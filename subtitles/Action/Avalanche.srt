Director: Naruse Mikio

13
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:30,466
‘Nadare' refers to the emotional crisis
experienced by Kusaka Goro.

14
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:35,526
Although Goro appears at first
to have his feet on the ground,

15
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:41,482
he falls eventually, pushed
by some sudden unknown force,

16
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:48,532
as if caught in an avalanche.

17
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:54,435
Today we all live in such
a precarious world that even

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,393
a person of strong will like Goro

19
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:09,198
can be carried away by this avalanche.”  -- Osaragi Jiro

20
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:25,404
That's enough for today,

21
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,647
Take this with you

22
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:18,475
I remember...there was
an airplane flying by then...

23
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,499
It's been a year already...

24
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,896
“We are in a Hotel in Nagoya...”

25
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,437
This way, we can make it clear
we are not hiding or running away

26
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,837
We also let your father know that we are here.

27
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,002
But...we can't do that.

28
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,408
Why?

29
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,577
Well, because...

30
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,431
You shouldn't think too much about it.

31
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,732
Aoyama is in Akasaka Ward, isn't it?

32
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,526
- I'll write it myself.
- Really? then go ahead

33
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,821
All we need to say is that we are staying in this hotel.

34
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,575
We can realize our wishes quicker
Think only about it.

35
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,127
Tomorrow my father will be here to pick us up

36
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:28,999
Father!

37
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,109
Goro, you're coming back?

38
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,509
Yes.  please apologise.

39
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,016
have you visited many places?

40
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,152
I've bought tickets already.
Do you have any luggage?

41
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:02,031
we don't have much luggage,
but could you pay the hotel for us?

42
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,656
That's not my business.

43
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:07,926
Keep in mind that you must pay
me back for the train fares too.

44
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,085
Such a good father he is!

45
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:22,134
Fukiko!

46
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:25,631
Fukiko!

47
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,713
- Did Goro tell you where he went?
- No

48
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,610
- and he didn't tell you when he'll be back ?
- No, he didn't.

49
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,135
He never used to do such a thing.

50
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:48,649
your hair style is kind
of unusual, isn't it?

51
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,533
Today's Sunday. Why don't you go
somewhere with Goro?

52
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,819
He went out somewhere
but we don't know where

53
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,934
you're too nice.  he needs a little
more coaxing, Fukiko.

54
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,676
Maybe Goro is not happy with Fukiko, don't you think?

55
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:22,424
But she is a good girl

56
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,155
There's no question about that, sure...

57
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:30,895
We haven't seen Yayoi lately, have we?

58
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:35,264
- That's right
- She's still alone with her young brother.

59
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:38,308
We've got to do something for her future

60
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:43,227
Goro would've been happier with Yayoi.

61
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,782
Apparently they liked each other, you know

62
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,811
Tell me, Yayoi,  Am I that bad?

63
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,445
Yes, you are

64
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,789
You don't act like a man,
you act like a coward.

65
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,706
You say I'm a coward,
but I love you all the same.

66
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:37,164
Don't say that, please, I ask you.

67
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:44,061
It's not only my fault. It's yours too.

68
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,061
You haven't been fair to me either.

69
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,480
Why? Why do you say I'm not fair?

70
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:55,237
don't you recognize that you've never
shown me your real feelings?

71
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,971
That's not true

72
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:00,666
Yes, it's true.  I couldn't see
what was in your mind

73
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,454
I thought you hated me.
So I found you condescending

74
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,574
I wanted to tell you this.

75
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,732
We became too close....

76
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,867
I keep to myself feelings I hold dear.

77
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,797
That's how I was brought up.

78
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:20,404
Goro, it's too late now.

79
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,878
It's not too late!

80
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,688
- Let me go!  Please!
- I'll talk to my father!

81
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,043
What about Fukiko?  Poor Fukiko!

82
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,957
Welcome back.

83
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:29,625
Father and Mother went out to a party.
They'd be back around 9 p.m.

84
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,998
Really?

85
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,143
- And your dinner?
- I already have.

86
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,649
- Do you want to change clothes?
- I'll stay like this.

87
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:53,047
- Would you like some tea then?
- Yes

88
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,363
(I should really talk about it.)

89
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,239
(No, I can't do that)

90
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:18,949
(not to Uncle Kusaka...)

91
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:49,680
I really apologize
for what happened this time

92
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,354
You don't have to, Uncle.

93
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:57,609
To tell the truth, I was hoping
Goro would change his mind.

94
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:03,257
In fact, both Urako and I wanted
you to be his wife.

95
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,429
Me...? Really?

96
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,094
Yes, this is what
disappointed Urako the most

97
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:33,201
I know you won't like it,
but I have enough of this marriage.

98
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:36,066
What makes you say things like that?

99
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,921
Let me tell you this:

100
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:46,792
you are a man, so you should
act with responsibility.

101
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,203
I do feel responsible, Father.

102
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,804
After all, it was my fault.

103
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,496
But if we keep going like this,

104
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:58,957
sooner or later our marriage will end up in failure.

105
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,364
For her own good we shouldn't
let it happen even if it is cruel.

106
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:06,228
I made up my mind and want
to get out of this situation!

107
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,966
Well, in this world,

108
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,896
There is much to complain about.

109
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:20,629
and one cannot always
make out the way he wants.

110
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,665
You can ask anyone

111
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:27,629
Life is full of dissatisfaction
and discontent

112
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:31,258
To put up with it
is the everyday task of human.

113
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:34,478
What is it that you
don't like about Fukiko?

114
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,503
- Well...
- Can't you tell me?

115
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,860
It's not easy to explain...

116
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,954
It's not logical then...

117
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,761
is she not a good girl?

118
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,095
Even though Mother was against it at first

119
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:51,751
now she likes her
very much like me

120
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,883
I do think Fukiko is a good girl too

121
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:58,646
But I think it's not good
for her to go on like this

122
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:01,444
Well, I really don't understand why.

123
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:05,157
It's better to divorce now
than to make her unhappy later.

124
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,239
- Do you make her unhappy?
- I feel sorry for her

125
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,262
there's nothing I can do about it.

126
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,661
I can't pretend I love her if I don't.
It's about my own life!

127
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:17,157
What about her life?

128
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:21,063
you led her to believe 
you were the man of her life

129
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:25,835
Don't you realize how 
irresponsible all this is?

130
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,158
I look at it differently.

131
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,730
The way you look at it is wrong...

132
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:38,449
You are not alone but living
with others, in a society

133
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:41,545
Everyone has responsibility in society

134
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:45,284
Are you saying that we shouldn't do
what we believe is right?

135
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:49,265
what we believe is right
is taught by the society we live in

136
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,221
then living in jail or in this society are the same

137
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,746
- I refuse such a life.
- Shut up!

138
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,179
Who do you think you are
to show such an arrogance

139
00:14:58,628 --> 00:14:59,965
A living being

140
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,288
Such a youngster you still are...

141
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:04,883
You cannot criticize me for being young

142
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,487
- Shut up
- No. I've had enough!

143
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:14,296
I'd be a coward if I don't live up
to what I think is right.

144
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,464
I do think about social responsibility,

145
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:22,825
but do I have to accept it even
when it is based on lies and deception?

146
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,306
That would be committing a sin!

147
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,519
I know I should have given more
thought before getting married

148
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,789
But is it all irreparable?

149
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:39,339
Suppose you are not Kusaka Goro
but an ordinary office worker

150
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:42,876
would you come up
with such a idea?

151
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,130
I know the life of an office worker.

152
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,658
I know also the life of those with money,

153
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:55,128
loveless couples who pretend to look
respectable but have lovers and mistresses

154
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:59,369
I don't like such lies.  I can't stand a married life in deception.

155
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:05,391
Well, isn't human life more subtle than that?

156
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,935
It is not a mathematical equation

157
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:13,422
I cannot bear listening to your selfish complaint.

158
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:14,637
But Father...

159
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,963
Some day, you'll understand what I'm saying.

160
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:21,517
It's a man's responsibility
to look after a frail woman.

161
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,726
and once you are married, it's a duty.

162
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:37,801
(A duty? Am I now
compelled to act like a coward?)

163
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,291
(Luckily I don't worry about money.
Why should I stay bound by old morality?)

164
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,701
(Things have changed since Father's times.)

165
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,806
(I should do what I think is right)

166
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,019
You shouldn't come to watch a baseball
game with such a weather

167
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,028
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

168
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:16,198
Nasty weather... Why did they invent
such annoying thing as a rain front?

169
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,442
Well, they didn't “invent” it!

170
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,070
- So are you going fine?
- Yes! I'm fine.

171
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:32,525
Fukuko is not expecting yet?

172
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:36,079
- Her name is “Fukiko”, not Fukuko!
- Oh, is that so?

173
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:42,193
Well, It's only names after all. Fukiko
or Fukuko, it doesn't matter.

174
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:49,631
Besides, I'm not her father myself.
Anyway, so no good news, eh?

175
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,526
No, not yet.

176
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:57,567
I'm starting to wonder if she's
capable of making a baby!

177
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,451
Ha-ha!  Are you kidding?

178
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:06,478
Well, she's always been healthy,
but she's just so skinny, you know...

179
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:09,336
Actually, skinny women
often are fertile. Don't worry!

180
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:18,004
- Oh, welcome!
- Hello.

181
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,548
Hello, Father.

182
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,562
What's happening?

183
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:29,207
Mother (-in-law) told me to show this to you...

184
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,553
What?

185
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,934
Oh, your hairstyle!

186
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:41,098
That's true, it's the first time...  very well...

187
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:44,679
- You look much better like that.
- You are joking

188
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:50,253
Come in, Koyanagi the lawyer is here.
We were talking about you.

189
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,567
Good day sir

190
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:13,625
Maybe you don't know, but he helped me
a lot for your marriage

191
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:16,755
Don't exaggerate, I was just involved

192
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:22,324
it's not easy with such a stubborn man like
your father... Fukuko, you know that

193
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:26,789
- Again!  It's Fukiko, not Fukuko!
- That's right, that's right.

194
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,986
first time she has this hairstyle

195
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:34,541
Kusaka's wife told her to show it to me

196
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,817
You look absolutely fabulous

197
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:42,241
Your husband must be thrilled

198
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:02,208
Please put out the laundry when the weather clears up.

199
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:09,124
can you prepare some sake and fish?

200
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:15,342
- Are you getting along well there?
- Yes.

201
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,105
With Goro's mother as well?

202
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:22,055
- She treats me very well.
- Really? That's very nice.

203
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,021
I'll help in the kitchen today!

204
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:28,358
then can you make that fish
you used to make often?

205
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:34,046
How was it...something "à la meunière"
Can you do it?

206
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:47,304
You know, Yokota, I don't like rich people
but I think Kusaka is different

207
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:53,516
Although he has a lot of money
He is a reliable man.

208
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,475
I see in his character some good sides of the old feudal times.

209
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,858
You are right,

210
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:08,692
he is different from the
common run of dirty moneymakers.

211
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:13,445
But first you didn't want to marry
your daughter to a rich family!

212
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,721
Well, after all Kusaka is a man
with a strong backbone!

213
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:21,697
Aren't you talking about yourself?

214
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:24,252
you are like a man
out of the Tokugawa era

215
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:29,555
If I was the Minister for Culture
I'd put you on display in a museum!

216
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:33,046
You'd put me in a museum,
then I'd put you in a zoo

217
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:25,031
Allo?  No, she is not here

218
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,599
No, Yayoi's gone to her cottage.

219
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,852
I see, thank you.

220
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:12,354
- What's the matter, Sister?
- What? Nothing.

221
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:17,105
Since you got here you
don't look like your normal self.

222
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,489
You see, Keisuke, I've been thinking...

223
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:29,361
Tell me. What is the meaning
of life as a human?

224
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:37,117
I don't know anymore if I'm happy
living in comfort like we do.

225
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,338
I think you are asking too much!

226
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:46,167
But listen, I heard a story about prisoners in Siberia

227
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:50,493
They say prison guards there pick up prisoners for fun

228
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:54,759
they make them dig and carry
the earth to somewhere else,

229
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:57,810
only to carry it back again to where
they dug it, day after day

230
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,730
And these prisoners are forced to repeat

231
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:06,851
this purposeless job over and over
until they get sick or go crazy.

232
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:12,172
There's nothing more cruel
than doing things without purpose.

233
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,597
It's the same thing for
those living a life without purpose.

234
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,757
Well, women can always...

235
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,763
...get married, right?

236
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:26,266
We say “it's settled”
when a woman is married off.

237
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:29,408
As if unmarried women were a nuisance!

238
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,732
what does it mean to be “settled”?

239
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:38,120
to submit your future to a stranger 
you don't know if you can trust

240
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:46,431
Keisuke, who can possibly trust one man for the whole life?

241
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:51,443
Marital fidelity is not that simple...

242
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:55,666
- So you think you can live differently?
- Well, that is the problem.

243
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,635
(Yes, this feeling stopped me from being with Goro)

244
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:08,055
(I've always thought
I'll marry with Goro)

245
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,275
(And yet, I was not able to get over this feeling)

246
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,574
(Maybe this mean I'm a coward?)

247
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:18,344
Sister, I don't know if I'm wrong but..

248
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:21,273
- Wasn't it all because of me?
- What?

249
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,839
about Goro.

250
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:26,223
- Wasn't it because of my illness?
- You fool!

251
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:29,413
I wanted to talk to you about it

252
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:33,240
If I die, you'll have to perpetuate our name, right?

253
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:42,209
But who gives a damn about family anyway?

254
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:46,645
That's not the reason why I
don't get married.  You worry too much,

255
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:49,836
you should feel free to do what you like.

256
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:54,226
I'm not worried about those things.  I do live as I want.

257
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:01,345
Someone named Kusaka is here for you.

258
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:04,046
- Do you think it's Goro?
- Yes, maybe it's him...

259
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,368
I don't want to see him.

260
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:09,351
Why?

261
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,456
- Would you see him?
- Yes.

262
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,874
I told my father that I wanted to divorce Fukiko

263
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:46,376
I thought he would understand but he didn't.
After all he's got old ideas

264
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:52,184
I told him that's I'm sure about it and 
that I'd be a coward if I didn't

265
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:56,420
Listen, Yayoi, we need to be strong
and think more about ourselves

266
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,520
You think too much about other people.

267
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:07,403
You always think about others,
but that's only to have clear conscience

268
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:11,376
We must not give in to such a easy thing, Yayoi!

269
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:16,857
A clear conscience is 
needed to live in society!

270
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:23,736
You are a liar!

271
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,829
How are you doing?

272
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,688
- and Goro?
- He went to Kamakura

273
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:09,875
- Alone?
- No, with a friend.

274
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:14,685
Why didn't you go with them?
You stayed home last Sunday too.

275
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:16,349
But...

276
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:24,804
Is the friend one of his colleagues?

277
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,582
Well...  He only said the friend had a house there

278
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:45,167
- And mother?
- She's in her room.

279
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,733
I came back a moment ago too.  It was an excellent show.

280
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:17,460
Oh, the concert?

281
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:22,177
Mr. Tamura was thankful for
the bouquet you sent him.

282
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,588
Who is Mr. Tamura?

283
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:28,971
- The pianist!
- Oh, of course

284
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:32,931
You know, I've been thinking

285
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,989
about Goro..

286
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:45,119
I think I should take the matter more seriously

287
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,863
I've been too busy to pay attention to him,
but from now on I'll take it upon myself.

288
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,408
You shouldn't be the only one to deal with him.

289
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:58,349
That would be very nice...

290
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,262
You know, Goro is very smart

291
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,656
he knows so much about things

292
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:09,463
Well, times have changed!  Young people today know everything!

293
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:10,925
Yeah, that's it.

294
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:15,148
But they don't know how
to sort out their knowledge

295
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:19,522
Actually, they lack something important

296
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:24,569
They make up a good excuse 
for every thing they do,

297
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,018
but they don't have principles

298
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,209
- But that is because...
- Let me finish.  

299
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:32,822
This is a very important issue

300
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,007
I'm thinking about Goro's reckless character

301
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:46,734
Maybe it is just typical of his generation,

302
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:50,992
but I feel there is something 
desperate about him

303
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:56,788
He knows his goal in life, but
he doesn't believe in it

304
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,741
Going to Nagoya with Fukiko, for example, 
he knew  this was not needed

305
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,700
But we got over that issue already.

306
00:31:06,902 --> 00:31:08,750
Well, you don't understand him...

307
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:12,586
Are you saying that 
I don't understand my own child?

308
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,637
Excuse me but...

309
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:20,760
It's true, being mother is 
more difficult these days.

310
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:26,055
You have been a great mother, 
and I am grateful for it.

311
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,134
But still it's a difficult matter...

312
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:36,077
What makes you worry so much...?

313
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:00,286
Keisuke,

314
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:05,802
I might live for the sake of 
my own happiness after all

315
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:10,250
We are able to live a life without worry,

316
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:13,822
and that is not 
the case for most people

317
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:17,968
Beyond our happiness 
the world is different

318
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:23,858
Here we can live happily, looking 
at the bright light in front of us,

319
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:27,355
but there is a crowd out there

320
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,306
people left behind in darkness,

321
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:33,333
moaning and groaning...

322
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:40,346
But, I now think happiness can exist 
only if we think about ourselves

323
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:43,327
and forget everything else...

324
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,986
Have you ever thought about all this?

325
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,209
Yes I have. in fact I have just now

326
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:55,893
in today's world, happiness exist 
only by forgetting others' misfortune

327
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,755
(Goro may win me over in the end...)

328
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:30,638
Goro, Would you come
here during lunch break?

329
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:35,124
What ? I thought we could
eat together

330
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,004
I'll be waiting then.

331
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:32,689
Father, you have something on your mustache

332
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,252
- It's getting warmer these days.
- Yeah.

333
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,454
Are you going straight 
to your office?

334
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,827
I still have some time.

335
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,290
- I think I'll walk a bit.
- I'll go with you then.

336
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,141
Why don't you get something 
for Fukiko?  I'll pay for it.

337
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:06,977
- No, it's okay.
- Why not?

338
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:09,955
There's no need for it.

339
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:19,810
Father!

340
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,253
I changed my mind.

341
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:35,021
To buy her a gift, you must first 
of all  have feelings for her

342
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:37,341
- Well, I...
- No more discussion!

343
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:41,802
I can't stand such 
a heartless attitude

344
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:47,784
People who don't care making others happy
are the most despicable beings!

345
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,439
Father, which one is better?

346
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,594
You are the one to choose.

347
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:21,081
- What about this?
- You choose what you think is good.

348
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,246
Father!

349
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:57,221
Isn't this beautiful? Goro bought it for me.

350
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,632
Really?  That's very nice.

351
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:10,205
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

352
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:38,405
No, she's not back yet.

353
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,986
Do you know where she went?  
What?  Kamakura?

354
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:06,129
Why do you look so sad?

355
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:11,768
I wish I could stay drunk all the time...

356
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,992
Listen, don't think about anything else when we are together.

357
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,525
Can you do that yourself?

358
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:33,112
when you are with me, 
don't you think about Fukiko ?

359
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,129
Don't you feel pity for her?

360
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:39,068
Tell me, Goro.

361
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:42,161
I can think only one thing at a time

362
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,624
Let's change the subject.

363
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:48,293
That means...when you are with Fukiko

364
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,416
you forget about me, right?

365
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:54,213
That's what you think?

366
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:59,957
It's better that you forget about me.

367
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:02,570
Here we go again!

368
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:11,170
enough talking about it, 
let's go dancing

369
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:26,040
Welcome back

370
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:28,433
Yayoi!

371
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:33,429
It's raining hard, isn't it?

372
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,059
The queen of diamonds...

373
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:57,226
Missed..,

374
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:00,886
This is my tenth try, you know.

375
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:06,217
Maybe I stop now.

376
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:38,467
Yayoi, please forgive us

377
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:42,814
We cannot find any solution.

378
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:50,176
You endure a lot, don't you?

379
00:42:55,778 --> 00:42:59,420
Yes.... patience

380
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:06,861
I'd like to take time to think about it

381
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,844
How can you become happy

382
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:15,472
It's been our homework, my wife and I

383
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:20,692
We knew from the beginning

384
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:34,902
Fukiko was no match for you.

385
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:39,119
she's a passive and weak girl

386
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:44,195
If I told her to sit down, 

387
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:47,204
she'd just sit down there forever.

388
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,272
She is so naive

389
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:53,261
If her husband cheated on her

390
00:43:53,655 --> 00:44:00,014
she wouldn't believe it. 
She'd even blame herself instead

391
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:05,276
She is like that. We can't be
harsh on her

392
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:10,872
You are like our own daughter, Yayoi

393
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:15,787
We've always thought of you 
that way, and we always will.

394
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:33,292
Yayoi!

395
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:43,008
Goro, you are coming back home with me

396
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:52,844
Yayoi!  Yayoi!

397
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:17,055
Goro, let's go home 
Call the chauffeur.

398
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,554
I don't.  You act like a coward!

399
00:45:19,795 --> 00:45:22,778
Mind your language!  
Don't forget I'm your father

400
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,470
- But Father...
- You are the coward.

401
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,759
You forced me to lie 
in the first place.

402
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,319
I've told you that I didn't want to lie.

403
00:45:36,522 --> 00:45:37,648
I know...

404
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:41,907
who has lied or who is responsible...

405
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:44,124
This is of no interest.

406
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,734
There is something more important 
we need to talk about

407
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:51,957
You are smart and know many things.

408
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:56,078
But your knowledge is thin 
like a piece of paper

409
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,187
Your head is stuffed with a bunch of thin paper

410
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:05,537
When you do something unreasonable,

411
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,971
you justify yourself with 
this understanding of paper

412
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,222
this mentality of yours, I find it wrong

413
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:18,967
This is a lot worse than just cheating on your wife! 

414
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,307
I think I am being sincere

415
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,744
I just want to do what I think is right

416
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,137
I want to be true to myself

417
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:30,703
 I don't want to be a wise hypocrite like yourself!

418
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:32,529
Stop this paper thoughts

419
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:37,905
The misfortune of your generation is 
knowing things without understanding them

420
00:46:38,454 --> 00:46:39,748
You only "know" things

421
00:46:39,868 --> 00:46:42,818
You're a stranger!  A stranger 
to people like me!

422
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:46,261
Think as you like

423
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:51,618
but if you continue with 
your immorality, I'll have to disown you.

424
00:46:56,658 --> 00:47:01,558
I should remind you, that you would not be what you are now

425
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:05,974
without the wealth of the Kusaka family

426
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:10,568
Is that a threat?

427
00:47:10,688 --> 00:47:13,656
 No. compassion. I feel pity for you

428
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:24,697
Well, which one will you let go?
Your paper “truth” or my wealth!

429
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:39,161
All right, I'll be a liar then!

430
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,536
(No one suspect it.)

431
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,457
(Father thinks that 
I am a different person)

432
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:31,122
(Fukiko, as usual, trusts me completely)

433
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,813
(She thinks we are off to enjoy ourselves today)

434
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,949
(And I am pretending 
to love her until we die)

435
00:48:38,644 --> 00:48:41,248
(even though in reality it's quite the opposite.)

436
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:43,259
(That's what Father wants)

437
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:45,124
(I can do that well.)

438
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:48,187
(He will say: “Oh, I knew it, 
I knew Goro loved Fukiko!)

439
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:51,730
(Otherwise how could he possibly commit suicide with her?”)

440
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,680
(And he will grieve over our “beautiful” deaths!)

441
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:07,759
Fukiko, let's go back to Nagoya.

442
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,354
We can visit the same places and  
stay in the same hotel and same room

443
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:16,247
But we didn't tell them 
that we were going that far.

444
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,683
It's all right, we'll send them a telegram

445
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,336
I remember it all!

446
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:51,060
The temple...and that big tree over there too!

447
00:49:53,664 --> 00:49:55,168
It's wonderful

448
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,086
I'm glad we came

449
00:49:57,765 --> 00:50:03,404
The last time I was scared...  
But it's different this time

450
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:22,049
(I thought the room was cleaner, but it's all right)

451
00:50:22,456 --> 00:50:27,031
(I don't want any sentimentalism 
in our double suicide.)

452
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:31,033
(This is just like any other business)

453
00:50:31,235 --> 00:50:35,243
(except that you can do it only once in life.)

454
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:49,537
I'm going out.  
I'll send them a telegram

455
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:50,971
Going by yourself?

456
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,478
Why don't you take a bath
 in the meantime?

457
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:17,648
(Actually, I don't need to die with her. 
Only pretending to)

458
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:21,194
(this way...  Fukiko will die happily)

459
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,495
(and no one will suspect murder)

460
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:27,630
(How come I didn't realize this earlier 
and wanted to kill myself too!)

461
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:44,310
(Well, I haven't changed a bit!)

462
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:47,785
What's the matter?

463
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,922
- Fukiko, are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

464
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:59,191
If I ask you to die with me, 
would you agree?

465
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:09,544
I am not kidding, 
I am serious, Fukiko!

466
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:15,141
There is no need to ask me such a question.

467
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:17,903
I need your answer!

468
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:22,263
My answer is quite obvious...

469
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:33,490
So you will die with me?

470
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:35,716
But why do you say that?

471
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:37,821
You're not aware about it

472
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:39,580
but there's no way out!

473
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:47,523
Look. Now do you understand 
that I'm not joking?

474
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,709
(She's almost convinced.  
Let's play it well)

475
00:53:55,616 --> 00:54:00,182
I am telling you the truth.  
I can't go on anymore.

476
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,160
Why?

477
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:07,048
I cannot tell you. I also 
don't want to tell you

478
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:14,876
But can't you at least talk to your father about it?

479
00:54:15,395 --> 00:54:21,280
He can help you out.  You should really talk to him.

480
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:24,741
Oh, thanks a lot!  I never thought 
you could give me advice!

481
00:54:25,022 --> 00:54:29,025
I guess you don't understand my feelings.

482
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:37,580
I am sorry,

483
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:42,181
I will do whatever you tell me to do.

484
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,909
Well, I don't want to force you.

485
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:49,516
No, you are not forcing me.

486
00:54:50,409 --> 00:54:52,969
I am all yours.

487
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:57,966
If you ask me to die with you, I will do it gladly.

488
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:20,698
(No, I must be strong!)

489
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:29,955
Is it because of Yayoi?

490
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:33,122
What?  What about her?

491
00:55:33,806 --> 00:55:35,618
Maybe I'm wrong?

492
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,654
Yayoi has nothing to do with it!

493
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,671
Is that really so?

494
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,844
Stop crying!  People will hear us.

495
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,230
I was stupid...

496
00:56:08,075 --> 00:56:13,860
I've been secretly worried that you loved Yayoi.

497
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:19,146
Please forgive me!

498
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:25,064
Stop crying, or people will hear us.  It's all right now.

499
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,784
I'm so ashamed of myself

500
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:33,619
I don't know what to do!

501
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,746
(What's going on with me?)

502
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:51,102
(Your head is stuffed 
with a bunch of thin paper)

503
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:55,730
(When you do something unreasonable,)

504
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:59,612
(you justify yourself with 
this understanding of paper)

505
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:05,204
(This is a lot worse than just cheating on your wife!)

506
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:12,177
(Compared to your wickedness, poor 
people's misdemeanors are even beautiful!)

507
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:14,722
(I did not give in to Father.)

508
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,103
(This is different. Something 
unknown changed my mind)

00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:35,466
it was all a lie Fukiko
I don't want to die

510
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:38,149
I was only telling you a lie.

511
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:18,136
You know, I'm feeling better now. 
Why don't you go for a trip somewhere.

512
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:23,679
Don't worry. For me it's better 
we stay together quietly like this.

513
00:58:23,917 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no use thinking about it..
