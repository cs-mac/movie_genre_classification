1
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
- Walk the wall on the left!
- I need a line!

2
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,440
I found her!
I found her!

3
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,360
I need some help
down here!

4
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,360
I need it now!

5
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,440
Anybody hear me?

6
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Get down here now!

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Come on!

8
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,600
Shepherd! Burr!

9
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,240
I got her! I can't move!

10
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,480
Come down here now!

11
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
Hold on.
They'll be here.

12
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
Move!

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,200
- I heard a voice.
- Help me!

14
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,840
I can't breathe!

15
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Help me! Help me out!
Help me out!

16
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,680
Help me move it!

17
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,720
Bring up the skycam.
Pan it left.

18
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,120
Show me what God sees.

19
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
Okay, camera two, show me the stands.

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,600
- Three, give me the ice.
- Okay, graphic is up.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,560
Uh, put game seven on preset.

22
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
How many technicians
are gonna be inside the arena?

23
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,320
We got 12 cameramen,
6 support... that's 18.

24
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
I want to limit their access.

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,640
Technicians and announcers
are the only ones cleared.

26
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,920
Hey, Spota, let us in.

27
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,320
Work don't stop just 'cause the
Vice President's coming, you know, babe.

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Must be Republicans.

29
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Having everybody check in through one
gate like this is a pain in the butt.

30
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
- It's only one night.
- It's the last game of the Stanley Cup.

31
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,560
Having the Vice President
here turns a headache into a concussion.

32
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,160
- I didn't vote for this guy.
- That's what makes what you're
doin' such a special gesture.

33
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
Hello, Pittsburgh.

34
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,880
Here we are in the seventh game of the
Stanley Cup finals. Penguins and Hawks.

35
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,600
Penguins in a come-from-behind
victory to shut down the Hawks.

36
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
Shit.

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,760
Sorry. Uh, my dog's missing.

38
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,720
We're out looking for him.

39
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,120
- Is it bad?
- What? You think this might be good?

40
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,280
- Let me see your license.
- Oh, sure.

41
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,560
Move. Move.

42
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
We are going to steal your car.

43
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Don't get killed over it, huh?

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
It's the last game.
We got a couple of minutes to go.

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
Just 15 seconds to go!

46
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
He skates up to center.
He knocks down one defender.

47
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,840
He's skating like a madman around
the ice. He gets to the blue line.

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,840
He shoots. Whoa!
And he scores! Whoo!

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,440
- Scratch my back with a hacksaw...
- Yes!

50
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,480
Dad!

51
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
Hey!

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,360
- That's a fancy new stick.
- Michael gave it to me.

53
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,640
- Hi.
- How are you, Darren?

54
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,720
Darren, what are you
doing here?

55
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,760
- You can't stay.
We're getting ready to leave.
- It's his birthday.

56
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
And you've got him
all day tomorrow.

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,080
I just got these.
I thought the kids might wanna...

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,080
We're all going out
to dinner.

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,280
- Looks like those are Penguin tickets.
- They are.

60
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,120
It's the seventh game.

61
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
- Vice President's gonna be there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

62
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,920
- Hey, that's my hat!
- I can wear it. Mom said I could.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
I did?

64
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,120
You know what that means?

65
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,080
- Not a clue.
- It means "I love you."

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
I love you too.

67
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,160
She's practicing to be deaf,
but that's still my hat!

68
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,320
- I'll get you a new one.
- You can't just take them
without talking to me first.

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,440
- Besides, you only have two tickets.
- I'm working at the arena.

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,880
- You're back to work, Dad?
- He's a fire inspector at the game.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,240
- It's very important work.
- Are you a fireman again, Daddy?

72
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Kind of, yeah.

73
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Kathi tells me it's only temporary.

74
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,160
- He was trying to save a little
girl in a burning building...
- Are we going to the game?

75
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,520
Don't do this again. I mean it.

76
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
It's not fair to the kids... or me.

77
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,560
I promise.

78
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,720
Excuse me.

79
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,000
This is Andrew.
He's the head chef.

80
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,160
Nobody goes in that elevator,
and I mean nobody,

81
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,800
even if they have proper I.D.,
unless this man says it's okay.

82
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
If he doesn't know them,
they don't get in that elevator.

83
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,480
After you finish the Vice President's
party, this kitchen is closed.

84
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,600
- Have I made myself clear?
- Abundantly.

85
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,200
That's how I like it.
Abundantly.

86
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,240
Mrs. Ferrara?

87
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
Yes?

88
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Let's just stroll into your house
like I'm your favorite nephew.

89
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,240
- Ackerman, Ekers.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
Come on, Mac. Mr. McCord makes sure
the building doesn't burn down.

91
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Go on through, Mr. Mac.
And who's this beauty?

92
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
This is my daughter Emily
and my son Tyler.

93
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,680
- Want a stamp?
- Love a stamp.

94
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
Hey, can you guys play
after we get in?

95
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Hey, hold your horses.
I'm getting a stamp here.

96
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,800
I'll never wash
this hand again.

97
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,000
- See you later, Mr. Mac.
- Okay.

98
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,560
- Joan.
- Hi, Darren.

99
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,080
- Are you working tonight?
- After I take Tyler to the locker room.

100
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Hey, could you give Emily
a look at Icey?

101
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Icey always loves company. Come on,
Emily, I'm gonna show you where Icey is.

102
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Icey. Big deal.
Some fat guy in a ratty penguin suit.

103
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,240
That blonde you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

104
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,560
- What's he doing?
- Shaping the blade.

105
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,880
They're like horseshoes. You get 'em
hot enough, you can bend 'em.

106
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,800
You, uh, recognize him?

107
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,680
Yeah. Luc Robitaille.

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
He waved at me.
You see that, Dad?

109
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

110
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

111
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,400
- Luc, this is Tyler McCord
and his father Darren.
- Hi, Tyler. How are you?

112
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,320
- Ca va?
- Bonjour.

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,880
Dad, what did he say?

114
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,800
He thinks, uh, they're gonna win.

115
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Hey, that's Brad Tolliver!

116
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,960
- Dad, he doesn't have a rocking chair.
- A what?

117
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,840
My dad said you should be sitting in
a rocking chair instead of on the ice.

118
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,040
- Oh, is that so?
- You play hockey, Tyler?

119
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,520
No, but my dad played.
He was a goalie.

120
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
A little semi-pro in Canada.
It was a long time ago.

121
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Come by some afternoon.

122
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

123
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

124
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
I can see the difference.

125
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I got this one, man.

126
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
Yes.

127
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,280
You boys have fun?

128
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,520
Luc Robitaille talked to me,
and we saw Brad Tolliver close up.

129
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
Your friends are gonna
be so jealous of you.

130
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,160
- I wanna go with Icey.
- So does Tyler.

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Icey has to hit the stands, guys.
I'll see you later.

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Bye-bye.

133
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Andrew, this is Emily and Tyler.

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,080
Pleasure.

135
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,360
- Be right back.
- Come. I want to show you something.

136
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,600
Whoa! Cool!

137
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,240
That's why you won't hear
anyone complain about my cooking.

138
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
- At least not to my face.
- You got a burnt-out light bulb.

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,040
Could you change it?
I've got my hands full.

140
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
Sure.

141
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,520
Is that what Daddy does,
change light bulbs?

142
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,680
No, Emily.
He's just helping out.

143
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,080
- Firemen don't do that kind of stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

144
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,920
- Uh, nothing.
- When are we gonna sit down?

145
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,720
Frequent Flyer is in and on
his way to the locker room.

146
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,640
Keep him moving.

147
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,240
The Penguin fans are anxious
to see for the first time...

148
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,040
- the Penguins kicking the Stanley Cup...
- Do you have any cookies?

149
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,280
You force your way in here with a gun,
and now I have to feed you?

150
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,640
You don't have to.
But I still have the gun.

151
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,080
I think I have some Fig Newtons.

152
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
Hey! Caution.

153
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,720
Caution keeps you safe.

154
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,440
I keep my machine gun
in with the produce.

155
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,040
Okay, Veep's comin' in.
Let's get decent!

156
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Christ, Jefferson,
it's a locker room.

157
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,280
Duckerman, why don't you
put on a jock?

158
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
- Got any tape?
- You're covering the right head.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Let's go, let's go.

160
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,480
All right, guys, I'm privileged to
introduce Vice President Daniel Bender.

161
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,040
He's a big hockey fan
and he'd like to say a few words.

162
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,960
"A few words."
There's an optimist.

163
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,680
I want to wish you all
the best of luck and, uh,

164
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
are you Democrats
or Republicans?

165
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,080
Neither, sir. Canadians.

166
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Well, in that case, good luck...

167
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,040
and I hope to toast
your championship after the game.

168
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,080
Sir, are you going to say the
same thing to the Blackhawks?

169
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,920
Of course.
Nice outfit, Duckerman.

170
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,440
Two nights ago with the Blackhawks
on the brink of elimination...

171
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,160
It's time!

172
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,880
I want you to pick up the phone...

173
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,800
and dial 555-1793.

174
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,880
- That's my husband's work number.
- It certainly is.

175
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,480
When you get him on the line,

176
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,400
- say only what's written on this.
- Ohh.

177
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Kitchen. Yeah. Hold on.

178
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
Andrew, it's your wife.

179
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
- Hello?
- Andy, it...

180
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,800
We have your wife.
Follow her instructions.

181
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,520
They will not hurt me...

182
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,440
if you do as they say.

183
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,160
If you give any indication something
is wrong, they will... kill me.

184
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,720
When you go to the...
Vice President's box,

185
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,400
you will take two new
assistants with you...

186
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,560
escorted by
two security men.

187
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,160
Get them into the box.
That's all you need to do.

188
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,560
That's all you need to know.

189
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,280
Who are these men?
How will I know them?

190
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,160
In 30 seconds, you'll know.

191
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,640
I swear this.
If you hurt my wife, I'll...

192
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,000
You'll what?
Burn my toast?

193
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,360
- Mr. Ferrara?
- Yes?

194
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
Are these men yours?

195
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,560
Yes. They're mine.

196
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,720
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,760
The National Hockey League presents
game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

198
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,400
The Chicago Blackhawks
and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

199
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
As we get ready for the seventh and
final game of the Stanley Cup finals,

200
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,920
you can feel the electricity in the air;
it sends a chill up your spine, Paul.

201
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,640
One of these clubs is going to
skate with Lord Stanley's cup
here at Civic Arena Ice tonight.

202
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
Listen to the crowd, Mike.
They're going crazy.

203
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, here's to a great game.

204
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,880
Great if we win;
not so great if we lose.

205
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,520
We are ready.

206
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Thank you, everybody.
You may leave now.

207
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,560
Mr. Ferrara will close up
your stations.

208
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,040
...singing of our National Anthem.

209
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,880
Oh, say, can you see

210
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,080
# By the dawn's
early light

211
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,200
# What so proudly we hailed

212
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,360
# At the twilight's
last gleaming

213
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,920
- # Whose broad stripes
- What the hell are you...

214
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,480
# And bright stars

215
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,000
# Through the perilous fight

216
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,680
# O'er the ramparts
we watched

217
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,480
# Were so gallantly streaming

218
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,760
# And the rockets'
red glare

219
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,960
# The bombs bursting in air

220
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,640
# Gave proof
through the night

221
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,080
# That our flag
was still there

222
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
- I love that part.
- # Oh, say does that

223
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,560
- # Star-spangled
- Well, gotta go.

224
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,920
# Banner yet wave

225
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,720
# O'er the land

226
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,680
# Of the free

227
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,280
# And the home

228
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,680
# Of the brave

229
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,240
This place is going crazy right now.

230
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,080
You could not beg, borrow or
steal a ticket before the game tonight.

231
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
If you were packing heat,
you couldn't get in here.

232
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,680
Eddie Belfour
starts in goal for Chicago.

233
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,680
Amazingly, Brad Tolliver will play...

234
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,840
even though he could hardly walk today
much less skate with a fever of 104.

235
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,440
And here we go.
Game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

236
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,080
And the Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

237
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,440
They'll work into Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

238
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,560
Graham, slap shot!
Tolliver makes the save.

239
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,360
Please, he needs a doctor.

240
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,520
No!

241
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Not any more. Go ahead.

242
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,680
Dead heroes get the best funerals.

243
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,360
Thanks for your help, Andrew.

244
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,560
His wife's recently deceased.
He would have been lonely without her.

245
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
I hope that clarifies
the urgency of this mission.

246
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,680
Only your best behavior's
gonna be good enough.

247
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,600
That agent's name was Eddie Caline.

248
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,960
He has a 5-year-old boy, a 3-year-old
little girl, and his wife's pregnant.

249
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,360
- I'll send a card.
- What do you want?

250
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,680
What do I want?

251
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,000
World peace, an end to bigotry
and no more mini-malls.

252
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,720
What am I gonna get?

253
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
And I am gonna get it.

254
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,160
That, boys and girls,
is really hot.

255
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,240
- What is your objective?
- My objective?

256
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,080
I get funny all over
when you talk like that.

257
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,960
I know what you're thinking.

258
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,680
Evaluate situation, calculate potential
losses and take appropriate action.

259
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,600
Let me do that for you.

260
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,120
The situation is hopeless.
The losses would be unacceptable.

261
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,400
The appropriate action is to do nothing
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

262
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,200
What kind of lunatic are you?

263
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,160
The best kind.

264
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,080
You can keep calling me names
if it makes you feel better.

265
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,240
Throw me your earpiece
and your mike.

266
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,800
Robitaille with a center pass.
That's just gonna miss.

267
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,280
We are still scoreless in game seven,
period one, the Hawks and Pens.

268
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,600
Watch Loeman.
He's got eyes in the back of his head.

269
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
They must be closed.

270
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,200
- Oh, gross!
- I have some work to do.

271
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,080
I'll be back before the period ends.
You two stay right here.

272
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
I'll go too,
so you'll have company.

273
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,760
Thanks, sweetheart,
but you stay with Tyler.

274
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,040
Now you won't be by yourself.

275
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
Thank you.

276
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
I mean it. Don't leave your seats.
Oh. In case you want a soda.

277
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,360
- Don't get out of your seats to get it.
- We get the idea, Dad.

278
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Hey, what's that?

279
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,360
Nothing.

280
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What's Daddy gotta do?

281
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
Probably change more light bulbs.

282
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,520
You said firemen don't do
that kind of stuff.

283
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,960
Dad's not really
a fireman any more, Emily.

284
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,680
Now a steal by Stevens.
He walks into the Chicago end.

285
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,000
Slap shot!
He... shoots and scores!

286
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,040
Kevin Stevens gives the Penguins
the opening goal.

287
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,640
Get in the fast lane, Grandma.
The bingo game is ready to roll.

288
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,760
Hey!

289
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,160
He doesn't know whether
to cry or wind his watch.

290
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,320
Hey!

291
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,240
- The Penguins have scored.
- Hey!

292
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,160
That one came off Steve Smith, the
Chicago defenseman, and finds the net.

293
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,360
Pittsburgh goal,
his 11th in the play-offs...

294
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,360
scored by number 25,

295
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,120
Kevin Stevens!

296
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,120
Face-off at center ice.
Naslund of the Penguins controls.

297
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
He jumps into the Chicago end with the
Penguins leading 1-0 here in game seven.

298
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,240
Mike, as we expected,
the hitting has been ferocious.

299
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,120
Uh, if the smoke bothers anyone,
you just speak up.

300
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,760
There's no reason to kill anyone else.
Nobody's a threat to you.

301
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,960
You know, I voted for you.
I really did.

302
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,320
It's your sincerity
and your compassion.

303
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,400
You happen to be wrong, though. There
may be a reason to kill someone else.

304
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,800
There's bound to be
resistance to my "objective."

305
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,800
I assure you I won't kill
more people than it takes
to convince everyone of my sincerity.

306
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
Will you make that cow
stop moaning?

307
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,960
Just...

308
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,320
- What's that?
- An invitation to the White House.

309
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,680
Open it and read it.

310
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,520
Don't, don't, don't.

311
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,160
- Out loud.
- It's nothing but a bunch of numbers.

312
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,640
And they wonder why
this economy's so fucked up.

313
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
Those are the numbers of 13 accounts in
5 U.S. banks belonging to 3 countries...

314
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,040
that our government
has frozen for a variety of reasons.

315
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,760
They represent a total deposit of one
billion, seven hundred million dollars.

316
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,120
Christ, it runs in the family.

317
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,360
During the course of this game, all
that money is going to be released...

318
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,160
and transferred to banks
of my choice.

319
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,120
- That's impossible.
- At least one-third must be moved...

320
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,840
during each of the three
periods of the game.

321
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,000
lf, at the first period's end, deposits
are behind, one of you will die.

322
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,640
If we're still lagging at the end of
the second period, two of you will die.

323
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,240
And at the end of the third period
everyone in this building will die.

324
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,000
- You have no idea of the complexity...
- I had an idea.

325
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,200
I had this idea, and we are gonna
make it work or we're gonna die trying.

326
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,400
You will call the President,
and on flash precedence priority,

327
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
he will call the Secretary of State
and Secretary of the Treasury.

328
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,920
Then banks will be notified
and the money will begin to move.

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Or it won't.

330
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,560
And if it doesn't,
when the game ends,

331
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,160
everyone in this box
and in this arena will die...

332
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,080
by explosion, fire and panic.

333
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,880
Enough bombs have been planted
in this building to stop all
the clocks in the hemisphere.

334
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,960
- You'll die with us.
- Could be.

335
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,920
I don't think anyone with manicured
fingernails and a $10,000 wristwatch...

336
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,680
- is planning on blowing himself up.
- $15,000 wristwatch.

337
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm not sure if I like you.

338
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,000
When I make up my mind,
you'll be the first to know.

339
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,440
- You're out of your mind.
- Me? Ha!

340
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm not the one paying some
Neanderthal 40 million dollars
to skate up and down the ice.

341
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,640
Call the White House.
You need the number?

342
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Left wing pass
down to Steve Smith.

343
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,600
I've got every agent
converging on the arena,

344
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,080
and we'll all get the support
we need from local P.D.

345
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,000
The FBI won't be necessary.
He's our asset. We'll get him back.

346
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,200
Tell the President I'll keep him fully
informed until the Vice President's out.

347
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,280
There'll be a total
media blackout on this.

348
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,520
We'll inform all news outlets
of how serious this is.

349
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,720
Yes, sir. Absolutely. The place is
sealed off. No one can go in or out.

350
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,640
And...

351
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
We messed up a few times
since I've been an agent,

352
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,600
but how the fuck did we lose
the Vice President?

353
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,000
Right side, Weinrich fires.
Down the left side, Graham shoots!

354
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,600
Penguins trying to get it out.

355
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,800
The sound in this building
is absolutely deafening.

356
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Shot picked up by Dubinsky.

357
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,200
Players are playing their guts out. It's
so loud, I can hardly hear myself think.

358
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,760
You don't have to think, Mike.
This is hockey.

359
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,600
The Hawks pressured now. Under 2 minutes
to go. Graham moves against Tolliver.

360
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,240
Fires and scores! The Chicago
Blackhawks have tied this game...

361
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,680
as Dirk Graham nailed it home,
his fourth of the play-offs.

362
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,480
And the Penguins and Hawks
are tied at one in game seven.

363
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,200
The Chicago goal,
his fourth of the play-offs...

364
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,640
They haven't moved a dime.

365
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,760
You know, I don't think
they believe you.

366
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,840
They're gonna sacrifice
a life to test my will.

367
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm truly disappointed. Nobody does
anything these days because it's right.

368
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,800
They only do it if you make them.

369
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,560
Would you like to vote on who gets the
distinction of demonstrating my resolve?

370
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,800
You're not giving enough time. I told
you it couldn't be done that quickly.

371
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,160
Oh, you watch how much
they accomplish during the next period.

372
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Now, would you all agree that
the mayor's wife's been most annoying?

373
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,320
Chicago again trying to make a move.

374
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,720
The Hawks attacking
the Penguin territory.

375
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,120
- An Orangeade.
- Coke or Sprite.

376
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,280
Sprite. No, Coke.

377
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
- Are you sure this time?
- One minute remaining
in the first period.

378
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,120
- "Sprite. No, Coke. No, Sprite."
- Shut up!

379
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,160
You're lucky Daddy's not here!

380
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,200
- Why, is there a light bulb
that needs changing?
- You take that back!

381
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,000
- Daddy's a fireman!
- He's too scared to be a fireman.

382
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,280
- He is not!
- Is too.
- I hate you.

383
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,200
Hey, Emily!
Dad said to stay here!

384
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,120
Hey, Emily!

385
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,480
Back in the right corner,
it'll be Steve Smith.

386
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,920
Smith out around center.
He lost the puck.

387
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,120
Robitaille back down
to Chicago territory.

388
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,240
Doesn't look too good.

389
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,080
Graham comes down the slot.
He's stopped by Tolliver.

390
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Hey, Joan, going out
to entertain the Veep?

391
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,400
Mmm.

392
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,160
Are you okay?

393
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,880
He can't push it in.
He had a chance.

394
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Ohh!

395
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,320
First period, shots on goal:
Chicago, 12;

396
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,320
Pittsburgh, 8.

397
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,240
Icey!

398
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,320
Say anything
and I'll kill your mother.

399
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,440
The official Stanley Cup album is
on sale at the Arena Concourse area.

400
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Be sure to pick up your copy now.

401
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,120
- Where's Emily?
- She went to the bathroom.

402
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,360
I told you two not to move.

403
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,520
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

404
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,040
- She hit me and...
- You soaked her.

405
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,240
Don't move.

406
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,640
If the building is falling down
around you, you don't move!

407
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
Emily!

408
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,240
It's a young wine.

409
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,440
Frisky. Huh.

410
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,680
It's almost impetuous,
wouldn't you say?

411
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
I can't think of any
punishment as severe...

412
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
as the one you deserve.

413
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,400
They didn't listen to me
and someone died. Call the President.

414
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
Tell him how much fun we're having.

415
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
I'm sorry. You're not cleared.

416
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,640
The owner just called me.
I'm Icey, the team mascot.

417
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
We're here to see
the Vice President.

418
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,880
- Who's this?
- The owner's niece.

419
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,280
Randy, we got clearance
on a Mr. Icey?

420
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,760
Randy?

421
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,880
- Randy.
- Mr. Icey's a woman, jerk-off.

422
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Emily!

423
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,960
Fuck it.

424
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,080
You owe me a Mother's Day card.

425
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,280
- What is this, a day-care center?
- She saw me off a guy.

426
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,200
- Then you off her.
- I tried.

427
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,200
Touch her, you'll lose me as a hostage,
because you'll have to shoot me.

428
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,200
- Mr. Vice President.
- Aw, shut up. He's campaigning.

429
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,240
- Who are you here with?
- My daddy, and he's a boss.

430
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,440
And he's very brave
and he's not afraid.

431
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,080
And he's gonna come looking
for me, and you'll be sorry.

432
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,320
Oh, I'm already sorry.
What do you mean, he's a boss?

433
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,800
He's a head fireman
and he makes sure everybody's safe...

434
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
- and there's no fire.
- Who is this boss?

435
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,440
Uh, he must be a fire marshal.
When we have special events...

436
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,200
Yeah, yeah. Go and see if there's a
nervous father looking for his daughter.

437
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,800
- What is your name?
- Emily.

438
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,640
- Emily what?
- McCord.

439
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,480
- And your father's name?
- It's McCord too.

440
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,040
Would you like it if I filled
your little mouth with spiders?

441
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,200
- What's his whole name?
- Darren Francis Thomas McCord.

442
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,440
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

443
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,640
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

444
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,040
Ah!

445
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,800
Joan, I was trying
to catch up with you and Emily.

446
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,720
- She wasn't supposed to leave her seat.
- I'm Carla.

447
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,040
- Joan had to go home sick.
- But you were with...

448
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,440
my... my daughter Emily.

449
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,760
Yeah, she was lost.

450
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
So I took her up
to the owner's box.

451
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,680
Come on.
We'll go get her.

452
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,480
Ow!

453
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,840
Aah!

454
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,560
Aah!

455
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,320
Aah!

456
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,600
Second period action about to begin.
The Penguins and Hawks tied at one.

457
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,880
Penguins have the face-off.
Francis deals it up to the Chicago end.

458
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,480
Jagr will chase it down.
He pops it up.

459
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,200
The pass is out to the Penguins.

460
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,600
You've got to get the cops.

461
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,600
My daughter's missing,
and someone just tried to kill me.

462
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,160
Show me where this happened.

463
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,240
May I help you?

464
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,560
This is Matthew Hallmark, Secret
Service. Put the Vice President on.

465
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,160
Hallmark?

466
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,800
Well, I see they care enough
to send their very best.

467
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,440
Gee, I never heard
that one before.

468
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,760
- Say hello.
- This is Vice President Bender. I...

469
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,280
- Now you talk to me.
- Who are you?

470
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200
- Is that necessary?
- Yes.

471
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm a disillusioned patriot with a yen
to fulfill my personal ambitions.

472
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,760
- All right. How many are dead?
- Counting Secret Service?

473
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,080
By the way, why do you tell everybody
you're Secret Service agents?

474
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,720
If it's supposed to be
a secret, don't tell anyone.

475
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
How many are dead?

476
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,360
One civilian, but the room
is full of candidates.

477
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,880
- Don't kill anyone else, you hear me?
- You were told the parameters.

478
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
Full transfer of funds
by the end of this game.

479
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
No attempt to storm this box;
no attempt to clear the arena.

480
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,040
No helicopters or police vehicles
encroach on the stadium grounds.

481
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,720
- Your demands are unrealistic.
- I'm a positive thinker, Matty.

482
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,880
We know you've already checked on these
accounts, so the wheels are turning.

483
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,720
Oh, by the way, don't make any transfers
to the Bently-owned banks.

484
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,560
As shocking as it may be,
they're CIA fronts.

485
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,880
You were with one of our agencies.

486
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,720
You're wasting some of that
unrealistic timetable.

487
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,840
Did he sound like he'd do it?
Kill the Vice President and everybody?

488
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,680
It sounds like he knows way too much.

489
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,680
Chelios, right side,
wide open to the net.

490
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Tolliver! A great save there from
right in front on Dubinsky.

491
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,680
And back come the Pittsburgh Penguins.

492
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,520
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

493
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,240
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

494
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,720
So, where's this seven-foot penguin?

495
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,360
She was there.
I wanna go up to the owner's box.

496
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,280
There's a VIP in the box,
and you don't have clearance.

497
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,720
- Neither does my daughter.
- Who knows where she is?

498
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,120
Let's page her over the public address.
Maybe she's just lost.

499
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,080
Oh, I made this up?
The penguin had a gun.

500
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,640
We'll page it too.

501
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,320
You said her name
was Carla, didn't you?

502
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,800
I always do things like that.

503
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,360
- You didn't say the name, did you?
- No.

504
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,080
Aah!

505
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,400
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fuck you. And fuck your kid.

506
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,240
- Where is she?
- I-I don't know.

507
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,520
- Is she in the owner's box?
- Maybe. Maybe she went out to dinner.

508
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
In a minute, that ear will come off.

509
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,640
All right! All right!

510
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,920
All right! We took the box.

511
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,840
We got people everywhere.

512
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,800
The whole joint's rigged with bombs.

513
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,880
We could bring the whole building down.

514
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,120
What are you, terrorists?

515
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,280
I'm no fucking terrorist.
I'm a professional!

516
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,640
- How do I get in the box?
- Oh, you don't.

517
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,080
Not if you want to see that kid alive.

518
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,800
Aah!

519
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,600
Game's tied at one. Chicago
puts the pressure on the Penguins.

520
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,520
Here's Shantz around the net.
He knocks it right in.

521
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,240
Chicago has taken the lead
against the Penguins.

522
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,080
- Jeff Shantz, the goal scorer.
- This crowd is unhappy,
but give the Hawks credit.

523
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Joe Murphy helping the play,
the Chicago center ice man.

524
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
Joan.

525
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,720
Murphy backhanded it off the right wing
boards, and ahead it goes...

526
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
into Chicago ice.

527
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,840
Cam Russell wearing number eight
in a bright red Chicago uniform.

528
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,200
For Chicago, every step,
every rush is so important.

529
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,800
911, emergency services.

530
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,640
- Officer Lyons speaking.
- My name is Darren McCord.

531
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,480
I'm calling you
from the Civic Arena. 555-1923.

532
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,400
This is not a crank call.

533
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,640
The Vice President is being held hostage
in the owner's box.

534
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,480
- They've got my daughter too.
- This is Sergeant Kurtz.

535
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,720
- Where are you calling from?
- The executive offices.

536
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,560
Stay there for 90 seconds
and keep the line clear.

537
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The Hawks got a man wide open.

538
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,800
He's a step behind the defense.
Here he comes. His shot.

539
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,720
Diving to make the save.

540
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,800
Yeah?

541
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,920
McCord? Hallmark, Secret Service.
What's your situation?

542
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,480
- Lousy. How long have you
known what's going on here?
- Assume we don't.

543
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,680
Someone is holding the owner's box
and everybody in it, including my kid.

544
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,960
- What else?
- Did you have agents posted
at a private elevator?

545
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,080
- Two.
- Notify their families.

546
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,320
- Had any contact with the aggressors?
- I killed two. Is that contact?

547
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,600
Look, one of them told me they're going
to bring this whole building down.

548
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,600
- What are you gonna do?
- We're evaluating the situation.

549
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,920
There's no situation! They want money,
a lot of it. Give it to them.

550
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,240
If you fuck around
and something happens to my kid...

551
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,480
We're considering
every possible response.

552
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,560
If you're not gonna pay,
I'll get my daughter.

553
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,120
Do not try any kind of rescue.
Do you understand me?

554
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,160
You will jeopardize the Vice President
and everyone else in the arena.

555
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,880
Believe me, we know
what the hell we're doing.

556
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,240
Our agents are entering the arena.

557
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,280
You stay where you are.
We're gonna do this by the numbers.

558
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,200
- What number was that, three?
- What I said goes. Don't do anything.

559
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,360
They've turned this whole place
into one big bomb. Do you understand?

560
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,240
- We have bomb squads.
- They don't do us any good out there.

561
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,600
- I'll find the bombs myself.
- You can't do anything alone!

562
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm not alone.

563
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,240
Watching them operate
doesn't give one much hope, does it?

564
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,920
I'm comfortable with whatever strategy
they deem appropriate.

565
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,520
Strategy? Shit.
They fucked up!

566
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,920
Two men should have been
stationed in that kitchen,

567
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
one with a clean geometrical line of
fire to every square inch of the room.

568
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,840
Every body and every thing going into
that elevator should have been searched.

569
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,680
And no covered tray should have been
allowed up here without inspection.

570
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,960
How long were you in the service?

571
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,920
I still am.

572
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,800
- This is my vacation.
- Counterfeit section.

573
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

574
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,560
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

575
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,400
We have confirmation.
One thousand meters.

576
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,280
One thousand meters, roger.

577
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,600
Five hundred meters and closing.

578
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,960
Tango Alpha,
going to start deployment.

579
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,640
Sierra Poppa, deploying one.

580
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,800
Deploying two.

581
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,440
Uh, what's your rate
of deployment there?

582
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,320
Roger.

583
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,240
Three hundred feet.

584
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,880
Three hundred feet.
Copy.

585
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,800
Two hundred feet.

586
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,560
Break off!
Break off!

587
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,640
Man down!

588
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,400
This is Hallmark.

589
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,720
I said no vehicles on the grounds,
no helicopters in the air...

590
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,640
and no agents
in the building.

591
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,360
What part of that
did you not understand?

592
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,560
Three cars are closing on the building
that missile came from.

593
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,800
Ground the other choppers.
I don't want to take this guy alive.

594
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,200
Penguins slip it back
behind the Chicago goal.

595
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,280
He shoots and scores!

596
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,240
Sandstrom and the Penguins
have tied it at two.

597
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,040
Oh, scratch my back
with a hacksaw!

598
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,520
Hey!

599
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,320
The Pittsburgh goal,
fourth of the play-offs...

600
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:07,520
scored by number 17,
Tomas Sandstrom!

601
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,680
The cavalry's coming.

602
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,640
Custer was in the cavalry.
Let 'em come.

603
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,200
- Command, access acquired.
- Roger, copy.

604
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,280
Second team going.
Now.

605
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,160
Motorola MX 360, encryption
and frequency-hopping capability.

606
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,720
Right out of the company store.
You talk, we listen.

607
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,640
Four at the
east side entrance.

608
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,720
We got a light blazer, maybe a tan
windbreaker with a black baseball cap.

609
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,000
A dark yet tasteful windbreaker...

610
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,680
and, uh, a Penguin jacket
and dark pants.

611
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,880
We pay these idiots to protect you,
and they're trying to get you killed.

612
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,520
As a taxpayer, I don't think
you're getting our money's worth.

613
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,360
If those guys want to see a hockey game
so much, we should put them on ice.

614
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,520
We're giving it five minutes.
If they don't report, we're moving in.

615
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,360
That's the President's choice,
but I think it's the wrong one.

616
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,160
- Unless I get a direct order,
I'm getting those guys out.
- Sir?

617
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,040
- What?
- I think you oughta see this.

618
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,400
Stay back!

619
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,720
- Jesus Christ.
- Get 'em out of here.

620
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,400
Penguins gun out of their
own end at the center ice.

621
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,400
They work it down the right.
Murphy has it and he gave it away.

622
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,480
Here's Mullen. It goes wide
off the glove of Eddie Belfour.

623
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,800
John Cullen going
behind the Chicago net.

624
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,160
This guy could prove
to be a pain in the ass.

625
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,080
He has heroic tendencies.

626
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,800
Don't get so worked up.
They'll win.

627
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,280
We've got four minutes left
in period number two.

628
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,920
Centered in the Chicago zone.

629
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,040
Mullen passes to Larry Murphy.

630
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,240
Murphy backhands it
off the right wing boards.

631
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,680
Belfour keeps the play alive.

632
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,720
No, don't!
Oh, don't do it!

633
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,160
This place is ready to explode.

634
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,360
The last seconds of play.

635
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,520
Don't!

636
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,720
- You just killed two
useful members of society.
- No! It's being done!

637
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,640
- The time ticking down here.
- Maybe you'll do better
in the third period.

638
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,360
- They're moving some.
- They're way behind.

639
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,280
I said one-third at the end
of the first period, one-third
at the end of the second period.

640
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,160
- Two seconds left.
- I don't see anything
even close to that.

641
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,280
No!

642
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Second period shots on goal:
Chicago, seven; Pittsburgh...

643
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,680
The mayor has decided not
to run for reelection.

644
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,440
Now, for my
second selection,

645
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,480
I... think...

646
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,680
- Um.
- No, please!

647
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,960
They're moving more.

648
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,120
But it's not that much.

649
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,120
Listen to me, goddam it!
You're getting it!

650
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Kids, don't try this at home.

651
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,560
- Yeah?
- I've got a message for the board.

652
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,880
Maybe you haven't heard.
A guy named Bell invented the telephone.

653
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
- Come on, it's been dead all day.
- Which one controls the billboard?

654
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,200
I can't let you do that.

655
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,120
I'm having a real bad day.

656
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,960
You're assuming his detonators
are radio-controlled.

657
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,080
We get someone inside with equipment
to jam all frequencies...

658
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,840
Damn.

659
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,760
- C-4. I hope he's wrong.
- Not likely.

660
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,640
Arson investigator,
lots of commendations.

661
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,480
- Problem is...
- Is what, sir?

662
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,880
He was taken off-line.
He's a head case.

663
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,200
Shit.

664
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,520
Here we go, final period
of the Stanley Cup finals!

665
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,080
The Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

666
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,000
They'll work it to Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

667
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,040
Sir, I have strong reservations
about you going alone.

668
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,920
There's no way to deploy
any number of men and get close.

669
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,760
- Nobody else is coming out dead!
- How you gonna get there?

670
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,640
Walk. One solitary man
shouldn't trigger a deadly response.

671
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,200
If it does, tell my ex-wife
her gravy train went off the tracks.

672
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,680
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

673
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,160
- Don't be too quick
to pull the trigger.
- Save it. I placed that stuff.

674
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,800
No detonator, no "ka-boom."

675
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,480
- Everybody's an expert.
- Bye-bye.

676
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,840
Aaah!

677
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,880
Bye-bye.

678
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,000
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

679
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,160
- Do you believe me about the explosives?
- Afraid not.

680
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,520
You're McCord. I'm Hallmark.

681
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,440
Have any I.D?

682
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,280
I didn't kill you.

683
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,840
That's for doing your job half-assed...

684
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,720
and putting
my daughter's life in danger.

685
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,640
- And the Vice President's.
- How'd you happen to come down here?

686
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,560
I saw these two and followed them.

687
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Part of my job is recognizing
who's out of place and who isn't.

688
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,760
They didn't seem
interested in hockey.

689
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,920
- How'd you kill that guy?
- Magic. I think there's more
setups like this.

690
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,600
- You know where they are?
- I made some educated guesses.

691
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,520
These are the points I'd pop
if I wanted to bring this place down.

692
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,320
- You marked 15 or 20.
- The places that would cause
the most structural damage.

693
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,680
Third period's started. We got less
than 20 minutes and we're guessing.

694
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,080
Let's hope I know what I'm doing.

695
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,880
Oh. Listen.
My son is here too.

696
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,320
If I can't get back to him,
he's sitting in D-10.

697
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,160
I'll be there.

698
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,120
- Thanks.
- Where are the rest of your men?

699
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,760
From the Chicago end,
McEachern centers.

700
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,040
Belfour made the stop.
Straka with a quick shot.

701
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,200
Just missed the far post.

702
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,120
- Now they're moving it.
- Yeah, but where? Check the codes.

703
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,000
Four hundred million to
Banco de Vizcaya, Madrid.

704
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,920
That's one of the counter banks.

705
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,800
And 300 million
to Banco Popular, Virgin Islands.

706
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,480
These transfers are being tracked;
you'll never get the money.

707
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,200
Not all of it. The money
will be transferred to 12 more banks.

708
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,400
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

709
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,600
Once it's transferred, it's transferred
again and again in a matter of minutes.

710
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,680
With each stop,
cash is siphoned and rerouted,

711
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,800
some converted to foreign currency,

712
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,480
some to negotiable instruments.

713
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,360
Thanks to the incredibly vast
and complicated world of banking...

714
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,560
that our CIA uses to such advantage,

715
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,040
about 500 million dollars will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

716
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,880
And the other billion,
200 million is just a diversion.

717
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,600
I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

718
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,000
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information...

719
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,880
if you weren't planning
to kill everyone here.

720
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,400
Who gets the Cup if I blow up
the building before the game is over?

721
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,160
Yeah?

722
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,760
Not on the phone. You know
they've got the frequency by now.

723
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,280
Don't go away.

724
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,720
Taken away, and McEachern
hustling down the right side.

725
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,840
Coming into the Chicago end. Moves in to
the net. A backhand shot, off-target.

726
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,680
McCord's disarming your bombs.

727
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,520
- Is he guessing?
- He's a pretty good guesser.

728
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,440
- Is he alone?
- Yeah.

729
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,320
- Why didn't you kill him?
- Two of your goons started
firing at us. He ran off.

730
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,800
- It was all I could do to keep
from getting my own ass shot.
- I want him.

731
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,680
I would've had him if you had
more control over your men.

732
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,440
The only problem my men had is they
didn't hit what they were shooting at.

733
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,320
Look, I was there too.

734
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,360
Nice.

735
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,920
I got the next best thing
to the fireman.

736
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,760
He's got a little boy here in the arena.
I know where he's sitting.

737
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,960
Bring him to me.

738
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,320
I always wanted a son.

739
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,520
Greg Smyth against Robitaille,
and zoom!

740
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,240
Quick shot, save made! Hawgood trying
to tee it up. Stopped by Tolliver.

741
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,080
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

742
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,320
Pretty exciting game, huh?

743
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,160
- How come you know my name?
- Your dad and I are friends.
He asked me to come get you.

744
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,840
He and your sister got invited to sit
in the owner's box, way up there.

745
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,720
They got big soft chairs
and plenty to eat.

746
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,560
My dad told me to stay here,
even if the building fell down.

747
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,440
If it did come down,
up there is where you'd wanna be.

748
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,640
Come on.

749
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,680
I'm gonna stay here.

750
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,800
I'm gonna be embarrassed
going back without you.

751
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:51,320
- Do you know my mom?
- No, but your dad's invited me
over for dinner tomorrow.

752
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,240
My mom and dad don't live together.

753
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,120
He didn't mention that.
He just said bring you upstairs.

754
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,440
- Don't you think you should
do what you're told?
- I am.

755
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,200
I need you to come with me.
I'm with the Secret Service.

756
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,960
- Come with me now.
- Come on! Down in front!

757
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,000
- I'll scream.
- I said, I'm with the Secret Service.

758
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,160
- And I'm a little kid.
- Hey, fella, I didn't pay to watch you!

759
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,080
Down in front!

760
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,240
Steve Smith finds the lane.
He'll skate ahead.

761
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,960
Coming to the Penguin line.

762
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,720
How many'd you get?

763
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,800
Four, so far.

764
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,680
- Is that all?
- Christ, I'm just one guy.

765
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,560
- How many did you get?
- Just one.

766
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,480
You are all alone, aren't you?

767
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,400
- You must be real proud.
- I'm gonna be real rich.

768
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,800
Now, very slowly...
I mean very slowly...

769
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,680
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

770
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,800
- What are you gonna do, drown me?
- No.

771
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,160
Aaaah!

772
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,680
- Yeah?
- Hallmark's dead.

773
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,640
- Who's this?
- Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

774
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,520
Tom Castillo.
How you doin', Tom?

775
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,040
- I hope you were gentle with Hallmark.
- How many hostages,

776
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,440
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

777
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,800
That's a personal question.
Ever been involved in an A.O.P., Tom?

778
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,080
I didn't call for conversation.
How many are still alive?

779
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,920
You'd probably think I was lying,
no matter what I told you,

780
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,760
so I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

781
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,040
Hello?

782
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,080
- Hello?
- Emily.

783
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,600
Don't let him know it's me. I'll get
you out. I'll take you home, I promise.

784
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,440
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

785
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,520
Twelve.

786
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,400
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

787
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,920
She included me, Tom.

788
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,360
Tell me what an A.O.P. is, or I'm gonna
shoot this cute little pumpkin.

789
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,560
Listen to me. Listen good.

790
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,600
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed, you lose.

791
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,040
How do you figure that, fireman?

792
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,920
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

793
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,080
You've got your hostages and your bombs,
so you can get your money.

794
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,920
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want anyone to get hurt.

795
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,880
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

796
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,760
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

797
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,960
That's the game,
you piece of shit.

798
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,720
If you touch her, the game's off.
Then I'll come after you.

799
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,920
You'll have to kill me in front of every
body in this arena. There will be panic.

800
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,560
The Secret Service, S.W.A.T., the
fucking navy will have to come in here.

801
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,440
Then you don't get your money.
You lose, pal.

802
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,320
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.

803
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,200
Oh, by the way,
in the Secret Service,

804
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,880
A.O.P. is "assault on principle."

805
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,680
- In this case, our Vice President.
- I don't give a shit.

806
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,440
Ooh, now, Tom, come on. If we're
gonna play, you got to play nice.

807
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,280
You run your ass off. I know where the
bombs are, so I know where you're going.

808
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,320
Then come and get me.

809
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,880
Would you like
a glass of wine or a cigarette?

810
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,640
It's customary to offer these
minor vices to someone before they die.

811
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,080
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are.

812
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,600
- I'm the scariest person you've seen.
- You're the meanest.

813
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,480
Am I, now?
How do you suppose I got that way?

814
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,280
Maybe when you were born
you had something wrong with your brain.

815
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,920
Don't you know any little boys like me?

816
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,960
If there were any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

817
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,240
I can assure you there are one or two.

818
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,840
I'm gonna kill your daddy.
What do you think about that?

819
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,640
He promised he'd take me home.
He always does what he says.

820
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,240
So do I.

821
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,800
We're in the third period.
The Penguins on the rush.

822
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,040
Tamer brings it in.

823
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,560
He puts it in!
Ron Francis!

824
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,200
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one too!

825
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,640
Chicago desperate to get
back into this game.

826
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,960
Sutter fires and scores!
Chicago does get the third goal!

827
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,800
I tell ya, Mike, I don't think
Tolliver looks like himself right now.

828
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,040
We shouldn't be surprised. He had
a 104 degree temperature earlier today.

829
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,360
He looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

830
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,760
- Yo, Ref.
- He's calling for the referee.

831
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,080
- He might wanna go to the bench.
- Tolliver is gonna head that way.

832
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,960
- Backup for the Penguins is Ken Wregget.
- What's the matter?

833
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,840
I really feel like shit.
I don't think I can goal.

834
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,440
Go to the locker room. Wregget!

835
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,800
- Get in there.
- Let's go, Kenny.

836
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,280
Now in goal for Pittsburgh,
number 31, Ken Wregget.

837
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,280
Hey, fireman, where are you?

838
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,280
- You don't call, you don't write.
- I'm not far away.

839
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,800
- How many have you found?
- How many what?

840
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,720
I could detonate all ten right now.

841
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,600
Go ahead. Then you lose.

842
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,800
Nervous stomach, fireman?

843
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,800
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

844
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,640
Charge!

845
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:20,760
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep. A shot off the stick!

846
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,840
Section B. Now.

847
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,640
Chelios guns it ahead
to Bernie Nicholls.

848
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,200
Here he comes!
Look out!

849
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,640
He shoots and scores! Bernie Nicholls
carried it in, right down the slot.

850
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,280
A heavy slap shot.

851
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,440
An old-fashioned shoot-out here
at the Stanley Cup competition.

852
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,960
Up the alley now,
center circle.

853
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,360
Lines it up to the Penguins.

854
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,760
He'll get the puck out.
He really shakes his stick.

855
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,600
Mike, they're making some noise
down here and I'm not sure why.

856
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,880
I don't believe this. Brad Tolliver
is actually coming back into the game!

857
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,240
This is a guy that once
finished a game with a broken ankle.

858
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,600
Takes a lot of guts to come back in
at this point with Chicago leading, 4-3.

859
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,320
They're on the verge of winning
their first Stanley Cup since 1960.

860
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,720
Now he's just sitting on the bench.

861
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,360
Feeling better?

862
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,800
Then get the fuck in there.

863
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,000
And here he comes.

864
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,480
Now back in goal for Pittsburgh,

865
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,280
number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing number 31, Ken Wregget.

866
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,840
I don't know what he did, if he
just recharged his battery or what,

867
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,200
but this guy was really sick
and he's gonna try to finish the game.

868
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,680
Can he can make the big saves to keep
the Penguins within striking distance?

869
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,600
He's got all summer to get better.

870
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,240
There's Tolliver, with the crowd
here literally crazy on their feet.

871
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,080
Penguins looking for a lift here
to try and get back in this game.

872
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,160
Here we go!
Chicago will control the face-off.

873
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,880
- They'll dump it to the Penguin end.
- Stay down there.

874
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,400
- Oh, Christ.
- Chicago drives it back
into Pittsburgh territory.

875
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,000
Chicago slips it back
behind the Pittsburgh goal.

876
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:07,000
The Penguins try to get the puck back,
and they do just that.

877
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,400
They scramble now
and deliver up the right side.

878
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,320
They have to stay on offense. Tolliver
is not challenging the shooters.

879
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,320
- He hasn't challenged much all night.
- Oh, shit.

880
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,160
Move out!

881
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,040
Move out!

882
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,600
Goddam it, move out!

883
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,840
He's gonna come out.
He'll challenge.

884
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,560
Tolliver hits his head on the ice,
and he's hurt, but play continues.

885
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,360
The puck gets free.
The Penguins have command.

886
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,840
The Penguins trail by only one.

887
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,920
Tolliver hit his head on the ice
so hard his kids will be born dizzy.

888
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,400
This is Chicago on the attack.

889
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:32,120
What a save by Brad Tolliver!
That's the save of the year!

890
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,080
He oughta get five to ten
for robbing the Hawks on that...

891
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,480
to keep the Penguins within a goal.

892
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,680
Not to mention, Paul,
that he's been sick.

893
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,480
He didn't challenge much this game. Now
he comes up with the save of the year.

894
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,840
No question about it,
that is his biggest save ever.

895
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,280
- He makes a move in front of the net.
- What's he doing?

896
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,560
- He just slammed Dubinsky!
- Tolliver, what the fuck are you doing?

897
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,560
He gave him a right cross
and knocked him down.

898
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,120
He's gonna get
a game misconduct and a fine.

899
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,040
He's put his team shorthanded.
The Penguins now are really in the hole.

900
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,240
Strange night for Tolliver.
I don't know what he's up to.

901
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:40,000
Tolliver, that's
a thousand-dollar fine!

902
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,840
Get outta the way!

903
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,400
Who the hell are you?

904
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,320
What the hell...

905
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,520
Aaah!

906
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,600
Ysebaert will rebound.
He'll turn and shoot.

907
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,880
Less than three minutes to go. He'll
have to find the puck. And he does.

908
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,640
Face-off.
Off the puck he goes!

909
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,480
Chicago has it back again with two
minutes to go in third-period action.

910
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,560
On the move. The Blackhawks
stopped by the Penguins' line.

911
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,360
The Penguins desperately
trying to get back and tie.

912
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,880
The Chicago Blackhawks
hold on to a 4-3 lead.

913
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,720
Penguins have to look for a big gun
to try and topple Chicago again.

914
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,120
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

915
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,480
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

916
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,640
Intercepted by Chicago!

917
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,920
Big check on
John Cullen of the Penguins.

918
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,840
Jagr going for the net, Naslund shoots,
and he's stopped by Belfour.

919
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,760
A minute, thirty-five to go
in the third period.

920
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,920
That's all that remains
for Chicago to win the Stanley Cup.

921
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,840
The Penguins need a rally
to tie the game.

922
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,280
Penguins reach in the corner.

923
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,680
Drop it.

924
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,000
Oh, what a save!

925
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,280
Larmer drills one! Nice stop! He gave
more moves than Mae West on that one!

926
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,040
One minute remaining
in the third period.

927
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,680
And the Penguins
trailing by a goal.

928
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,240
Chicago still
putting pressure on.

929
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,640
Forty seconds remaining now.

930
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,000
Aaah!

931
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,960
The Penguins
need a goal desperately.

932
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,640
Thirty seconds left. Chicago's looking
for the parade down Michigan Ave.

933
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,800
They feel they've got
the Stanley Cup.

934
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,000
Aaah!

935
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,600
Aaah!

936
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,520
...Chicago win the Stanley Cup.

937
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,520
Time again ticking down.
Penguins running out of it.

938
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,120
Penguins reaching for every
possible thing they have.

939
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,960
Chicago takes it away. They'll drive
it to center with 14 seconds to go.

940
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,360
The Penguins don't have much time!

941
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,360
The puck's run by Francis,
ahead to Robitaille.

942
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,040
Not much time to go. Luc Robitaille...

943
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,720
We've got eight seconds left!

944
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,000
Seconds to go.

945
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,480
Stop the press!
Stop the press!

946
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,400
The Penguins have tied the game.

947
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,720
We're going to sudden death overtime!
You would have to be here to believe it!

948
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,680
Lucky Luc has scored for the Penguins
with under a second to go!

949
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,040
This series has been incredible!

950
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,840
- Lucky Luc has done it again!
- Sudden death?

951
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,120
Sudden death.

952
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,840
Paul, the Penguins
would not give up, despite the odds.

953
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,240
Belfour tried everything
in his power to stop them.

954
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,080
The Penguins have forced
sudden death overtime.

955
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:40,440
The team that scores first in the
next period will win the Stanley Cup!

956
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,840
Pittsburgh goal,

957
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,000
his 14th in the play-offs,
scored by...

958
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,880
Life's just a shitbox
of ironies, huh?

959
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,960
We still got money to move.
I hope it's not mine.

960
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,880
Everybody's got
a little more time.

961
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,800
I'd hate to see them waste it.

962
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,720
Wouldn't you?

963
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,040
Throw away the clocks, because the next
goal is going to win the Stanley Cup.

964
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,960
That's what sudden death
is all about.

965
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,800
Penguins control the draw,
drop it into the Chicago end.

966
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,720
Jagr will carry it in.

967
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:04,400
Both net-minders coming up tough here.
McEachern has it again!

968
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,320
Psst.

969
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,040
Aah!

970
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,720
Aaaah!

971
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,440
Breaking quickly!
Got a man! Move!

972
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,840
Bang! I'm immortal.

973
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,000
Aah!

974
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,120
Aaaah!

975
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,760
Jagr will carry it in,
but he's checked.

976
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,320
Aaaah!

977
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,160
Holy shit!

978
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,560
What's that?

979
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,880
Daddy!

980
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,120
Daddy.

981
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,880
- Come on, let's go!
- Watch it, will ya?

982
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,760
How many did you find, fireman?

983
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,000
Tyler.

984
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,560
I didn't move, Dad.
I didn't move.

985
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Not even when things
blew up.

986
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,800
I didn't move.

987
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,960
It's over.

988
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,960
You're McCord, right?
I'm Agent Saccio.

989
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,840
Better off not moving
until this settles down.

990
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,680
The Vice President wants very much
to meet you. He's very grateful.

991
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,160
Daddy. Daddy.

992
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
Daddy, that's the man.

993
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,680
That's the man, Daddy.
That's him.

994
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,080
Daddy!

995
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,680
Stay with him.

996
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,640
Emily!

997
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,560
Daddy!

998
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,400
Let's go.

999
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,600
Daddy!

1000
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,120
Daddy!

1001
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,000
No!

1002
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,920
Aaah! Daddy!

1003
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,600
Daddy!

1004
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:38,160
I'm not gonna kill you!

1005
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,000
I'd rather you spent the rest
of your life remembering you
couldn't save your little girl.

1006
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,280
Daddy!

1007
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,120
Aah!

1008
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,680
Aaah!

1009
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,320
Aah!

1010
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,040
Aaah!

1011
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,800
Aaah!

1012
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,840
Aaaah!

1013
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,800
You should've seen my dad.

1014
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,800
My daddy's a fireman.
