1060
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:25,278
I need your help, Harry.

1061
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:27,383
For what?
Where's my chair?

1062
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:30,391
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

1063
01:36:32,352 --> 01:36:34,261
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

1064
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:36,190
That's great.
That's great.

1065
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:38,044
Give me my chair.

1066
01:36:38,145 --> 01:36:40,795
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

1067
01:36:40,896 --> 01:36:43,263
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

1068
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,815
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

1069
01:36:45,921 --> 01:36:48,637
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

1070
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:51,736
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

1071
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:54,394
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

1072
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:57,693
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

1073
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,846
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?

1074
01:37:40,128 --> 01:37:41,951
