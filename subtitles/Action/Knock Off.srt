1
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,574
Marine Command Post O.C.U.1.
Inspector Chang calling.

2
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:31,558
Beach cordon
is in place. Over.

3
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,372
OK.

4
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,387
Son of a bitch!

5
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,553
Oh, shoot!

6
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:04,220
With June 30 only 72 hours away,

7
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,384
Hong Kong and the world are poised for one of
the most historic moments...

8
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:09,266
Of the closing century:

9
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:12,789
The return of Hong Kong to chinese rule after
a century and a half as a British colony.

10
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,953
With both Prince Charles
and President Jiang Zemin at the podium,

11
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:19,737
and high-ranking guests
from all over the world in attendance,

12
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:23,481
there will be an unprecedented
level of security for Tuesday's ceremonies.

13
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:27,064
Three security zones
for land, sea and air will be patrolled...

14
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,509
 I confess that this is
really not my song 

15
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,092
 I bought it in Hong Kong 

16
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,895
- A belly ring. Does that
increase pleasure during sex?
- Not really.

17
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,957
I meant for me. Lance, work with me.
I'm working.

18
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,179
- I'm not loving this.
- Sorry, sir.

19
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,183
- Lans, burn this. - Yes, sir.
- Burn this in front of your parents.
Will you do that?

20
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,425
- We can't wear underwear with these clothes.
- Why not?

21
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,928
- This underwear sucks. I'm not gonna wear it.
- Why not?

22
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,611
They're denim.
The underwear are spandex nylon.

23
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,193
- So.
- They're chemically reactive.

24
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,777
Then don't wear the underwear!
I've always been against underwear.

25
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:59,739
My record proves that.
Come on, people! Work with me!

26
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,183
You're models! Look bitchy!
Look like you haven't eaten in a week.

27
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:05,826
 Don't fake it 
 V-SIX jeans 

28
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:09,389
 don't fake it
I'm good enough to wear 

29
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,412
- I need your support today.
It's a very hard day for me.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:14,415
- Why can't you be a gentleman
like your partner?
- My partner! Where is Ray?

31
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:17,298
- Give me the phone!
I need your support.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:19,961
- Does that mean anything to you?
I gotta get out of the garment business.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:03,006
Hey, nice wheels, man.

34
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,249
Take it for a spin.
You sure?

35
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:07,231
- A short spin.
Hey, guys!
- Yeah!

36
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,493
Yo, Bobo!

37
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:12,316
Marcus. Hey, nice glasses.
Cartier?

38
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,499
- Yeah. You want them?
- I've got boxes.

39
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,282
Greatest knockoff artist
in Hong Kong.

40
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:19,864
Ah, hard to believe
Marcus Ray gone "regit."

41
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:22,307
- Legit, legit.
- Yeah.

42
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:25,891
- Oh, ho, ho, ho. Any good?
- The last ones.

43
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:29,495
Work good. Fifteen, 20 minutes.
Long enough to make sale.

44
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:33,919
Good. I wanna go out with my reputation intact.
I always made quality crap.

45
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,343
You know, Ray, you can always come back.
Hey, Choy.

46
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,645
You've got to use designers
who speak english.

47
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,507
What's wrong?
These excellent.

48
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,389
- Right out of picture in catalog.
- I know,

49
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,251
but "Puma," one "m."

50
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,734
only an idiot
would buy these.

51
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:50,177
One "m," two "m's."
these are hot. Collector item.

52
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:02,310
This is not your shipment, Marcus. Get your gwei-lo
hands off the merchandise, or you'll lose it.

53
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,552
You're in the toy business
now, Skinny?

54
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,614
I thought you were
too big for that.

55
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:12,120
I can be in any business I want, and no one
can touch me. Not you, not the law.

56
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,684
You wanna know why your legs
didn't just get broken?

57
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:20,008
I put a big bet on you
in today's race.

58
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,553
Ladies and gentlemen,

59
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,695
your attention, please.

60
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,698
The Hong Kong
merchants' association...

61
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,561
Will begin its seventh annual
charity race in ten minutes.

62
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,446
V-SIX jeans is our name.

63
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,069
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Give me some energy, huh?

64
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,532
Come on! Give me the illusion
that you give a crap.

65
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,956
- Come on, people! Pachy. Pachy!
- No, really.

66
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,298
Are you okay?
Can I get you some water?

67
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,482
- Uh-uh.
- You work for me, right? You're an elephant?

68
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,624
- Right.
- Then put your head on and get to work!

69
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,028
I'm not paying you peanuts!
Get going! Get on it!

70
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,491
Marcus, Marcus, he's our man.

71
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:02,534
If he can't do it,
no one can!

72
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:09,441
Hey, girls.
I'm late, I'm late.

73
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,843
Where were you?
At 8:00, we had a tax meeting.

74
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,766
At 10:30,
we had a fashion show.

75
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,749
At 11:15, we had a design meeting.
At noon, the copier blew up.

76
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:20,072
At 1:00 P.M., we had an office meeting with
the entire staff of V-SIX jeans,

77
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,014
saying, "where's Ray?
Where's Ray?"

78
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:25,118
Good job. Hey, did you get
my running shoes?

79
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:28,361
I got something even better.
You're gonna love this.

80
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:32,546
It's Puma, 5000-x, hydroplane sole,
shock absorbent.

81
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:35,168
Trust me,
it's the bomby-bomb.

82
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,111
It's the shit.
it is shit.

83
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,674
You're kidding, right?

84
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:47,401
It doesn't matter what you wear
because I'm gonna win.

85
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:53,388
Eddie.
Hey, chrome dome.

86
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:57,472
Just back from tokyo, huh?
You son of a bitch.

87
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,777
I'm one step ahead
of an angry husband. Hah!

88
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:10,025
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hey, Eddie. Nice clothes. Steal 'em?

89
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:16,352
He doesn't mean it. Hey, I thought you'd given up.
I heard you were running.

90
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,656
I can't let you
spoil my record.

91
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,479
Get ready to weep.
I'm gonna kick your ass again, like last year.

92
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,961
Hey, you won last year
because you cheated.

93
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,186
No, because since you
hooked up with Tommy, you've gotten soft.

94
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,809
Soft?
I'll show you soft.

95
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,453
Who's next?

96
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,880
We got shocks,
we got k3, we got kandu.

97
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,185
I got 100,000 on Eddie Wang.
We got 100,000 on V-SIX jeans. Any takers?

98
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,629
Bang-bang!

99
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,112
Hey, he's betting
on both of us again.

100
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,395
He's a two-timer.
See you at the finish line.

101
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:59,178
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Here, here.

102
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:01,140
Here, take it.
Take it. Take it all.

103
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,522
If you keep hanging out
with them, we're not gonna be worth crap.

104
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,465
- All we have is our reputation, Ray!
- He's family.

105
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:09,008
Oh, he's family.
Yeah, the five families.

106
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:12,552
- His brother is the biggest mobster in Hong Kong.
- That's his cousin.

107
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,414
- Just stop being an old lady.
- No! You ruined it.

108
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:16,356
I don't want to
anymore.

109
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,780
Hey, no.

110
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,844
- You worry too much. Look, I'm in condition.
- I don't...

111
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,607
- we'll go on eastern avenue,
then come back on second.
- I don't want to!

112
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,190
It's a straight shot
to the finish line.

113
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,092
We are a lock to win,
my buddy.

114
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,014
Eddie's got the fix in.

115
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:36,497
Okay?
Okay, no problem.

116
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,925
- Bite me.
- On your marks!

117
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,472
Get set!

118
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,022
Go!

119
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:18,662
Go! Go!

120
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:21,806
Go, go! Now go!

121
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,133
No!

122
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

123
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,844
Shit!

124
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:16,684
Don't panic!
We're a lock to win!

125
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:21,489
I'm not worried about winning.
I wanna be a lock not to die.

126
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,932
You're not gonna die, okay?

127
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,992
Turn it around!
Turn it around!

128
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,577
The cars.

129
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:54,644
Go, go, go. Go!

130
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:58,128
Go, go, go. Go!
Go, go, go. Go!

131
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,692
- You're in shape! You're in shape!
- I'm in shape!

132
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:03,634
Go, go!
I'm in shape.

133
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,200
He's taking a shortcut.
Turn here! Turn here!

134
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,422
- Here? There's no "here" here.
- Trust me. Turn here!

135
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,884
Turn!
Okay.

136
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,347
What are you waiting for,
you idiot?

137
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,390
Go!

138
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,312
Go, go!

139
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,294
Go!

140
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,882
So are you, baby.
Sorry.

141
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,345
Sorry. Excuse me.

142
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,608
- Go, go! Don't even think about it!
- Sorry.

143
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,650
Go, go, go!

144
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,693
Go, go!
You got it! You got it!

145
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,416
We're winning!
We're winning!

146
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:49,042
Come on! Move that big,
beautiful ass of yours!

147
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,064
Hey, what you doing?

148
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:54,448
I'm just... I'm just saying
we're winning, that's all.

149
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:01,175
- Hey!
- Move it! You gotta want it!

150
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,361
Finish line.
Superfast.

151
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,265
Yah-ha-ha, baby!
Yah-ha-ha!

152
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:13,148
- Hey, how the hell did he get ahead of us?
- Good question.

153
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:24,119
Those Pumas must be knockoffs.
What kind of scumbag would sell knockoffs?

154
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,352
Goddamn traitor!

155
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,116
Eddie!

156
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,022
Something's not right.

157
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,905
It's not him.

158
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,627
So what?

159
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:55,413
- Eddie!
- Uh, Ray.

160
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,055
Stop it!
Hey, what are you doing?

161
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,218
- They've got Eddie!
- You've got me!

162
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,868
Drop it!

163
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:50,815
Eddie! Eddie.

164
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:57,162
He was cheating again.
Thank god.

165
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:59,585
Get up!

166
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,614
You're gonna talk, perp!
No, he's not!

167
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,088
Move, move, move!

168
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,533
Police! Don't move!

169
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:31,619
Now stand up slowly!
No sudden moves!

170
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,243
I got her!

171
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,485
- I got her!
- Tommy!

172
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,890
What did you do?
She's a cop.

173
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:44,933
She's a cop?

174
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:48,036
- Yeah, she's a cop.
- You didn't tell me she was a cop.

175
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:04,274
You saying you were innocent participants
in this rickshaw race...

176
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,996
For which I see
no permit was issued.

177
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:09,759
- However, a number of questions remain.
- What kind of questions?

178
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,884
All we did was defend ourselves.
We're innocent.

179
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:17,688
- We're not... we're not criminals.
- That remains to be seen.

180
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,531
We've identified
this man,

181
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,294
Ivan Largoff.

182
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:26,357
Killed at the scene
by detective Ling.

183
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:30,001
He's formerly a K.G.B. Agent,
russian intelligence.

184
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:33,344
And since you're so innocent,
why would such a person attack you?

185
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,408
Maybe he wasn't
that intelligent.

186
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,415
Look, we're legitimate businessmen
with an office to run.

187
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:47,299
An office that employs a lot
of Hong Kong citizens.

188
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,822
And pays those
Hong Kong taxes.

189
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:52,865
Pay for the police, and that's why Hong Kong
police are everywhere.

190
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,428
Mr. Ray, our records indicate...

191
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,531
That you first entered Hong Kong
as an illegal immigrant.

192
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,274
At one point, you were deported
and came back immediately...

193
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:04,918
Because of the money you could make,
and proceeded to build a large illegal business.

194
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:07,261
Hey, hey, hey.
We all make mistakes, huh?

195
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:09,823
- Apparently.
- Did you know the racer who
was killed by the russians...

196
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,247
was a small-time gambler
and worked for your friend, Eddie Wang?

197
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,770
Eddie Wang?
Doesn't ring a bell to me.

198
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,012
I suppose you don't
know him either, Mr. Hendricks.

199
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,994
No bells here,

200
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:23,238
but I do have a little ringing
in my ears from the accident, though.

201
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:26,821
Sir, their stress levels are up.
They're lying.

202
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,924
But what a surprise.

203
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,326
Your self-defense story
checks out... for now, that is.

204
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,829
You're released
on your own recognizance.

205
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:38,974
Don't leave the jurisdiction, gentlemen.
This investigation isn't over. And...

206
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,177
we know where you live.

207
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:45,001
Speaking personally,
once we fold that union jack,

208
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,684
I don't care
what they do with you.

209
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,807
Mr. Hendricks, Mr. Ray,
you may go.

210
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:52,789
Thank you.
Thank you.

211
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,153
Hey, we're a lock to win. You don't
weigh much. Good call. Good job.

212
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,875
- It's shit.
- Oh.

213
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:02,619
Uh-uh, wait a minute. Sit down.
I have a few more questions.

214
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,162
Besides trashing
your company's reputation,

215
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,264
you mind telling me
what you're doing here?

216
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:11,108
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Are you, like, the Hong Kong Five-O?

217
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,411
- Is there a parking ticket we need to take care of?
- Karen lee.

218
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:17,275
Executive V.P.
international sales, V-SIX jeans.

219
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,857
Oh.

220
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:23,201
I realize this may be very difficult for you,
gentlemen,

221
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:25,764
but please
try to think.

222
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:30,169
What are those?
Um, V-SIX, 606, size eight.

223
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,131
Your size.

224
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,093
- I'm a six, thank you.
- Ah.

225
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,978
Mr. Hendricks, the masseuse is here
for your regular appointment.

226
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,341
Yeah, uh, cancel her
for the rest of the week.

227
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:43,843
Make it the rest
of the month.

228
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:49,029
Obviously neither one of you is used to pulling
your own weight in this company.

229
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:52,012
But please,
let's give it a try. Pull.

230
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:57,057
- I meant together.
- Oh. Oh.

231
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,564
Pull.

232
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,791
That's enough.

233
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:14,436
Now try these.

234
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,066
Gentlemen, in light
of our company motto and mascot,

235
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,949
- how do you explain this?
- Uh, well, I've been working out,

236
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:29,732
and you, uh, naturally...

237
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,014
okay, they're knockoffs.
Exactly.

238
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:37,380
Cheap eight-ounce denim instead of the
14-ounce used in authentic V-SIX jeans.

239
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,423
What? They are knockoff artists
in Hong Kong?

240
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:44,928
I'm shocked. Okay, you see, Hong Kong
is like knockoff central.

241
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:48,172
They knock off everything
from Benetton to Fila to knockoff Puma.

242
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:51,816
Yeah, and the pope's catholic.
So what?

243
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:55,199
This pair came from the last shipment
you sent to the states.

244
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,381
In fact, half the entire
shipment was counterfeit.

245
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,325
- No, no, no, that's impossible.
- That's fact.

246
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,449
Inspector's report. Check it against
your own shipping manifest.

247
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,656
She's right.

248
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:12,658
- She looks good when she's right, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:16,742
And if half the entire shipment
was eight-ounce instead of 14,

250
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:19,985
at wholesale, that means
V-SIX jeans is out...

251
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:24,270
- $4,200,000.
- Oh, that's bullshit!

252
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,032
Aha!

253
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:29,676
You didn't convert
from Hong Kong dollars to U.S. Dollars.

254
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:34,281
The real figure is
$5,400,000.

255
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:38,705
Uh, this calculator has...
excuse us, please.

256
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:42,930
Bangkok won't ship the yardage
in 30 days because of the handover.

257
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,834
Okay. Swap the destination with
the origin in the computer.

258
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:50,178
When it gets here,
tell customs we made a mistake.

259
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,520
Then return it
to our factory here, okay?

260
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,883
Uh, mel, don't you have
something for me to sign?

261
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,789
I sign things too...
in private.

262
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,592
Oh, things like
that falsified document.

263
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,695
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
Ray signs all the false documents.

264
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:10,579
Oh, I agree, and I think
you two have spent your time in Hong Kong...

265
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,162
Getting drunk, chasing ass,
and getting massages...

266
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,124
Instead of taking care
of company business.

267
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:19,469
Look, the massage industry in Hong Kong is
going through a really tough time right now.

268
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,771
I'm just trying to help out
the local college girls.

269
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:25,575
I don't know and I don't care whether you
two pathetic excuses for business partners...

270
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:30,420
Are mixed up in this knockoff bullshit as
instigators or just dupes.

271
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,484
I swear, we're just dupes.
Either way, we'll see tonight.

272
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:37,768
That's when the customs police is raiding
the factory these bogus jeans came from.

273
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:40,491
They'll need you to identify
the merchandise.

274
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:43,094
Some local named Eddie Wang
signed the lease.

275
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:46,838
Eddie Wang?
Doesn't sound familiar.

276
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:49,421
Ray?

277
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:52,984
- I'll pick you up at 6:30 tonight.
- No, wait a minute.

278
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,147
Ray got his ass kicked
last night.

279
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,269
Ray hasn't slept
in 24 hours.

280
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:59,692
Ray can't go
on some wild goose chase.

281
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,976
Don't worry. If ray's mixed up
in this knockoff bullshit,

282
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,959
Ray's gonna get plenty of rest
in prison, and so will you.

283
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,102
Prison?

284
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:13,706
Yes, prison, gentlemen. You see, counterfeiting
happens to be a federal crime.

285
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,089
Whether it's clothing or whether it's money,
it doesn't matter.

286
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:21,114
If you're not available tonight, I can only assume
that you intend to flee my jurisdiction.

287
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,217
In which case,
trust and believe,

288
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:25,619
I will take
appropriate action.

289
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:31,405
Like I said, 6:30.
Be there.

290
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:37,292
She looks good
when she's mean, hmm?

291
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,382
Where's Eddie, big guy?

292
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,208
Where's your boss, huh?

293
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,571
Light you a cigar?

294
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:58,354
Of course not,
you're dead.

295
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:03,700
Idiot comrade Volkov
killed you.

296
00:25:06,783 --> 00:25:10,227
We've had enough
of your screwups, Volkov.

297
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:12,669
You're always high on something.
Now we give you tough love.

298
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:19,196
Cure you, cold turkey.

299
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:28,826
Ah, trevyev,
your passports are ready.

300
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,332
Didn't your mothers teach you
not to make a mess?

301
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,755
You turned this place
into a shithole.

302
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:38,897
You want transportation
out of Hong Kong?

303
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:40,799
And you want
to get paid?

304
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,763
Ooh.

305
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,666
Our V-SIX friends are headed
toward the factory.

306
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,891
I'd suggest you cowboys
get over there before they do and clean up.

307
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,162
You're worried about
miss V-SIX, size six.

308
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:05,425
I'm worried about those guys
at the market chasing Eddie.

309
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:07,728
Why?

310
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:10,551
Why?
Uh, okay.

311
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,513
'Cause he's a scumbag,

312
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,995
and he's probably got himself
mixed up in some chinese "ting."

313
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,199
You mean "tong."
"ting" is a beverage.

314
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,121
I thought it was "tang."
That's another beverage.

315
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:23,024
And by the way, Eddie's no scumbag, okay?
He's my family.

316
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,186
"Eddie's no scumbag.
He's family."

317
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:30,852
Hey, easy on my shirt, big fella.
That's $1,000 hawaiian.

318
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,556
Oh, that's now... Jesus!

319
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:37,079
Oh, my... goddamn it!
You did that on purpose!

320
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,322
- Look, I'm a scumbag, huh?
- I never said you were a scumbag.

321
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,224
But you thought
about it.

322
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,368
Friend.

323
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:49,112
Oh, great. Now he's a mind reader.
Stupid asshole.

324
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,554
I should kill him
in front of his parents.

325
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,743
Thanks.

326
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,331
Chief's upset with you
about this.

327
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,253
You made a spectacle
of yourself.

328
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,996
You know what he's like.
He wanted to keep a low profile.

329
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:19,764
Thanks.

330
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,223
Tommy?

331
00:27:58,505 --> 00:28:01,949
Stay out of it!
Stay out of what?

332
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,273
- Get your ass back in there,
or you're in big trouble.
- I am already.

333
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,121
Hey, hold on.

334
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:21,790
- You're supposed to report to us,
but we never hear from you.
- I'm busy.

335
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,633
You don't want me to tip off Ray, do you?
You've got years of training.

336
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:27,496
You can't handle a street punk
like Marcus Ray?

337
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:31,521
It's a local named Eddie Wang.
He's running a knockoff factory.

338
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:35,325
He obviously made the wrong kind of enemies,
and I got caught in the middle.

339
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,547
Look, I gotta get
back down there.

340
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:40,810
Well, Eddie Wang, we may have to send him away.
That's something we can arrange.

341
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,333
Jesus!

342
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:50,180
you think I can't
smell cops?

343
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:54,505
It all fits now!
You make me a partner...

344
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,468
While the executives
from the states looking for knockoffs.

345
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:00,171
You're setting me up!
It's not what it looks like!

346
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:02,734
You're using me to get to Eddie.
Huh?

347
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:08,540
Who are you working for?
Tell me!

348
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,502
What are you doing?

349
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,007
What?

350
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,550
What are you doing?

351
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,353
Who the hell are you?

352
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,856
If they go over, I'm the last man you're
gonna see on planet earth.

353
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,858
Harry!

354
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:31,264
- Game's over, Harry! We gotta tell him!
- Tell him.

355
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:34,367
We work for the government!
We're C.I.A.!

356
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:37,190
Harry's my boss!

357
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:40,234
Now pull us up, ray.

358
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:43,057
Pull us up, ray.

359
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,002
Jesus.

360
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:02,918
You look confused, Mr. Ray.
It's simple really.

361
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:06,181
Because my boy Hendricks here
needed a cover, so we really had to use you.

362
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:10,566
You were a little dirty,
but we couldn't be picky. Understand?

363
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:15,431
You understand
what I'm saying?

364
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:19,335
Don't you understand
what you do affects me?

365
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,739
You want to destroy
our business?

366
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,841
Is that what you want,
huh?

367
00:30:24,901 --> 00:30:28,365
Whoever you are, you were
supposed to make me legit.

368
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:31,909
You lied to me!

369
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,973
It was a need-to-know basis,
and you didn't need to know!

370
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:41,058
There is not one legitimate businessman in
all of Hong Kong that would work with you!

371
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:43,020
Not one, ray.
I did.

372
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:45,523
I've been carrying you
for four years.

373
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,330
You're the king
of knockoffs.

374
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,335
I was,
but you're still a fake.

375
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:07,366
Now that is a problem.
That is a problem.

376
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,649
Why?

377
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,752
There's this woman executive
from V-SIX jeans.

378
00:31:12,812 --> 00:31:15,975
She's from the states.
Somebody's counterfeiting our jeans,

379
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,198
and she thinks
we're involved.

380
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:21,521
- We're supposed to raid a factory tonight.
- What?

381
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:25,205
Shit! What the hell is the
matter with you, asshole?

382
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,728
You're in trouble.

383
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:51,974
Nice building.

384
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:54,516
- Thank you.
- Too nice on your salaries.

385
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,519
- What?
- Check into "sublet,

386
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,761
manager's residences,"
if convicted.

387
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:01,364
No, no, it's just the lobby that's nice.
The rooms are very small.

388
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:10,253
- Let me help...
- Help you.
- Thank you.

389
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,215
May I?

390
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,463
Here's the lease on the factory we're raiding.
Eddie Wang signed it.

391
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:21,645
That still doesn't prove
he's a knockoff artist.

392
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:25,870
Why are you defending a gangster? It looks
like he's screwing us.

393
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,212
Oh, no. With Eddie,
it's more like date rape.

394
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:32,717
Would you explain to my partner,
there are three people on this bench,

395
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:35,600
not just his biceps.

396
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,284
Hey, look,
I hear you like 007.

397
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:42,608
Just the ones
with Sean Connery.

398
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,651
I hope we find something.
We will.

399
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:47,573
Last week, we busted
a whole warehouse...

400
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,615
Where they were making
knockoff Apple Babies.

401
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,377
Apple Babies?

402
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:54,220
- Oh, I love those.
- Me too.

403
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,923
I buy them
for my niece, Ashley, all the time.

404
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,706
- You know, it's really starting
to become a full-time job.
- Really?

405
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,514
This is vanilla creme.
She's the hardest to find.

406
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:12,539
She's yours. I gotta tell you, though,
she's a phony.

407
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,962
It seems like
they're everywhere.

408
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:27,375
Sir, everything
is prepared.

409
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:30,158
Good.
The men are in position.

410
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:34,303
Once everything's secure, we gotta get these
V-SIX people to identify the merchandise.

411
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:37,786
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus Ray.

412
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,351
Parents were doctors,
died in Indochina.

413
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:44,654
Adopted, age ten.

414
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:48,057
And a series of meaningless jobs until
you hooked up with Tommy.

415
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:51,221
- That's supposed to be me?
- I'm sorry.

416
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:54,684
Don't be sorry.

417
00:33:56,186 --> 00:34:00,050
I'm sorry that after tonight,
Eddie'll probably be arrested.

418
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,723
What are we waitin' on?

419
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,426
Every night at the same time,
they get a food delivery.

420
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,909
When the door opens,
we go in.

421
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:23,835
Szechwan or cantonese?
It's mom's pizza!

422
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:37,009
Hello? Who's there?
It's mom's pizza.

423
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,092
Come on! Let's go!

424
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,254
Don't let him go!
Stop him!

425
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:00,646
Freakin' hell!

426
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:03,569
Come on!

427
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,548
- Nice toy.
- It's not a toy, so don't play with it.

428
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:42,510
Here's your wallet,
and I accept your apology.

429
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,833
No, no, no, no.
I'm not saying I'm sorry.

430
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,756
Okay, okay,
the apology's over.

431
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,120
Happy?

432
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:54,603
Happy.
I'm sorry.

433
00:38:54,663 --> 00:38:57,026
Me too.

434
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,059
Let's go see
your boss, Tommy.

435
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:26,117
These guys have something
against escalators?

436
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:32,423
What's with the sign?

437
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,406
We're entering the Buddha.

438
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,809
Hey, what's
the cover charge?

439
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,616
- I'm gonna have to search...
- It's all right.
- I cleared it with the boss.

440
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:47,560
- I know. We still have to search him.
- I said I cleared it.

441
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,482
Step back.
Sorry, man.

442
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:52,425
You wanna tell me
what it is you want?

443
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:56,309
It's okay.
A trade.

444
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,213
I'll bring you Eddie Wang
if you'll take him out of Hong Kong.

445
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,957
What are you, a comedian?
Do you think Eddie Wang is worth all of that?

446
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,839
- All right.
- You gotta show me some more.

447
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,821
It's okay.

448
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,872
It's the Green Flame Project,
1989.

449
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:20,535
The soviets were years from completing it.
They must've finished it.

450
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,957
See that battery
your friend is carrying around out there?

451
00:40:23,017 --> 00:40:26,421
That's not a battery.
That's a state-of-the-art explosive device...

452
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:28,683
Equal to a half a stick
of dynamite.

453
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:32,467
If he knew it was a nanobomb, he wouldn't
be carrying it around like a cough drop.

454
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,870
Once they've achieved that level
of miniaturization, Harry,

455
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,073
- They could target anywhere they want.
- They're already there.

456
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:42,738
They have a remote-control
detonation device, probably microwave.

457
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:45,962
They're gonna put these bombs
into clock radios,

458
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,924
stereos, microwaves,

459
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:50,346
cel phones,
even children's toys.

460
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:53,450
And once this stuff
gets shipped,

461
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,413
a lot of innocent people gonna
be in a lot of grave danger.

462
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:04,702
What about Eddie?
What do you want me to do about Eddie?

463
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,565
Bring Eddie in.
You tell him I'll protect him.

464
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:10,007
He might know
something.

465
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,816
Thanks, man.
So, you're a spy, huh?

466
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:21,259
I was an intelligence analyst.
Anything I heard of?

467
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:24,623
- Wait, wait, wait!
- From Eddie.
- Heard of the gulf war?

468
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:28,567
- What the hell is that?
- It's a message from Eddie.
I know where he is.

469
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,132
Where the hell are we?

470
00:41:33,212 --> 00:41:35,995
It's a Fruit Market.

471
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:40,340
Johansson would love this place.
I hope he keeps his word.

472
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:45,085
Shouldn't we be leaving
a trail of bread crumbs or something?

473
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,717
He said he still can.

474
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,163
My mother always loved
that record.

475
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:06,688
You're listening to melodrama
for some reason? Huh?

476
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,395
Bam!

477
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,143
I found the record in papa's things.
You can take it.

478
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:25,808
We raided a factory
last night, Eddie.

479
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:28,991
- Why?
- You were knocking off our jeans.

480
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:32,515
Come on, Ray.
You're more than adopted. You're family.

481
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:37,040
Be a buddy, and Tommy's my bud.
Right, Tommy?

482
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,202
- Ah, ah.
- Buddies like to play, right?

483
00:42:39,262 --> 00:42:43,587
Those jeans are the tip of the iceberg.
Do you know what you did?

484
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,171
Who set you up?
Huh? Tell me.

485
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:53,297
Look, you won't like it.
It was Skinny.

486
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:57,201
When he brought these russians to me,
it seemed like a sweet deal.

487
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,123
- Skinny?
- Yes!

488
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:02,227
I provide them with knockoff toys,
toasters, whatever.

489
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:04,629
They do some modifications.
I ship them.

490
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,492
This is obviously
between you two, so if you can aim at him...

491
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,534
when I found out
what they really were,

492
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:13,278
- I shipped them right to the bottom of the sea!
- They were nanobombs!

493
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:17,843
- You know?
- Tommy's C.I.A.

494
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:25,952
The little dweeb is C.I.A.?
Good cover. Good.

495
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:30,777
I don't know how much longer.
Ray keeps telling everyone. Right, Ray?

496
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:35,742
Eddie,
I made a deal for you.

497
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:40,467
They're going to help you go
somewhere safe.

498
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:42,970
I promise.

499
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,853
That's what Skinny told me...
that he'd help.

500
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:50,498
But I'm gonna help myself. I've got something
for you in the safe. Hold on.

501
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:55,043
This is the biggest thing to hit Hong Kong
since typhoon hattie. Better than money!

502
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:57,986
Watch him. Come on.
I was gonna sell it to the highest bidder:

503
00:43:58,046 --> 00:43:59,908
The french, germans
or beijing.

504
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:02,331
But family is family.

505
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:26,917
Eddie!
Damn it!

506
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,464
Ray.

507
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:38,629
We gotta run.

508
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,654
- Don't you know the way out of here?
- I have no idea!

509
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:07,019
Ow. Oh.

510
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:11,304
Don't they have
bananas here?

511
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:30,985
Ow! God,
I hate this fruit!

512
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,582
Shit!

513
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:30,512
Fuck!

514
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:24,850
It's me.
A V.C.R.?

515
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,233
Surveillance tape. Anyone who's been in
and out of this place is on it.

516
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:34,160
Move!

517
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,484
Stop playing around.
Come on.

518
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,595
Let's go.

519
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:10,078
Hula, hula, hula, hula.

520
00:49:10,138 --> 00:49:12,600
Hula, hula, hula, hula.

521
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:15,303
I'm gonna find a place
around here to collapse.

522
00:49:15,363 --> 00:49:18,687
- Great. Wait for me in the office.
- All right.

523
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,104
- Let's get rid of this shit.
We're running out of time.
- Okay.

524
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:40,030
Hey, Skinny!

525
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,574
- You better run, Skinny! They're coming after you!
- Hamaa!

526
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:49,059
Gwei-lo! You're a dead man!
You killed Eddie!

527
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,544
The russians did it.
The people you got Eddie involved with.

528
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:55,626
You're a lousy liar, Marcus.

529
00:49:55,686 --> 00:49:57,668
I didn't get Eddie involved
with any russians.

530
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,291
- Then who was he hiding from?
- Who knows?

531
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:02,273
You were with him
when he was executed.

532
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:05,857
- Executed?
- Executed.

533
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,360
Why?

534
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,904
Why did you say "executed"?

535
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:19,535
- You're gonna tell me everything.
- Go to hell, Ray.

536
00:51:44,462 --> 00:51:46,804
Stop, Ray, stop!

537
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,828
Oh, God.

538
00:51:49,908 --> 00:51:52,230
- You're not really gonna do this?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:18,218
You bet on both sides.
Right, Skinny?

540
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:20,180
You bastard.
Tell me!

541
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:24,625
That was a Hong Kong love song,

542
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:26,507
and we hope to put President Jiang Zemin
and Prince Charles...

543
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:29,370
In a cuddly mood
for tonight's handover ceremony.

544
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,934
We'll have the news in five with an update
on the explosion at the Kowloon Fruit Market.

545
00:52:33,014 --> 00:52:35,977
But first, here's another
romantic song.

546
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:39,721
This time,
from the U.S. Of A.

547
00:52:51,473 --> 00:52:53,515
Ah!

548
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,641
What happened to you?

549
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:02,265
- Some explosion.
- At the Fruit Market? The one on the news?

550
00:53:02,325 --> 00:53:04,147
- Yeah. Easy, easy.
- Look at you.

551
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:06,069
You're bleeding. We gotta get you
to a hospital.

552
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:08,752
- No. No hospitals.
- We have to get you to a hospital.

553
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,674
Look at this. There's blood.
Ouch!

554
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:12,636
Shit.

555
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,901
- We need to get cleaned up.
- Yeah.

556
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:21,866
You know, sometimes you're in such shock,
you don't realize you've been hurt.

557
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:25,870
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
- So.

558
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,394
- Easy, easy, easy.
- What were you doing in a place like that anyway?

559
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,739
- You know, Ray has some contacts.
- What kind of contacts?

560
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:37,742
A friend, a buddy.

561
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:40,345
He blew up, but you know,
shit happens.

562
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:42,508
Easy.

563
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,712
- Oh.
- Got it?

564
00:53:46,772 --> 00:53:49,215
Eddie knew
about the bombs, huh?

565
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:51,117
That's why you
killed him, huh?

566
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:53,659
I don't know what you're
talking about. Eddie was like a brother to me.

567
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:56,062
Yeah,
like a Menendez brother.

568
00:53:56,122 --> 00:54:00,367
If I'm right, this tape will prove
you booby-trapped Eddie's safe.

569
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,951
You piece of shit.
You killed him.

570
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:08,495
Hey, don't go anywhere, okay?

571
00:54:08,575 --> 00:54:10,798
We're gonna have a movie night,
make some popcorn, watch this.

572
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:13,240
You sit, be comfortable.
We'll be back.

573
00:54:16,143 --> 00:54:17,885
Hold on.
Let me find it.

574
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:20,248
Wait a minute.
Stop it there.

575
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:26,494
Son of a bitch.
Who is that?

576
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:31,520
Karen, V-SIX exec.
I don't believe this.

577
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,324
Hendricks is in danger. You gotta go after him.
He's walking into a trap.

578
00:54:35,384 --> 00:54:37,326
I'll go talk
to Skinny.

579
00:54:57,507 --> 00:55:00,350
Hot, hot.

580
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:26,018
Knockoffs.
Jesus.

581
00:55:32,004 --> 00:55:36,028
You and Marcus have been acting really
strange lately. Sure you told me everything?

582
00:55:36,088 --> 00:55:40,773
- We were trying to decide what
we were gonna have for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,036
And I said,
"how about Szechwan?"

584
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:45,558
And, uh,
let the machine get that.

585
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:48,381
And he said, "how about cantonese?"
and we already had cantonese.

586
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:50,263
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well,

587
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:53,347
I was trying to decide
what wine we should order.

588
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:56,830
Oh, I like this.

589
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:59,393
I'm into this.

590
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:03,317
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

591
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:07,161
Back when you got that
fake identity from the C.I.A.

592
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:10,625
We're gonna play a little game, Hendricks.
It's called "20 questions."

593
00:56:10,685 --> 00:56:13,528
Question number one:
If that's even your real name,

594
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,590
are you working alone,
or are there more of you?

595
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:20,936
Hey. Hey.

596
00:56:20,996 --> 00:56:23,799
Tommy, she saw Eddie
before we did.

597
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:27,002
She's a bigger
knockoff than us.

598
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:33,730
Watch your step, Ray!

599
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:40,257
- Are you sure?
- She was on the tape.

600
00:56:59,037 --> 00:57:02,120
I was never
into threesomes.

601
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:07,746
I got her. I got her.
Right there. Right there.

602
00:57:07,806 --> 00:57:09,668
What do we do
with her?

603
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:11,750
We take her in to see
the chief right now.

604
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,493
- Johansson's dead!
- What?

605
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:17,917
The russians killed him,
and Skinny too.

606
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:22,201
You better talk now, bitch,
or I'll blow your head off. Talk! Right now!

607
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,924
Look into my pants.

608
00:57:25,004 --> 00:57:27,166
Go ahead. Come on.
You were pretty eager five minutes ago,

609
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,129
you little shit!

610
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:32,893
Just do it.

611
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:34,975
In the back!

612
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:45,706
C.I.A.?

613
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:48,429
Bullshit.
It's a fake, Tommy.

614
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:50,852
- Just like her.
- No, it's real. Check it.

615
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:03,045
It's good.

616
00:58:05,968 --> 00:58:08,230
I'm sorry for what I said
in the other room,

617
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:11,293
but those handcuffs were really biting
into my wrists, you know?

618
00:58:11,373 --> 00:58:13,456
I should've blown your head off
and set you up.

619
00:58:13,516 --> 00:58:15,438
Yeah?
Why the jeans act?

620
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:18,601
Langley suspected there was
a mole in Hendricks' division.

621
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,484
I'm here to find out
who it is.

622
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:24,808
I have an emergency contact, but there's no way
I can trust the guy.

623
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:29,293
No! There's a special security unit attached
to the american V.I.P.S. for a handover.

624
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:31,815
I think
they can help us.

625
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,599
The american delegation is led
by Vice President Al Gore...

626
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,342
Who is a champion of trade
with Hong Kong.

627
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:41,706
Vice President Gore is also
expected to meet...

628
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:45,350
With the commercial attaches
of the incoming administration.

629
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:49,134
You can't go like that.
You've gotta change.

630
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:51,877
- Formal or casual?
- Let's go!

631
00:58:51,937 --> 00:58:54,860
I'll bring the van.
I'll bring the van around.

632
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:06,112
Back to news of the handover.

633
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:09,716
The Prince of Wales is coming
down the britannia now.

634
00:59:09,776 --> 00:59:12,498
The last time a British royal
will visit a British Hong Kong.

635
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:19,306
He will be taking a short walk to H.M.S.
Tamar, the British Naval Base,

636
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:23,690
which will be handed over to their counterparts
of the People's Republic of China...

637
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,652
In a few hours' time.

638
00:59:29,256 --> 00:59:32,900
Prince Charles
will be attending...

639
00:59:39,988 --> 00:59:44,613
over 300 groups from all walks of life
and all corners of Hong Kong...

640
00:59:44,693 --> 00:59:47,636
will take part
in the two-hour ceremony.

641
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:53,642
Holy fucking shit.
The pockets of our jeans.

642
00:59:53,702 --> 00:59:56,085
The V-SIX logo.
The V-SIX logo.

643
01:00:01,551 --> 01:00:03,893
Shipping.

644
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,239
Shipping.

645
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:55,568
Boom.

646
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,344
Meanwhile, at government house,
another historic moment...

647
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:13,587
With the last British Governor,
Chris Patten, in attendance.

648
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,731
The British flag is being
lowered for the last time.

649
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,413
After Eddie dumped
the knockoffs in the sea,

650
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:21,355
the russians
switched to our jeans.

651
01:01:21,436 --> 01:01:25,660
Oh, so they're into fashion now,
and your business is booming.

652
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,602
You know
where you're going?

653
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:31,386
The computer says they're shipping
the jeans tonight.

654
01:01:38,354 --> 01:01:41,397
- You're never gonna get away with this.
- Shut up!

655
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:44,140
- They're already getting away with it.
- I know.

656
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,542
I'm trying
to mind-fuck them.

657
01:01:46,622 --> 01:01:48,464
On the placement test
at langley,

658
01:01:48,524 --> 01:01:50,346
I was off the chart
on verbal skills.

659
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:52,348
Could I die alone,
please?

660
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:58,515
Lucky for some,
it's the handover tonight.

661
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:01,458
There's only one way
out of Hong Kong by sea.

662
01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:04,622
Oh, yeah? If we hurry up,
we can intercept them.

663
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:06,924
And by the way,
do you know how to swim?

664
01:02:10,388 --> 01:02:14,772
Electronics are amazing, huh?
Three months old, already it's obsolete.

665
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:18,797
Best part of microchips,
you get mega bucks.

666
01:02:18,877 --> 01:02:21,780
Small as a cel phone,

667
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,603
but this little kukla,
it can do the job.

668
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:26,545
Boom.

669
01:02:31,991 --> 01:02:35,775
We already told everybody:
The F.B.I., the mossad,

670
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,278
- Shut up!
- Surete, Barnaby Jones.

671
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,544
Now you will eat these, turn green in a flash.
It's better than a diet pill.

672
01:02:45,685 --> 01:02:47,827
Two of these, you lose
your appetite completely.

673
01:02:47,908 --> 01:02:50,070
In fact, you will lose you
completely.

674
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:54,194
Or maybe
you will drink this.

675
01:02:57,237 --> 01:02:59,220
Wanna drink this, baby?

676
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,523
Let's talk about this. I wanna talk.
I got some information.

677
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,725
- No, you don't wanna do that.
- You like it?

678
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:07,969
You want more?
I give you more.

679
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:12,213
I open your mouth.
I open it wide open this time.

680
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:26,368
Way to go, Harry!
Nice shot!

681
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:29,151
Hey, you even left a few alive to interrogate.
Now come on untie me!

682
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:31,574
Harry!
Come on, man!

683
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:38,101
Congratulations.

684
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,825
You're giving the cigar
to the wrong guy, Harry.

685
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,889
You didn't keep them alive
for interrogation.

686
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:48,612
You just eliminated a partner
you didn't need anymore.

687
01:03:48,672 --> 01:03:52,156
Just like you did
with Skinny.

688
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:24,310
Washington thought it might be someone
in our organization, but never you, Johansson.

689
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,853
After 20 years, why?

690
01:04:26,913 --> 01:04:28,835
Entrepreneurship, babycakes.

691
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:33,119
Now once we have our little baby bombs
all over the U.S.,

692
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,284
There's gonna be a monthly satellite bill that
would make H.B.O. green with envy.

693
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:39,386
$100 billion a month.

694
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:43,991
And if they don't pay, we send the detonation
signal, and Good-Bye, Yellow Brick Road.

695
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:49,156
"Good-Bye, Yellow Brick Road"? You better buy
some new cd's, Harry, it's pathetic.

696
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:30,080
Shoot 'em.

697
01:05:43,594 --> 01:05:45,156
Whoa!

698
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:53,765
What the hell was that?
Go find out!

699
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:04,937
Toss it!

700
01:06:04,997 --> 01:06:07,099
Good! Yes!

701
01:07:07,404 --> 01:07:09,225
Sir. A mobile unit has picked up
a signal.

702
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:11,688
There's an
unauthorized intrusion.

703
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:18,335
Sir.

704
01:07:18,415 --> 01:07:21,218
- Any change?
- No, ma'am. Still incoming.

705
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,120
Footprint
of cargo vessel, sir.

706
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,102
No friend or foe beacon.

707
01:07:25,162 --> 01:07:29,006
She already passed the first line of buoys.
There goes the second.

708
01:07:29,067 --> 01:07:31,529
The next line's a deadline.
That's exactly what it means.

709
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,671
Attention all air units.

710
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,074
Attention all air units.

711
01:07:36,134 --> 01:07:39,938
This is guardian.
Proceed to shipping warning lane...

712
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,221
And intercept
approaching vessel.

713
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:46,125
- Use whatever force is necessary.
- Roger.

714
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,853
Attention cargo vessel.

715
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:35,397
- Attention cargo vessel.
- Pouncer!

716
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:37,359
Report in.
What's going on?

717
01:08:37,419 --> 01:08:41,323
Guardian, we have visual. The vessel is
under power but seems to be drifting.

718
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:44,587
Approaching final deadline.
E.T.A., one minute.

719
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,389
Pouncer,

720
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:49,832
that vessel must not...
repeat, must not...

721
01:08:49,913 --> 01:08:51,815
cross that deadline.

722
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:56,520
If it does, execute with extreme prejudice.
Do you copy?

723
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,443
We copy, guardian.
Extreme prejudice. Over.

724
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:02,506
You heard him, boys.
Activate and arm weapon systems.

725
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:05,129
Weapon systems are active.
Activating now.

726
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,112
Attention, cargo vessel.

727
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:11,175
Attention, cargo vessel.

728
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:16,301
This is a restricted area.
If you do not change course, we will fire on you.

729
01:09:17,462 --> 01:09:21,786
Do you read?
Cargo vessel, do you read?

730
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:30,676
Attention, cargo vessel.
This is a restricted area.

731
01:09:30,736 --> 01:09:33,679
If you do not change course,
we will fire on you.

732
01:09:50,717 --> 01:09:55,362
Attention, barge 28.
You will be over the deadline in ten seconds.

733
01:09:55,422 --> 01:09:59,106
- You must change course or we will open fire.
- Locked on target.

734
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:02,650
Fire on my command.
Steady.

735
01:10:06,754 --> 01:10:10,158
- Steady. Five,
- Come on.

736
01:10:10,218 --> 01:10:14,122
Four, three, two...

737
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:16,104
guardian, she's stopping.

738
01:10:16,164 --> 01:10:21,230
Vessel has stopped six meters from the deadline.
They appear to be turning back.

739
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:26,375
Sir, weapons are still hot.

740
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:31,681
Deactivate weapon system.
Please confirm. Deactivate weapon system.

741
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,724
Orders confirmed.
Return to base and await further orders.

742
01:10:34,784 --> 01:10:37,167
Roger, wing commander.
Returning to base.

743
01:10:37,227 --> 01:10:39,869
Whew!
That was a close one.

744
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:21,157
Come on.
Come on!

745
01:12:29,486 --> 01:12:32,469
Come on. Come on.

746
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:37,174
Move your asses up to the tower.
You hear me? Go.

747
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:29,590
Damn it!

748
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,164
We are under heavy fire.
We should move now, sir.

749
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:03,126
See if it's clear.

750
01:14:03,186 --> 01:14:06,990
Go!

751
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:15,430
Oh!

752
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:37,694
Oh, shoot.
It's gonna blow!

753
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:40,257
Come on! Let's go!
It's gonna blow!

754
01:17:47,424 --> 01:17:49,606
Come on, let's go! Start the engine!
Hurry up!

755
01:17:56,774 --> 01:17:59,617
We're all gonna die.
I'm doing my best!

756
01:18:16,515 --> 01:18:19,939
Come on. Got it.
We got it.

757
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,072
Come on! Come on!

758
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:20,223
Over here!

759
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:25,128
Are you okay?

760
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,672
- You all right?
- Yeah.

761
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:33,137
- What happened?
- I smoked his fat ass like a roman candle.

762
01:19:35,139 --> 01:19:38,082
Look.
This is his detonator.

763
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:45,129
What are you looking for?

764
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:47,592
Johansson.

765
01:19:51,276 --> 01:19:53,258
Victoria Harbor lights up...

766
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:57,583
With the first fireworks starting just a few hours
before the official handover,

767
01:19:57,643 --> 01:20:00,686
kicking off a two-day
fireworks extravaganza...

768
01:20:00,746 --> 01:20:05,491
Where over $100 million
will literally go up in smoke.

769
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:09,255
The use of fireworks, traditionally a symbol
of celebration,

770
01:20:09,315 --> 01:20:12,579
is particularly meaningful
in these two nights...

771
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:17,644
When the world watches as Hong Kong
puts on its biggest ever fireworks to welcome...

772
01:20:17,704 --> 01:20:20,587
they found explosives
in our jeans.

773
01:20:20,647 --> 01:20:23,570
That's not good.
People don't want explosives in their jeans.

774
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:26,053
Hey, some people do,
you know?

775
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:27,975
Check this out.

776
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:30,818
Are you crazy?
That's evidence.

777
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:32,740
I've been doing
some research, Ray.

778
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,944
The average american home
has 3.57 remote controls.

779
01:20:37,005 --> 01:20:40,548
What if you had one that did everything?
I'm not just talking the V.C.R., the TV.

780
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,991
I'm talking the jacuzzi,
sprinkler system.

781
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:46,294
The police estimate that there
are over one million people...

782
01:20:46,354 --> 01:20:48,176
On both sides
of the harbor tonight.

783
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:52,561
- You-you-you turn that thing,
and the-the garage opens up.
- Oh, yeah?

784
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,483
It-it opens.

785
01:20:54,543 --> 01:20:56,625
Sometime just before
12:00 midnight,

786
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,909
each and everyone in the royal
Hong Kong police force...

787
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:02,191
Must find
the time and place...

788
01:21:07,637 --> 01:21:13,203
forget it. We don't know anything about
electronics. Let's stick to what we know.

789
01:21:13,263 --> 01:21:15,125
The following
is a special report.

790
01:21:15,185 --> 01:21:18,228
A loud explosion was witnessed
in the Kowloon area this evening,

791
01:21:18,288 --> 01:21:20,311
shortly after
the fireworks began.

792
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:23,334
Spectators noted green flames
from the explosion.

793
01:21:23,414 --> 01:21:27,598
Authorities will not confirm whether the explosion
was part of the fireworks show.

794
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:30,642
- Earlier this evening, a similar
explosion with green flames...
- What do you know?

795
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:34,065
Massage parlors,
gambling, booze.

796
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:37,529
- Yeah.
- That's not bad.

797
01:21:37,589 --> 01:21:39,751
If I had a lot of money...
a lot of money...

798
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:41,713
I'd start my own
football league.

799
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:45,357
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Only women players.

800
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:47,920
- Why?
- And I'd be the only guy.

801
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,840
Fantastic. No action movie would be
complete without sweat.

802
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:56,185
 I confess that this is
really not my song 

803
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,328
 I bought it in Hong Kong 

804
01:21:59,388 --> 01:22:01,490
 it's a knockoff 

805
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:06,035
 I confess that this is
really not my voice 

806
01:22:06,115 --> 01:22:11,059
 although I had a choice
it's a knockoff 

807
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:13,522
 so close 

808
01:22:13,602 --> 01:22:15,984
 to real 

809
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,426
 the look 

810
01:22:18,486 --> 01:22:20,949
 the feel 

811
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:23,351
 so close 

812
01:22:23,411 --> 01:22:25,873
 and yet 

813
01:22:25,953 --> 01:22:28,416
 the paint's 

814
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:31,058
 still wet 

815
01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:36,083
 you keep thinkin' that
you're really holdin' hands 

816
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:39,286
 sorry, that's no hand 

817
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:41,188
 it's a knockoff 

818
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:46,133
 just my luck that I would
look into your eyes 

819
01:22:46,213 --> 01:22:50,717
 then I realized
they were knockoffs 

820
01:22:50,777 --> 01:22:53,239
 so close 

821
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:55,542
 to real 

822
01:22:55,622 --> 01:22:59,646
 the look, the feel 

823
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:03,269
 so close 

824
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:05,471
 and yet 

825
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:08,094
 the paint's 

826
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:10,996
 still wet 

827
01:23:11,076 --> 01:23:14,900
closed-captioned by

828
01:23:30,535 --> 01:23:32,837

01:23:32,897 --> 01:23:35,400

01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,762

01:23:40,284 --> 01:23:42,646

01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:45,209

 still wet 

836
01:23:50,594 --> 01:23:55,318
 I can guess that though
you really wear it well 

837
01:23:55,399 --> 01:23:58,522
 once you wear it well 

838
01:23:58,602 --> 01:24:00,443
 it's a knockoff 

839
01:24:00,523 --> 01:24:05,248
 I'm the renoir
you see hangin' on the wall 

840
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:10,213

 it's a knockoff
