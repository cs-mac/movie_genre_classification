1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:06,881
This is Captain Moreti to unit five.

2
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:11,056
Pick up Brannigan. Use a forklift
if you have to, but get him.

3
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:15,102
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.

4
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:18,424
Brannigan.
Cream sports. You know the licence.

5
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:45,871
- Knock, knock.
- Breaking and entering's against the law.

6
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:48,954
I rang. You didn't answer.

7
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,219
I was working.

8
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,847
Doing your own engraving now?

9
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:56,823
Hey! Wouldn't know
old Abe without his mole.

10
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:59,546
Where's Larkin?

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:06,630
No serial number, no prints,
can't be traced...

12
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,577
Nobody'll know who dumped you.

13
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:12,221
I don't spook, Brannigan.

14
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,925
All right.

15
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:20,259
The government wants Larkin for taxes.
Chicago police want him for extortion.

16
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:24,896
Cut out the dedicated-cop act. Everybody
in this town knows you want Larkin.

17
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:28,098
And the grand jury finally indicts him
and he disappears.

18
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:32,710
And I'll give you five seconds
to tell me where. You count.

19
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,618
Hey, wait a minute. Wait, OK.

20
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,816
- He left town.
- How?

21
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,823
- I don't know.
- Where?

22
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,280
I don't know. No, wait a minute.
I don't know. You gota believe me.

23
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,538
All right. Cool it.

24
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:59,152
You must be getin' old, Angell,
tryin' to push second-rate paper like this.

25
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,943
Manny, this is Warehouse 17, Polk Street.

26
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,771
- I got a paperhanger.
- Turn around, big man.

27
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,220
- Angell, you're a real bush-leaguer.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,661
- Know somethin'? I don't think it's loaded.
- You dirty, lousy Mick!

29
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:17,744
You got no rules! You got no...

30
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:21,711
Jim? Jim, are you all right?

31
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:25,200
Are you all right, Jim?

32
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,224
Moretti's steaming. You got the whole
Chicago PD looking for you.

33
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,844
- Nice to be wanted.
- You're wanted all right.

34
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:37,325
- There's an APB out on you.
- Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.

35
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,196
There's a contract out on you.

36
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,119
Try explaining that to your parole officer.

37
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,011
Larkin's put up 25 Gs
to get you knocked off.

38
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:51,568
You're gonna be walking down the street,
or sleeping, or siting on the can,

39
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,675
and the next minute,
Brannigan, you are dead!

40
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:56,903
You lousy Mick, you!

41
00:04:56,904 --> 00:05:11,615
Brannigan.

42
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,306
He's on the inside, far end of 17.

43
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:15,891
Not him.

44
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,889
Who?

45
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,167
You. The captain wants to see you. Now.

46
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:28,430
- You got a warrant?
- I don't need a warrant, Jim.

47
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,002
- You're a public menace.
- All right.

48
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:33,558
- Get in.
- That's my car.

49
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,438
Joe'll bring your car.

50
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:41,756
Careful of the paint job.

51
00:05:41,756 --> 00:06:39,028
British Airways flight 570
nonstop 747 to London

52
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,863
will depart from the B concourse.

53
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,563
Ah, you made it.

54
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:49,391
All right, Captain. You goin' someplace?

55
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,306
No, Lieutenant.

56
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:53,723
- You are.
- I am?

57
00:06:53,723 --> 00:07:03,716
- What is this, Moreti?
- Passport, airline ticket, 500 expenses.

58
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:07,938
- I packed a bag for you.
- That is my bag.

59
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:11,132
I put everything in that was clean.
Here, don't catch cold.

60
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,250
You're gonna make somebody
a nice litle wife.

61
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,568
- I'm doin' you a favour, Jim.
- Yeah.

62
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:22,491
- Ben Larkin got outa town.
- I know that.

63
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,438
- He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.
- London?

64
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,078
You got extradition papers.

65
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:31,826
Miss Allen? I thought you might like
to bring him back and kick him in a cell.

66
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,526
- Miss Allen, Lieutenant Brannigan.
- Hi.

67
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:36,469
- She'll find a seat for you.
- Hi.

68
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,515
Just follow me, Lieutenant.

69
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:40,307
Anywhere.

70
00:07:40,307 --> 00:08:51,239
Nice day.

71
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:56,609
- Want to walk, Mel?
- All right. You're on.

72
00:08:56,609 --> 00:09:11,846
By the right!

73
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:17,671
Keep up there!

74
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:25,264
First order of business -
call off the wolves.

75
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,307
Even the elevator man looks
like he's from Scotland Yard.

76
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:30,265
It may not be as simple as that.

77
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,216
What broke loose?

78
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:35,618
The word was in the street, Ben.

79
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,477
Somebody talked, somebody listened.

80
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:44,293
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over
with extradition papers and handcuffs.

81
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,527
He'll be at Heathrow any time now.

82
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:50,554
I told you I wanted
that Irish bastard wasted.

83
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:55,708
It's being taken care of, Ben.
That won't help your extradition problem.

84
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,323
There'll only be a dozen cops
on the next flight with more papers.

85
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:04,183
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.
I like the women, the clubs, the action.

86
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:08,022
- I always did.
- Ben, please. Listen to what I worked out.

87
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,842
Now, in Devon,

88
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:17,511
at an airport nobody's used for years,
I've got a pilot who'll take you to Ireland

89
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:20,123
where you'll skip
immigration and customs.

90
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:23,867
Then you'll head on south
to Ecuador, Venezuela...

91
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:29,245
Oh, that's just great. I end up eating
bananas, listening to my arteries harden.

92
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:35,316
Ben... I'm talking to you as your lawyer,
your friend, not a tour guide.

93
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:40,303
The Cook County grand jury
can't touch you down there.

94
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:47,547
Look, the boys'll take care of you.

95
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,498
They have to. They've got
more skeletons than most graveyards.

96
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:55,369
- And you know what closets they hang in.
- Fields,

97
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:59,528
we didn't build this organisation by
running the grand juries to save our hides.

98
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,594
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.

99
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,139
To the boys, you're still number one.

100
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,847
They'll see that you live like a king.

101
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:11,196
They'll use me as a conduit.

102
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:15,682
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland,
launder it in Panama,

103
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:20,382
and ship it to you by bank drafts
or leters of credit, whichever you prefer.

104
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,145
That's good. That's good.

105
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:29,000
You know, Mel, those bananas
will taste a hell of a lot beter

106
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,502
when I know Brannigan's lying
in some guter.

107
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:33,429
It's done.

108
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:38,432
- Who you got?
- Gorman. We used him before.

109
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,981
Good. He's a pro.

110
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:45,004
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.

111
00:11:45,004 --> 00:12:18,564
British Airways flight number BA570
from Chicago is now arriving at gate two.

112
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,000
Is flight 570 in yet?

113
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
- It's just arrived.
- Could you make the announcement?

114
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes, of course.

115
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,962
- Have a nice stay.
- Thank you.

116
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:35,961
Would Mr James Brannigan,
British Airways passenger from Chicago,

117
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:38,988
please report to the British Airways
information desk?

118
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:42,692
James Brannigan, British Airways
information desk, please.

119
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:46,069
How long are you expecting
to be with us, Mr Gorman?

120
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:54,117
- Mr Gorman?
- Oh, sorry. A week.

121
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:57,096
Business or pleasure, sir?

122
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,991
Strictly pleasure.

123
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:18,221
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Yes? How did you know?

124
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:22,451
Headquarters told me to look for someone
slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.

125
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,175
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher.
Scotland Yard.

126
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,369
They've made real improvements
since I was last here.

127
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,894
Well, thank you. This way, sir.

128
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,662
Where's my man?
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.

129
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,931
Oh, Commander Swann
is handling the extradition.

130
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:41,998
- And the return ticket reservations?
- Sir Charles has taken care of that.

131
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:44,826
- He's expecting you for lunch at his club.
- Sir Charles?

132
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,669
Sir Charles?

133
00:13:47,669 --> 00:14:00,053
I've been assigned as your driver,
and to take care of you while you're here.

134
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:05,271
- To keep an eye on me, you mean.
- Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.

135
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:08,657
Anyway, it'll make a nice change
from the vice squad.

136
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:54,244
- All clear, sir.
- Right.

137
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:59,399
Mel...

138
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,713
I'm the one that's gonna take the heat.
Now, nothing can screw up.

139
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,409
Stay cool, Ben.

140
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:09,475
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.

141
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:18,313
- Good morning, Mr Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.

142
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:36,825
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.

143
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:40,776
Larkin's here.

144
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:46,983
Get me a box
at the dog races tonight, Gates.

145
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:49,157
Oh, yeah.

146
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:55,475
Call Jimmy-the-Bet and tell him
to put L400 on Triple Cross.

147
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,801
Ready when you are, Mr Larkin.

148
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,353
Good.

149
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:07,018
You've been to England before, sir?

150
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:10,085
That's right, Miss Thatcher -
during the war.

151
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:14,570
I expect you'll find London's changed
quite a bit, but it's basically the same.

152
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,458
It's still a very beautiful city.

153
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,508
If there are any places
you'd like to revisit...

154
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:25,037
Right now what I'd like is eight hours of
sleep, a shower and a change of clothes.

155
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:28,382
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.

156
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,237
Yes, sir.

157
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:31,479
Oh.

158
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:35,406
If I sound like a bear cub
with a toothache, it's just...

159
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:38,712
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.

160
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:39,945
Huh?

161
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:43,426
He said there were three things
wrong with Yanks.

162
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,863
- Yeah?
- Overpaid, oversexed...

163
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,758
and over here.

164
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,777
I really walked into that one.

165
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,684
And deserved it. I'm sorry.

166
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:55,642
Might we start again, sir?

167
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:58,829
Why? We're doing fine.

168
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:04,103
I was just thinking - can I call you Jenny?

169
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,575
Of course.

170
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:10,053
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.

171
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:10,911
Whoo!

172
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,126
She used to lend me money
when I was broke.

173
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:20,352
Did she contribute
any other... philanthropies?

174
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:23,756
We were friends.

175
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:26,095
Good friends.

176
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:31,680
Damn good friends.

177
00:17:31,680 --> 00:18:25,843
- All right, Mr Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.

178
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:32,154
Would you mind lying down,
facing this way?

179
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,955
- All right.
- And relax.

180
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:43,000
Excuse me, Captain. I've got
a steam cabinet out there for delivery.

181
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, the pool's down there, but you'll
have to go outside. I'll show you the way.

182
00:18:46,359 --> 00:19:12,642
Excuse me, Tom. There's a delivery.

183
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,590
What? I don't know
anything about a delivery.

184
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,198
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order. Where shall we drop it?

185
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:21,507
You'd beter put it out there
through the open door.

186
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:26,000
Grand Central Station.

187
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:35,515
Hey, muscles. It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?

188
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,944
Excuse me a moment, Mr Larkin.

189
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:44,815
Now, what's all this?

190
00:19:44,816 --> 00:20:13,479
That's great.

191
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,916
Oh, you like that, do you?

192
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:36,605
Yeah. Good.

193
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,281
How do you like that?

194
00:20:39,281 --> 00:21:31,874
Morning, sir.

195
00:21:31,874 --> 00:22:07,642
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.

196
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:24,155
- See you later, sir.
- Aren't you joining us?

197
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:27,261
If I walked in I'd cause
a dozen heart atacks.

198
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:30,567
It's a men's club - rules strictly enforced.

199
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,377
Too bad.

200
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:37,999
Sir?

201
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:42,022
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan.
To see Commander Swann.

202
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:45,822
Yes, that'll be Sir Charles.
He's in the lounge bar, upstairs.

203
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,422
- Thank you.
- Begging your pardon, sir...

204
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:53,349
I'm sorry, Mr Brannigan. It's a club rule.

205
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,257
Fine.

206
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:59,219
Strictly enforced, I presume.

207
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:29,377
And that was the last I saw of her.

208
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:35,815
Excuse me.

209
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:40,125
Lieutenant Brannigan? Charles Swann.

210
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,151
- Pleasant flight?
- Just long.

211
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:47,955
- Would you like a glass of sherry?
- Actually, I'd like a boilermaker.

212
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:53,668
That's whisky - neat, you'd say -
and a beer chaser, cold, if you can find it.

213
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,025
- Certainly, sir.
- I think we can manage that.

214
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:57,649
A good old Polish drink.

215
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,839
Where do we pick up this Larkin?

216
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,196
Well, he's under surveillance.

217
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:06,403
Surveillance? You come
to the States for a prisoner,

218
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,943
we'd have him standing by
handcuffed at the airport.

219
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:14,512
Yes, but under our judicial system
Mr Larkin has the right to apply for bail.

220
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:17,507
Well, unfortunately,
we have the same law.

221
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:21,729
- That's how we lost him.
- Rather careless, wasn't it?

222
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:24,660
You can rest assured
that won't happen here.

223
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,197
- Spot of lunch?
- Why not?

224
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:32,626
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.

225
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:42,268
- Should I call you Sir Charles?
- I think Swann'll do nicely, thank you.

226
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:46,132
I only use the "sir" for theatre tickets and
table reservations. May I lead the way?

227
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,266
Morning, sir.

228
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:53,229
Actually, the title is a military courtesy
granted to one of my ancient ancestors,

229
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,858
probably for holding
somebody's horse at a coronation.

230
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:57,760
- How's this?
- Thank you.

231
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,234
- No castles or booty?
- No, I'm afraid not.

232
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:04,555
But every Maundy Thursday,
for some reason,

233
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:07,518
I'm granted the inestimable privilege -
morning, Barker -

234
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:11,023
of dropping a sprig of myrtle
in the river Thames at Westminster.

235
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:15,141
- The Dover sole is excellent.
- Thank you. Dover sole?

236
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:17,355
Commander, it's my breakfast time.

237
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:21,649
I'd sure like two over easy,
some bacon, crisp, and a short stack.

238
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:27,011
Right. I think what my guest would like
is two eggs, lightly fried on either side,

239
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:30,962
a couple of rashers of bacon
and a modest portion of pancakes.

240
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,814
- Not too modest on the pancakes.
- Sir.

241
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:37,303
- And Dover sole for me, please.
- Thank you, sir.

242
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,616
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing
that particular item.

243
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:44,583
Well, the fella at the front desk
said I had to put it on.

244
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,761
Not the tie.

245
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,852
The .38 calibre Colt Diamondback.

246
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:55,616
Commander, I always wear this.

247
00:25:55,616 --> 00:26:01,305
I'm afraid it's placing you in violation of
British law and Scotland Yard regulations.

248
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:04,826
Well, it isn't in violation
of United States law,

249
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:09,136
and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations

250
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,552
which makes it obligatory.

251
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:14,934
Then I strongly urge you
to resist any temptation to use it.

252
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:20,288
Well, I don't think I'll be needing it in here.

253
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,299
Excuse me, Sir Charles.

254
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,178
A gentleman to see you at the door.

255
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:28,013
Excuse me.

256
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:55,429
Barker, bring the lieutenant a whisky
and a beer chaser, will you?

257
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:56,837
You mean a boilermaker, sir.

258
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:58,756
Make it two.

259
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:06,071
- What for?
- Mr Larkin has been kidnapped.

260
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:13,659
It can't happen here, huh?

261
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:22,926
Well, cheer up.

262
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:26,375
All we can lose is our jobs.

263
00:27:26,375 --> 00:28:52,220
Oh. Gorman?

264
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,246
Yeah.

265
00:28:53,246 --> 00:29:01,996
A friend said you had a package for me.

266
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:06,051
Two questions - from where and for what?

267
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,945
From Chicago, to hit something.

268
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:10,119
Right on, bucko.

269
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:20,694
Half now and half at ice time.

270
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,418
When he's on ice, you mean.

271
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:48,777
- A bit light.
- It's just my usual commission.

272
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:54,099
Off their end, not mine. Don't be difficult.

273
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:57,899
Why don't you stay awhile
and talk to Luana?

274
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,602
Hm?

275
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:04,295
Oh.

276
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:43,068
Nice and gentle, love. I'm not kinky.

277
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:45,465
You are what you're paid to be.

278
00:30:45,465 --> 00:31:00,933
This is all that Larkin
left behind at the athletic club.

279
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:03,808
We don't know
he was really snatched.

280
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:07,919
Of course not. But we do still have
that masseur unconscious in hospital.

281
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,364
It might be just an act.

282
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:14,283
I don't think that's an assumption
the Yard can afford to make.

283
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:18,473
If it was up to me I'd get some men
out thumpin' on the streets,

284
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:20,289
passing out some e pluribus unum.

285
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,196
That's what 90 per cent
of police work is today.

286
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:29,618
The murder rate in your country, I'm sure,
gives testimony to your superior methods.

287
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:32,764
Commander, I didn't come
over here to argue methods.

288
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:39,393
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing, and
I intend to use my best efforts to find him.

289
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:41,758
Without interfering
with the Yard, of course.

290
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,243
Oh, er, Lieutenant.

291
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:49,414
I am still a litle concerned
about a certain item you're wearing.

292
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,672
Oh, well, if that bothers you...

293
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:55,045
wear it in good health.

294
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,729
The old school tie.

295
00:31:57,729 --> 00:32:07,841
Well, guv, what do you think
of our friend Brannigan?

296
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,374
Well...

297
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:14,141
he's an American.

298
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:32,080
Sir Charles. Why would
a bona fide lord wanna be a cop?

299
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,948
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?

300
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:37,122
I don't know. Runs in the family.

301
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,328
But it stops right here. My son is a lawyer.

302
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,171
Uh-huh?

303
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:46,696
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.

304
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:52,018
Mollie? Do me a favour, will you?
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.

305
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:55,850
I don't know. About seven. Thanks.

306
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,119
Monkey wrench?

307
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,827
You mean a spanner?

308
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:04,348
Did I throw one in your social life?

309
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:06,083
Well, not quite.

310
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,389
Not that Richard is exactly
a paragon of patience.

311
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:15,923
Well, just blame it on your Yankee
slave-driver - who still hasn't eaten.

312
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:18,790
Would you mind grabbing a bite
before we house-hunt?

313
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,159
I wouldn't mind at all.

314
00:33:20,159 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you, Mrs Cooper.

315
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
- Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.
- Around nine?

316
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Fine, sir. Good night.

317
00:34:09,000 --> 00:35:42,539
Mr Lawyer, the next voice
you hear belongs to Ben Larkin.

318
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,306
You'd better listen.

319
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:48,321
Fields, I've been grabbed
by a couple of hoods.

320
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:52,472
They're tough, so you do exactly
what I tell you or I'm a dead man.

321
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:55,171
You got five envelopes with this tape.

322
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:59,410
First put L50,000 in each envelope -
get old, used bills.

323
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,772
You make the drop in person. Come to the
mailbox in the middle of Piccadilly Circus

324
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:07,114
at exactly 11.35am tomorrow morning.

325
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:12,642
You got that? Next, stay away
from those damn limey cops.

326
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:14,059
They'll just screw things up.

327
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:18,106
There's a gun at my head, Fields,
so don't blow this one.

328
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,108
My guys'll tear your heart out.

329
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:30,495
- Why'd you double-cross him, Fields?
- What does that mean?

330
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:32,868
Larkin told you
to stay away from the cops.

331
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:38,701
In Chicago, I would have. But, considering
the reputation of Scotland Yard,

332
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:43,170
I decided it was in the best interests of
my client to put the mater in their hands.

333
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,520
Oh, you're a real eagle scout, Fields.

334
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,654
- We don't even know it's Larkin's voice.
- Inspector.

335
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:54,601
Mr Larkin called in to complain
about our surveillance.

336
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:57,524
The call was routed through Central,

337
00:36:57,524 --> 00:37:00,479
where it was in turn redirected
to the switchboard of our department.

338
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:04,638
In rather sulphurous language,
Mr Larkin demanded...

339
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:05,799
Yes, thank you, Mike.

340
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,906
The point is, we taped
Larkin's call, voiceprinted it.

341
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:11,853
They matched.

342
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:18,737
Do you think you can raise that money
by tomorrow morning?

343
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,683
That's no problem.

344
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:24,886
Fortunately Mr Larkin has generous
and influential associates in the States.

345
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:30,423
- Translation, Commander: hoods.
- A bank draft is on its way.

346
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:34,805
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers
and skimmed off of casinos.

347
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:39,211
Yes, well, er, I think we perhaps
beter get on with it, Mr Fields.

348
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,847
Commander, what will you be doing?

349
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:45,934
Well, our interests are mutual -
the safe return of Mr Larkin.

350
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,836
We'll keep you informed.

351
00:37:47,837 --> 00:38:57,837
It's a bit dicey.

352
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,433
Not a copper in sight.

353
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:06,608
They're down there, all right.
I can smell 'em.

354
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:27,894
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

355
00:39:27,894 --> 00:40:56,545
Atention all units.
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.

356
00:40:56,545 --> 00:42:07,199
Drop completed.

357
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,205
Prepare for pick-up phase.

358
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:23,454
Well, now we'll see.

359
00:42:23,454 --> 00:43:08,221
The mail van's just passed me.

360
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:10,132
Approaching the island now.

361
00:43:10,132 --> 00:44:18,000
It's too damn simple.

362
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,775
- Pick-up completed.
- Right, job completed. Let's go.

363
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:38,573
We'll take him.

364
00:44:38,573 --> 00:48:29,452
It's a messenger on a scooter.
We're on him.

365
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:30,853
Right. Get going.

366
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:46,138
- Like I said...
- Too damn simple.

367
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:50,408
That's right. Too damn simple.

368
00:48:50,408 --> 00:49:02,529
Don't get too far behind.

369
00:49:02,529 --> 00:50:28,174
Hold it!

370
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:33,720
- Can you swim?
- Yeah.

371
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,236
- Go get it.
- Argh!

372
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:46,739
I'll sink with these boots on!

373
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:50,260
Oi, give us a hand!

374
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,749
After a few questions.

375
00:50:53,749 --> 00:51:00,904
What's the idea of throwin'
this money in the river?

376
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:04,170
Money? I don't know nothing
about no money.

377
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,831
Some bloke mailed me instructions
with a L5 note.

378
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:23,223
- Newspaper!
- What?!

379
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,405
They pulled a murphy!

380
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:28,583
Hey, what about me?

381
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,071
A murphy?

382
00:51:30,071 --> 00:51:46,265
OK.

383
00:51:46,265 --> 00:52:00,027
Yeah,
they tunnelled from underneath.

384
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:05,692
Yes, of course. And then
they switched envelopes by means of a...

385
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:06,949
A false botom.

386
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:14,623
As simple as that.

387
00:52:14,623 --> 00:52:16,685
A magnet?

388
00:52:16,685 --> 00:52:24,645
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.

389
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:55,034
I'll be right back.

390
00:52:55,034 --> 00:53:15,770
Hello, Mrs Cooper.

391
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,534
Good afternoon, Mr Brannigan.

392
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:22,788
- Would you like a coffee?
- Oh, thank you, no.

393
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:25,759
- Some people are waiting for me.
- Ah.

394
00:53:25,759 --> 00:54:40,557
Oh, Mrs Cooper?

395
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:42,580
Yes, Mr Brannigan?

396
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,914
- Did I have any visitors today?
- No, I don't think so.

397
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:48,498
Thank you.

398
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:52,226
Oh, there was a man here.

399
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:54,623
Something about the central heating.

400
00:54:54,623 --> 00:55:45,765
- What happened?
- Your central-heating friend left a present.

401
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:47,557
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.

402
00:55:47,557 --> 00:56:18,000
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.

403
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,431
- Jim?
- In here.

404
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:40,872
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm afraid that the... I'll show you.

405
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:47,636
- You mean he's put another one in there?
- I mean...

406
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:53,102
Yes.

407
00:56:53,102 --> 00:57:02,831
Yeah.

408
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:08,664
Larkin paid 25 grand to get me that view.

409
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:20,226
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:24,146
Ah-ah. All being fingerprinted, guv.

411
00:57:24,146 --> 00:57:27,850
I want a complete report on all sales
of gelignite in the past two months.

412
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,948
And try and trace that damn thing.

413
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,126
- Where is he?
- Downstairs at Mrs Cooper's, sir.

414
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:38,771
Oh, don't you look nice!

415
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:41,431
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry I haven't a room available.

416
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:44,880
- I can make room in my place.
- That's kind but...

417
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,000
- It'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.

418
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,176
We ought to show our visitor
a bit of British hospitality.

419
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:52,430
- Why don't you take him out for dinner?
- Yes, sir.

420
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,680
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.

421
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,181
- Thank you very much, Mrs Cooper.
- Oh, yes, Mrs Cooper, thank you.

422
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:05,424
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.

423
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:06,537
I will.

424
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:14,083
Perhaps you'd care for a cup of coffee.
Come along.

425
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,353
Well...

426
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:33,941
But it says "for sale".

427
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:38,203
I can get them to rent it to you,
if you don't mind me as your neighbour.

428
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:40,919
Why should I?
Puts me closer to my driver.

429
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:56,865
- It's been a lovely evening, Jim.
- Yeah, pleasant.

430
00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:59,509
And I hate to change the mood.

431
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:05,453
- Jenny, I want you to do me a favour.
- You shouldn't have that. That's a felony.

432
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:07,539
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

433
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:09,418
Commander Swann was not amused.

434
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:12,182
I had these names run down
by the department.

435
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,260
They all check out except that one.

436
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,004
- Jimmy-the-Bet.
- That's right. You know him?

437
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:22,649
Yeah. He's a bookie. He's also a grass -
what you call a stoolie.

438
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:26,472
He's got his eye on every keyhole
in London. Is it important?

439
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:29,396
Anything that has to do
with Larkin is important.

440
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:34,375
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs -
you name it, he's in it.

441
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:40,789
Jenny, I just happen to be working
the other side of the street.

442
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,883
Is that all?

443
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:50,413
Well, a couple of years ago
I was makin' it tough for him and...

444
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:52,045
one night he hit back.

445
00:59:52,045 --> 00:59:55,024
Pair of shotguns.

446
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,772
He obviously missed.

447
00:59:57,772 --> 01:00:02,759
But the rookie riding with me
took a blast in his face.

448
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:08,033
He left a widow and a couple of nice kids.

449
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:12,949
I'm sorry, Jim.
You must have been close to him.

450
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:14,860
Well, that'd make a good story.

451
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,034
But that's not the reason.

452
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:21,622
The truth is, I hated his guts
and he didn't like me.

453
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:25,948
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, the hell with that. I...

454
01:00:25,948 --> 01:00:28,616
My job was to keep him alive

455
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:33,149
until he could get smart enough
or tough enough to take care of himself.

456
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:36,646
I blew it.

457
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:43,092
What's that for?

458
01:00:43,092 --> 01:00:45,194
I don't know.

459
01:00:45,194 --> 01:00:49,225
You're just so... damn solid.

460
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:51,080
Fat, you mean.

461
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,637
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.

462
01:00:55,637 --> 01:00:57,341
Hello?

463
01:00:57,341 --> 01:01:00,423
Yes, Inspector.

464
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,243
Yes, right away.

465
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:07,330
He wants us back at the office.

466
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:19,219
Yes, well, there's no doubt
that fingerprint is Larkin's.

467
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:25,306
Oh. Forgive me for interrupting
your evening, Lieutenant.

468
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:30,206
Jenny, the artist has a sketch of our mad
bomber in 194. Pick it up for me, will you?

469
01:01:30,206 --> 01:01:38,453
Your theory that Larkin may have staged
his own kidnapping doesn't quite work.

470
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:41,767
- Is that so?
- Someone sent a contribution from him.

471
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:45,646
Did you print it?

472
01:01:45,646 --> 01:01:47,860
Of course.

473
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,456
Third finger of the left hand.

474
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:58,520
And it was accompanied by a demand
for an additional 350,000 quid.

475
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:02,033
That brings the ante up
to a million and a half dollars.

476
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:07,212
The additional payment was a penalty
because Mr Fields consulted the Yard.

477
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:09,967
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.

478
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:13,209
They certainly made bloody fools of us
in that Piccadilly caper.

479
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:17,519
In all my years at the Yard
I've never received a finger in the post.

480
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:20,238
Lord knows what they'll send us next.
Ah, thank you.

481
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:23,652
That's it. It's based
on your landlady's description.

482
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:29,030
We've wired copies to Interpol, the Suret?
and the FBI. Does it ring a bell for you?

483
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:33,332
No, but if Larkin has a contract
on me, he'd hire top talent.

484
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,275
Well, I want you on
the next flight to Chicago.

485
01:02:35,275 --> 01:02:38,326
You care, Commander! You really care.

486
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:43,002
I want you in Chicago alive, you big sod.

487
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:48,093
I don't want you in London as an unsolved
homicide. We're short-staffed as it is.

488
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:51,319
We have the same trouble in Chicago,
Commander. Good night.

489
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,294
Good night.

490
01:02:53,294 --> 01:02:56,280
Oh! Lieutenant.

491
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,642
- I'll take that particular item.
- You mean, uh...?

492
01:03:01,642 --> 01:03:07,275
- The notepad.
- Oh.

493
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:13,020
Yes, I-I, uh... I guess
I picked this up by mistake.

494
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,577
Yes, of course. That's what I'd assumed.

495
01:03:15,577 --> 01:03:22,309
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

496
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:33,497
Darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till two.

497
01:03:33,497 --> 01:03:35,743
Yeah, well, here comes my problem.

498
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:40,714
- Jim, this is my fianc? Richard Nelson.
- How are you?

499
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:42,737
So you're the guy
who's been ruining our love life.

500
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:47,095
- I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.
- If I were, you'd have to worry.

501
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:51,596
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. I'm sorry.

502
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:54,559
- Good night, love.
- Good night.

503
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:04,256
- OK. Where to?
- Jimmy-the-Bet.

504
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:07,451
Oh. You watch him.
He's a tough customer.

505
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:26,242
- Evening.
- I've no time for bird cops.

506
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:30,433
- I've got a thousand pounds on this fight.
- This isn't social, it's official. Open up.

507
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:34,766
It still isn't social.

508
01:04:34,766 --> 01:04:38,638
- I'm a cop.
- It shows, flatfoot.

509
01:04:38,638 --> 01:04:41,936
And I found your name
on a notepad of Benny Larkin's.

510
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:46,126
- Is he one of your customers?
- I got nothing to say to you. Out!

511
01:04:46,126 --> 01:04:52,261
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.
You're gonna give me some information.

512
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:56,754
I can ask questions easy or
I can ask 'em hard. Which'll it be?

513
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:59,350
This is what I answer questions with.

514
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:06,458
It's mighty persuasive. I guess
the questions can wait. But not for long.

515
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:12,378
Argh!

516
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:17,429
Now, would you like to try for England's
free dental care or answer my question?

517
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:21,141
I'll ask it just once.

518
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:24,271
- Name a name.
- Drexel.

519
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:26,828
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.

520
01:05:26,828 --> 01:05:30,779
- Where can I find this Drexel?
- A pub.

521
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:34,969
He goes there. The Lamb Tavern.
He goes there midday.

522
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:37,605
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

523
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:41,708
You know something?
That Jackson's a bum.

524
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:44,360
He won't make it through the eighth.

525
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:51,834
Jackson's hurt! He's down!

526
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:58,495
- Any trouble?
- No trouble.

527
01:05:58,495 --> 01:06:02,168
A litle hard to understand his accent.

528
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:24,012
- That's Scotch rump steak.
- I'll have that one.

529
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:30,059
I don't mind this turning into a shopping
tour as long as it ends up with Drexel.

530
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:36,689
I say. Talk of the devil.

531
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:40,345
That's him in the grey suit,
walking towards the pub now.

532
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:44,758
Fine. Would you just give me time
to get a litle friendly?

533
01:06:44,758 --> 01:07:08,771
Mind if I but in, partner?

534
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,984
- It's a free country.
- All right, Navy?

535
01:07:10,984 --> 01:07:14,896
- It's a pleasant country.
- I wouldn't argue with that.

536
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:18,488
Last time I was here, people were
getin' bombed a different way.

537
01:07:18,488 --> 01:07:29,756
- Doris, let's have some service here.
- What do you want?

538
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:32,520
- Some Guinness. How about you?
- Same again.

539
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,220
- Good. Navy?
- I got enough, thanks.

540
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,888
- How is the second-best navy?
- You should know.

541
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,791
Nice one, Ted.

542
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,112
Well, partner, cheers.

543
01:07:43,112 --> 01:07:48,211
Wait a minute, friend. We're havin' a drink.

544
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:51,469
Drexel, I'd like a few words.
Let's step outside.

545
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:55,413
- Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?
- Is it illegal to have a drink?

546
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:58,989
May I suggest that you keep out of this?
This is police business.

547
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:01,569
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.

548
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:04,213
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.

549
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,327
That cuts it.

550
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:13,032
Sorry. Sorry.

551
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:16,091
It wasn't me! What you trying to...?

552
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:26,147
- What's the idea?
- Well, who the hell started it?

553
01:08:26,147 --> 01:08:31,087
Awfully sorry.

554
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:39,739
Henry!

555
01:08:39,739 --> 01:09:18,045
Ah! Guv.

556
01:09:18,045 --> 01:09:28,928
Ah-ah-ah.

557
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:30,337
Guv.

558
01:09:30,338 --> 01:09:34,105
- Ah, Mike. Have you got it?
- Seems likely, guv.

559
01:09:34,105 --> 01:09:37,132
Gwendolyn Rooke, female,
Caucasian, age 26...

560
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:43,466
- Well, get on with it, then.
- The subject resides in Balham...

561
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:45,696
- Sorry, lady. If I were you...
- Look out!

562
01:09:45,696 --> 01:09:47,049
Huh? Oh.

563
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:55,838
...and has access to blueprints
for telephone and sewage conduits...

564
01:09:55,838 --> 01:10:00,427
under Piccadilly Circus.

565
01:10:00,427 --> 01:10:06,514
This place is getin' kinda unfriendly.

566
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:11,278
- Where are we goin'?
- Let's go to my place and have a drink.

567
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:20,117
Are you all right?

568
01:10:20,117 --> 01:10:25,111
Come on, partner.
We beter get outa here.

569
01:10:25,111 --> 01:10:40,053
- The Yank's got our pigeon.
- As far as I can see.

570
01:10:40,053 --> 01:11:01,937
Yes, well. Perhaps we'd beter look her
over, see what Miss Rooke has to say.

571
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:07,451
Oh, and, er, Mike, while you're at it,
run this lot of rowdies in, will you?

572
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:08,867
Right, guv.

573
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:13,217
'Scuse me. How's your wrist?

574
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:34,583
Ah, Constable. Arrest that lot, will you?

575
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:41,332
It had nothing to do with me!
I'm only here for the beer!

576
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:48,200
I think you'll find the evidence
is conclusive, sir, if you examine the map.

577
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,112
Thanks, Mike.

578
01:11:52,112 --> 01:11:59,649
Last month, the, erm...

579
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:06,128
the 16th, to be exact,
you made copies of maps

580
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:09,760
detailing the electrical and sewage
conduits beneath Piccadilly Circus.

581
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,236
- That's what I'm paid to do, sir.
- Of course.

582
01:12:12,236 --> 01:12:17,424
- To whom did you give those copies?
- To one of my supervisors, I expect.

583
01:12:17,424 --> 01:12:23,207
Miss Rooke, both you and I know
that that is not true.

584
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:31,734
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke,
is a crime in itself,

585
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:36,394
and I suggest that in your own
best interests you stop lying to me.

586
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:45,583
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

587
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:49,052
- Miss Rooke!
- I've always been a good girl, sir.

588
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:53,133
I'm sure you have, my dear,
but to whom did you give them?

589
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:57,332
To my boyfriend. Freddy.

590
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:01,650
Freddy.

591
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:06,836
- Now, now, come on.
- Whoops! Watch it, partner.

592
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:08,883
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.

593
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:17,776
I like Americans. They think big.
Wait till you see what I got here.

594
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:19,607
- Take a look at this.
- Look at what?

595
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:23,478
I've got a deal goin' here
that'll make your hair stand on end.

596
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:25,939
Uh-uh.

597
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:30,002
Now, now. You're geting too familiar.
I've only just met you.

598
01:13:30,002 --> 01:13:32,008
We're only acquaintances yet.

599
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:35,569
What I think you need, fella,
is a cup of coffee.

600
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:38,731
- I need another drink.
- Get in the kitchen.

601
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:41,997
Come on, let's have a fight. Marquess
of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.

602
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:52,006
Give me a minute and I'll fix you up,
if I can find the coffee.

603
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:55,471
- I don't want any coffee.
- Maybe you'll have to setle for tea.

604
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:57,230
I want a drink.

605
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:47,114
All right, buster, the friendly hour's over.

606
01:14:47,114 --> 01:14:48,698
Wake up.

607
01:14:48,698 --> 01:14:54,960
Come on. Get up.

608
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:03,590
Hold it up down there!

609
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:22,642
Get off, you stupid-lookin' mut.

610
01:15:22,642 --> 01:15:25,684
Whoops! Sorry.

611
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:30,077
Police, son. Follow that car.

612
01:15:30,077 --> 01:15:33,040
What? Police? What... What car?

613
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,489
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.

614
01:15:36,489 --> 01:16:05,761
I say, this is actually a new car, you know.

615
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:10,351
You're not really supposed
to go beyond 4,000 revs...

616
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:18,119
...till the 1,000-mile inspection.

617
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:23,099
Please look out. Oh! Agh!

618
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:28,756
I was rather hoping to keep it
for a year or so.

619
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:35,927
I wonder if I might get you
a taxi or something.

620
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:46,908
Oh! Argh!

621
01:16:46,908 --> 01:17:20,135
Hang on.

622
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:30,325
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!

623
01:17:30,326 --> 01:18:11,163
Oh, nuts.

624
01:18:11,163 --> 01:18:14,229
No!

625
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:44,307
I waited a year for delivery.

626
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:55,814
Very good. Thank you.

627
01:18:55,814 --> 01:19:03,152
Well, Lieutenant. How did you, er...
enjoy your sightseeing tour?

628
01:19:03,152 --> 01:19:05,629
The view from the bridge was terrific.

629
01:19:05,629 --> 01:19:09,859
Incidentally, regarding that automobile,
where would you like it shipped?

630
01:19:09,859 --> 01:19:12,424
- Hm?
- You bought it, you know.

631
01:19:12,424 --> 01:19:26,035
- Cor, handsome.
- Freddy.

632
01:19:26,035 --> 01:19:33,796
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.

633
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:43,565
It's not fair. My eyes are murderin' me
looking at all those bloody pictures.

634
01:19:43,565 --> 01:19:47,780
- You smoke when I tell you.
- Listen, I know my rights.

635
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,922
Don't start talking about rights.
I'll tear you limb from limb.

636
01:19:51,922 --> 01:19:54,949
- Oh, aye?
- Now, who did you sell those plans to?

637
01:19:54,949 --> 01:20:01,307
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Poor ignorant wee laddie, isn't he?

638
01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:04,294
They do have libraries inside, Freddy,

639
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:07,823
and I'll put you away for so long,
you'll come out a bloody PhD!

640
01:20:07,823 --> 01:20:15,185
Swann.

641
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:19,806
I'd tell that fella what he wants to know.
He likes to hurt people.

642
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:23,550
Today at a bar there was a fight.

643
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:25,883
He bit a guy's ear off.

644
01:20:25,883 --> 01:20:28,910
- Him?
- And that's not all.

645
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:33,905
What, him?

646
01:20:33,905 --> 01:20:39,897
We'll be in touch. No more calls.

647
01:20:39,897 --> 01:20:44,621
Look. I've really had you, you creep.

648
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:45,528
OK.

649
01:20:45,528 --> 01:20:51,264
OK. He gave me L100
to sell him the plans.

650
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:52,283
- Who did?
- Charlie.

651
01:20:52,283 --> 01:20:54,297
Charlie Kane!

652
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:56,989
Put him up.

653
01:20:56,989 --> 01:21:03,116
- That's Charlie!
- Take him away.

654
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:06,685
And that's our man.
That's the fella that nailed Drexel.

655
01:21:06,685 --> 01:21:09,161
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.

656
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:12,316
Boy, oh boy, it's really coming together.

657
01:21:12,316 --> 01:21:16,817
That was Fields. They're calling tomorrow
with instructions for the next payment.

658
01:21:16,817 --> 01:21:20,465
- Give us time to trace the call?
- I wish we could.

659
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:24,050
- They're calling on a marine frequency.
- They ain't amateurs.

660
01:21:24,050 --> 01:23:29,156
- Jim? Where are you going?
- Have you got the keys to your car?

661
01:23:29,156 --> 01:23:31,242
- I forgot my notebook.
- Sure. I'll get it.

662
01:23:31,243 --> 01:23:32,197
No!

663
01:23:32,197 --> 01:23:34,259
You'll get your hair wet!

664
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:39,382
You wanna bet?

665
01:23:39,382 --> 01:25:13,954
Jenny, look out!

666
01:25:13,954 --> 01:25:46,009
Jenny!

667
01:25:46,009 --> 01:25:47,537
You all right?

668
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:50,922
- Are you all right?
- No.

669
01:25:50,922 --> 01:25:52,060
What's the mater?

670
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:55,198
- Well, look at my hat.
- Oh.

671
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:57,252
Your hat.

672
01:25:57,253 --> 01:26:00,758
Let's get outa this.

673
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:03,688
Yes, sir.

674
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:10,987
Dammit, I'm having to take more flak
than an air gunner over Normandy on this.

675
01:26:10,987 --> 01:26:15,831
Forget the commissioner. Now we've got
the Home Secretary blowing his top,

676
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:18,395
demanding to know what kind
of a lunatic I've turned loose.

677
01:26:18,396 --> 01:26:21,438
- This isn't Chicago, you know.
- That's right.

678
01:26:21,438 --> 01:26:26,202
- You can't buy a decent hamburger.
- You're a bloody magnet for trouble.

679
01:26:26,202 --> 01:26:28,544
First the man hired to kill you
blows up an apartment.

680
01:26:28,544 --> 01:26:30,964
Then you demolish an automobile

681
01:26:30,965 --> 01:26:35,713
in what must be one of the most brazen,
reckless stunts in the annals of this city.

682
01:26:35,713 --> 01:26:40,477
Then you turn a perfectly peaceful street
into a shooting gallery!

683
01:26:40,477 --> 01:26:44,388
If I hadn't done some shooting, Jenny'd be
lying on a marble slab right now!

684
01:26:44,388 --> 01:26:47,367
Exactly! Simply because
she was mistaken for you!

685
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:51,183
I've asked you politely. Now I'll
ask you impolitely. Give me that gun!

686
01:26:51,183 --> 01:26:52,982
I haven't got it!

687
01:26:52,982 --> 01:26:58,878
Well?

688
01:26:58,878 --> 01:27:01,945
This just arrived
from the FBI in Washington DC.

689
01:27:01,945 --> 01:27:05,952
- Got a name for him?
- Name of John Gorman.

690
01:27:05,952 --> 01:27:07,050
An habitu?of New Orleans, Louisiana.

691
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:10,833
- Do you know him?
- Well, I know about him.

692
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:13,167
Word is that he's a stud who won't quit.

693
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:16,034
We'll pick him up.
Send out a top-priority signal.

694
01:27:16,034 --> 01:27:17,307
Right away, sir.

695
01:27:17,307 --> 01:27:21,155
Yes?

696
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:27,330
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.

697
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,436
Hello.

698
01:27:30,436 --> 01:27:33,040
Hello, big stuff.

699
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,270
Sure. Fine.

700
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,321
You did? Well, what's the dope?

701
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:40,247
Uh-huh.

702
01:27:40,248 --> 01:27:44,071
Wait, let me get this straight.
Jupiter equity fund.

703
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:51,609
He bought 20,000 shares at 49,
sold them at three. Whoo!

704
01:27:51,609 --> 01:27:54,700
That makes Melvin
a living, breathing pauper.

705
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,857
Sure, I will. Be home soon.

706
01:27:56,858 --> 01:28:01,430
Your son? What's his line of work?

707
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:03,827
- Ballet.
- I should have guessed.

708
01:28:03,827 --> 01:28:07,300
No, he's assistant district atorney
for Cook County.

709
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,064
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?

710
01:28:10,064 --> 01:28:13,186
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.

711
01:28:13,186 --> 01:28:16,580
Have I got some kind of a present for you.

712
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:40,146
Yes.

713
01:28:40,146 --> 01:28:41,634
Right. Thank you.

714
01:28:41,635 --> 01:28:45,920
- Mr Fields is on his way up, sir.
- You know where he's parked.

715
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,982
Nine, lower level.

716
01:28:47,982 --> 01:29:02,510
I got to the bank at the stroke of ten,

717
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:06,127
but it took eight clerks until now
to get this package together.

718
01:29:06,127 --> 01:29:09,464
We were worried about you, Melvin.

719
01:29:09,464 --> 01:29:12,698
- Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.
- I have.

720
01:29:12,698 --> 01:29:17,900
We are now ready and willing
to make the payment.

721
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:25,478
Mr Fields, we have some new information,

722
01:29:25,478 --> 01:29:30,218
and we are now very close to
a breakthrough in this case. Very close.

723
01:29:30,218 --> 01:29:32,249
Oh?

724
01:29:32,249 --> 01:29:39,332
Within four hours, or five at the most, we
expect to have Mr Larkin home and safe.

725
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:45,794
I strongly suggest, therefore,
that, in the best interests of your client,

726
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:48,646
you delay payment for those few hours.

727
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:50,118
No way.

728
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,671
This time I do exactly what they tell me.

729
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:59,495
You pay that money now and
you'll get Larkin back in chunks.

730
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:04,769
The lieutenant quotes
chapter and verse, Mr Fields.

731
01:30:04,769 --> 01:30:08,218
This is a gentleman who rejoices
in the name of Charlie-the-Handle,

732
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:11,492
identified as a member
of the kidnap team.

733
01:30:11,492 --> 01:30:14,344
He will lead us to Mr Larkin.

734
01:30:14,344 --> 01:30:17,235
Kind of unusual, Melvin.

735
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:22,047
Couple of cops telling you
what's best for your client.

736
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:26,261
Knock it off. If Larkin's friends
find out I'm in bed with the Yard,

737
01:30:26,261 --> 01:30:27,574
they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.

738
01:30:27,574 --> 01:30:33,016
It's all there. You don't have to count it.

739
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:38,091
If you lose Larkin and that loot, they'll part
more than your hair with that blowtorch.

740
01:30:38,091 --> 01:30:41,372
Earthy but accurate,
I would have thought.

741
01:30:41,373 --> 01:30:45,148
If you'll accept my apologies, I really
must insist that you give us the time.

742
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:47,665
Something's coming in, sir.

743
01:30:47,665 --> 01:30:49,998
Put it on the speaker.

744
01:30:49,998 --> 01:30:55,966
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.

745
01:30:55,966 --> 01:31:00,627
Now you contact us
on marine frequency 15.2.

746
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:07,136
Repeat: 15.2. We will use
different frequencies to contact you

747
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,724
and you will have only four seconds
to make the change.

748
01:31:09,725 --> 01:31:13,620
Calling Mel Fields.

749
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,256
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?

750
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:25,531
- This is Mel Fields.
- Now, I'm gonna give it to you just once,

751
01:31:25,532 --> 01:31:26,717
so get it good.

752
01:31:26,717 --> 01:31:29,305
This is how you make the drop.

753
01:31:29,305 --> 01:31:34,261
You leave the hotel in exactly ten minutes.

754
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:39,535
Make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?

755
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:41,861
Yes, I've got it.

756
01:31:41,861 --> 01:31:45,724
But I've run into a slight snag.

757
01:31:45,724 --> 01:31:50,408
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem.

758
01:31:50,408 --> 01:31:54,543
But the bank needs four or five hours
more to get the money together.

759
01:31:54,543 --> 01:31:59,100
- What do you think, Geef? Coppers?
- For his sake, I hope not.

760
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,868
- Listen, Fields...
- Come on, Mel. Bring the money here!

761
01:32:02,868 --> 01:32:03,798
Bring it!

762
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:11,384
All right, you've just bought yourself
four hours. And then you've had it.

763
01:32:11,384 --> 01:32:17,105
Then you've had it.

764
01:32:17,105 --> 01:32:23,375
All right.

765
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:27,789
You've got four hours to get Larkin back.

766
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:33,932
But if you don't, I make the payment,
and I won't tell you where or when.

767
01:32:33,932 --> 01:32:36,855
- Fair enough.
- And, Commander Swann,

768
01:32:36,855 --> 01:32:41,404
I want your word that there'll be
no surveillance of any kind.

769
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:44,008
You have my word, sir.

770
01:32:44,008 --> 01:32:47,648
Oh, and be sure to call room service
if you need anything.

771
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:52,636
I will.

772
01:32:52,636 --> 01:32:56,970
Find anything?

773
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:03,264
She's clean, sir, except for this.

774
01:33:03,264 --> 01:33:07,032
A long-range homing device.

775
01:33:07,032 --> 01:33:12,242
Can't trust anybody these days.

776
01:33:12,243 --> 01:33:38,208
Stay back. Not too close.

777
01:33:38,208 --> 01:36:09,265
It's OK. He's alone.

778
01:36:09,265 --> 01:37:13,558
Well, come on. Make the payoff
and let's get the hell outa here.

779
01:37:13,558 --> 01:37:15,270
Not yet, Ben.

780
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:22,593
- What do you mean, not yet?
- Charlie. Geef.

781
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:25,062
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.

782
01:37:25,062 --> 01:37:29,738
- Has he been a good boy?
- He never raised a finger.

783
01:37:29,738 --> 01:37:30,652
Ooh.

784
01:37:30,653 --> 01:37:33,010
Bad joke, Geef.

785
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:38,013
Good job, Charlie.

786
01:37:38,013 --> 01:37:45,495
- Well, come on, get 'em off!
- Get back...

787
01:37:45,495 --> 01:37:49,510
on your big, fat rear.

788
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:56,586
Mel.

789
01:37:56,586 --> 01:38:01,111
What's going on?

790
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:07,859
You know, I think it's about time.

791
01:38:07,859 --> 01:38:08,559
Yes.

792
01:38:08,559 --> 01:38:11,793
But this is my party, Charlie.

793
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:15,816
Ben...

794
01:38:15,816 --> 01:38:24,453
The first time we met, you told me
something I've never forgoten.

795
01:38:24,453 --> 01:38:27,098
It's my golden rule, you might say.

796
01:38:27,098 --> 01:38:31,782
Never trust anybody.

797
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:50,773
Mel, have you gone out of your...?

798
01:38:50,773 --> 01:39:13,622
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!

799
01:39:13,622 --> 01:39:18,466
I'm sorry about your finger.
I'm really sorry.

800
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:21,277
I bet you are.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.

801
01:39:21,277 --> 01:39:24,264
And don't forget that first payment
I've got stashed away.

802
01:39:24,264 --> 01:39:28,191
- How do we get this off?
- The key's by the mirror.

803
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:34,709
It's first class for you all the way
to South America, and on into the sunset.

804
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:40,150
This makes up for that bath I took
in that Jupiter stock.

805
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:44,381
Yeah. Sorry about that.
And we got wall-to-wall alibis.

806
01:39:44,381 --> 01:39:48,188
Oh, Scotland Yard'll swear that
I cooperated, made the payments.

807
01:39:48,188 --> 01:39:53,096
And even that big clown Brannigan
backs up our story.

808
01:39:53,096 --> 01:39:54,672
As long as he's alive.

809
01:39:54,672 --> 01:40:02,337
You know, Mel, for a minute,
when you had that gun on me...

810
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:05,372
I thought you were gonna get greedy.

811
01:40:05,372 --> 01:40:09,379
You know, for a minute,
Ben, I was tempted.

812
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:14,598
But what the hell kind of world would it be
if you couldn't trust somebody, hm?

813
01:40:14,598 --> 01:41:00,568
We've been had.

814
01:41:00,568 --> 01:41:08,361
- Knock, knock.
- Brannigan!

815
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:13,189
I wouldn't.
Unless you wanna sing soprano.

816
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:16,534
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.

817
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:34,521
They're all yours, Lieutenant.

818
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:41,891
Don't worry about me, James.

819
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:43,507
Bye-bye.

820
01:41:43,507 --> 01:41:49,156
And I mean bye-bye.

821
01:41:49,156 --> 01:41:57,507
That fella don't quit easy, does he?

822
01:41:57,507 --> 01:42:02,845
Do you think you can hang onto 'em until
I can get 'em a couple of airplane tickets?

823
01:42:02,845 --> 01:42:05,106
I think we could manage that, yes.

824
01:42:05,106 --> 01:42:07,440
I just hope you don't lose them
back in the Colonies.

825
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,179
- Safe trip.
- Thank you.

826
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:30,501
How about a lift, Yank?

827
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:53,262
Gorman. Jim!

828
01:42:53,262 --> 01:43:06,339
- Jim! Jim?
- I'm all right.

829
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:10,705
Hold it here.

830
01:43:10,705 --> 01:43:16,992
Now!

831
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,106
Get behind that car!

832
01:43:20,106 --> 01:45:35,271
Well...

833
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:38,003
I'm gonna miss this old town.

834
01:45:38,003 --> 01:45:39,921
It's gonna miss you.

835
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:45,674
I'm not sure if I agree with what
my old dad said about you Yanks.

836
01:45:45,674 --> 01:45:48,924
You mean that part about being overpaid?

837
01:45:48,924 --> 01:45:51,241
No. Over here.

838
01:45:51,241 --> 01:45:56,149
- Jenny, it's been great.
- It has.

839
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,916
So long.

840
01:45:57,916 --> 01:46:57,916
