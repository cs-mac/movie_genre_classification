2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,777
Awakened by the sound of an explosion...

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,941
...running for their lives.

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,451
Police are now pushing...

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,783
...the Feds are telling us
it is not a terror attack.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,380
It is most likely an accident.

7
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,948
...the Fire Department is
calling a major emergency.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,619
...wave of unexplained killings

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,492
that are sweeping across this city.

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,699
Not all things in the world...

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,738
are quite as they first appear.

12
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,308
Every seven years in an ordinary town,

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,846
an extraordinary event takes place.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,841
You won't know it...

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,182
you won't see it...

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,683
...but it happens.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,173
Damn.

18
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,388
- You out?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,587
Don't let it be him, Joshua. not him.

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,958
Mr. Harlow!

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,136
What's the matter, Mr. Harlow?

22
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,730
Are you out of bullets?

23
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,934
Here, have some of mine!

24
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,373
Whoo-hoo!

25
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,577
No you don't, Mr. Harlow.

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,575
Joshua!

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,241
To be quite frank with you,

28
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,747
you're a stain on our profession.

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,582
I'm beyond fucking insulted.

30
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,950
So...

31
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,753
come on out..

32
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,917
and I'll show you...

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,123
the only way to quit this line of work.

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,789
Congratulations, man.

35
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,928
Thanks.

36
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,859
I'm glad it was you.

37
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,215
Enjoy your life together.

38
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,372
We have a winner.

39
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,426
...crime rose across the board-

40
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,937
particularly gang-related gun crime,

41
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,769
which is leaving residents
in a constant state of fear.

42
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,674
There were calls last night
for further investment...

43
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,872
in the city's under-manned
police force, as often-

44
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,315
Another day in the borough.

45
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,487
All right, you. Come on.

46
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,583
Out.

47
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,787
You been here long enough.

48
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,023
- Closing time, eh?
- Opening time.

49
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,965
How many times have
I told you about this?

50
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,966
Come on, out.

51
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,468
What did I do last night?

52
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,267
It's not what you did,
it's how much you drank.

53
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,170
You're a disgrace, you know that?

54
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,804
You dirty bastard. Right.

55
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,074
Sorry.

56
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,274
Sorry.

57
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,114
Here. Don't forget this.

58
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,418
Now piss off, Father. You're barred!

59
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,092
Disgusting.

60
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,869
Fuck off.

61
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,009
All right. Venue's stacked.

62
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,341
Visual is coming through. Almost got it.

63
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,881
I'm into the ccTV mainframe.

64
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,611
That is tasty and invisible.

65
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,674
Thank you. Watch and learn.

66
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,049
- Rerouting.
- Thank you.

67
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,352
Rerouted CCTV footage is online.

68
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,824
Confirm complete camera tap.

69
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,690
Rerouted ccTV confirmed

70
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,695
on all grid sections A through to B.

71
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,287
We have coverage of the entire city.

72
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,855
Abso-fucking-lutely.

73
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,230
Good. Visuals on the standby?

74
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,292
All available motion
detectors and hidden cameras

75
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,302
are active and responsive.

76
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,861
- Block coms.
- Blocking.

77
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,770
Emergency calls placed
on permanent hold cycle.

78
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,900
Please hold while we try to connect you.

79
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,275
Emergency radio
frequencies are scrambled.

80
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,906
Lock everything. Prepare to go live.

81
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,375
We're up.

82
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,351
About time. What's our status?

83
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,717
Some of the long hauls
are a little late rising,

84
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,050
but the majority are up and about.

85
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:24,885
And the implants?

86
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,720
The surgery teams completed overnight.

87
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,056
Good. Make sure the
cleanup crews are ready.

88
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,119
They're going to have a busy day.

89
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,890
Ladies and gentlemen...

90
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,332
welcome to the Tournament.

91
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,567
It is my honor

92
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,575
to be your host for
this legendary event,

93
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,908
being held for the first
time here in Great Britain.

94
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,413
With more CCTV than
anywhere else on Earth,

95
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,347
we shouldn't miss a thing.

96
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,087
now, as you know,

97
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,250
the stakes in this room are high,

98
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,123
but the stakes for our
competitors out there

99
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,424
are the highest possible.

100
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,657
At this very moment,

101
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,756
30 of the world's greatest assassins

102
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,824
are preparing for the
ultimate sporting event.

103
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,730
International killers of
every imaginable discipline

104
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,435
will compete for a
$10 million cash prize

105
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,035
and the honorable title
of the "World's Best. "

106
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,617
our lovely ladies are
standing by to take your bets.

107
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,778
100K minimum stake.

108
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,947
And here are a few of
my personal favorites

109
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,184
you may wish to keep your eye on.

110
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,124
- Visuals online.
- Go to seven.

111
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,219
- Go to seven, Rob.
- And cue.

112
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,632
Lai Lai Zhen, abandoned
at birth and left for dead.

113
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,602
At 17, she was killing for the Triads

114
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,797
and has grown up to become
the number one hitter

115
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,898
in the Eastern market
for the past three years-

116
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,808
a snip at 10 to 1.

117
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,640
Anton Bogart.

118
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,810
An outstanding athlete,

119
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,115
he lives for the thrill of the hunt.

120
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,951
Silent, stealthy, smart-

121
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,320
a lethal option.

122
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,522
9 to 1.

123
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,359
Yuri Petrov, Russian special forces.

124
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,492
An incredible all-rounder
armed to the teeth.

125
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,833
Fists, feet, bullets, bombs-

126
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,429
utterly merciless, he has it all.

127
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,839
Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid.

128
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,347
An outside bet,

129
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,646
but he's mad enough to rise the ranks.

130
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,845
Reckless, ruthless, wild,

131
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,013
but guaranteed great entertainment.

132
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,683
This is one guy who truly loves his job.

133
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,361
And if you thought it
couldn't get any better,

134
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,193
we have a dramatic late entrant...

135
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
a returning champion who I'm sure...

136
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,964
will add something very
personal to the proceedings.

137
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,062
Seven years ago,

138
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,370
Joshua Harlow took
the Tournament by storm

139
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,807
and retired as a champion.

140
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,572
But this year he's back.

141
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,136
For one reason, and one reason only-

142
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,176
revenge.

143
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,713
Joshua's wife was brutally murdered...

144
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
in their Miami home four months ago,

145
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,150
and the person who killed her...

146
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,214
is one of this year's players!

147
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,888
Joshua Harlow is our favorite at 2 to 1.

148
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,657
Activate tracking devices.

149
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,759
overlaying and synching positions.

150
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,862
- Tracking bugs online.
- Prepare to go hot.

151
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,167
Hotter than me in a swimsuit.

152
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,269
Cue.

153
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,777
As ever, each assassin...

154
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,177
is implanted with a tracking device,

155
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,509
so we can find them,

156
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,311
and they can find each other.

157
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,218
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice.

158
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,916
If we don't have a
winner within 24 hours,

159
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,083
our contestants will discover...

160
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,456
that their tracking device...

161
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,927
isn't just a tracking device.

162
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,155
Well, I know you're all very busy men.

163
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,500
30 contestants...

164
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,439
24 hours...

165
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,565
one rule...

166
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,666
kill or die.

167
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,940
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

168
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,345
The Tournament has begun.

169
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,730
Suck me sideways.

170
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,325
I would kill for a piece of that pie.

171
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,631
Yeah, right.

172
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,332
You'd be fucking dead before
you could lick your lips.

173
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,036
Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her.

174
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,510
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

175
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,137
Yeah, kinda.

176
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,273
They go way back. He
nurtured her or something.

177
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,143
Oh, oh, oh.

178
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,483
All right, it is showtime.

179
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,215
Holy shit. Can you do that?

180
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,848
- Wow.
- He just killed an innocent guy!

181
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,085
Fuck! I love this shit.

182
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,093
- Fuck!
- Keep on him.

183
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,685
I'm locked on him. Nowhere to hide.

184
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,355
Miss Hunter, it is showtime.

185
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,661
We have Tomko versus Zhen.

186
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,701
That is England v. China!

187
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,259
Good. Patch it through.

188
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,032
Sir, we're off.

189
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,665
It's Steve Tomko and Lai Lai Zhen.

190
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,609
What the fuck are you up to?

191
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,115
Who is it?

192
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,052
Room service.

193
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,284
Breakfast, madam.

194
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,486
You like that, bitch? Huh?

195
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,502
I just want you to
know, after I kill you,

196
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,511
I'm going to fuck you.

197
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,727
Hey, welcome to the tournament, Rob.

198
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,905
You fucking bitch!

199
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,265
First blood to Lai Lai Zhen.

200
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,440
Her odds move to 7 to 1.

201
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,474
Yeah!

202
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,978
Cleanup crew Delta to the
Ivy House Hotel room 107.

203
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,216
We're on our way.

204
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,315
I still would.

205
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,586
Confirm one body...

206
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
Oh, okay, party time.

207
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,859
We have the Frenchman Anton Bogart...

208
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,831
heading into a cluster...

209
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,390
developing on the high street.
- Shit.

210
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,902
Activating all street security cams.

211
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,169
Picking it up on one,
two, three police cameras.

212
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,904
- The cameras live?
- Cameras are live.

213
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,741
We are in on the Gypsy.

214
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,101
Fuck. The Frenchman's gone cold.

215
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,233
I didn't see a fight.
You see him get killed?

216
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,538
No, I didn't see a fucking fight.

217
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,805
Doing a signal sweep.

218
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,039
Check his body heat sensor now.

219
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,102
I'm on it.

220
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,752
Tech. He's back. What did you do?

221
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,053
Must've been a blip.

222
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,254
Run a complete diagnostic.
I don't like blips.

223
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,761
Top you off?

224
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,869
- Coffee?
- no.

225
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:41,900
Top you off?

226
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,878
There you go.

227
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,188
Yes.

228
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,518
No.

229
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,887
Okay.

230
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,790
You planning to pay for that?

231
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,593
Yeah. Yes.

232
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,268
Credit card?

233
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,337
Here, Father. Allow me.

234
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,305
Enjoy your coffee.

235
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,539
Au revoir.

236
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,580
Thank you.

237
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,210
Hello, Todd.

238
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,846
Hello, Father.

239
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,685
Sorry I haven't been around.

240
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,622
I've been busy. How's your mom doing?

241
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,819
She died, Father.

242
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,830
I... I'm sorry.

243
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,661
She was asking after you.

244
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,260
Is there anything I can do,
like help with the funeral?

245
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,031
That's okay. I've got it all sorted.

246
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,644
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

247
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,245
I think we have another blip.

248
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,881
Shooter on the rooftop just went cold.

249
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,982
No one near her.

250
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,808
We've got a moving
signal but no Frenchman.

251
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,811
What the hell is going on?

252
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,506
- Come on.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

253
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,606
I fucking hate blips!

254
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,946
Hail Mary, full of grace.

255
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,114
The Lord is with thee.

256
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,282
Blessed art thou amongst women,

257
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,121
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

258
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,128
Holy Mary, mother of
God, pray for us sinners

259
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,664
now and in the hour of our death, amen.

260
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,239
Oh, please, Blessed Virgin, hear me.

261
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,346
I want to be a good man.

262
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,521
I want to be a strong man.

263
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,018
But I look inside my heart
and there is nothing there.

264
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,024
There's nothing there.

265
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,061
Oh, Blessed Virgin, please give me hope.

266
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,879
I know.

267
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,922
What?

268
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,551
Whatever this is, please, please...

269
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,993
What's wrong with you?

270
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,429
What's wrong with me?

271
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,398
Please, hear me...

272
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,298
Why aren't you defending yourself?

273
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,427
I don't have any money, please.

274
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,471
- I don't have any money.
- Shut up.

275
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm just a... I'm just a priest.

276
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,174
Please, please...

277
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,095
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

278
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,660
goodbye.

279
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,241
I'm going to enjoy this.

280
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,737
Stop!

281
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,374
Stop.

282
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,142
Stop!

283
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,516
Please, don't struggle.

284
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,789
So much easier when they don't struggle.

285
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,193
What are you doing?

286
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,753
Just let her go!

287
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,264
I've got a gun!

288
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,301
I've got a gun and I'll use it.

289
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,838
Aah!

290
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,412
Don't move.

291
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,576
Or what?

292
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,247
Just... just stay right there.

293
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,619
Stay back!

294
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,391
You need one in the chamber.

295
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,534
- Who are you?
- I'm a priest!

296
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,095
If you lie to me, I break your neck.

297
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,697
I'm not. I'm not!

298
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,936
Where are your weapons?
Who do you work for?

299
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,568
Where do you receive your orders from?

300
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,612
Rome!

301
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,673
No scar.

302
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,411
I don't know what you're talking about.

303
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,487
You're bleeping.

304
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,999
You really don't know what
I'm talking about, do you?

305
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,069
You really are a priest.

306
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,729
Father Macavoy.

307
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,309
This is... was my church.

308
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,407
Well, Father, welcome to the Tournament.

309
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,618
Thank you.

310
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,153
They found the blip.

311
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,161
What is it?

312
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,663
It's our Frenchman.

313
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,791
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed...

314
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,334
to cut out his tracking device,

315
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,461
and it's ended up inside that priest.

316
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,834
I see.

317
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,669
We now have one of our favorites...

318
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,107
running around virtually invisible?

319
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,667
I'm sorry. What shall I tell them to do?

320
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,839
I suggest you shorten his odds...

321
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,507
and follow him.

322
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,550
Yes, sir.

323
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,345
Tech. okay, maintain
visual contact with Bogart.

324
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,685
Don't lose sight of that
slippery little bastard.

325
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,818
Tracking manually. Damn, Bogart's quick.

326
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,987
Go to camera two. Quick, go.

327
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,291
Just got to reconfigure.

328
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,355
Give me a second.

329
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,861
- Holy shit.
- What now?

330
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,371
- It's him.
- You sure?

331
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,373
Oh, there are gonna be fireworks.

332
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,705
All right, Miss Hunter, we have Harlow.

333
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,574
We have Harlow for you.

334
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,409
May I have your attention?

335
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,380
You wanted the greatest show on Earth.

336
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,215
out for revenge,

337
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,188
the greatest assassin of our time.

338
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,913
Cut the shit, Eddy.

339
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,076
Oh, shit.

340
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,450
- What are you doing here?
- I need information.

341
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,421
What have you heard?

342
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,152
I heard someone came for you.

343
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,393
I heard it got a bit messy.

344
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,200
And I heard about your wife.

345
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,397
What did you hear? Who told you?

346
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,271
The crazy American kid, Miles.

347
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,604
He's your one.

348
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,840
Miles Slade, the finger guy?

349
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,014
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

350
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,884
Um...

351
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,299
Whoohoohoo!

352
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,030
Eat shit!

353
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,969
Well, that's one more
for the trophy cabinet,

354
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,306
thank you very much.

355
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,914
Hey, boy!

356
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:13,973
Come here, little fella.

357
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,883
Hey, there's a good boy.

358
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,320
There's a good dog.
Yeah, that's a good dog.

359
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,982
That's a good dog.

360
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,085
Hey, what is this?

361
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,857
What is that, huh?

362
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,660
What is it? Here you go.

363
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,632
That guy is fucked up.

364
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,155
See you later, boy.

365
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,369
Okay, just take it back a little.

366
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,994
Playing out to one.

367
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,171
Jeez, who steals a finger?

368
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,938
Oh, yeah.

369
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,104
Oh, fuck.

370
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,546
That's the emergency line. What do I do?

371
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,049
Answer it.

372
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,917
Hello.

373
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,085
Yeah, hold on. I'll
just put you through.

374
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,898
Just spoke to Lai Lai Zhen.

375
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,901
You tell her you wanted to eat her pie?

376
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,898
- Excuse me, Senator.
- All right.

377
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,564
It's Lai Lai.

378
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,737
Make sure that redneck
settles his marker...

379
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,777
before he has another coronary.

380
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:49,807
Speak.

381
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,974
We have a situation with a civilian.

382
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,778
Who are you talking to, the police?

383
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,251
Quiet. I know you can
see what's going on.

384
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,254
You know the rules, Lai Lai.

385
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,187
It's kill or be killed.

386
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,158
You're like a child
running back to Daddy

387
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,091
telling me how the big
boy stole your ball.

388
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,029
You're on the battlefield.
There is no going back.

389
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,363
And he's just one of those famous
innocent bystanders you hear about.

390
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,459
- Let me speak to him.
- no, stop it.

391
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,334
- This is Father Macavoy.
- I'll kill you myself.

392
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,101
- Let me speak to him.
- It's not right. He's just a priest.

393
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,110
Personally, I find it kind of apt.

394
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,942
Back in the day we used to
throw Christians to the lions.

395
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,847
Seems that history is repeating itself.

396
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,111
Carry him or kill him,

397
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,676
but don't call back.

398
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,651
What's happened? Are the police coming?

399
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,625
Not really.

400
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,224
Move!

401
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,930
We have to get out of here now.

402
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,490
Move it!

403
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,002
Oh, God!

404
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,306
Someone help me!

405
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,808
Please, help! God!

406
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,844
It's stuck.

407
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,082
Help me with the seatbelt.

408
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,592
- It's jammed.
- Don't let me die!

409
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,894
Come here. Come here.

410
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,466
Wrong day to be a good Samaritan.

411
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,042
When I say "move it", move it!

412
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,634
- Come on!
- What's going on?

413
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,009
You've got a bug inside you.
They think you're a hitter.

414
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,048
This is a competition for assassins.

415
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,378
That last man standing wins.

416
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,077
A game where people kill each other?

417
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,211
Yes, we have to get
the tracker out of you,

418
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,256
otherwise you're a target.

419
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,416
Why don't we go to the police?

420
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,754
Eh? You and I.

421
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,623
You acted in self-defense.
I'll speak for you.

422
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,890
Is it my accent? Do
I stutter? Is that it?

423
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,454
The people who run this,

424
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,397
they are more powerful than the police.

425
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,458
- Somebody...
- They will get you anywhere.

426
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,561
- ... do something!
- But the bodies...

427
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,662
people will see the bodies.

428
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,331
There will be an explanation.

429
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,002
It won't be the truth, but it
will be what people will buy.

430
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,068
A madman with a gun, a terrorist attack,

431
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,773
a natural disaster, a car crash.

432
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,576
That's how the Tournament
remains a secret!

433
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,241
It's insane.

434
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,411
Don't you watch TV, Father?

435
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,454
The whole world is insane.

436
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,619
now move it! Come on!

437
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,064
Sir.

438
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,431
Sir, can we just reconfirm?

439
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,231
You want to make the priest a player?

440
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,771
You want him on the system?

441
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,932
Was I unclear, Mr. Hamilton?

442
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,104
No. No, sir. It's ready. It's ready.

443
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,875
- This is bullshit.
- Shut up and do it.

444
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,251
Ladies and gentlemen, a man of the cloth

445
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,723
has stepped out from the sidelines.

446
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,625
If any of you good people
would like to take a long shot

447
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,356
on a man with a dog collar,

448
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,261
we'll take that action.

449
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,176
Lai Lai. Will you hurry up?

450
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,306
It's not coming up.

451
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,647
How do you know I've
even swallowed this thing?

452
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,310
How else could it be inside you?

453
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
Fuck! Fuck!

454
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,356
Everybody thinks I'm an assassin!

455
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,057
Everybody wants me dead!

456
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,998
- Yes.
- oh, fuck!

457
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,263
I don't wanna die.

458
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,132
- It's okay.
- I don't wanna die.

459
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,202
I don't wanna die.

460
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,213
- I don't know how to cope with this.
- You'll be okay.

461
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,884
Trust me.

462
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,715
Okay.

463
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,587
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

464
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,827
Oh, officer, thank goodness you're here.

465
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,293
Nice outfit, Father.

466
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,631
Get down!

467
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,779
Come on!

468
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,011
What's happening?

469
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,575
I'm not sure, but we have
to get out of here now.

470
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,252
A policeman's been killed.

471
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,848
- He's a player.
- A player?

472
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,224
Why would anybody want to
take part in this madness?

473
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,287
Cash prize, revenge, title, excitement.

474
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,195
So what's your reason?

475
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,386
I've seen him before.

476
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,447
- In the cafe this morning.
- Are you sure?

477
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,720
- Positive.
- He cut it out.

478
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,069
Hold on!

479
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,617
Fuck.

480
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,218
Whoo! Here we go.

481
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,128
Yeah. Hi, ladies!

482
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,340
Hurry back.

483
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,872
I love you, baby.

484
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,311
Enjoy your life together.

485
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,426
Where were you?

486
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,529
Host on speaker. Joshua,

487
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,695
I'm deeply sorry about your loss,

488
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,261
but I may have some information

489
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,830
about the person that came after you.

490
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,001
I may know where you can find them.

491
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,949
Oh, shit.

492
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,952
We got another one of
those cluster things.

493
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,044
Jesus fucking Christ.

494
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,715
That's not a cluster.
That is a war zone.

495
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,849
Angel's titty bar? Are you kidding me?

496
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,325
There's nine shooters in there.

497
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,656
Why aren't they attacking each other?

498
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,162
Probably so many people in the place

499
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,663
they don't know who is who.

500
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,825
All right, we got
ourselves a situation here.

501
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,664
We have nine players in one location.

502
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,298
Repeat, nine players in
one shithole location.

503
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,069
Ladies and gentlemen,

504
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,010
we have a bloodbath about to take place.

505
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,414
Come on, bitches!

506
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,321
Yeah!

507
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,658
Fuck yeah!

508
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,926
Come on, boys!

509
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:46,970
Whoo-hoo!

510
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,742
Yeah!

511
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,210
No, you don't!

512
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,848
I see you, bud!

513
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,123
Thanks, sweetheart.

514
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,090
Tindillini and Mitre out.

515
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,359
They're going down
fast. Still taking bets.

516
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,738
Come on, boys!

517
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,468
Whoo-hoo!

518
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,951
Yeah!

519
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,488
You fucking son of a bitch.

520
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,161
Whoo!

521
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,071
- Ho, ho, ho!
- This is fucked up.

522
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,233
oh!

523
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,743
That's Van de Ven out of the game.

524
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,348
Where you at, boys?

525
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,927
Aah!

526
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,399
Aah!

527
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,101
Miles. Bring it on!

528
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,877
Yeah! Fuck, yeah!

529
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,415
Whoo-whoo! Whoo!

530
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,677
Was it you, Miles?

531
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,150
Did you come after me?

532
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,449
- Stay still, honey.
- Did you murder my wife?

533
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,113
What the fuck you talking about?

534
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,055
Aah!

535
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,298
No, you don't, honey.

536
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,997
Good night, sugar.

537
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,947
We're experiencing
problems with transmitting.

538
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,152
All units, we have reports of gunfire...

539
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,825
Sorry, we're completely swamped here.

540
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,496
What the hell's going on today?

541
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,433
God, I need a drink.

542
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,569
You drink too much

543
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,305
and your eyes give you away.

544
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,574
You damage your liver.

545
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,082
That's just perfect. That's
just exactly what I need,

546
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,711
health advice from a hit man.

547
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,985
What are we going to do?

548
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,619
We have to wait until it
passes through your system.

549
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,993
The further out of town we go,
the less accurate the tracker.

550
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,623
It will buy us some time.

551
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,634
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

552
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,101
Why are you here?

553
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,331
Why are you playing?

554
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,499
Why all the questions?

555
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,600
Why do you drink so much?

556
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,306
Why were you sobbing
like a child this morning?

557
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,576
Because I'm lost.

558
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,188
You're lost?

559
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,690
Try to be me.

560
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,423
It must be tough playing
God with people's lives.

561
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,497
I don't play God.

562
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,761
If I don't do it, somebody else will.

563
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,533
It's just a job. nothing more.

564
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,698
I don't believe you.

565
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,704
otherwise, why didn't you just kill me?

566
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,076
I don't kill the innocent.

567
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,748
I'm so happy.

568
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:10,484
Did you feel that?

569
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,061
Please!

570
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,257
Where were you?

571
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,770
Can you hold that for me, buddy?

572
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,005
Huh. Howdy.

573
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:37,854
Look at you.

574
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,421
Joshua Harlow,

575
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,221
greatest assassin there ever was.

576
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,152
Well, I shit ya,

577
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,858
you're well past your best, ain't ya?

578
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,697
But, hey, look at the bright side-

579
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,227
at least you fell at the
hands of this year's champion.

580
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,107
Look at what I did to that guy.

581
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,944
What the fuck was I thinking?

582
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,780
Jesus, Miles, you're a fucking maniac.

583
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,149
Thanks.

584
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,122
Have a drink, legend.

585
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,390
Trying to quit.

586
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,125
Just to be clear, old-timer,

587
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,169
these are the last few
moments of your life

588
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,965
you're experiencing right now.

589
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,303
You might as well have a drink with me.

590
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,205
Maybe later.

591
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,070
Suit yourself, superstar.

592
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,944
Go on, now, tell me...

593
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,875
how many kills?

594
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,485
See, I love killing.

595
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,524
Just the smell of it.

596
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,386
Why Mary?

597
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,628
Mary?

598
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,062
Yeah.

599
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,998
Mary who? I killed a
fucking million Marys.

600
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,501
You know who.

601
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,662
Miami, four months ago.

602
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,864
I wasn't home.

603
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,407
It was me you wanted.
Why did you kill her?

604
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,817
Give me a second.

605
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,945
Hey, man, let me help you.

606
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,235
Whoa.

607
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,729
That's some nasty shit.

608
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:40,710
Now where were we?

609
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,134
My wife.

610
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,010
Yeah. Why weren't you there?

611
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,175
You left her all alone.

612
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,242
If I were you...

613
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,648
I'd blame myself.

614
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,721
Bad news, superstar.

615
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,595
This is really going to fuck you off.

616
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,770
It wasn't me.

617
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,607
Don't lie to me, kid.

618
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,779
I am not...

619
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,745
a kid!

620
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,289
Whoohoohoo!

621
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,558
I got me a $10 million trigger finger.

622
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,826
That's as close as you'll ever come,

623
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,027
you fucking amateur.

624
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,935
Here, let me help you with that.

625
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,769
I really wish it was me.

626
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,608
Shit, I really do.

627
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,204
But I wouldn't go take credit
for other people's work.

628
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,007
That'd just be wrong.

629
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,643
Don't you pass out on me, legend.

630
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,885
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife.

631
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,160
It gives me great pleasure

632
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,721
to know...

633
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,528
that you know who did it

634
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,832
and that you can't do a
fucking thing about it.

635
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,936
Lai Lai Zhen came after you.

636
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,176
Lai Lai Zhen.

637
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,510
She killed your wife.

638
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,408
You're a liar.

639
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,179
Am I?

640
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,824
I think I'll have that drink now.

641
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,519
That's the spirit.

642
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,026
Toast the new champion.

643
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,365
I think we're done here.

644
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,549
You okay?

645
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,909
oh, no. For a minute there

646
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,080
I thought it was all just a bad dream.

647
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,589
You'll be okay.

648
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,298
Oh.

649
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,061
Oh, please.

650
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:42,070
Please, God, help me through this.

651
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:47,132
Please give me some strength because-

652
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,178
because I need a drink!

653
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,291
Sorry, I was...

654
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:13,026
Bless me, Father, I have sinned.

655
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,332
Aah!

656
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,274
Stakes are high, ladies and gentlemen,

657
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,211
a favorite will fall.

658
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,463
You're lucky I got to
you before Joshua did.

659
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,168
He's pretty pissed you killed his wife.

660
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,822
no, no.

661
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,484
Wait, wait.

662
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,290
Please, please stop.

663
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,694
Finish the fucker!

664
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,194
You...

665
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,329
Don't do it!

666
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,432
Please! I'm sorry.

667
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,567
Don't do it. Don't do it.

668
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,961
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,872
Pull the fucking trigger!

670
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,308
Let's get as close as we can.

671
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,043
Keep him locked. We gotta wait.

672
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,779
He said what?

673
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,079
It's the right thing.

674
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,154
What is it?

675
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,424
What is it?

676
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,725
No!

677
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,394
What is it?

678
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,370
Aah!

679
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,302
Hello? Mill's service station.

680
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,602
It's, um-

681
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,141
it's for you.

682
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,781
Hello?

683
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,511
Father Macavoy,

684
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,780
we haven't met,

685
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,789
but I feel I know you intimately.

686
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,792
So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?

687
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,125
Such profanity from a man of the cloth.

688
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,623
now I suggest you listen to me

689
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,328
very, very carefully.

690
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,461
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt

691
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,063
what could have been a spectacular kill,

692
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,974
I feel I should clarify
the rules a little.

693
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,808
There's a time limit you
really should take note of.

694
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,475
Time limit? What are you talking about?

695
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,983
It's very simple.

696
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,316
You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.

697
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,753
I'm not going to kill anyone.

698
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,814
We shall wait and see.

699
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,883
It will be your faith

700
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,428
against your desire to live.

701
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,987
That device inside you is
so much more than a tracker,

702
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,555
as you've just witnessed.

703
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,330
There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.

704
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,667
If there's more than
one player still alive

705
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,673
when the clock hits zero,

706
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,504
everyone will meet the same fate

707
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,170
as your American friend.

708
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,373
So let's see if you have any real guts.

709
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,547
It's kill or be killed.

710
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,018
Four hours, Father,

711
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,749
and the clock is ticking.

712
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,459
Thank you.

713
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,303
Well, that's perfect.

714
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,507
Let's bring a replay of that up on one.

715
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,543
Jesus.

716
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,135
We have to do that to all of them

717
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,201
if the time runs out?

718
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,544
No, it takes them out automatically.

719
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,208
What's the priest doing?

720
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,378
If the sat imagery is correct,

721
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,617
he is trying to sort his shit out.

722
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,716
Anything yet?

723
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,557
Nothing's happening. I'm too tense.

724
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,223
It's got to come out
one end or the other.

725
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,558
Can you not wait outside?

726
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,071
I'm staying put. now concentrate.

727
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,298
You're putting me off.

728
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,742
Can you whistle or something?

729
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,480
okay, who's Joshua's wife?

730
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,350
It doesn't matter.

731
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,389
okay.

732
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,322
I thought the way you
reacted when you heard-

733
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,622
Will you just leave it alone?

734
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,964
Bit of a confession in here, really, eh?

735
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,106
Confession can be incredibly hard.

736
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,613
It's painful to admit our sins

737
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,014
and trust ourselves in God's care.

738
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,988
But it helps.

739
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,120
It helps...

740
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,662
sometimes.

741
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,691
Why don't you tell me why you're here?

742
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,327
Hmm?

743
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,166
What's it got to do with Joshua's wife?

744
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,821
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes...

745
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,016
is understanding.

746
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,928
Somewhere, deep inside of them,

747
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,225
they've been expecting it.

748
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,927
Mary Harlow didn't have that look.

749
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,534
She just stared at me,

750
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,201
like you did this morning-

751
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,448
petrified, scared...

752
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,352
bewildered.

753
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,660
I saw in her eyes

754
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,423
that something was wrong.

755
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,800
Please!

756
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,661
My instincts told me to stop.

757
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,197
Please!

758
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,139
But I pulled the trigger anyway.

759
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,218
I didn't know it until afterwards,

760
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,449
but she was pregnant.

761
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,085
It's haunted me ever since.

762
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,525
That's why I have to
win this tournament...

763
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,465
so I can get enough money to vanish.

764
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,603
And if I don't win...

765
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,604
then I get what's coming.

766
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,924
Okay, Miss Hunter, the
final few players...

767
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,429
seem to be converging on the motorway.

768
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,828
We got Harlow on the move,

769
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,594
we're tracking Bogart nearby,

770
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,431
and the long shot,
Topuzov, is closing in fast.

771
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,200
Lai Lai Zhen and the
priest are sitting ducks.

772
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,711
We have to get out of here now.

773
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,813
- I haven't-
- Now.

774
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,414
Okay.

775
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,562
Shit.

776
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,339
Quick, get to the car.

777
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,142
Shit.

778
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,852
Oh, shit.

779
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,885
Come on!

780
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,923
What's going on?

781
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,457
- I'm taking your bus.
- What?

782
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,126
I'm taking your bus.

783
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:15,699
Drive.

784
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,202
- I can't drive a bus.
- Learn fast!

785
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,401
Fuck.

786
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,746
What about the passengers?

787
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,428
Everybody down!

788
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,224
Come on!

789
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,877
Lai Lai!

790
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:00,769
Fuck.

791
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,721
They're coming up on the Frenchman.

792
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,723
How is he gonna get in on the action?

793
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,928
Lai Lai! Come and see this.

794
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,592
I'm a little busy
now. Can you handle it?

795
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,239
It's more in your department, really!

796
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,977
Jeez, they're going way too fast.

797
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,012
They're out of control.

798
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,317
That guy's got a ticket.

799
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,284
Maybe not.

800
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,827
Holy shit. Lai Lai's taking a beating.

801
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,223
open the door!

802
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:55,748
Lai Lai!

803
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,980
Lai Lai, what are we gonna do?

804
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,078
Drive!

805
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,684
What have I done?

806
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,432
You saved me.

807
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:21,326
I'm gonna be sick.

808
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,282
Shit.

809
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,120
okay, that is confirmed, sir.

810
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:47,923
Bogart is down and the priest
has officially left the game.

811
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,556
What about Joshua?

812
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,843
Father...

813
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,073
what are you doing still here?

814
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,484
I cannot protect you anymore.

815
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,818
Please go.

816
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,118
I don't wanna go.

817
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,163
Why not?

818
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,730
You didn't abandon me,

819
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,735
so I'm not going to abandon you, yes?

820
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,515
We should go.

821
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,712
Come on.

822
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,358
only five minutes remaining,
ladies and gentlemen.

823
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,696
Let me remind you,

824
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,329
if we don't have a winner
when the time runs out,

825
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:39,237
we will pay out on the current
favorite, Joshua Harlow.

826
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,379
No cameras.

827
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,449
They cannot see us in here.

828
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,324
What did you say?

829
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,327
There are no cameras in there.

830
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,887
- What about satellite?
- They're indoors.

831
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,227
Did I speak to you?

832
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,495
There are 30 people in
there who paid $10 million.

833
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,866
We're in the final few minutes.

834
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:10,029
I want everything and anything

835
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,572
pointed at that fucking church!

836
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,437
Wow, that really helps.

837
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,004
okay, okay.

838
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:21,505
If we can't show what, we
can at least show where.

839
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,283
We'll give 'em something to watch.

840
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,957
You have to get to a hospital.

841
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,961
I want you to pray with me.

842
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,468
of course.

843
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,628
You said your prayers?

844
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,729
I hope you said goodbye.

845
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:20,604
Please, this is God's house.

846
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:21,801
no killing in God's house.

847
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,143
God? Why, Lai Lai?

848
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,806
Did someone send you,

849
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,647
or was it personal?

850
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,914
- Just kill me.
- no, no, no.

851
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,512
Get it over with.

852
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,890
Why?

853
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,588
Why'd you come after me?

854
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,528
Why'd you come after me?

855
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,193
I didn't come after you.

856
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,829
What?

857
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,602
I wasn't there for you.
I was there for her.

858
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,371
The contract was on your wife.

859
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:08,688
Why?

860
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,351
Why would anyone want to kill Mary? Why?

861
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,394
I don't know why.

862
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,861
We never know why.

863
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,526
Please, please. Joshua, please.

864
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,932
She's not to blame.

865
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,731
She's not to blame for any of this.

866
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:25,295
She's a device, like a tool.

867
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,671
- She didn't want to kill your wife.
- no, shut up!

868
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,903
- She didn't want
to kill- - Shut up!

869
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:34,878
Mary was my life.

870
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,919
Mary was my life! Who hired you?

871
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:41,149
She was your life. She was your life.

872
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:43,417
Don't dishonor her now with death.

873
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:44,981
Who hired you?

874
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,392
- You're dishonoring her with death!
- Shut up!

875
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,555
Who hired you?

876
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,395
You know who hired me.

877
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,834
Joshua, what would Mary do?

878
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,204
What would Mary have you do?

879
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,318
We have a winner.

880
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:33,097
Ladies and gentlemen,

881
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,329
I want to present to you...

882
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,497
the two-time winner of the Tournament.

883
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,007
Please be upstanding

884
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,273
for the greatest assassin of our time!

885
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,094
Joshua...

886
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,565
I know everything.

887
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,406
Why?

888
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,383
What?

889
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,885
I put on a good show, didn't I?

890
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,219
You can keep all this money that I won,

891
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:32,885
if you just tell me why
you murdered my wife.

892
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,128
You're delirious, Joshua.

893
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,792
I'm dying, but you're sweating.

894
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,530
now why is that?

895
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,734
What's the matter,
you afraid to admit it?

896
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,332
Come on.

897
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,934
Come on, we're all killers here!

898
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,738
You need a doctor.

899
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,074
You're being absurd.

900
01:25:55,150 --> 01:26:00,452
Why? Why did you murder my wife?

901
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,958
or are you too fucking gutless?

902
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,129
Why?

903
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,997
Because it was necessary.

904
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,767
You didn't want to come
back to the Tournament.

905
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,239
I wasn't going to accept that.

906
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,503
You're the reigning champion.

907
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,506
Look at you, Joshua!

908
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,947
You're a warrior, gladiator.

909
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,614
Men like you don't die in your beds,

910
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,213
they fall on the field.

911
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,285
They give the crowd...

912
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,886
a glorious death.

913
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,130
Why?

914
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,731
Why?

915
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,778
Because if I'd have just asked...

916
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:03,140
you'd have said no.

917
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,413
You needed a little motivation-

918
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,387
pressure...

919
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,292
on that little chink in the armor.

920
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,529
Close your eyes.

921
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,033
You and your wife

922
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:22,433
will be together soon.

923
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,965
I love you, baby.

924
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,446
Host. Joshua, wait! Wait!

925
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:35,615
Joshua!

926
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:36,615
Joshua!

927
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:42,252
We'll see her together.

928
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,664
Jesus, he took her tracker out.

929
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:01,265
override. It's gonna blow.

930
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,917
So, uh, I'm going to go home.

931
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,983
Yeah, me too.

932
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,598
newscaster. Terror
stepped up a notch today.

933
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,231
Bombs are believed to have gone off

934
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:08,570
in both a city center church

935
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,110
and a popular strip
bar on the outskirts...

936
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,443
our little town has been tested,

937
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:17,280
played witness to events
beyond comprehension,

938
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,582
besieged by darkness.

939
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,849
...many major road accidents,

940
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:24,448
the worst of which a
mile-long motorway pileup.

941
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,959
And yet, here we are again,

942
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,088
our spirits renewed...

943
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,824
reborn.

944
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:38,968
...the debilitating lack
of any CCTV footage...

945
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:43,636
...to increase surveillance
to blanket proportions.

946
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:44,507
Macavoy. I'm reminded of the words

947
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,810
of the American writer Robert Nathan

948
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:53,821
when he said, "We must
give thanks to the sorrow

949
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:56,948
"that shows us pity,

950
01:29:57,024 --> 01:30:01,085
"to the pain that teaches us courage,

951
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:04,131
"and to the mystery which
is a mystery still. "

952
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,839
Let us pray.

953
01:30:22,725 --> 01:30:58,325
