00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,487
I'll tell him.
I'll tell him, Florence.

475
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:36,622
Okay.
I'll tell him.

476
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,436
Hello. My name
is Minnie Moore.

477
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,738
I understand we're supposed
to have a lunch date.

478
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,010
Hi. I'm Zelmo.
Zelmo Swift.

479
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,313
I'm a friend of Earl's.
You know, my cousin Earl?

480
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,351
Gee, I'm charmed by you.
You know that?

481
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,419
I've been dyin' to meet you
for years and years.

482
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:13,638
Where shall we go to lunch?

483
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,764
You're tall and lovely.
How tall and lovely are you?

484
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,668
I'm five feet six.
Let's go to lunch.

485
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,804
Wow. (LAUGHS)

486
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,305
Wow!

487
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,627
ZELMO: Hey, park it conveniently. We're
going to have a fast lunch. Okay?

488
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,652
Right.

489
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,040
Good. That's okay.
Leave the bottle.

490
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,576
WAITER: (SPEAKS ITALIAN)
Okay. Fine. Thank you.

491
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:06,912
To the human heart.

492
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:08,980
To the human heart.

493
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,118
It's good.

494
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,922
Minnie, tell me about yourself.

495
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,725
I can't.

496
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,427
(SCOFFS)

497
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,495
You can't tell me
about yourself?

498
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,431
No. I really can't.

499
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,798
Well, tell me
something. Anything.

500
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,634
Something where
I can get to know you.

501
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:34,039
Well, I'm single,
I live alone and I, uh,

502
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,574
I work at the museum.

503
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,511
That's it?
That's all there is?

504
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,713
That's not much to go on, is it?

505
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,949
Can't you tell me
something else?

506
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,751
Let me tell you, all right?

507
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,820
Let's see, now.
You weren't born here.

508
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:52,824
You were born in the north.
Right? Am I right?

509
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:56,528
You were born from, uh...
New York to Wisconsin.

510
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,196
Near Canada.

511
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,031
And both your parents are alive.

512
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,633
How about that?

513
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,435
Well, that's
a dumb thing to say.

514
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,837
What is?
I mean, my father's dead.

515
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,973
Oh, no.
Gee, I'm sorry.

516
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,675
No. I don't mean
it's your fault.

517
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,078
I mean, when you're guessing
it's a dumb thing to say...

518
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:16,114
Actually,
it was very perceptive.

519
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,585
Are you, uh,
clairvoyant or anything?

520
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:20,986
You funny?
You putting me on?

521
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:25,691
No, really. I was born
in New York, in Niagara Falls.

522
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,930
In Niagara Falls?
In the Falls?

523
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,467
Oh, no.
I was born in...

524
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,737
In New York, near the Falls.

525
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,575
You're terrific. What a terrific sense
of humor you got. You know that?

526
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:46,878
Oh, what a lovely person.
You know, I would say...

527
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,581
I'd say you're very
romantically inclined.

528
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,049
True?

529
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,720
Yes, it's true.
I knew that.

530
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,888
I know. You don't
take romance lightly.

531
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,525
If you fall in love with a man
it has to be for keeps.

532
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:00,792
Am I right?

533
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:03,595
Yes, you're
absolutely right, Zelmo.

534
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,867
You know, now that
I screwed that up,

535
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,237
what do we drink to?
Let's drink to something.

536
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,610
Zelmo, let's drink to happiness.

537
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:22,180
Okay, let's drink... Let's drink
to you and to your happiness.

538
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:27,152
You know, you're a very lovely
person. Do you know that?

539
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,224
How come you called me?

540
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,927
When you called me,
what made you call me?

541
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,530
No, you don't have to answer
that. That's all right.

542
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:41,032
I understand.

543
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:45,203
You know, I don't go out much.
Did you know that?

544
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,306
I'm actually scared of women. You
must be frightened of men too, huh?

545
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,742
I don't know what to say
to them, to women.

546
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:53,311
I say,
"Hello, how are you?"

547
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,547
I say anything I can think of,

548
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,083
but I don't say anything.
Not really.

549
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,286
I'm a loner.
I'm always alone.

550
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,956
My interests are in Keats,
Shelley, Swinburne, Shakespeare,

551
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,192
Marlowe, Wordsworth,

552
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,128
opera, poetry, music.

553
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,164
Did you know I was reading
since I was twelve years old?

554
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,668
I wear glasses now,
I read so much.

555
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,838
That's funny. I would've
sworn you were a businessman.

556
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,240
Nah, I hate business,
Minnie, hate it.

557
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,110
It's funny,
because I'm a rich man.

558
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,245
But I hate making money.

559
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,947
I don't know what to do with it.

560
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,117
I wake up in the morning,
I say, "Zelmo",

561
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,153
"oh, Zelmo, what are you
gonna do with all your money?"

562
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,923
What can I do with my money?

563
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,725
I don't know.

564
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,260
I give it to charity,
I give it to friends.

565
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,964
I buy a big house,
I take vacations.

566
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:50,035
From what, I don't know.
But I go on, I go on.

567
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,007
I'm not married anymore.

568
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,878
I was married to a...

569
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,880
Actually, she was
a very rare woman.

570
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,617
We didn't have any children,
so it didn't last long.

571
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,252
I mean...

572
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:10,155
I made a big mistake on our
wedding night, you know?

573
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,990
Personal stuff.

574
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:19,364
Minnie, you know, you're very
easy to talk to. You know that?

575
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,000
You look like you care about me.

576
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:28,406
You know, that's a rare quality to have.
A terrific quality.

577
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,243
You know, the people that listen
continuously are much more fascinating

578
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,279
than the people that talk.

579
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,049
Look at your eyes.
They're so moist.

580
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,386
You're so sensitive.
That's a terrific quality.

581
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,023
Very rare today. Very rare today.
You know that?

582
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,895
Uh... Zelmo...

583
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,868
I'm all confused. You've got
me confused. I don't know...

584
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:59,671
I can't think clearly
when you're around.

585
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:01,807
You know, I'm a very lonely man.

586
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,677
If I could find someone
it could be you.

587
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:09,014
Someone that had your qualities.
Someone that when I took her hand,

588
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,982
she wouldn't pull it away.

589
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,285
Zelmo, let's order,
because it's really very late.

590
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,990
Look at your hands,
they're so delicate.

591
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,693
You know, they're so
sensitive. Do you know that...

592
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:26,164
I can tell everything you're thinking by
the way you're flickin' your fingers.

593
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,970
Minnie, you know
what my trouble is?

594
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:35,106
I've got hair down my back and
on my chest and down my arms.

595
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,143
But not on my legs.
My legs are very smooth.

596
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,712
Oh, geez. What am I...
I'm embarrassing you.

597
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:42,714
No, no. That's Okay. I...

598
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,850
Listen, I'm going
to have the veal piccata.

599
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:47,953
Gee, I don't know why I can't
get that feeling across to you.

600
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:50,455
I can't get you to feel what
I'm feeling. It's very hard.

601
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,758
It is very hard.

602
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:58,429
Listen, my wife died,
so I'm not divorced.

603
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:02,200
Zelmo, I don't want
to hurt you, but...

604
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,401
How can you hurt me?

605
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:06,104
Well, I mean, uh...

606
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:10,842
Everything that you're saying to me, I
know it must be very painful to you.

607
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:13,478
And, uh...
I made you uneasy, didn't I?

608
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:17,749
Zelmo, I just want you to know

609
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,819
that I have absolutely no
personal interest in you.

610
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,321
I really just
wanted to have lunch.

611
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:31,863
I think we'd better go.
I'm terribly sorry.

612
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,165
Lunch.

613
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,002
Oh, Jesus. With blondes!

614
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,537
Blondes!

615
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,372
What is it with you blondes?

616
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:45,043
You all have some Swedish
suicide impulse? Huh?

617
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,446
I took a blonde to lunch once, next thing
you know she wanted me to kick her.

618
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,782
I said, me kick you?
For what?

619
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:53,118
What's that supposed
to be, something?

620
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,787
Hey, check.
Gimme my check.

621
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,492
Here. Here's my credit card.
Take my credit card.

622
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:04,362
Another time in Trenton, New Jersey,
this friend of mine says to me,

623
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:08,166
"Why don't you go out with this girl?" I
said, "All right. I'll go out with her."

624
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,969
She's got three kids.
We come back to her place.

625
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:14,472
I says, "Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

783
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,784
Good evening.
May I help you?

784
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:42,553
Yes, I'd like a beer to start.
One beer.

785
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,555
What do you want?
Vermouth cassis.

786
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,824
Vermouth cassis.
What's that?

787
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,926
Vermouth cassis?

788
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,896
It's a type of beverage. Sorry,
honey, I don't know what it is.

789
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:55,065
What is it?
It's, uh...

790
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,201
It's just dry vermouth
with a little cassis.

791
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,435
Right. That's it.

792
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,239
Let me get this clear. Tell me,
honey, do you put ice in it?

793
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:05,342
Tell it to the bartender and
he'll fix it for you. Okay?

794
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,045
I'm just trying to find out
if you put ice in it.

795
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,848
Well, ask the bartender.
That's his job.

796
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,784
And don't look at me like that.

797
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:16,086
Don't look at me like that
or I'll get up.

798
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,027
Car. Uh... The truck.

799
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,195
Yes, sir, you got your ticket?
Thank you.

800
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,164
Be right with you, sir.
SEYMOUR: "Sir"?

801
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,874
(ENGINE STARTING)

802
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,381
(LOUD SCRAPING)
Hey!

803
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,216
Hey, man. Hey!

804
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,356
Sorry about that
brick wall, sir.

805
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,931
Good night. There's no tip
necessary. Thank you.

806
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:04,034
People just don't
like their work, man.

807
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:07,638
They can't do their jobs.
They have no respect for cars.

808
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:11,408
They don't like people.
What the hell they livin' for?

809
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,179
There. That looks like a...

810
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:18,683
No, no. I don't like the looks
of that joint. Forget it.

811
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,818
Hold on,
I'm gonna make a U-turn.

812
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,738
Unbelievable.

813
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:46,711
Unbelievable.

814
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,880
Unbelievable.

815
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:52,850
It costs more to park your car
than it does to eat.

816
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:55,252
You got parking lot of the brain.
Yeah.

817
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:57,922
My brain's a parking lot.

818
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:59,757
You're a funny guy.

819
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,126
I don't think
of myself as funny.

820
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,995
That's why I'm funny. If you
think of yourself as funny,

821
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:08,432
you become tragic. Really. I know a
lot of guys who think they're funny.

822
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:11,235
They have tremendous pressure
on them to be funny.

823
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:14,705
I knew a guy used to stand in front
of a mirror, make funny faces.

824
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:16,974
Practiced his timing.

825
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,977
Hell, all you have to do to have
a good time is just be yourself.

826
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,988
What do you want?
Could I have a menu?

827
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,124
No, we don't have a menu.
Everything's up on the sign.

828
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:38,395
I'll have the chili beans
and two hot dogs.

829
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,865
Do you have malteds?
We sure do.

830
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:45,002
Okay. I'll have one. That's with
vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.

831
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:49,373
Not chocolate ice cream
and vanilla syrup. Got that?

832
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,442
You go somewhere and order a
malted, they always get it wrong.

833
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:55,145
Would you just tell me
what you want?

834
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:59,149
Look, just make it
any way you want.

835
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:02,887
You know, before I met you,
I thought I was in trouble.

836
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,056
It's annoying living. You not only
have to learn their language,

837
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,025
you have to learn
their emotions.

838
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,761
Well...
Well, nothing. It's true.

839
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:15,032
You know what I like about you?

840
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,134
You like me?

841
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:20,170
You talk about practical things.

842
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,939
You talk about eating,

843
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:24,875
you talk about spending money,
you talk about cars.

844
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,778
And that's it.
Are you kidding?

845
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:31,415
I talk about everything, except
what I want to talk about.

846
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,921
I mean, when I first
looked at you I...

847
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,423
I said, "There she is.
That's the girl."

848
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,425
"That's the girl
I'm in love with."

849
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,128
And that was the first time
I looked at you.

850
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:03,313
(MUMBLING)

851
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:05,549
Salt.
Hey, you got any salt?

852
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,519
Spill those goddamn
beans on my pants.

853
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,159
I usually eat alone.

854
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,428
In fact, I usually eat
in my shorts.

855
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:29,106
I don't get it. I don't know
if you're dumb or what.

856
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,376
You got me so off-balance, I'm
spilling things on my pants.

857
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,980
I'm worried about the way I eat.
I talk to you, you don't listen.

858
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,915
It cost me a fortune
to buy that malted milk,

859
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,317
It cost me a fortune to park
the car to take you out.

860
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:43,387
What is it with you?

861
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,357
I don't get depressed. You got
a way of depressing me.

862
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,426
You put your
sunglasses on at night.

863
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,900
I never missed with anyone before,
not if I was turning it on.

864
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:58,535
And I'm turning it on.
Are you ready?

865
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,637
No. Are you through?
Yeah, I'm through.

866
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,074
Well, I'm not ready.
I'm not through.

867
01:04:04,108 --> 01:04:06,310
You get me beat up,
and I lose my job.

868
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,546
And you, you look so beautiful.

869
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,549
So pretty.

870
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,351
I guess I'm sayin' this
for nothin'.

871
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,054
I mean,
it's all over between us.

872
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:20,524
What's all over between us?
Whatever.

873
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,993
You got a way of
lookin' down on people,

874
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:25,162
of thinkin' that you're
better than they are.

875
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,564
Actually, you're just
a girl with good looks.

876
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:32,202
But it's so damned depressing to sit with
someone who takes themselves so seriously.

877
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,092
Good night.

878

01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:21,952
Mmm.

880
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,054
You didn't give me time.

881
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,925
Just a minute.

882
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:55,185
Well, yeah. Right.

883
01:05:57,121 --> 01:06:00,024
Well, it's the same old story.

884
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:02,659
Then...

885
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,333
Then I get this other guy and
I stay with him for a while.

886
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,635
And then...

887
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:15,539
I roomed with this girl, right?

888
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,143
She hates eggs.

889
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,278
I love 'em.

890
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,180
That's a problem
when you're living

891
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,782
with someone that hates eggs.

892
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,052
She can't stand 'em.

893
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:30,787
I loved them boiled, scrambled,

894
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,024
any way you
can eat 'em. Raw.

895
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:37,161
Anywhere. But every
time I'm cooking an egg,

896
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:39,396
she has to leave the room.

897
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,667
So then I said,
"Okay."

898
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:48,272
I figure, boy, I need a rest.

899
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,007
I really need a rest.

900
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:56,446
So it's Sacramento, here I come.

901

I have to see my mother.

902
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:05,089
I mean, she can't
pay the gas bill,

903
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:07,324
she can't pay the light bill,

904
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,727
she can't... She can't
pay any bill.

905
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,135
You know? Huh?

what I'm saying?

No?

909
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,179
You don't know what I'm saying?

Sorry to get you up so early,

01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:19,396

and take care of myself, you know,

917
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:23,133
it'll be that time.
So who cares, right?

918
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,568

it's not the right face.

I'm not humiliated in there.

1250
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:22,417
(WATER RUNNING)

1251
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,890
Oh, I'm sorry, Minnie.
Oh, it's not your fault.

1252
01:35:27,923 --> 01:35:30,392
Oh, Seymour,
it's not your fault. It's not.

1253
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,896
I mean, there's some...

1254
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:38,033
There's some kind of craziness
going on here that's not right.

1255
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,936
No, I mean, every time you come
near me you get beaten up.

1256
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:45,908
Every time I come near you
I get cut or I get

1257
01:35:45,941 --> 01:35:47,810
punched or something.
It's not right, Seymour.

1258
01:35:47,843 --> 01:35:49,878
SEYMOUR:
Minnie, I... I just...

1259
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:51,313
I mean, it just happened,
Minnie.

1260
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,782
I know. I mean, it started
and it just happened.

1261
01:35:53,816 --> 01:35:56,118
I don't know.
I know, I know, Seymour.

1262
01:35:56,151 --> 01:36:00,022
It's just not there.
Don't you understand? It's...

1263
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:03,258
It's a pretend place that people
get to and they always...

1264
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:06,461
They just never say it,
but it doesn't exist.

1265
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:09,331
It's not there, Seymour.
It just isn't there.

1266
01:36:09,364 --> 01:36:10,665
SEYMOUR: I think it is.

1267
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:14,837
(SOBBING) No, Seymour, it isn't.
It's nothing, don't you see?

1268
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:17,205
It's just nothing.

1269
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,875
(SNIFFLING) Oh, give me
a cigarette, please.

1270
01:36:20,843 --> 01:36:22,177

God damn it, God damn it.

1273
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:37,225
Seymour, what are you doing?
Stop it.

1274
01:36:37,259 --> 01:36:41,263
Nothin'. I'll just clean this up. I'll
clean it up so you don't hurt yourself.

1275
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,331
No. I can do that.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1276
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:45,533
I can do it, Seymour.
Minnie, don't you see?

1277
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:47,269
That's what happens
when you love someone.

1278
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,470
Stop it, Seymour.

1279
01:36:48,503 --> 01:36:50,105
Oh, man.

1280
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:53,842
You punch doors.
You make a fool of yourself...

1281
01:36:53,876 --> 01:36:55,143
You...

1282
01:36:55,177 --> 01:36:58,313
God damn it, I don't know!
You know?

1283
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:01,249
Please go home, Seymour.

1284
01:37:01,283 --> 01:37:05,253
Minnie, I don't believe it. Every girl
I've ever known has been in love with me.

1285
01:37:05,287 --> 01:37:08,924
The only girl I'm in love with
doesn't even like me.

1286
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:13,962
God damn it, I know you love me.

1287

MINNIE: No. No, I don't.

1288
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:18,400
You do. You do.
I can't, Seymour. I can't.

1289
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:20,068
You can.
No, I can't.

1290
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:22,370
Oh, please go, Seymour.
Please.

1291
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:24,406
No, I won't go.
I know you love me.

1292
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,208
No, I...

1293
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:29,144
I think I'm gonna faint.
Honest.

I love you! Believe that.

Jesus Christ!
What do you want me to do?

1298
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:44,960
What do you want me to do?
You want me to kill myself?

1299
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:47,595
You want me to hurt me? What?

1300
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:54,502
Is that it? Look at that.

1301
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:56,614
Is that what you want? Do you
want me to do that to me?

1302
01:37:56,638 --> 01:37:58,440
Or do you want me
to do it to you?

1303
01:37:58,974 --> 01:38:00,976
What?

1304
01:38:01,009 --> 01:38:03,511
Tell me. Talk...
God damn it, tell me.

1305

Huh.

01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:42,710
Seymour.
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

1406
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:44,011
I'm so happy to see you.

1407
01:44:44,045 --> 01:44:47,915
Oh, Seymour,
she's got a good body.

1408
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:51,353
She's got a good body
and a good face.

1409
01:44:51,986 --> 01:44:54,522
Cute kid. I like that.

1410
01:44:54,556 --> 01:44:56,358
Come on, here. Sit down.

1411
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:59,727
Over here. Sit over here.
Next to your boyfriend.

1412
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:02,464
Don't forget the manners
I taught you.

1413
01:45:02,497 --> 01:45:05,367
I'm gonna sit down beside you.

1414
01:45:09,904 --> 01:45:13,107
GEORGIA: Uh, well, I think
we should begin by ordering.

1415
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,542
Don't you?

1416
01:45:16,378 --> 01:45:18,480
What kind of food
do they have here?

1417
01:45:18,513 --> 01:45:20,482
SEYMOUR: Restaurant food, Mom.

1418
01:45:20,515 --> 01:45:24,085
He doesn't know anything,
he eats in hamburger joints.

1419
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:27,689
Actually, I think they specialize
in steaks, Mrs. Moskowitz.

1420
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:31,726
In steaks, eh? This is a
spaghetti and meatball joint.

1421
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:34,362
Maybe they've got steaks,
maybe you're right.

1422
01:45:34,396 --> 01:45:36,831
Maybe they have a steak
they can throw at us.

1423
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:42,136
Seymour, when did you two meet?

1424
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,739
Um, about four days ago, right?

1425
01:45:44,772 --> 01:45:46,508
Yes, four days ago.

1426
01:45:46,541 --> 01:45:50,144
Four days ago?
Right. Four days.

1427
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:53,615
Don't you know
when you met the girl?

1428
01:45:53,648 --> 01:45:57,752
Four days? To be safe,
it would have to be a year.

1429
01:45:57,785 --> 01:46:01,523
You don't know anything about
a woman until you marry her.

1430
01:46:01,556 --> 01:46:05,860
Dummy! Don't you remember
what I told you?

1431
01:46:05,893 --> 01:46:08,830
Georgia, how tall are you?
MINNIE: She's five-feet-nine.

1432
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:10,732
Five-nine.

1433
01:46:10,765 --> 01:46:12,634
Yes, five-nine.

1434
01:46:12,667 --> 01:46:14,736
Of course, with heels.

1435
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:16,671
I know.
You wear shoes with heels.

1436
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,706
You don't go around
barefoot, do you?

1437
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:29,917
(SEYMOUR AND MINNIE COUGHING)

1438
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:39,561
Well, uh...

1439
01:46:41,663 --> 01:46:45,667
When Minnie was five she had
curls all over her head.

1440
01:46:46,868 --> 01:46:50,071
We called her
our Shirley Temple.

1441
01:46:50,104 --> 01:46:52,740
And she had the biggest eyes
you ever saw.

1442
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:56,077
And a lisp.

1443
01:46:56,110 --> 01:47:00,582
You know that lisp that children
have that we think is so adorable?

1444
01:47:00,615 --> 01:47:03,451
So one day she came
to me and she said,

1445
01:47:03,485 --> 01:47:07,088
"Mommy,
I want to help you work."

1446
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:11,659
And I said, "Well, darling,
what do you want to do?"

1447
01:47:11,693 --> 01:47:16,063
And she said, "I want to help
you clean the bathrooms."

1448
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:20,602
So I said, "All right."

1449
01:47:20,635 --> 01:47:24,672
"If you want to clean the bathrooms,
you clean the bathrooms."

1450
01:47:24,706 --> 01:47:27,942
"And Mommy will give you
a dime."

1451
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:33,748
So we put a little apron
on her and gave her a sponge,

1452
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:38,620
and some cleanser. I think
it was Bab-O at the time.

1453
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:41,756
And she got down
on her hands and knees

1454
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,959
and began scrubbing
and scrubbing.

1455
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:49,497
In a while I looked down at that
little thing and there she was,

1456
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:52,266
working her little heart out
and I thought,

1457
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,569
"I'll give her a hand."

1458
01:47:54,602 --> 01:47:58,740
But she said, "Mommy,
I will do it mine self."

1459
01:47:59,941 --> 01:48:01,943
She was so cute.

1460
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:05,079
They grow up so fast.

1461
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:09,684
And here I am today,

1462
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:14,221
looking at my little curly-haired
girl that I adore so much,

1463
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:18,259
and she wants to get married.

1464
01:48:20,027 --> 01:48:22,830
And I think it's wonderful.

1465
01:48:22,864 --> 01:48:25,266
What's so wonderful about it?

1466
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,803
Seymour is a car parker.

1467
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:31,539
Your daughter's very attractive.

1468
01:48:31,573 --> 01:48:33,675
She doesn't have curly hair,

1469
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:36,944
and she's not
five years old anymore.

1470
01:48:36,978 --> 01:48:40,047
And Seymour! (GROANS)

1471
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:43,551
Albert Einstein he's not.

1472
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:45,319
Georgia, that's your name,
isn't it, honey?

1473
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:46,888
Yes, Georgia Moore.

1474
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:50,592
Georgia,
where are they gonna sleep?

1475
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:52,694
What are they gonna eat?

1476
01:48:52,727 --> 01:48:54,762
Georgia,

1477
01:48:54,796 --> 01:49:00,001
my son is going to be the
father of your daughter's baby.

1478
01:49:00,935 --> 01:49:02,937
Mom! There's no baby!

1479
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,107
What are you talking about?
I would've told you that.

1480
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:09,577
What did you tell your mother?
Nothing! I didn't say nothin'.

1481
01:49:09,611 --> 01:49:12,346
So, what's the reason
to get married?

1482
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:16,918
Why don't you two live
with each other? It's easier.

1483
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:20,021
MINNIE: Mrs. Moskowitz,

1484
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:23,157
your son and I love each other
and we're going to be married

1485
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,727
and I hope you approve.

1486
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:29,263
What have I got
to say about it, darling?

1487
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:31,198
It's your life.

1488
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:35,136
You want to marry this bum,
go ahead and marry him.

1489
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:44,712
Georgia, they're gonna
be turnin' to us every day.

1490
01:49:44,746 --> 01:49:47,248
How do you think
this bum got here?

1491
01:49:47,281 --> 01:49:50,718
I gave him 400 dollars
from my savings.

1492
01:49:50,752 --> 01:49:53,821
I've got no husband
to take care of me.

1493
01:49:54,989 --> 01:50:00,261
Uh, Seymour,
uh, what are your plans?

1494
01:50:00,294 --> 01:50:02,630
SEYMOUR: I'm thinking
of getting a bigger...

1495
01:50:02,664 --> 01:50:05,299
Going to work for
a bigger company, Mrs. Moore.

1496
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:08,670
GEORGIA: Well,
is there anything definite?

1497
01:50:08,703 --> 01:50:11,372
No, but I don't like working
for restaurants,

1498
01:50:11,405 --> 01:50:15,843
because if the business goes
off, or the food isn't good,

1499
01:50:15,877 --> 01:50:17,712
or something, you know...

1500
01:50:17,745 --> 01:50:21,115
I just think that if I go
to a regular parking lot

1501
01:50:21,148 --> 01:50:24,285
for a big company,
I'll do a lot better.

1502
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:31,425
Mother, Seymour likes cars.
He's very happy with cars.

1503
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,027
Yeah.

1504
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:36,030
SHEBA: I don't know how
to make it any plainer.

1505
01:50:36,063 --> 01:50:39,066
This boy here has no ambition.

1506
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,936
He's not pretty.
Look at him.

1507
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,405
Suavity, he doesn't have.

1508
01:50:46,107 --> 01:50:47,374
He eats sideways.

1509
01:50:47,408 --> 01:50:50,978
The food keeps going
into the mouth this way.

1510
01:50:51,012 --> 01:50:53,214
He's deaf.

1511
01:50:53,247 --> 01:50:55,950
This girl of yours
is very attractive.

1512
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,451
She's got nice hair.

1513
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:01,188
And she could do very well
marrying some normal man.

1514
01:51:01,222 --> 01:51:04,025
So, if there's no baby coming...

1515
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:07,094
SEYMOUR: Oh, shit, Ma.

Shit. I mean...
