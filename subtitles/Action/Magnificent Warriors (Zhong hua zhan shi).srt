18
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,760
Let me tell you, use whatever way to persuade Yunyun to come back.

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,060
This concerns the cooperation between Darwin and ZM Group.

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,820
Nothing else matters. You women

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,620
never know what's more important.

22
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,570
Dad, how many times have I told you?

23
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,930
Yunyun and my wedding has nothing to do with the co-operation. If you want to use our wedding

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,250
to gain any benefits from Darwin, then you should forget it.

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,370
This isn't the reason why I want to marry Yunyun.

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,900
What is wrong with you lately? Why do you talk back to me?

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,030
Who did you learn it from? Did you know if someone else heard what you said,

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,640
everyone would think of it as a joke.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,330
You better remember your role as the general manager.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,630
The collaboration between two major corporations won't last long if there isn't any marriage union to fall back on.

31
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,250
Also, the projects for cooperation with Darwin,

32
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,750
you better not mess it up. If you do,

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,550
you might as well not get married.

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,250
Don't worry. I will do as you wish.

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,600
To complete the wedding perfectly.

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,530
But it isn't because of any advantage, nor it is for ZM Group.

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,610
I did it for myself.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,900
Can't you just go with our son for once?

39
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,480
Just now, those were the  stirrings of love on your face.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,240
How do you change so much when we talk about work?

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,590
I'm depressed.

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,160
I still can't get Ian's recognition in Bertone.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,710
He doesn't even regard me as his student.

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,780
I've worked so hard, it's not for my idol to hate me.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,090
Stop drinking! You're drinking wine as if it were water. It's bad for you skin.

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,920
Who cares. Only alcohol can comfort me now.

47
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,310
Look, Tian!

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,090
Now that Qianjin said that he likes me,

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,380
I don't know what has gotten over him. I think I should go look for a Daoist priest to change my fortune.

50
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,190
Why is it bad luck if Qianjin likes you?

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,610
This is a fate that Heaven has destined.

52
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,590
No, no. I don't want it.

53
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,180
Right now, I'm worried about this situation. So awkward.

54
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,160
What happened to the fearless Chen Zhen that I knew? Has she gone missing?

55
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,730
The fearless Chen Zhen has been defeated by reality.

56
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,770
I've been despised by my idol. I've been overwhelmed by my inferiority–

57
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,220
Then just be re-born it again.

58
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,670
What do you mean?

59
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,890
For example, accept Qianjin's confession.

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,340
Maybe Qianjin is the right man for you in this life.

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,580
With him as the man behind you, all things will go smoothly for you

62
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,700
and lead straight to success.

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,430
I'm going to the toilet.

64
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,080
Zhen!

65
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,250
Enough.

66
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,180
Why can't you love me?

67
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,450
I loved you for more than ten years.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,920
Can you bear to push me away?

69
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,820
Do you have someone that you like?

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,860
If you don't, then can you

71
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,100
see the fact that I have waited for you for over ten years–

72
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,650
Don't talk about this. I ignored your feelings.

73
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,890
It was my problem, sorry. If I found out earlier, then this may not have happened.

74
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,920
You can't stop it. There's nothing you can do.

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Just like me, I thought I could not love you.

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,470
But I can't do it.

77
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,690
Stop saying such things.

78
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,080
Which part of me isn't good?

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,350
Why are you always cold towards me?

80
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,940
- I treat everyone the same.
- No.

81
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,230
You don't treat Wang Xiao like that. You are warm towards him and bear with him.

82
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,020
Because Wang Xiao loves me,

83
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,100
so... you controlled yourself to not love me. Am I right?

84
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,040
Yunyun, I've already clearly told you about my rejection.

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,150
I don't understand. I really don't understand.

86
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,500
What is the barrier that's stopping us?

87
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,760
Some people don't have love from birth. You can't tell me to use something I don't have.

88
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't use this lousy reason to reject me.

89
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,670
That means that you really don't understand me.

90
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,290
Why are they here?

91
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,450
Two love rivals appearing at the same time. This can only mean one thing.

92
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,430
You mean that...

93
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,270
Shen Yun knows about Ian and Wang Xiao's relationship and told him to come here?

94
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,980
To negotiate.

95
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,350
The plot is reaching closer to the climax.

96
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,230
What do we do? I'm so nervous. So exciting.

97
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,350
Hey, Zhenzhen. Who are you rooting for?

98
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,410
Of course, Shen Yun. A woman should support other women.

99
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,210
And those two men have deceived her from the beginning. We can't tolerate it.

100
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,160
But these two men, one is prince charming and the other is your master.

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,690
I don't care anymore. In the face of morality and justice, I choose

102
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,650
righteousness!

103
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,200
After you left, I tried my best to be worthy of you.

104
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,480
I've studied my way up to the research institute.

105
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,920
I entered the company and worked hard to make the company

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,890
increase in sales. I just wanted

107
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,920
every part of me to be perfect and outstanding.

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,790
I also hope that one day

109
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,450
that  you will realize that I'm the brightest star. I want you to notice me.

110
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,310
Maybe love is what motivated you to go forward, but that's not my case and it will never be.

111
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,460
So much that it doesn't even cross my sight.

112
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,070
Do you not need love?

113
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,430
I indeed do not need it.

114
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,850
So if you want it, I can't give you any.

115
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,740
Please don't leave!

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,260
Why do you like me? Because you're the princess.

117
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,700
You're looking forward to some day that a prince will come and save you. But I'm not that prince.

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,970
Wang Xiao is your prince.

119
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,020
No, he's not. If one day you can love someone,

120
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,100
then you'll understand how "she" is

121
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,960
more important than your life.

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,160
You place too much importance on love, it's too unhealthy.

123
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,110
You're the one that's unhealthy.

124
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,580
You've worked so hard within the 10 years because you were looking for that one person.

125
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,830
Rejecting love, rejecting all women around you.

126
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,660
Now your mother isn't here anymore. You should think for yourself.

127
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,980
A person can't live without love.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,360
You drank too much. I will get some water for you.

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,400
You can't leave!

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,180
Can't you just look at me? I'm Shen Yun.

131
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,470
The Shen Yun whom everyone cherishes and regards as their darling.

132
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,940
Why can't you see me? Why can't you care?

133
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,580
Ten years ago, you left without a note. Now you're leaving  again?

134
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,590
You can't leave without taking responsibility.

135
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,930
Today, we must be clear on everything.

136
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,210
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,630
Stop! Don't go!

138
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,910
That person there, what's his situation?

139
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,830
How should I know? Let's wait and see.

140
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,370
Uh, she had a bit too much today. She didn't mean to splash on you.

141
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,730
What do you mean not on purpose? Then do you mean she poured it on me and it's fine?

142
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,650
- No.. I don't mean that
- What does it have to do with you? 
- Okay, enough.

143
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,480
Go away!

144
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,960
- Then what do you want? 
- Pay up.

145
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,390
We are men. Just let go of it, all right? Bye.

146
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,790
What are you looking at? You should hurry home!

147
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,630
Why are you so fierce?

148
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,070
You have to feel sorry toward Shen Yun. Aren't you responsible for hurting her and losing her happiness?

149
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,870
<i>Hey, stop! Don't go!</i>

150
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,260
<i>You made my clothes wet and you want to leave? Pay for it!</i>

151
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,230
Pay what for? Are you trying to extort money?

152
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,490
- I'm extorting you, so? 
- I detest people like you. Go in and we will discuss. Come, come.

153
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,020
- Hey!
- Go in.

154
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,500
Don't start a fight! Stop it!

155
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,590
They are starting a fight.

156
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,480
- Don't fight!
- Don't fight! Don't fight!

157
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,190
- Stop! 
- Stop fighting.

158
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,420
Did I cause this? What do we do? Should we call the police?

159
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,040
Call the police. Hurry!

160
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
Or should we call the ambulance?

161
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
- Which one should we call? 
- The police!

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,770
Stop it!<i> Don't fight anymore!</i>

163
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,750
<i>- Save me!
- What are you screaming for?</i>

164
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,170
<i>You don't even admit that I'm your disciple. I don't know any martial arts, how do I save you?</i>

165
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,070
<i>You did this to yourself. Let's go.</i>

166
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,560
<i>You traitor!</i>

167
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,920
Warrior, I never knew you were so good at fighting. You made me worry for nothing.

168
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,640
I will find time to settle this score with you.

169
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
Did I say something wrong?

170
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,940
Did you get hurt?

171
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,080
Can you stop being so impulsive!

172
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Don't think you're on your own and nothing matters.

173
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,450
If something bad happen to you, what should I do?

174
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,350
Let me go!

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,340
Let go.

176
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,830
Wang Xiao...

177
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,370
Wang Xiao...

178
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,260
Hey, look out!

179
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,280
Yunyun, are you all right?

180
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,020
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

181
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,980
Why are you so good to me?

182
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,590
It's okay.

183
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,150
Who did this?

184
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,270
Who started the fight? What happened?

185
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,980
Hey, he started first! My hands are bleeding already.

186
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,350
How can you say that! It was them who started it.

187
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,080
Yes! I can be the witness!

188
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,950
Why did you start the fight?

189
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,820
- His hand is hurt. Can he go to the hospital first?
- I'm all right.

190
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,240
The bottle was smashed. How could you say it's fine?

191
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,320
If they go to the hospital, we are going too. See, I'm also bleeding.

192
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,800
- That's right. 
- Quiet down. Back to my original question.

193
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,160
Why did you start the fight?

194
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,060
We couldn't stand him cheating that lady's feelings.

195
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,700
We were lending a helping hand. Is that wrong?

196
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,550
Sir, you've misunderstood!

197
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,660
I think you've misunderstood my relationship with my older brother.

198
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,140
Older brother?!

199
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,580
My name is Wang Xiao.

200
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,920
<i>- He is called Wang Yi.
- Really an idiot!</i>

201
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,390
<i>Miss Chen, do you admit you are guilty?</i>

202
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,960
<i>Sir, please let me live. I'm innocent.</i>

203
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,450
<i>Outrageous shrew! It's clear you who can't distinguish right and wrong.</i>

204
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,360
<i>This is deliberate misrepresentation, spreading false rumors everywhere, tarnishing others' reputation.</i>

205
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,410
<i>How are you innocent?</i>

206
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,490
<i>Sir, I didn't do it on purpose. I admit my mistake.</i>

207
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,290
<i>Even though you admit, but the mistake has already been made.</i>

208
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,580
<i>This crime cannot be revoked.</i>

209
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,530
<i>Sir!</i>

210
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,300
<i>How should I punish you?</i>

211
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,080
<i>She loves to gossip. How about slicing her tongue off?</i>

212
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,650
<i>Blinded from the truth. How about taking her eyes out?</i>

213
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,530
<i>If there is a problem with someone's intelligence, even if you slice her tongue and pull her eyes out</i>

214
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,060
<i>that still doesn't solve the problem.</i>

215
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,990
<i>Let her learn how to become how a good person again; learn the right ethics.</i>

216
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,310
<i>But a person's intelligence is already set from birth, you can't change it.</i>

217
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,240
<i>That's true. No matter how hard a pig washes itself, it is still a pig.</i>

218
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,670
<i>You guys are right. I'm not even worth a pig.</i>

219
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,160
<i>How about I die instead?</i>

220
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,060
<i>-This is a big misunderstanding.</i>
-So I was right.

221
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,950
- It was him. He toyed with the lady's feelings.
- Right.

222
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,740
You are trying to give me a love story, right?

223
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,400
Who can say it clearly?

224
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,130
Miss Shen, can you confirm your relationship between you three?

225
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,120
One is my fiance...

226
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,770
- I am their brother-- 
- ...and the person I love.

227
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Wang Xiao, Shen Yun has drunk too much.

228
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,220
Wang Xiao, I...

229
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
You don't have to explain anymore.

230
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:37,270
Sorry. If there isn't anything else, can I leave?

231
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,260
You have to resolve your love problems in private.

232
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,730
After you sign here, you can go.

233

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Masked Love Team @ Viki.com</i>

234
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,990
When we were little, I knew you were the person she liked.

235
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,600
You have always been my big hero. I could only follow behind you.

236
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:22,020
During the time while you were away, I thought I could replace you in her heart.

237
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,590
But I never thought...

238
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,220
I'm very sorry. I put you in this situation.

239
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,660
It's not your fault. I know you didn't do anything.

240
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,590
If I had resolved this well, then the result may not be this bad.

241
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,760
Hearing what you say,

242
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,190
you already knew! Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,600
I was worried you'd think too much. I thought Yunyun was just temporarily out of her mind.

244
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,060
Temporarily?

245
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,050
Ten years isn't short, right?

246
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,120
- Sorry
- You don't have to apologize.

247
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,740
The more you do this, the more you make me feel like a failure.

248
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,320
Miss Shen.

249
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,130
Miss Shen, don't blame me for minding so much. I just want to ask.

250
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,900
General Manager treats you so well. Why don't you love him?

251
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,100
Him being nice and me loving him or not are two different matters.

252
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,490
- But we can see that General Manager really loves you! 
- Enough!

253
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,870
This has nothing to do with you two.

254
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,960
How pitiful.

255
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,760
General Manager must be really hurt right now.

256
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,660
I never thought prince charming would be abandoned by the princess.

257
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,990
<i>Please don't overthink it. Your wound hasn't healed yet, let me take you to the hospital.</i>

<i>I'm okay.</i>

259
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,990
Comparing to what happen today, this injury is a small matter. I won't die from it.

260
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,200
I want to be by myself.

261

Brother Wang Yi,

262
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,150
I... I know whatever I say is wrong.

263
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,030
But the person who I don't want to hurt the most is Wang Xiao.

264
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,310

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,770
Today, Teacher Wu Qing is teaching us alien special effects makeup.

294
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,570
Alien?

295
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,480
- I want to look, too! 
- You're not allowed.

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,420
Quickly go back. Don't you know she kills people? If she finds out, you are done for. If you're done for, I am, too.

She won't find out, I'll hide behind you.

I'll hide.

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,660
Black and white paint.

305
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,180
<i>The clay you use to make the teeth.</i>

306
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,680
<i>You can change the shape of this clay by adding water.</i>

307
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,340
Today we will be molding it into a longish shape.

308
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,820
and make an alien's horns.

309
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,070
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

310
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,120
This is the button from home which I wanted to throw away.

311
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,880
I thought it looked like alien's eyes, so I used it.

312
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,860
You guys must always observe the items around you.

313
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,220
You must keep all usable things that are unique, creative.

314
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,900
<i>You must be ready to use them on your special effects art.</i>

315
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,670
Teacher Wu Qing really puts materials to good use.

316
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,210
She can even think of using buttons to use as alien's eyes.

317
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,550
Or else she wouldn't be a teacher.

318
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,160
- You shouldn't talk.
- I won't talk.

319
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,980
<i>When it dries, we will do a few copies.</i>

320
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,140
For example, like this sharp style.

321
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,370
When it dries, within the special effects work, you can use it to kill people.

322
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,320
So amazing, you can make this out of clay?

323
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,410
Stop talking! I beg you. Just stay right there.

324
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,990
- But I can't see it. 
- Even if you can't see it, you still shouldn't talk.

325
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,310
I won't speak. I'll just look.

326
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,300
What are you two talking about?

327
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,760
- Oh. Nothing. 
- Who's behind you? 
- There's no one behind me.

328
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,620
- No one's behind me. 
- Who is it?

329
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,020
No...

330
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,150
Chen Zhen?

331
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,630
Hi, Teacher Wu Qing, what a coincidence.

332
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,950
You're Ian's student, why are you in my class? Do you have any intentions?

333
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,040
I don't have any intention, I just want to learn.

334
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,960
You're not learning with Ian but instead you're here?

335
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,700
Do you think that you can't learn anything from Ian?

336
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,470
It's not that I can't learn anything. It's because I don't understand everything Ian teaches me.

337
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,410
Let's go. Go!

338
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,790
Come with me.

339
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,950
What is she up to?

340
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,160
<i>These are all the documents.</i>

341
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,850
Ian is here, too? That's great.

342
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,930
What's wrong? Why are you two together?

343
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:50,170
Boss, don't be anxious. I just want to tell you something quite interesting.

344
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,830
Oh? What interesting thing?

345
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,500
This student Chen Zhen came to my class to listen in secretly.

346
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,790
I really do want to ask Ian, how do you teach your students?

347
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,350
Letting your students go to other teacher's class to learn secretly. Is that your way of teaching?

348
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,620
<i>- You ingrate! Where are you off to? 
 - Master!</i>

349
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,560
<i>You betrayed our sect. Today, I am going to disable your martial arts, and purge you out of the sect.</i>

350
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,210
<i>Master! I had no choice.</i>

351
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,120
<i>Stop talking nonsense, take my hit!</i>

352
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,450
<i>Master!</i>

353
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,500
My way of teaching is my business. No one else can have a say on it.

354
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,930
That's right. How ever you teach your student indeed isn't my business.

355
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,860
And I don't care about it either. So I plan on asking her.

356
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Chen Zhen, you came to class today to listen in secretly.

357
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,650
Is it  because you want to learn from me?

358
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,350
Then do you think that you can't learn anything from Ian, and want to learn from me?

359
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,610
Of course not. I went today because I was curious.

360
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,040
Wu Qing, students want to improve themselves is a good thing.

361
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,350
You should all be their teacher.

362
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,840
Boss, I don't have any other intention.

363
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,690
I'm just thinking if Ian is too busy  and doesn't have time to take her,

364
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,230
and I see Chen Zhen is so willing to learn, I am quite happy to take her in.

365
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,440
Then let her go with you. I really don't have enough time to take her.

366
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,050
If there are even better chances to learn, then that's good for her, too.

367
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,890
You get busy. I have something on so I'm leaving.

368
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,210
Ian really does have special perks.

369
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,900
He doesn't even need to teach students. So easy for him.

370
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,340
Wait! How can you just push me to another teacher?

371
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,810
Teacher Wu Qing is one of the professional special effects artist within the country. Learning  under her is your good fortune.

372
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,360
I know my actions today weren't good, but...

373
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,070
But I just wanted to learn more things.

374
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,630
Are the things I get you to do not considered learning?

375
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,290
You're just making me draw. I know that drawing is the basic of special effects art,

376
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,310
but... I don't understand;  I don't even know what I'm doing.

377
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,660
After many days, I haven't learned one technique on special effects art.

378
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,120
If you really think this way, I really don't know what you can do in the future?

379
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,050
Compared to others, my progress rate is slower.

380
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,800
You think it's nothing because you're busy and have projects to accept.

381
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,770
But you don't understand the anxiety and fear I have of not being able to do anything.

382
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,510
Aren't you just that impatient to successfully become a master within a short time?

383
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:55,550
You aren't a genius. If you don't go the normal way, you will fall.

384
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,400
Your skills and attitude don't fulfill the requisites of being a special effects artist, so I don't want to teach you.

385
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,560
You've finally said the words in your heart!

386
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,350
Do I have to say them again? Go report to Wu Qing this afternoon.

387
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,280
No! Don't give me to Teacher Wu Qing. Don't be like this to me.

388
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,680
Can you not be this loud? People will think I did something bad to you.

389
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,750
You really are bad to me.

390
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,770
I originally drew you out as my teacher. I was originally your student.

391
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,390
But you've been very cold to me, and you don't treat me like a student.

392
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,100
You even said that I'm not your student. You make me very sad.

393
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,900
If you're like this, then I will never let you follow me anymore.

394
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,890
Wait... Please don't let me go to Teacher Wu Qing there.

395
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,790
I beg you. If I learn under her, I will be done for.

396
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,900
Luo Wen is almost dead learning under her.

397
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,360
I don't want my graduation day to be my funeral day.

398
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,460
Have you thought of your own problem? All day you just want to become successful.

399
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,330
Let me ask,. Have you ever been mature enough to ask me to bring you to the production crew?

400
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,370
-No, but–
- Teacher Wang Yi,

401
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,480
This is the production company's contract. If you think it's fine, then you can sign it.

402
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,770
You've never told me your thoughts before. How would I know what you're thinking about?

403
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,580
Shut up!

404
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,470
Didn't you go to Wu Qing to learn? So you shouldn't be following me.

405
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,630
Don't go around being jealous.

406
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,850
So boring. Who's the one jealous?

407
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,730
Wait!

408
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,050
I want to have a conversation with you today.

409
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,920
Okay. I give you 2 minutes. Get on with the main points.

410
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,690
I wish you'd see me as your student and teach me well.

411
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,410
Even though Sha Tian, Meili, Luo Wen all work very hard and are exhausted,

412
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,670
you can tell they are learning a lot.

413
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,330
And my special effects notebook is still blank.

414
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,080
The things in the notebook, you study them enough at school and cram school. No need to come here.

415
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,980
Do you know what I'm going to say?

416
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,200
Am I not giving you a chance to express yourself?

417
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,710
Let me ask you. Why are you so anxious?

418
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,340
Of course, I'm anxious. I'm anxious to become a special effects artist!

419
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,740
I'm anxious to be successful and earn money. I'm rushing to renovate my house.

420
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,030
I'm anxious to buy my dad a big shop. I want to give my dad a better life.

421
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,980
To you, it's nothing if you don't teach me well; but to me,

422
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,840
it just means that my future is without hope.

423
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,320
I've told you. If you follow me, then you have to do as I say.

424
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,040
If you're not happy or don't have the brains to understand, then you can leave anytime.

425
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,440
Two minutes are up. Don't take your emotions on me.

426
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,610
What has he done to Chen Zhen?

427
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,090
I'm very curious.

428
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,100
Teacher Zifan, no matter what you do to me, I still won't get angry.

429
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,810
- Dig your nostrils.
- Okay.

430
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,660
Zhenzhen, why did you come home so early?

431
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,710
When I left Bertone, Meili and Luo Wen were still there.

432
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,990
That's right. I'm the only student who's the most free.

433
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,340
Being free is good. If you're so busy to a point that you don't have time to eat, then it'll only make you feel bad.

434
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,410
If you don't understand then don't speak. I'm pissed off right now.

435
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,900
Okay. Then I won't say anything.

436
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,150
I'll cook for you. You're probably hungry so you're angry.

437
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,550
You'll feel better after you eat.

438
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,150
Zhenzhen, are you angry because I let him in?

439
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,580
I was venting my anger of Ian on him.

440
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,430
Then are you still willing to be his friend?

441
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,710
I think you need to have a good conversation with him.

442
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,570
Enough, talk to each other.

443
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,230
- Qianjin.
- Go sit in the living room. I'll be done soon.

444
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,730
I have something to say to you.

445
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,620
What?

446
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,020
I don't understand. I thought the person who you liked was Sha Tian.

447
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,140
A girl like Sha Tian,

448
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:12,210
she's pretty, has a sweet voice, very gentle and knows how to dress prettily. Out of ten men, eleven would like her.

449
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,830
I don't even look good, my voice isn't sweet either.

450
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,830
My body isn't great, I'm not gentle and could possibly beat you in a fight. Are you blind?

451
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,940
What do you like about me?

452
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,460
I don't know either.

453
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,010
I just know that I want to see you everyday.

454
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,500
I want to see you smile. I want to see that you are happy after eating the food I cook.

455
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,480
Stop talking!

456
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,910
Then you should know when you started to like me.

457
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,100
It's... that time.

458
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,300
The first time you went to the restaurant to eat.

459
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,320
<i>Hey, Zhenzhen. Put your foot down.</i>

460
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,910
<i>- What's wrong? 
- You're not like a girl. That way you can't find a boyfriend.</i>

461
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:25,460
<i> My man would love every part of me.</i>

462
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,360
<i>What kind of theory is that?</i>

463
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,220
<i>Hello. All your dishes have arrived.</i>

464
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,380
<i>- Your food is very good. 
- Really? Thank you.</i>

465
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,120
<i>Please get me another two of chef's special.</i>

466
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,290
<i>You... are you not full?</i>

467
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,560
<i>Are you still eating?</i>

468
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,370
<i>I can still have quite a bit.</i>

469
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,160
<i>Look at the girl. She can eat so much.</i>

470
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,930
<i>- Hey, the bill please.
- Yes.</i>

471
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,840
<i>A total of ¥52, just give me ¥50.</i>

472
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,920
<i>- Do you need me to takeaway these dishes?
- No need.
- Thanks.</i>

473
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,520
<i>Do you not want your dishes anymore?
 - That's right.</i>

474
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,450
<i>That's so wasteful. Then can you order as to how much you can eat in the future?</i>

475
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,810
<i>It's none of your business.</i>

476
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,030
<i>Zhenzhen!</i>

477
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,780
<i>Look, these vegetables and meat,</i>

478
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,190
<i>all these are the hard work of the farmers.</i>

479
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,730
<i>They took these to the market. The master then carefully selects them .</i>

480
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,510
<i>Then the chef makes these delicious foods before they arrive at your table.</i>

481
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,900
<i>You ordered these but you're not eating it. How wasteful is that?</i>

482
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,320
<i>You're crazy.</i>

483
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,280
<i>Give me some rice!</i>

484
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,340
<i>All right.</i>

485
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,450
<i>What is your name?</i>

486
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,180
<i>Qianjin. Song Qianjin.</i>

487
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,050
<i>I don't care if you're Qianjin (forward) or Houtui (backwards), you have to keep our promise.</i>

488
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,950
<i>- What promise? 
 - When customers come, only let them order the amount they can eat. Don't let them waste food.</i>

489
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,820
<i>When did I agree?</i>

490
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,410
<i>- Yes, I promise you.
- Do I still have two more dishes?</i>

491
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,400
- What? 
- Didn't I order two chef's special?

492
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
<i>Oh. Yes.</i>

493
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,190
My god. Song Qianjin, do you like being abused?

494
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,090
You're very kind, and truthful.

495
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,970
I've always seen customers waste food.

496
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,430
Food can't speak and can't get angry. They think wasting it doesn't matter.

497
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,340
But you'd come out and speak up for them.

498
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:51,020
You're very brave. Very good. Plus, you can understand that every dish comes with a process of hard work.

499
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,020
I really think you're special.

500
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,580
Stop looking at me like that.

501
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,550
I'm not comfortable.

502
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:20,390
Qianjin, right now, I don't have any plans in be in a relationship.

503
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,210
Can't we keep our good friendship?

504
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,540
Because I don't want it to be awkward to see you in the future.

505
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,860
All right, I will do as you say.

506
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,730
As long you don't avoid me. I am willing to sincerely see you as my good friend.

507
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,530
- Really?
- Yes.

508
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,330
Thank you.

509
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:49,500
Zhenzhen, then what kind of man do you like?

510
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,410
Tell me. Maybe I can still work towards it.

511
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,940
It'd be faster for you to reincarnate.

512
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,760
It was your old company's general manager, right?

513
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,380
Shut up!

514
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,770
Whatever he is capable of, what he has... I'm able, too.

515
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,440
I will definitely prove it to you.

516
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,960
Wait till the day Sunshine Boy can defeat Mr. Tall, Rich and Handsome.

517
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,550
Wang Xiao.

518
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,560
Dad.

519
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,060
How did your talk go with Yunyun yesterday?

520
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,420
You returned home without saying anything.

521
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,330
Also, when are you going to re-schedule your wedding?

522
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,930
About that... Dad, yesterday evening I didn't have the opportunity to talk about that with Yunyun.

523
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,110
Then why did you go there? Do you know you are wasting time right now?

524
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:31,730
Besides, I'm telling you again. The tender bidding was halted because of the wedding.

525
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,310
The company can't wait anymore. If we keep on delaying, our company will make a big loss.

526
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,700
I hope you will hurry and resolve this problem.

527
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,610
I don't want to force Yunyun! I want to give her a little more time.

528
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,990
She is so stubborn now because you always go with her wishes.

529
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,930
Why are you so useless?

530
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,330
You can't even deal with a woman, how are you going to do great things in the future?

531
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,480
Dad! You don't understand a lot of things!

532
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,930
All right. Tell me what the problem is between you two?

533
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,230
Dad, you can be assured.

534
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,000
I won't let you wait too long for my marriage with Yunyun.

535
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,410
Okay. I hope you won't disappoint me.

536
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm so full!

537
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,750
Qianjin is very pitiful. After cooking so hard,

538
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,020
he still had to wash the dishes before leaving.

539
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,790
If you're not a queen, then what is a queen?

540
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,510
Stop talking nonsense. He's a real brother and a good friend.

541
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,290
Doesn't it feel good clearing things up?

542
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:02,650
Not just good. My appetite is so good, I ate an extra bowl.

543
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,130
- Are you satisfied? 
- No. How could there not be dessert after dinner?

544
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,510
- What kind of stomach do you have? 
 -There is another stomach for dessert.

545
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,020
Tian, should we go have dessert?

546
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,110
No! I don't want to eat.

547
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,710
Dessert is the main source of being fat, the evil of all evils.

548
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,850
If you want to go, then go on your own. I cannot go with you.

549
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,800
What you said is right.

550
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,070
But what does it have to do with me? Eat.

551
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,620
Eating alone is very lonely.

552
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,530
But the good point is that no one snatches food from you.

553
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,810
I don't care if you snatch my food; instead, I'm very happy for you to share with me.

554
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,960
Sit down.

555
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,450
Then I'm not going to be polite.

556
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,410
Waitress! Another set of tableware please!

557
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,420
You are lucky! I just ate so I won't snatch so much from you.

558
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,180
Lucky?

559
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,860
That is just what I need right now.

560
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,780
I always thought that people like you who had meals outside,

561
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,240
you'd go to Michelin starred or five-star restaurants.

562
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,290
Never thought I would meet you here.

563
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:46,180
Because of my situation right now, I can only come to this kind of place and be at ease.

564
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,440
One person eating alone is good, but drinking alone isn't good.

565
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,420
Come, I will accompany you! Let's forget every problem!

566
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

567
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,770
You shouldn't care how people will look at you.

568
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,680
You just have to live happily.

569
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,830
I also want to live the way you just said.

570
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:30,380
But sometimes, we can't live according to what we want.

571
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:38,550
Seems like your prince's and princess' lives do have their share of heavy burden.

572
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,430
Prince? So that's what you guys call me.

573
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,910
It sounds really sad.

574
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,290
What is so sad about it?

575
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,460
What's wrong with being a prince? Princes still need to pee and poo right?

576
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,800
That is true, but do you have to be so direct?

577
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,040
What direct? Still caring about your image? Your woman already ran away!

578
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,250
If I were you, even if I broke my arms and legs

579
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,970
I'd still try my best and snatch her back.

580
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,460
The end!

581
