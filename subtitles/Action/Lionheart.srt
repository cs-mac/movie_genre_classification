1
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,298
Don't worry.

2
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:16,093
What, you don't trust me?
I've got the money.

3
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,929
Let's see the stuff.

4
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,681
Let's see
the money.

5
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,273
Money.

6
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,674
This is sugar.

7
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:55,842
No shit.

8
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:57,718
Yeah, no shit.

9
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,180
And this is gasoline.

10
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:03,307
That's right, man.

11
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,600
It's gasoline.

12
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,480
Yeah, come on.
Torch him, man.

13
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,817
No.

14
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,459
Mrs. Gaultier, I'm sorry this
had to happen to your family.

15
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:47,216
We've done everything
that can be done.

16
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:51,845
In cases like this it is very difficult
to make any kind of prediction,

17
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,932
so for the next couple of months
it's going to be touch and go.

18
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,517
Mrs. Gaultier...

19
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,435
The insurance has expired,
I know.

20
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,439
Does he have any
other relatives,

21
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:05,359
anyone else that
could possibly help?

22
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:09,863
No. Come on, Nicole.
Let's go.

23
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,745
Lyon. Lyon.

24
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,291
Lyon? Lyon!

25
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,545
Lyon!

26
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,463
Hi, Lyon.

27
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,967
I bet you're wondering what's in the
old goodie sack for you today, huh?

28
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,220
Let's have a look.
There we go.

29
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,932
Legionnaire Lyon Gaultier.

30
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,855
Yes.

31
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:29,943
It's very nice.

32
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,612
No interest, eh?

33
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:33,822
Okay, back she goes.

34
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,457
Yeah, Gaultier,
that's me.

35
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,128
This one's been out
in the sun too long.

36
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,306
She said she tried to call me
two weeks ago. Nobody told me.

37
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,676
Why?

38
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:10,225
This is the Foreign Legion,
Gaultier, not Club Med.

39
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,560
We're talking
about my brother.

40
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,978
He could be dead by now.

41
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,507
And we could be at war with
the bloody wogs tomorrow.

42
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:28,435
I need your ass here. Your
brother is not my problem.

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,627
Or yours anymore.

44
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,050
You gave up your family
when you joined the Legion.

45
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,804
I never gave up my family.

46
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:47,767
Never.

47
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:52,146
Legionnaire, I don't have
time for this ScheiÃŸe.

48
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,651
I need to see my brother.

49
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:01,614
You need what
I tell you you need.

50
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,745
And right now, I think you
need two weeks' hard labor.

51
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,279
Starting tomorrow.

52
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,703
You want something else
to cry about legionnaire?

53
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
We can arrange it.

54
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:27,012
You only have six months left
in the Legion, Gaultier.

55
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,640
Don't make it six years.

56
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,229
You're a real asshole.

57
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,526
Is there
a problem, sir?

58
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,029
No, no, no, no, no.
No problem.

59
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,699
Desert fever, this is your real problem.

60
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,660
Too many weeks
in the hot sun.

61
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,999
Shall we try
sweatbox, sir?

62
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,002
Yes, this might help.

63
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,839
Just until his
fever breaks.

64
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,022
Cover your head,
Legionnaire.

65
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:30,909
Move.

66
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,536
Your belt.

67
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,210
Come on.

68
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:43,964
Move!

69
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,632
Your hotel room
is ready. Let's go.

70
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,925
Come on.
Okay.

71
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,466
Get me a fucking jeep!

72
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,578
There is no sign
of him, sir.

73
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:00,165
He'll never make it.

74
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,336
If the wogs don't
kill him, then the desert will.

75
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,841
Just in case, head down to the
docks first thing in the morning.

76
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,886
The ocean's his only
way out of the country.

77
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,496
Moustafa,
go this way.

78
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,633
Hey!

79
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,927
Get your ass back down below!

80
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,345
Get down to those
boiler rooms now!

81
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,638
Okay, okay.

82
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:26,015
This ain't no pleasure
cruise. Move your ass!

83
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:48,246
The letter was
from his sister-in-law.

84
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:49,998
We are fortunate.

85
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:54,544
Our intelligence section makes a habit
of recording the return addresses.

86
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,929
We'll contact the Americans and ask
them to keep her under surveillance.

87
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:08,474
Inspector,
this man is a deserter,

88
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,561
a traitor to France
and a goddamn terrorist.

89
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:16,649
Adjutant, all I can do
is transmit the word.

90
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,401
If the Los Angeles cops

91
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:23,573
aren't too busy busting dope dealers,
gang rapists and serial killers

92
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:27,410
maybe they will have time
to bring the asshole in.

93
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:29,996
And if they don't,
tough shit.

94
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:35,168
If they do not,
maybe I can help.

95
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,497
You stay off the top deck,
First Mate's orders.

96
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:04,622
You were told not to come up.
Am I right?

97
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,958
Yeah.

98
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,127
And you told me that ship's
gonna go to Los Angeles.

99
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,296
What difference
does it make?

100
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,507
You ain't got no green card,
you ain't got no visa.

101
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:18,010
You ain't getting off this
boat anywhere, Frenchie.

102
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,470
So get your ass below

103
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:24,224
before somebody reports you, a
deserter, stowed away on their ship.

104
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:29,048
I pay for the trip.

105
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,872
I'm being generous Frenchie.

106
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,412
You keep stocking my boilers or you'll
be breaking rocks in the hot sun.

107
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,498
Now, what's it gonna be?

108
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,002
It's going to be simple.

109
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:49,550
Hey, maybe we make a deal.
You've been so generous to me.

110
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:50,760
Huh?

111
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,041
America.

112
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,334
Los Angeles Information.

113
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:27,337
Please deposit $2.40.

114
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,548
No, no.
It's my sister-in-law.

115
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,968
She's waiting for me,
Helene Gaultier.

116
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:35,470
Honey, I don't care if she's
the mayor's sister-in-law.

117
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,680
If I don't hear the coins,

118
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,932
this is the end of the
conversation, you got it?

119
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,588
Hey! Come on,
come on!

120
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,339
Come on,
get in there.

121
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,300
Come on.
Come on, get up.

122
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,926
What are
you doing?

123
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:16,136
Come on.

124
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,972
Yeah. Come on, man.

125
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,439
Come on,
God damn it.

126
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,859
I want my money, man!

127
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,199
Hey, hey, all right.
The man won.

128
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,456
You want another fight? You sure
you don't want another fight, mother?

129
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:47,417
Look at that, man,
you can win.

130
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,174
Come on, get your money. Now
I ain't got all goddamn day.

131
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:57,135
I want my money.
I want my money.

132
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:00,722
Shut up. Shut up. Now who's
gonna fight the next fight?

133
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,308
Shut up. Shut up. Now who's
gonna fight the next fight?

134
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,562
Look here. Who's gonna
fight the next goddamn fight?

135
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:10,732
Do we even have a next fight? God
damn it, do we have a next fight?

136
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,692
Come on, man,
do we have a next fight?

137
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,156
All right, all right. Hey, hey. Look
here. We got a visitor, all right.

138
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,574
Who might you be,
my man?

139
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,785
Lyon. Lyon.
What?

140
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:24,412
Lyon.
Lyon.

141
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,499
What the fuck is Lyon?

142
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,463
Lion. You're the Lion. The
Lion. MAN: All right. Hey!

143
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:34,839
All right.

144
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,801
All right, all right. Who
wants to take on the Lion?

145
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,553
Who wants to
take on the Lion?

146
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:43,431
Somebody's got
to take on the damn Lion.

147
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:46,059
Hey, that's my man now.

148
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,269
Yeah, we got us
a fight now, baby.

149
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,353
Wrestle him.

150
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,772
Yeah! Let's get ready
for this one.

151
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,149
Bets down.
Put your bets down.

152
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,116
Put my money down.

153
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,325
Who are you taking?

154
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,329
Come on, come on.

155
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:08,999
Ain't nobody gonna
bet on the Lion?

156
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:15,380
Bets. That's it. Bets over, bets
over, bets over. All right. Bets over.

157
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:23,596
All right.
Look here.

158
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,473
You sure you want
to do this, my man?

159
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,601
I'm the only one betting on
you. Don't let me down, now.

160
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,771
This is ours, my man,
if you can beat this dude.

161
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:34,232
It's going right here.

162
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,527
Trust me, man.
Can you beat him?

163
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,488
Kick his lion ass.

164
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:41,781
All right.

165
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,034
It's on. It's on.

166
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:45,660
Take him.

167
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,245
It's on. Yeah!

168
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,165
Come on. Come on.

169
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:54,044
Yeah! Let's go!

170
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,549
Yeah, that's good, man. Good.

171
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:04,929
That's right. That's it,
that's it. Right there.

172
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,185
No, man.
Come on.

173
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:12,729
I don't believe this.

174
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,190
I got me a man here.
Yeah, look at this.

175
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,691
Do you see this?
Do you see this?

176
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:19,110
Yeah, brother.
Come on, come on.

177
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:42,759
That's it, my man.
Mother, cut him.

178
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,725
Oh, my God.

179
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:55,522
Hell, boy.

180
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:58,483
Hey, hey, you see that shit?
Look at this here.

181
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,901
Shit, boy,
you're a bad motherfucker

182
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,861
with that foreign shit, boy.
Put it right there.

183
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,613
Shit. Goddamn,
you're bad, boy.

184
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:04,739
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

185
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:06,449
Get the fuck out of
my pocket. You break...

186
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:07,951
All right, fuck, then go
ahead and take it, man.

187
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,370
It's your money
any goddamn way.

188
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,290
Wait a minute. Let me count. Thanks.

189
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,751
Wait. Hold on. Let me count
this shit. Wait a minute.

190
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:17,836
Wait, wait,
wait a minute, man.

191
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,087
You didn't give me enough
goddamn money, man.

192
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,547
Hey, look here, boy.
You're a good fighter, boy.

193
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:21,881
But you can't count
worth a shit.

194
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,967
God damn it, give me
my goddamn money. Hey!

195
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:28,179
The number you
have dialled is no longer in service

196
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,181
and there's no new number.

197
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,725
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

198
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,311
please hang up
and dial again.

199
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:38,690
There's nowhere to go.

200
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:46,906
Nobody home?

201
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,158
No.

202
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,286
Hey, man, don't be looking
at the damn sandwich, man.

203
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,163
Pick it up and eat it.
It ain't gonna hurt you.

204
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,957
'Cause you're Lion,
king of the jungle.

205
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:00,086
So you want to
get to LA, huh?

206
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,379
Yeah.

207
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:12,682
Hey, man. Thank you
very much for that, man.

208
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,601
Look here, I'll get you
back in LA, all right?

209
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:16,269
Thank you for paying
for the sandwich.

210
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:17,937
Yeah, sure.

211
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:19,939
It is where you
want to go, LA, right?

212
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:21,483
Yeah, can you take
me there?

213
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:22,942
Damn straight, baby.

214
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,027
When?

215
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,112
That totally depends
upon you, my man.

216
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:29,449
We just got to go see some
people, you know what I'm saying?

217
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,290
Hey, now.
What's happening, huh?

218
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,377
May I help you,
gentlemen?

219
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,837
Here to see
the lady, man.

220
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:43,922
Uh...

221
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,633
You'll have to be a little
bit more specific than that.

222
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:48,009
Oh, man,
cut the shit.

223
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:51,596
Just tell her Joshua's here with
someone I think she'd like to meet.

224
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:58,353
Well, if it ain't
old Joshua.

225
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,854
My main man.

226
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:01,105
Yeah.

227
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,191
How'd you find us?

228
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,985
Here, look here, man. Word gets
out. You know what I'm saying?

229
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,779
I want you
to meet somebody.

230
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,906
You chose
a bad time.

231
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,157
Call me middle
of next week.

232
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:13,451
No, no. Now.

233
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,789
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

234
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:21,668
Hey, the man just
kicked five asses.

235
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,545
You want to make
yours number six?

236
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,891
Okay. Fuck it.

237
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:39,894
Follow me.

238
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,980
Hey, I love New York.

239
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:46,150
Hey, cool down, man.
Just look at him.

240
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,238
Fire someplace?

241
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,575
Hey, look here.

242
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,209
Wait here.

243
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:05,587
Yeah, all right.
Formal, ain't it?

244
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,839
Hey, this is
your ticket, man.

245
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:10,883
Ticket to LA, any place
else you want to go.

246
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,428
Check it out.

247
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:19,517
That, my man,
is the lady.

248
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:22,520
And this is her show.

249
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,027
Been a long time, Joshua.

250
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:35,992
I see your taste
is improving. Who's this?

251
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:43,458
This is the Lion,
king of the jungle.

252
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,043
Joshua, please.

253
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:49,505
What's your name?

254
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,632
Lyon.

255
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,092
Lyon? You're French?

256
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:56,429
What's the difference?

257
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:01,976
It's all right. My man
don't like talking about himself,

258
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:05,271
you know, where he comes from, any of
that mess, you know what I'm saying?

259
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,773
Is it cool?

260
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,192
Cool.

261
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,945
I can appreciate
a little attitude

262
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:17,325
as long as he can give them
what they want to see.

263
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,744
Come on!

264
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:23,247
Come on. Kick him.
Yes, kick him. Come on.

265
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:24,832
Kick him. Yeah.

266
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:25,917
You can do it. Come on.

267
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:29,837
Come on. Get him.
Get him. Come on. Let's go.

268
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:34,550
Kick his ass.

269
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,135
Come on.

270
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,345
Come on. Get him.

271
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,347
Get him!
Come on. Yeah.

272
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,933
Come on, get him.
That's right. Yes.

273
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,689
Come on. Get up.
Get up. Come on.

274
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:49,065
Let's go. Come on.

275
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,697
Get up!

276
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:56,823
Get back. Come on.

277
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,119
Come on.

278
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,374
Come on! You can't
just scuffle. Come on.

279
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,852
Finish him!

280
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,905
Bring it in. What
is this? I paid for a fight!

281
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:40,992
Come on. Come on.
Let's do lunch sometime.

282
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:46,330
What is this?
Know what? Get the mop!

283
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,083
Busted. Busted.

284
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:52,670
Bring in the mop.

285
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:58,718
Sonny,
Sonny, Sonny, Sonny!

286
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:02,013
Sonny, Sonny, Sonny, Sonny!

287
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:09,020
Hey, now it's time to find out how
bad you want to get to LA, my man.

288
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:10,772
Ain't no nickel-and-dime
shit here.

289
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:13,107
I didn't agree when they said
you were a bum, but that's right!

290
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,902
Hey, there you are.

291
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,034
Sure you want to mess up
that face, handsome?

292
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,455
You're up, stud.

293
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,874
Hey, wake up.
Fight's this way.

294
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:34,086
Things are gonna be
just fine, my man.

295
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,922
Hey, hey.
Hey, how you doing, Joshua?

296
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,423
You all right, man?
Hey, yeah.

297
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,175
Lenny,
what are you calling it?

298
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,221
I make Sonny a three-to-one
favorite. What's the other kid's name?

299
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,099
Lyonheart.

300
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,476
Lyonheart.

301
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,812
Hey, I got three-to-one
against Lyonheart.

302
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:52,396
Three-to-one
against Lyonheart.

303
00:27:55,108 --> 00:28:00,988
Dig it, Lyonheart, 15% off the
top if we win, 5% if we lose.

304
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:02,990
We?

305
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:06,452
Hey, man. Who brought you here, sucker?

306
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,871
I got it. I got it.
I got it. Okay.

307
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,832
I'm gonna bet this whole
damn wad on your ass.

308
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:14,418
You whip this sucker's ass and
we split 50-50. All right? Huh?

309
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:18,464
Oh, shit. Look here.

310
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,342
Hey, we partners, man.

311
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:22,468
Huh?

312
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:25,638
Yeah. Don't either one
of us ever forget that.

313
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:29,225
Come on. Talk to me, talk
to me. Haven't got all night.

314
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,772
On Lyonheart, all of it.

315
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:37,400
And keep this between us.

316
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:41,279
It's over. It's over.

317
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,489
Come on, guys.
Come on, come on.

318
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:46,450
You know the rules, huh?
There's no rules.

319
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,332
You're kind of pretty.

320
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:57,295
I don't know if I want
to fight you or fuck you.

321
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,046
Sonny.

322
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:11,225
Come on, boy.

323
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,643
Come on, come on.

324
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:13,936
Come on. Come on.

325
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,938
Come on, Sonny.

326
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:19,901
Come on.

327
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:24,447
Come on, come on.

328
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:25,865
Come on, come on.

329
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:27,658
Come on, Lion.

330
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,873
Come on, Lion.
That's it, that's it.

331
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:49,347
Get up, Sonny!

332
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,935
Get up, Sonny, get up.
Get up, Sonny.

333
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,270
That's my man right there.
I brought him here.

334
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,730
Get up, pussy.

335
00:29:57,814 --> 00:29:59,273
It's over, man.
He's had it.

336
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,025
Shit.
Hey!

337
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:02,568
I could fucking kick
this guy's ass.

338
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:04,236
You see this shit, man?
I know, baby, I know.

339
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,696
Not bad.

340
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:06,864
Hey, come on.

341
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:08,616
Who is this guy?

342
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:14,872
Right now, you and me.

343
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:17,959
Hey. No, no, no, no.

344
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,544
No, no, no, no. Hey, no,
no. Don't do that, man.

345
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,046
Hey, come on,
come on, come on.

346
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:27,802
Hey, now come on, man,
you ain't gonna go do shit.

347
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:30,304
Hey, the winner.
Ladies and gentlemen,

348
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:36,185
Lyonheart,
king of the jungle.

349
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:43,818
Don't ever insult one
of my patrons again.

350
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,987
If there's something that
Russell or I can't handle,

351
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:48,572
we have paid
security personnel who can.

352
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:49,949
You clear on that?

353
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,242
Yeah.

354
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:52,535
Good.

355
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,622
Now, what's this shit
about a trip to LA?

356
00:30:56,707 --> 00:31:00,334
Because I think I can have another fight
lined up for you in less than a week.

357
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,337
Better money for
everybody this time.

358
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:04,672
But it's up to you, Lyon.

359
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:06,424
I'm going to Los Angeles.

360
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:08,926
What the fuck
is in Los Angeles?

361
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:12,221
All right.

362
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,098
Can you at least make it
back by Tuesday?

363
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:15,182
No.

364
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,436
Do us a favor. Talk it
over with your manager.

365
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,063
My manager?

366
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:24,525
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look here.

367
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:28,654
My man wants to go to LA. What he's
got going there is his business.

368
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,906
And we'll be back here when we're
good and ready to come back here.

369
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,367
You understand what I'm
saying? Right, my man?

370
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,536
Let me tell you
all something.

371
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,834
What I did tonight I did for my
family, not for you, not for me.

372
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:46,922
You made a total of $5,000.

373
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,217
That's a pretty substantial
amount for a one-night stand.

374
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,344
Where else are you gonna
make that kind of money?

375
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,015
That's my business,
not yours. Stop the car.

376
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,267
What if we can arrange
a fight for you in California?

377
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,227
We do have a circuit
out there, too.

378
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:02,813
Arrange it
for somebody else.

379
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:04,648
And stop the car.

380
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:17,328
That $5,000 won't go
as far as he thinks.

381
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,917
My private number,
in case he changes his mind.

382
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:29,757
Hey, hey, man. Get up off
the celebration, will you?

383
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:32,927
Come on, man, you know how far
the damn airport is from here?

384
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,012
Hey, come on, man.
It's just me and you now.

385
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,973
I left them other
jive turkeys way behind.

386
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:39,850
All right. Hey, look here.
I can dig it.

387
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:41,393
Hey, my brother done
made me some money,

388
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:43,187
so I'm gonna leave his ass
in the damn street.

389
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:46,315
Well, that's all right. That's all
right. Go ahead with your bad self.

390
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,818
We'll see how far your ass gets
without my help, God damn it.

391
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:49,944
Go ahead.

392
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:51,445
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

393
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,405
Jive motherfucker.

394
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,368
Tonight, I fought
for you.

395
00:32:58,203 --> 00:32:59,286
Didn't make
enough money, huh?

396
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:00,579
Wait a minute.

397
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:01,705
You want some more?

398
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,999
Don't be talking about no
damn money around here, man.

399
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,794
Shit, man, if people find out
we've got $10,000 in our pocket,

400
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:08,295
we won't even make it
to that damn corner.

401
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,089
Man, just put your money
back in the pocket, there.

402
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:13,175
That's... Yeah, there.
That is just... Yeah, yeah.

403
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,094
Look here, man.
Hey, look here.

404
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:16,470
Why don't we get a cab
out of here, man,

405
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:18,931
right now, all right?
Yeah. Come on.

406
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:20,558
Hey, hey, look here.

407
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,893
There it is. There's a telephone.
That's what we need, man.

408
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,228
Hey. Listen to me.
Yeah.

409
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,313
Listen to me. I'll get
you out of this, all right?

410
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:28,983
Yeah. We'll survive.
Now come on, man.

411
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:32,236
God is merciful, you
know it. Come on, man.

412
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,699
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey. Looking
for an honest man? I'm him.

413
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:39,368
Never steer you wrong.
There it is. See?

414
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:50,921
Hey, man.
What is this, man?

415
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,423
Shut up, man.

416
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,436
Hey, cuz,
you want to use our phone?

417
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,189
Look, that's all right, blood, we'll
go someplace else. Don't worry about it.

418
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,774
What, you don't
like my phone, cuz?

419
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,653
How much you want
for your phone?

420
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:15,946
Let me do
the talking, man.

421
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,865
Hey, shut up,
nigger.

422
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,284
I want to hear what
the white boy got to say.

423
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:23,787
This is my hood, motherfucker,
and I ask the questions.

424
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,873
How much you want to pay?

425
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:27,625
He ain't got no money,
motherfucker.

426
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,001
I got the goddamn money.

427
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:32,254
And I'll kick your ass.
You ain't getting shit.

428
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,381
Motherfucker's gonna pay now.

429
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,301
Come on, man.
Get in there, man.

430
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:55,903
Today's your
lucky day, punk.

431
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:57,446
Yeah, that's right.
I want a cab.

432
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,823
What, you expect me
to walk to the airport?

433
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,825
What do you mean, you don't send
no cabs to this neighborhood?

434
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,410
Wait, are you...

435
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:05,412
Hey, man,
you want to use the phone?

436
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:07,206
Come on. Let's go.
Hey.

437
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:11,418
You're gonna listen
to Joshua now, huh?

438
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:12,544
Yeah.

439
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,755
I've been all over the
world, man. I've been around.

440
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,509
From the Big Apple to the
Big Orange, I know the score.

441
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:21,303
How you gonna get around
in all that smog?

442
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:23,514
Huh?

443
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,432
Them freeways?

444
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:31,105
Now, people in LA, man,
lot of shit going on.

445
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:34,316
Lot of weird-ass
motherfuckers running around.

446
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,945
Besides,
I owe you lunch.

447
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:42,157
Yeah, yeah.
You owe me lunch.

448
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:43,450
Good.

449
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:47,705
But you're wasting your time
if you think I'll fight again.

450
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,207
Hey, I can dig it.
It's cool.

451
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,877
Okay. Okay.

452
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,133
$5,000 will go a long ways
in the land of sunshine.

453
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,900
He is my brother.
I want to see Francois now.

454
00:36:27,724 --> 00:36:29,824
I understand but we still
need to see some identification.

455
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,825
I want to see my brother.

456
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:38,849
- What's going on?
- Please come with me. Please.

457
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:44,628
It finally happened
late last week.

458
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,256
With the extent
of his injuries,

459
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:51,426
honestly, I don't know how
he held on as long as he did.

460
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,017
It's because I told him
I'd always be there for him.

461
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:03,272
I'm truly sorry.

462
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:13,657
The guys who did this to him,
did they catch them?

463
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:23,917
Mr. Gaultier, he's gone, and nothing
we can do will bring him back.

464
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:29,798
Doc, my question is,
did they catch them?

465
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:37,916
Yes, Mr. Gaultier. I believe
the police have them in custody.

466
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,340
The guys who set him on fire...

467
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:42,864
might have been...

468
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:44,838
rival drug dealers...

469
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,562
they might have been customers
that he sold some bad stuff to.

470
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:52,963
It might have been kids
playing a sick prank.

471
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,687
We may never know.

472
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,389
He was too delirious to tell
the police much of anything.

473
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:00,563
Now if I were you,

474
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:04,483
I'd be a little more concerned
about his wife and his child.

475
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:07,311
He left them with a stack
of unpaid medical bills

476
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:10,614
and not too much
of anything else.

477
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:14,701
Now I can give you
their address, if you'd like.

478
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:17,537
I have it.

479
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:21,499
Thank you.

480
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,923
Hey, you don't look
sick to me, baby.

481
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:35,180
Hey, Lion. Hey, Lion!

482
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:44,606
Hey. Hey, Lyonheart.
Hey, man, what's happening?

483
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,318
You acting like they said you
were pregnant or something.

484
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,156
I don't need you.
Just go, okay?

485
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:56,326
Go.

486
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:38,660
Hey. Look there. There he is.

487
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,289
Hey, my treat, remember?

488
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,874
Damn inflation, man.

489
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:49,004
Look here. Here's $2, man.
Keep the change. For your kids.

490
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:51,381
I heard Russell say you
don't know when to quit, huh?

491
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:52,632
Hey, that's me, man.

492
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:53,758
That's you.

493
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,302
Can't argue with
the facts, right?

494
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:57,971
You have nothing
better to do?

495
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,223
Okay.

496
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,310
Maybe you can
help me then.

497
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:05,562
Find this place.
That's the address.

498
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:14,821
No problem, man. Who lives
there? You got a sister?

499
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:21,077
Just find me this place and
don't ask too much question.

500
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:37,642
Hey, hold it, man.
Hold that goddamn car. Yeah.

501
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:39,977
Motherfucker.

502
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:46,067
Hey. Oh, hey, hey. There it
is. There it is. Right there.

503
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,674
It's yours?

504
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:06,678
Do you know where a lady
named Helene lives?

505
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:11,308
Can you show me?

506
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:14,394
My mommy told me not
to talk to strangers.

507
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,439
Your mommy, huh?

508
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:20,859
She's right.

509
00:41:24,197 --> 00:41:27,199
My name is Nicole,
and I'm five.

510
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:31,077
Nicole, c'est trÃ¨s joli.
My name is Lyon.

511
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,247
Now you're not
a stranger anymore.

512
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:39,711
I'm not a stranger when your
mommy says I'm not a stranger.

513
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,254
Just give me
some time, okay?

514
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,881
Just a few more days
and I will have it.

515
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:43,965
You will have it, I promise.

516
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,050
Friday.
Friday.

517
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:46,968
Friday.
Not a partial payment, cash.

518
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:49,137
450 bucks, cash.

519
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:50,388
Absolutely.

520
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:54,059
Okay. If you don't, you
and your family are on the street.

521
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,355
I don't think this would be
a good time to ask my mommy.

522
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,570
Deadbeats like you are why I can't
get the goddamn elevator fixed.

523
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:07,494
You live here?

524
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:09,395
I came to visit.

525
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:11,419
Well excuse me.

526
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,832
Let's go.

527
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:29,089
Mommy, is he a stranger?

528
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,719
Nicole, go inside and draw
with your crayons.

529
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,888
Just for a minute, honey.

530
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,062
So you finally decided to
grace us with your presence.

531
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:47,691
Helene, it was impossible
for me to go.

532
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,193
I put myself in lots
of trouble to get here.

533
00:42:54,478 --> 00:42:57,605
Well, I've got news for you. It wasn't
worth it, because you're too late.

534
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,233
Helene, I tried.
I'm sorry. I tried.

535
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:09,241
You know, the only thing that he
wanted was just to see your face again.

536
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:11,869
Maybe we should
go inside.

537
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,120
No, I don't want you inside.

538
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:16,665
I don't want you anywhere
near me or my daughter again.

539
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,086
You're the one who started
her father on that shit.

540
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,253
That's not true.

541
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:22,338
Oh, yeah?

542
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:25,132
He took that shipment
to Amsterdam for you.

543
00:43:25,217 --> 00:43:27,468
That's what
I say to the cop.

544
00:43:28,178 --> 00:43:31,263
He was a smart kid. I didn't
want him to go in jail.

545
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:32,556
He had a future.
You were pregnant.

546
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:34,391
Oh, spare me the details.
You're family.

547
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:37,186
He might have been better off if
you had just kept your mouth shut

548
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,979
and let him go to jail.

549
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:41,816
He was not enough
strong to be in jail.

550
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:44,151
It would have killed him.

551
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:47,696
The streets that you left
him on are what killed him.

552
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:50,199
No, Helene.

553
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:52,993
Come on.

554
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:59,125
I don't have anything
more to say to you.

555
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:00,751
Helene, come on.

556
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:06,382
Helene, you and Nicole,
we're family.

557
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:11,220
You're my only family.
Let me try to help you.

558
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:17,643
Helene.

559
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:22,273
This is to help you
with your bill.

560
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:24,358
I don't want your money.

561
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:29,238
Don't you get it? I don't want
anything from you ever again.

562
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:32,408
Now, get out of here
before I call the cops.

563
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:50,718
You look like you're about
ready to jump off a bridge.

564
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,428
Here, have some chicken.

565
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:53,929
No. Thanks.

566
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:58,100
I need something else.

567
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:01,604
You don't even have to
say it, man. I'm psychic.

568
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,460
Foreign Legion, huh? That's them
guys with those white hats on, right?

569
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,672
I thought the Foreign Legion was something
that you see in old movies, or something.

570
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,886
I wish it was just
an old movie.

571
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,807
Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,974
Hey, where you want
to go now, man?

573
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,143
You want to get some girls,
you want to go dancing?

574
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,063
You know what I'm saying?
Where you want to go?

575
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,649
I've got some
business to finish.

576
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,693
Personal business.

577
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,324
Is it something I can
help you with, man?

578
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,662
Yeah. Maybe.

579
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,918
Hey, look here.
Let's drink to that, man.

580
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,003
Hey, put them up there.

581
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,381
Here, all right.

582
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,762
Jump the devil with
his blind children.

583
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,685
Look here, man,
I gotta make phone call.

584
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,520
I'll be right back, all right?

585
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,105
Yeah?
Yeah.

586
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,315
Where you going?

587
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,319
Hey, we got to find us a place
to stay for the night, right?

588
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,446
I'm looking out for you.

589
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,368
I'll be right back.
Hey, hey, there's a phone.

590
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,253
Look out, look out.

591
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,303
All right. All right.
Just stand up.

592
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,727
Hey.

593
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,273
Check it out, Dorothy.
We ain't in Kansas no more.

594
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,609
Where are we going?

595
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,655
Visit an old friend of mine. There.
Yeah, that's the place, right there.

596
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,758
Sure you all right?

597
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,092
Yeah.

598
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,308
Yeah. She only uses this place
when she's in LA on business.

599
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,562
Go, go, go ahead. Look around.
It's yours for the night.

600
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,192
How about you?

601
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,569
Yeah, I'll be
right next door.

602
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:45,654
That's hers, too.

603
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,738
Okay.

604
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,205
It's nice to have friends,
ain't it?

605
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,212
Hey, go look. You relax, man.
Enjoy yourself.

606
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,435
Good morning.

607
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,398
Joshua told me you needed a
place to stay for the night.

608
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,444
I hope this was adequate.

609
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,740
Yes. Thank you.

610
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,455
I need to go. Excuse me.

611
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,211
So go.

612
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,174
When I came in this morning,

613
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,678
you were spread across the
bed like an old throw rug.

614
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,349
What happened
to my clothes?

615
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:42,020
I gave them to the valet with
instructions to burn them.

616
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,232
You told them to
burn my clothes?

617
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,653
Give me a break.

618
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,579
There are a few shops
right down the street.

619
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:04,334
I'm sure we'll be able to find a way
to replace your fabulous wardrobe.

620
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,845
I just want my clothes back.

621
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,976
Not on your life.

622
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,978
I'm taking you
shopping today

623
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,773
if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming.

624
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,695
Why are you so nice to me?

625
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,721
Just try one more.
S'il vous plaÃ®t.

626
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,395
It's nice.
It's not for me.

627
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,897
No?

628
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,906
How about this?

629
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,243
Any better?

630
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,580
Everything okay in there?

631
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,584
Everything is fine.

632
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:36,426
You know, people in New York are
still talking about your fight.

633
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,515
Let them talk.

634
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,612
You planning on sleeping
in the hallway?

635
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:59,157
No. I'll stay next
door with Joshua.

636
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,786
Is that it?

637
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,581
You two got
something going?

638
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,667
Cynthia,
I'm not your toy.

639
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:15,757
If you want a toy to play with,
talk to Russell, not to me.

640
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:23,765
You want to carry this?
There. Come on.

641
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,839
Is this your ball?

642
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,599
Take some money.

643
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,904
Oh, Christ.

644
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,212
I'll do it.

645
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,964
Well, finally.

646
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,675
I mean, I'll fight.

647
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,720
Oh.

648
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:14,310
But first you have to help me
to take care of some business.

649
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,980
All right, talk to me.

650
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,985
I need to open
a bank account.

651
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,445
I like that kind of talk.

652
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:29,492
Not in my name, we'll make up a
name. Don't ask me why, just do it.

653
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,412
That's my condition.

654
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,790
I'll call my accountant
first thing in the morning.

655
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,339
Anything else?

656
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,427
Yes. I have
to move out of here.

657
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:57,270
Do I have the right to ask what
brought these sudden changes on?

658
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,899
Look, I'm gonna fight for you.
I have to live like a fighter.

659
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:05,736
This place is too nice
to me, too soft, too easy.

660
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,240
I see.

661
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:18,064
Are you sure it isn't because you've
found something a little softer,
a little easier out on the street today?

662
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:20,688
Don't answer that.
That's "My business. My business!".

663
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:23,812
I'm sick of this shit!
Get out!

664
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:28,636
Get the fuck out!
And take that goddam cripple with you.

665
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,260
In the morning you call Russell
and you tell him where you're staying.

666
00:56:33,284 --> 00:56:36,484
From now on, you deal with Russell,
and only with Russell.

667
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:38,508
Our relationship is strictly business.

668
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:43,032
The way it should have been
from the beginning. You got that?

669
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:50,856
And you owe me for these.

670
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,680
I'll call Russell in the morning.
You don't forget to call your accountant.

671
00:57:01,204 --> 00:57:03,204
I'll think about it.

672
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:06,407
Yeah. Think about it.

673
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,767
Don't fall
in them damn skates, boy!

674
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,325
Excuse me. No, no. Please,
sir, go right ahead.

675
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,777
What is this, a dance, man?
He's got on a damn skirt.

676
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,028
Scotland.

677
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:57,783
Scotland? Scotland's shit. Kick
his Scotland ass. It's not that bad.

678
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,369
Go up his dress. I'd like to
see if he got any drawers on.

679
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,715
Take your time,
take your time now.

680
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,634
Don't be shaking
hands with him.

681
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,642
Come on, man,
come on. Now...

682
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,029
Damn.

683
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,447
Look at all this.

684
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,115
Get off my car.

685
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,163
Move, move, move.
Get off my car, man.

686
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,806
Get off the damn car.

687
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,105
Yeah, that's it,
that's it, that's it.

688
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,044
That's it. One more round,
one more round. Almost there.

689
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,171
That's it. Yeah,
that's all right. That's it.

690
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,798
Lay it on him, that's it.
You got it, man.

691
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,634
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let go of
him, Lyon. He's gone. Let go of him.

692
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,429
Hey, let him go, let him go,
let him go. Let him go.

693
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,473
He's gone. Let him go, Lyon,
come on. Yeah, that's right.

694
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,060
Be ready with the cash, Flash. Okay.

695
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,312
All right. All right.
Yeah.

696
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:37,026
I'm back. Who's back?
We're back in town.

697
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,154
That's right, baby.

698
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,961
After you, ladies.

699
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,094
Moustafa, it's your turn.

700
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,600
Mommy, does this mean
I can have a bike?

701
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,811
Honey, why don't you
go in the other room

702
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,564
so I can talk to
Mr. Eldridge, okay?

703
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,191
You could draw me
a pretty picture.

704
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,693
I'm gonna go
draw myself a bike.

705
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,363
Well, that would be
very nice, sweetie.

706
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,781
Cute.

707
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,160
I just don't know how I
couldn't have known about it.

708
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,955
Well, husbands do
this all the time.

709
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,625
Yeah. Secret little
insurance policy,

710
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,419
want to make sure the wife and kids
will be taken care of, you know?

711
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:41,173
Without freaking them out.
You know what I mean?

712
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,176
Well, you'll get one
of those every month.

713
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,096
You know how the post office is around
here, so I'll be bringing them by myself,

714
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,597
if you don't mind.

715
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:54,103
Oh, no, that's fine. Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

716
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,649
Don't thank me. Thank the
man who set up the policy.

717
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,778
May he rest in peace.

718
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,993
Oh, just do me
one little favor.

719
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,037
I know it's something
that he would have wanted.

720
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,498
Well, what is that?

721
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,208
Get the little girl a bike.

722
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,589
All right,
you have a nice day now.

723
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,691
Yes! That's it, that's it.
I like that. Yeah.

724
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:31,575
Hey, hey. That's bad for you.

725
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,245
Destroys your concentration.

726
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,956
Well, it looked
good to me.

727
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:41,251
It looked good to me,
but get on out there, boy.

728
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,279
Hey, you guys.

729
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,823
What are you doing?
What is that?

730
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,494
Like my new bike?

731
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,620
Yeah.

732
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,580
Bye, you guys.
Bye.

733
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,207
Bye.

734
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,625
See you tomorrow.

735
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,017
Moustafa, wake up.
He's here, downstairs!

736
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,696
Come on, let's go.

737
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,077
Nicole!
Come on inside, honey.

738
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,592
Think he see us?

739
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,388
He'll be back.

740
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,016
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

741
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,269
Okay, I'm taking some bets.
Lyonheart five to fight in the pool.

742
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,729
No wading.

743
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,473
Yeah!

744
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:35,884
Get up!

745
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,069
That's it.

746
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,966
Better luck next time, man.

747
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,850
We don't need
to go Rambo, huh? That's it.

748
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:18,945
Yeah! Hey.
We did it. My boy did it.

749
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,490
Who is Helene Gaultier?

750
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,576
According to the bank,

751
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,413
she's the one they said cashed
that phony insurance check.

752
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,834
She used to be married
to his brother.

753
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,587
He's just trying to help
the woman out, that's all.

754
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,339
Is he fucking her?

755
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,469
Cynthia, you're one hard,
cold, sick bitch, you know that?

756
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,262
I asked you a question.

757
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,056
Bitch, the man don't even
step inside her apartment.

758
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,351
She don't know where the
damn money's coming from.

759
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,603
Well, as his
self-appointed manager,

760
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,064
I'm counting on you
to keep him out of trouble.

761
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:58,443
You mean keep
him making money.

762
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,903
That's right.

763
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:04,950
For me. And for you.

764
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,461
Start keeping
an eye on those two.

765
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,919
Hi. See my new bike?

766
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,968
I said that's a nice bike.

767
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:11,433
Is that French? My daddy
used to talk French.

768
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,691
I've got to go now.

769
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,151
Who's that?

770
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,196
Nicole.

771
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,947
Okay, you go home right now.

772
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,033
You go home right now.

773
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,743
You know why we're here.

774
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,788
Don't force us to get rough
in front of little girl.

775
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,290
Without me they'll
be on the street.

776
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,876
Tell your sad stories
to the court-martial.

777
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,255
We're just supposed to take
you back, any way we can.

778
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,467
Just give me one week to get
the money for them. One week.

779
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,802
Your time was up
in the desert,

780
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,388
and we still owe you
for that one, fucker.

781
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,640
Go to hell.

782
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,309
I show you hell.

783
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,293
Grab him!

784
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,848
Come on.

785
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:40,146
This is the end.
Let's go. Let's go!

786
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,573
Lion.

787
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,953
If you're in some kind of trouble,
maybe we ought to know about it.

788
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,748
And you spying on me,
I should know about it, too.

789
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,752
Okay, now you know. Maybe we should
lay all our cards on the table.

790
01:13:05,276 --> 01:13:06,461
Do you hear that?

791
01:13:06,685 --> 01:13:09,885
Either you take a ride with the
cops or you take a ride with me.

792
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:12,209
Now what's it gonna be stud?

793
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,433
What about them?

794
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:16,657
If I was you I wouldn't be
so concerned about their health

795
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:19,358
It doesn't look like they were
doing you any big favours today.

796
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,713
Come on.

797
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,177
Here.

798
01:13:28,262 --> 01:13:29,304
Oh, man!

799
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:32,223
These dudes did a number
on you, huh, homes?

800
01:13:32,308 --> 01:13:34,225
Do you know
what you need, man?

801
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,394
You need karate lessons, man.

802
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,062
That way nobody
will mess with you.

803
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,648
I mean, look at you.
You got a broken rib.

804
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:42,734
You're gonna have to stay
in bed for a month, homes.

805
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,569
Do me a favor.
Yo.

806
01:13:45,446 --> 01:13:47,572
Don't talk to nobody
about my rib.

807
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:50,325
Don't worry about that, man.
Shit, $100, man.

808
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:51,367
Have a nice day.

809
01:13:51,452 --> 01:13:52,702
Business all the time.

810
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,726
<i>His name is Lyon.
I know he's here.</i>

811
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,550
<i>I have to go find him.
Now is he in here?</i>

812
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:58,574
<i>Can you tell me if he's in here?</i>

813
01:13:58,598 --> 01:14:00,312
<i>Well who knows?
Who knows where he...</i>

814
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:02,336
<i>...Excuse me, I have to go.</i>

815
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,860
I rushed over here as soon
as I heard what happened.

816
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:09,884
My God.

817
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:12,808
You're staying here tonight, aren't you?

818
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:15,332
When did you start to care?

819
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:17,756
Get off it Lyon.

820
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,280
I know I said some things
that I probably shouldn't have

821
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:22,704
But if I had known the
truth about your situation

822
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,928
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have helped you with your family.

823
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:32,452
- You want to help?
- Yeah.

824
01:14:37,176 --> 01:14:38,676
I need your help.

825
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,100
Whatever you want.

826
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:46,497
Who's there?

827
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:47,706
Mr. Eldridge.

828
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,335
I wasn't expecting
you back so soon.

829
01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:54,630
Yeah, I know. Look, something's
come up. We've got to talk.

830
01:14:54,714 --> 01:14:56,382
About what?

831
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:59,385
Look, I heard about the shit
that went down today. Look...

832
01:14:59,469 --> 01:15:02,596
Please, Mrs. Gaultier,
this is real important.

833
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:08,269
Look, you've got to get out
of this place tonight.

834
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:09,478
You and the little girl.

835
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:12,398
How do you know
what happened today?

836
01:15:12,524 --> 01:15:13,941
Hey, my man?

837
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,870
So there never was an
insurance plan, was there?

838
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,872
Okay. Now you see that?

839
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,040
Yeah, that's where your money's
been coming from. No, no, no, no.

840
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:34,962
Look, now I think you owe him a minute
of your time to say what he's got to say.

841
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,966
So, say what you got to say.

842
01:15:39,259 --> 01:15:42,928
Okay. Those men today, they
followed me from North Africa.

843
01:15:44,055 --> 01:15:46,056
They knew I'd be
coming to see you.

844
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,058
Does this have anything
to do with drugs?

845
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,394
Because if it does, I don't want
to have anything to do with it.

846
01:15:50,478 --> 01:15:52,104
I've been through this
shit with Francois...

847
01:15:52,188 --> 01:15:55,316
Helene, I swear,
it's not drugs.

848
01:15:56,776 --> 01:16:01,739
Now I don't have too much
time, but I'm here to help you.

849
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:08,162
Don't do this to me.

850
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,539
My life is hard enough
as it is, I...

851
01:16:10,624 --> 01:16:14,919
I'm not trying to give you
problems. I'm here to help you.

852
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,338
Please,
you've got to trust me.

853
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,342
Hi, Mr. Eldridge.

854
01:16:21,426 --> 01:16:23,177
Hey. Yeah, yeah.

855
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:26,513
See my new bike?
He's already seen it.

856
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:31,477
Mommy,
is he still a stranger?

857
01:16:38,735 --> 01:16:42,363
No, honey.
This is your uncle Lyon,

858
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,034
your daddy's brother.

859
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,663
I knew you weren't
really a stranger.

860
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:09,223
That's him. Atilla.

861
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:18,232
A born killer. Real pro, not
some bum we picked off the street.

862
01:17:21,152 --> 01:17:23,612
He likes to toy
with his opponents,

863
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:30,160
give them hope.
Then he tears them apart.

864
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,425
Never seen anything like that
on our circuit, huh?

865
01:17:52,559 --> 01:17:55,769
And that's why I can't
let you have Lyon just yet.

866
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:59,106
The fight's already scheduled.

867
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:04,778
But if I get hassled by the French
Consulate or the immigration people,

868
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:08,574
it'll screw up everything.

869
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:12,703
So I need your cooperation.
And I promise you,

870
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:15,873
as soon as Atilla's
finished ripping him apart,

871
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:23,329
I will hand him over to you
as is. What do you say, guys?

872
01:18:24,453 --> 01:18:26,753
I say...

873
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:39,398
Can we watch?

874
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:48,824
Yes.

875
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:54,205
I hope this is the right
stuff. Joshua picked them.

876
01:18:54,289 --> 01:18:57,208
Well, there's enough to feed
her entire kindergarten class.

877
01:18:57,334 --> 01:19:01,962
And there's something else
Santa Claus brought. Oh, no.

878
01:19:02,047 --> 01:19:04,048
Merry Christmas.

879
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:06,467
You guys are gonna spoil her.

880
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:10,012
It's my only niece, I've got
the right to spoil her, right?

881
01:19:10,097 --> 01:19:11,764
Yeah,
I guess so.

882
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:18,229
Well, if there
is no real food here,

883
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:22,400
I guess I'll pick some things up
from work tomorrow, bring them home.

884
01:19:22,484 --> 01:19:25,694
That's something else
I want to talk about.

885
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:30,574
I don't think you should go
back to that place anymore.

886
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:34,245
Are you serious? How long do
you expect us to stay here?

887
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,419
I don't know, just until
you have a new job

888
01:19:41,503 --> 01:19:44,922
or another husband.

889
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:48,801
I mean, it's no problem, you
can stay here. It's home now.

890
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,178
This is beautiful.

891
01:19:51,847 --> 01:19:55,516
Yeah, your niece,
she made it for you.

892
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,936
And insisted I put it
right where you'd see it.

893
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:00,146
Nice.

894
01:20:02,524 --> 01:20:03,524
Oui.

895
01:20:07,821 --> 01:20:10,614
Hey, man,
guess who's outside?

896
01:20:15,168 --> 01:20:16,752
Let's get crazy.

897
01:20:19,631 --> 01:20:20,756
Where are we going?

898
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,676
Loosen up, we're going
to see some friends.

899
01:20:27,264 --> 01:20:30,808
How are your relatives doing,
by the way?

900
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,227
They'll be much better
if I was there.

901
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:37,147
Well, this little party
we're attending tonight,

902
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,566
it's for their benefit
as much as ours.

903
01:20:40,527 --> 01:20:43,612
These friends of mine are thinking
of betting some serious money

904
01:20:43,697 --> 01:20:48,784
on your next fight, Lyon. Just
how serious depends on you.

905
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:53,080
We can all retire on this one.
Don't fuck it up.

906
01:21:21,735 --> 01:21:23,235
Mr. Lyonheart, welcome.

907
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,031
We've just been watching your
videotape. Most impressive.

908
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,283
Would you like a drink?
Can I get you a drink, sir?

909
01:21:29,409 --> 01:21:31,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll have a gin and tonic

910
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:33,996
with a twist of lime,
my good man.

911
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,664
By all means.
Come this way, please.

912
01:21:35,749 --> 01:21:37,333
Did you have a pleasant
journey over here?

913
01:21:37,417 --> 01:21:38,584
No, man.

914
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:39,793
I'm sorry
to hear that.

915
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,005
So, did you get
the tape?

916
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:46,800
If you knew what I went
through to smuggle this out...

917
01:22:03,735 --> 01:22:05,027
What do you think?

918
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:06,904
Not too good.

919
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,447
Full of shit.

920
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:23,462
Enough of this.

921
01:22:23,546 --> 01:22:26,590
Well, I have to tell you,
I'm not too impressed.

922
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:28,467
What about you,
Mr. Lyonheart?

923
01:22:28,635 --> 01:22:32,721
We have friends in Hong Kong who say
that he will wipe the floor with you.

924
01:22:32,806 --> 01:22:34,890
What do you think
about that?

925
01:22:34,974 --> 01:22:36,475
Anything is possible.

926
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:39,699
Humble devil isn't he?

927
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:43,745
Talk is cheap. You've
all seen him in action.

928
01:22:45,623 --> 01:22:48,250
Draw your own
conclusions, gentlemen.

929
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:51,670
As far as I'm concerned,

930
01:22:51,754 --> 01:22:55,841
Lyonheart is gonna eat
this bozo for breakfast.

931
01:22:58,136 --> 01:23:01,263
And I've got a quarter mil
ready to back it up.

932
01:23:04,434 --> 01:23:08,437
We'll let you know which
way we're going on the day of the fight.

933
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:34,546
Faster?
Yeah, faster.

934
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,797
Okay.

935
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:54,858
Okay, that's it
for today, guys.

936
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:16,713
She's so beautiful.

937
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:23,220
Tonight, I'll have a fight,
a big fight, lots of money,

938
01:24:24,013 --> 01:24:29,101
and if I win, I would like to take
you and Nicole away from this place,

939
01:24:29,185 --> 01:24:34,189
away from this city, and leave
all the bad stuff behind us.

940
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:43,573
No problems. No problems,
it'll be clear.

941
01:24:45,326 --> 01:24:46,409
This is going great.

942
01:24:46,536 --> 01:24:47,786
Picked up your
highest script.

943
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:49,162
You understand
what I'm saying?

944
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:51,832
You don't understand
at all, right? Okay.

945
01:25:36,586 --> 01:25:40,297
Madhouse out there, man.
Hey, hey, hey! My man.

946
01:25:40,381 --> 01:25:43,383
Hey, look at you.
Yeah. Ready to get rich?

947
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:45,260
Come on, throw a few,
throw a few.

948
01:25:48,139 --> 01:25:52,017
I took all my money out of the
bank and I put a bet on myself.

949
01:25:52,101 --> 01:25:54,394
We're going to
win that fight.

950
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:05,614
Confidence, that's what I like to
hear, man. You know what I'm saying?

951
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:09,492
All right, all right,
what is it, man?

952
01:26:09,577 --> 01:26:11,953
You've been hiding something all
week long. What's going down, man?

953
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:13,038
Nothing.

954
01:26:13,122 --> 01:26:14,539
Nothing, huh? Nothing?

955
01:26:14,624 --> 01:26:15,749
Easy.

956
01:26:17,752 --> 01:26:19,961
You know what's circulating
out there, man?

957
01:26:20,046 --> 01:26:22,214
12 million motherfucking
dollars, man.

958
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:24,341
Cynthia's friends have come
through like a motherfucker, man,

959
01:26:24,425 --> 01:26:26,384
and then I hear
that shit about Atilla.

960
01:26:26,469 --> 01:26:28,929
Man, this dude's already
bagged eight bodies.

961
01:26:29,013 --> 01:26:30,764
I'll beat him.
Beat him?

962
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,474
You ain't gonna beat him,
not if you're all fucked up.

963
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:34,059
How're you gonna beat him
if you're all fucked up?

964
01:26:34,143 --> 01:26:35,727
I'll beat the guy. I have to.

965
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:37,437
You don't have to do shit,
motherfucker,

966
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:39,147
but get yourself all
fucked up like I did.

967
01:26:39,232 --> 01:26:40,273
Is that what you want?

968
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:41,524
Be out there on the street,
motherfucker,

969
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:43,944
running $5 fights
for winos and junkies?

970
01:26:45,488 --> 01:26:49,824
I'm gonna take you away
from this shitty business.

971
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:53,995
You and my family, even
Cynthia, if she wants to.

972
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,793
Cynthia, man?

973
01:26:59,877 --> 01:27:04,005
You think Cynthia gives
a flying fuck about you?

974
01:27:05,508 --> 01:27:08,051
You know what
your problem is, man?

975
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:10,470
You got a big heart,
Lyonheart.

976
01:27:10,554 --> 01:27:13,014
I mean, you're strong
as a lion, man,

977
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:17,018
but this right here, this?

978
01:27:17,728 --> 01:27:20,605
This is what fucks you up
and leaves you bleeding

979
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:24,734
on the motherfucking ground with nobody
to give a two-bit shit about your ass.

980
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,778
Look, Lyonheart,
nobody gives a shit

981
01:27:26,862 --> 01:27:29,072
about you but you, man.
Nobody.

982
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:32,200
You care about me.

983
01:27:34,328 --> 01:27:37,539
I'm gonna win that fight.
You've got to trust me.

984
01:27:43,629 --> 01:27:45,297
Hey, Josh.
What it is.

985
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:58,893
Who you betting on?

986
01:27:58,978 --> 01:28:00,145
Look at the board.

987
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:02,564
I'd say the wind's definitely
blowing in our direction.

988
01:28:02,648 --> 01:28:06,401
I didn't ask you that. I asked
you who you were betting on.

989
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:11,698
Why? Having any last-minutes
doubts about your boy?

990
01:28:13,367 --> 01:28:17,287
No, I... I was just
remembering the way you did me.

991
01:28:18,664 --> 01:28:21,666
Is there something
I should know about Atilla?

992
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:24,544
Is there something
I should know about Lyon?

993
01:28:24,628 --> 01:28:29,132
No, no, no, no. No. He's gonna
stomp that dude in the ground.

994
01:28:29,675 --> 01:28:32,010
Send him home
in a little box.

995
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:35,930
Well then,
there's the desk.

996
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,018
You've got about five minutes
left to place your bet.

997
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:42,687
You near an hour
too late, man.

998
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:47,317
Hookie-bookie,
what's up, man?

999
01:28:47,401 --> 01:28:50,195
Hey, talk to me, man. You
gonna make a bet, or what?

1000
01:28:52,865 --> 01:28:54,449
All of the stuff.

1001
01:28:54,533 --> 01:28:56,951
Yeah? Very good.

1002
01:29:00,581 --> 01:29:03,458
Which way are you
going, man, Lyonheart or Atilla?

1003
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:05,877
One minute till post,
my friend.

1004
01:30:09,733 --> 01:30:13,486
Did you see the look on his
face? He's totally psyched out.

1005
01:31:40,407 --> 01:31:42,242
He's toying with him.

1006
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:12,188
That's right. That's
it. All right. Got him.

1007
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:13,398
Another one.
Keep going.

1008
01:32:13,482 --> 01:32:14,566
Yeah. Kick him again.

1009
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:15,692
There we go.

1010
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:21,155
Yeah!

1011
01:32:26,495 --> 01:32:27,996
What's wrong?

1012
01:33:28,307 --> 01:33:29,307
Man.

1013
01:33:52,748 --> 01:33:55,958
Lyonheart, stay down, damn
it. Stay the fuck down!

1014
01:34:00,089 --> 01:34:03,299
Stay down, man.
Just stay down.

1015
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:09,889
We bet all the money.

1016
01:34:09,973 --> 01:34:12,725
Don't worry about that,
just stay down.

1017
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:24,028
Cynthia, she bet against me.
I know it.

1018
01:34:24,113 --> 01:34:28,700
You were right, you were
right. She bet against me.

1019
01:34:28,784 --> 01:34:32,620
Damn it! This dude's gonna kill
your ass. Don't you know that?

1020
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:37,417
This dude's gonna kill your
ass, man. Don't you know that?

1021
01:34:39,044 --> 01:34:41,295
Look, he's hurt.
Come on, Lyonheart. Come on.

1022
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:46,718
That dude's gonna kill your
ass. Don't you know that?

1023
01:35:37,978 --> 01:35:40,897
Lyonheart, I told you
the way this shit did me.

1024
01:35:40,981 --> 01:35:44,066
Don't let it do you, man.
Stay the fuck down.

1025
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:47,320
Come on, man.
Come on, Lyon.

1026
01:35:47,404 --> 01:35:50,698
We don't need the money, man.
I got us a deal.

1027
01:35:50,783 --> 01:35:53,993
I told you, 50-50 all
the way down the line.

1028
01:35:54,077 --> 01:35:57,121
Well, I'm gonna split it with
you, man. 50-50, all the way, man.

1029
01:35:57,206 --> 01:35:59,791
Just like I said I would.

1030
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:02,043
Look, it's on him, man.

1031
01:36:02,836 --> 01:36:04,879
The whole bet's on Atilla.

1032
01:36:10,886 --> 01:36:12,220
Wrong bet.

1033
01:36:20,437 --> 01:36:21,521
Yes!

1034
01:36:23,732 --> 01:36:26,359
This dude's gonna
kill your ass, man.

1035
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:44,126
Come on,
kick the snot out of him!

1036
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:47,004
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, Lyonheart.

1037
01:36:47,089 --> 01:36:51,259
Hey. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, Lyonheart.

1038
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:53,094
Lyonheart!

1039
01:36:55,848 --> 01:36:57,098
Yeah!

1040
01:37:02,312 --> 01:37:04,647
Come on! Come on!

1041
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:08,776
You...

1042
01:37:22,207 --> 01:37:24,375
Come on! Come on!

1043
01:37:28,297 --> 01:37:29,630
All right!

1044
01:37:31,508 --> 01:37:33,551
Get out there.
You bury that motherfucker.

1045
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,774
Kick the shit out of him!

1046
01:37:58,869 --> 01:38:00,786
We got him! We got him!

1047
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:40,242
Finish him, man.

1048
01:38:40,452 --> 01:38:41,577
Right.

1049
01:39:00,806 --> 01:39:05,059
Great fight, Lyon. Your
family's going to be okay now.

1050
01:39:06,561 --> 01:39:09,105
It's time to go home.
Let's go.

1051
01:39:10,524 --> 01:39:11,774
Let's go.

1052
01:39:20,575 --> 01:39:25,287
Oh, Cynthia, darling, I just wanted
to thank you for such wonderful advice.

1053
01:39:32,045 --> 01:39:33,546
Open the door.

1054
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:55,693
You definitely got heart,
Lyonheart.

1055
01:39:55,777 --> 01:39:58,946
Don't ever lose it,
because you never get it back.

1056
01:39:59,031 --> 01:40:02,491
Take it from me.
I've been there, man.

1057
01:40:50,957 --> 01:40:52,291
Miss Caldera,

1058
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:55,920
the house would like to have a word
with you regarding your unsecured marker.

1059
01:40:56,004 --> 01:40:57,671
This way, please.

1060
01:40:59,925 --> 01:41:02,843
If you find that
bitch, don't let her off the premises.

1061
01:41:02,928 --> 01:41:04,887
She's headed toward
the front door now, sir.

1062
01:41:04,971 --> 01:41:06,180
With the cash?

1063
01:41:06,264 --> 01:41:08,140
Tell him it's
in New York. I swear it is.

1064
01:41:08,225 --> 01:41:09,225
I'll have it tomorrow.

1065
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:10,726
You better.

1066
01:41:22,697 --> 01:41:24,115
Oh, my God.

1067
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:36,836
Look. We're all ready to go.

1068
01:41:39,714 --> 01:41:41,215
What happened?

1069
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:45,386
Come on. I love you.

1070
01:41:53,812 --> 01:41:58,649
Nicole, you and your mommy will
have to go without me, okay?

1071
01:42:01,736 --> 01:42:03,404
Here, this will help you.

1072
01:42:03,488 --> 01:42:07,741
No. Why? You have
to go with us. You have to.

1073
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:12,413
It's not fair! Why can't
you go? It's not fair!

1074
01:42:13,206 --> 01:42:14,832
It's not fair!

1075
01:42:14,916 --> 01:42:17,334
I know, life is not too fair.

1076
01:42:17,419 --> 01:42:22,089
And sometimes it's ugly
and it's stupid and mean.

1077
01:42:22,174 --> 01:42:24,842
But sometimes,
life is beautiful, too.

1078
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:28,512
Now I've got to go back
to an ugly place,

1079
01:42:28,597 --> 01:42:31,974
and if I don't, I'll be
running for the rest of my life,

1080
01:42:32,058 --> 01:42:34,476
and you and your mommy
will be running with me.

1081
01:42:34,561 --> 01:42:36,312
I don't care.

1082
01:42:37,564 --> 01:42:40,900
Nicole, chÃ©rie, you've
seen too much ugly already.

1083
01:42:41,902 --> 01:42:43,444
What about you?

1084
01:42:46,281 --> 01:42:49,450
I'll always have something
beautiful to remember.

1085
01:43:11,306 --> 01:43:13,390
You take care
of them, okay?

1086
01:43:13,475 --> 01:43:15,809
You got it, man.
You got it.

1087
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:18,145
I love you.

1088
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,397
Me, too. I'll miss you.

1089
01:43:27,155 --> 01:43:28,822
Come on,
let's go.

1090
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:49,969
I love you.

1091
01:44:18,039 --> 01:44:19,290
Get out.

1092
01:44:36,266 --> 01:44:37,599
