1
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,757
Hey!

2
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,597
Hey, that's my car!

3
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,227
You can't steal my car! I'm a cop!

4
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,500
Oh, my God!

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,066
Shit.

6
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,619
Freeze!

7
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
Okay! Okay, you got me.

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,383
Enjoying yourself, pervert?

9
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,099
Jesus, would you take it easy,
Dick Tracy?

10
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,221
Move.

11
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,142
Can I just ask you one question?

12
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,268
Yeah, what?

13
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,267
How come all cops have two-inch peckers?

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,282
Damn.

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,441
Yeah?

16
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,869
What time is it?

17
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,369
Where?

18
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,121
Yeah.

19
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,165
I'll meet you there.

20
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,834
Okay, okay, I'll meet you there.

21
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,686
<i>Okay.</i>

22
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,055
Well, I like that wrinkled look.

23
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,509
Very sexy. Next time, go the whole way.

24
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,515
You know, ask for less starch.

25
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,179
Had a hard night.

26
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,144
Don't talk to me about hard
till you spend a night with Charlene.

27
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,184
That woman is a total nympho.

28
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,065
She couldn't keep her hands off me.

29
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,863
I was so sore this morning,
I thought it was gonna fall off.

30
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,778
Ah, Jesus, Sarge, I don't want to hear
about your sex life. My head's killing me.

31
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,487
Too much firewater last night, huh?

32
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,715
You know, you've been hitting the stuff
a little strong lately.

33
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,538
Hey, I got everything under control, okay?

34
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,708
Well, what have we got here?

35
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,539
Name's Teri Kaplan.

36
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,711
Teri Kaplan?

37
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,630
Teri Kaplan.

38
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,007
Isn't that one of Anthony Vincenzo's girls?

39
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,095
That's her.

40
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,676
Hey, Sergeant.

41
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,594
I think I found something.

42
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,731
Give me a stick or a pen or something.

43
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,249
"Anthony Alberto Vincenzo."

44
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,457
Hey, Frank.

45
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,375
How's the cocaine business?

46
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,468
I wouldn't know.

47
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,753
Oh, that's right.

48
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,965
You're not a drug dealer.
You're an importer.

49
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,765
And your brother's not a scum-sucking
pimp, he's a talent agent.

50
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,022
This is my mother here.
Don't talk that way in front of my mother.

51
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,565
Who the hell do you think you are?

52
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,603
<i>I'll</i> tell you who I am. I'm the man who's
gonna arrest your brother for murder.

53
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,731
Haven't seen him.

54
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,661
Well, when you do, you tell him the smart
thing to do is to turn himself in.

55
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,535
Because this time we got him by the balls.

56
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,037
I'm sorry. I don't mean "balls."

57
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,875
I mean "chandeliers."

58
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,953
We have him by the chandeliers.

59
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,165
You're interrupting our meal. Beat it.

60
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,669
Oh, Murphy, let me ask you,
you ever hear of Murphy's Law?

61
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,138
"If anything can possibly
go wrong, it will"?

62
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,261
A lot of things could happen
to someone like you.

63
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,721
You could get run over by a truck.

64
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,362
The gas heater in your apartment
could blow up.

65
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,186
Or you could lose a wheel going down
the freeway at 80 miles an hour.

66
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,266
Got to remember that.

67
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,482
The only law I know is Jack Murphy's Law.

68
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,866
That's very simple.

69
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,320
"Don't fuck with Jack Murphy."

70
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,364
You remember that.

71
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:48,218
<i>Continental Coach Lines
No. 28, arriving Ramp 16.</i>

72
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,972
<i>Ventura, Santa Carla,
Camarillo and Oxnard.</i>

73
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,793
<i>Attention, please.</i>

74
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:23,048
<i>Sunliner Express to San Diego
departs in 30 minutes on Ramp 5.</i>

75
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,377
Mr. Cameron?

76
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,032
Howdy.

77
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,781
Where are the addresses?

78
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,283
Right here.

79
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,498
Had a little trouble with one of them.
Ben Wilcove.

80
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,001
Seems he retired a few years ago,

81
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,503
moved up in the mountains a ways.

82
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,381
He wasn't easy to find.

83
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,053
But you found him.

84
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,134
Oh, yeah.

85
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,217
But, like I say,
it took a bit longer than I figured.

86
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,886
Uh, what I mean is,
I'm gonna have to charge you

87
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,430
a little more than we originally agreed on.

88
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,935
How much more?

89
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,362
With expenses and everything...

90
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,940
Let's say another $2,000.

91
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,360
Go to hell.

92
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,447
Miss Freeman!

93
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,117
Miss Freeman.

94
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,792
Hey, do you want these addresses or not?

95
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,213
You know, you can go to somebody else
if you want to.

96
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,888
But if these people were to find out
you was looking for them,

97
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,310
now I wonder how they'd feel about that.

98
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,479
You really are a slime, aren't you?

99
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,768
No, ma'am. Just a private investigator.

100
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,594
Of course, some people
would say that's the same thing.

101
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,491
All right, $2,000.

102
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,829
That'll be cash on delivery,
if you don't mind.

103
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,999
How about traveler's checks?

104
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,827
That'd be all right.

105
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,758
Since you put it that way

106
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,932
I guess we could forget
about the extra expenses and all,

107
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,600
and just call it even.

108
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,310
Nice doing business with you, ma'am.

109
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,396
You move another hair,
and I'll blow your head off.

110
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,479
Now wait a minute.

111
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,444
You can have my wallet.

112
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
It has almost $100 in it.

113
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,986
I don't want your money.

114
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,707
All I want is for you to say, "Ah."

115
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,993
What do you mean?

116
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,672
You know. Like in a doctor's office.

117
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,007
Do it.

118
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,009
Ah.

119
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,174
You can do better than that.

120
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,514
Make it bigger.

121
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,183
Ah.

122
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,774
Ah.

123
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,352
Perfect.

124
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,484
Hello.

125
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,444
- Jack Murphy?
- Yeah.

126
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,458
<i>Hello?</i>

127
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,548
Hello?

128
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,717
Hey, what the hell is this?
Some kind of game?

129
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,338
Yes, and the game is just beginning.

130
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>I'm gonna kill you.</i>

131
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,184
<i>But first, I'm gonna put you through hell.</i>

132
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,442
Marie? Thought her name was Charlene.

133
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,736
Charlene's history. Marie's the future.

134
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,022
Woman has an incredible imagination.

135
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,907
I've been a cop 18 years. She knows
words I've never even heard before.

136
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,069
Say, Murph...

137
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,281
I like your tie, especially the stains.

138
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,416
Looks like the sewer backed up again.

139
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,462
I was at Madam Tong's the other night.
I saw your wife.

140
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,504
- Nice tits.
- Hey, lay it down.

141
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,173
Taste as good as they look?

142
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,756
Break it up, God damn it!

143
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,800
Come on, stop it!

144
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,218
Ease up.

145
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,432
What the hell's wrong with you two?

146
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,890
Murphy! My office, now!

147
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,313
Let's go clean up. Come on.

148
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,400
What was that all about?

149
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,364
It's something personal.

150
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,950
I don't understand you.

151
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,622
Look at you. You're a mess.

152
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,416
You look like you just
got out of the drunk tank.

153
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,538
You think you're the only man
whose wife ever left him?

154
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,501
Over three-quarters of the cops
on the police force are divorced.

155
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,800
So maybe you think
you can hide in a bottle?

156
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,305
You better get your act together, Jack,
or you're gonna lose everything you got.

157
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,094
Eh.

158
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,264
Get the hell out of here.

159
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,064
Bingo, that was airport security.

160
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,989
A guy matching Tony Vincenzo's
description just bought a ticket for Vegas.

161
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,320
His plane leaves in 20 minutes.

162
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,028
<i>Attention, please.</i>

163
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,581

<i>Southwest Airlines Flight 702...</i>

166
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,504
Hey, hey!

167
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,175
<i>...now arriving at Gate 17.</i>

168
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,459
Hold it!

169
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,510
Get away from me,
or <i>I'll</i> blow her fucking head off!

170
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
Freeze!

171
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,683
Get back!

172
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,847
Back!

173
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,694
Move it! I said move!

174
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,316
Move! Move!

175
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,401
All right!

176
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,947
Get down.

177
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,119
Tony!

178
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,881
Watch it.

179
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,880
- Somebody call it in?
- You folks all right?

180
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,772
Can you tell me what happened?
What happened here?

181
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,265
It's all under control.
It's all under control.

182
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,638
Over here.

183
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,094
This way, Sergeant.

184
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,851
Bambino.

185
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,198
Mama?

186
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,742
Mama, the car's waiting.

187
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,743
He was a good boy.

188
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,784
A decent boy.

189
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,588
Your brother is dead.

190
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,709
What are you gonna do about it?

191
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,593
I'll take care of it, Mama.

192
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,218
I want that bastard cop dead.

193
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,844
Do you hear me?

194
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,346
I want him crucified.

195
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,860
Over here! Over here.

196
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,345
Come on!

197
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,200
<i>And next up here on the stage, fellows,
is a girl you're really gonna love.</i>

198
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,910
<i>Put your hands together, and welcome.</i>

199
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,747
<i>Philly Flash!</i>

200
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,133
Hi.

201
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,482
You got the notice?

202
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,185
Yeah.

203
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,688
So now it's official.

204
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,069
I tried to call you.

205
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,943
Your phone's been disconnected.

206
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,613
I moved. I'm living with Carl.

207
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,915
He's the manager of the club.

208
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,585
Jan. What are you doing here?

209
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,209
Don't start.

210
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,761
Why do you want to work
in a dump like this?

211
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,928
I'm a dancer.

212
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,593
You call that dancing?

213
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,723
Yes.

214
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,011
If you don't like it, don't come around.

215
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,263
$5.40.

216
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,729
Watch it, snot-rag!

217
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,811
Hey!

218
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,726
You can't come in here!

219
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,372
Come on out,
or I'll put a bullet through the door.

220
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,713
Okay! Okay, I'm coming.

221
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,013
Go ahead, camel-crotch. Shoot me.

222
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,761
Don't tempt me.

223
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,812
Ow!

224
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,519
God, you snot-licking donkey fart!

225
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,733
Get up.

226
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,360
I think I hurt my back.

227
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,861
Poor girl. Let me help you.

228
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,905
You stupid...

229
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,406
Jism-breath! Scrotum-cheeks!

230
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,331
Bug-sucking booger.

231
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,537
You're gonna regret this.

232
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,213
Dinosaur dork.

233
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,708
Fart-brains.

234
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,390
Hey, you know, I want to file a complaint
against this scumbag cop here.

235
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,969
Police brutality.

236
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,895
He assaulted me for absolutely
no reason, and then he tried to rape me.

237
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,190
Sounds like you got
yourself a real live one.

238
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,396
Suck a doorknob, you homo.

239
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,853
She got any ID?

240
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,691
Get your hands off me, faggot!

241
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,246
Get this.

242
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,869
"Arabella."

243
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,084
"Arabella McGee."

244
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,749
Arabella. Cute.

245
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,831
Hey, sit on it, slime-ball.

246
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,333
Have a nice day, Arabella.

247
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,010
Eat it, toe-jam.

248
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,928
Monkey vomit!

249
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,584
<i>And the dancing never stops
here at Madam Tong's.</i>

250
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,549
<i>Let's put our hands together,
and welcome to the stage...</i>

251
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,465
Back again?

252
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,308
Yeah. Slumming.

253
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,770
Why don't you just go home
and leave me alone?

254
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,065
I'm tired of you following me.
I'm tired of you spying on me.

255
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,108
You know what you look like up there?

256
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,019
You look like a whore.

257
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,400
You bastard!

258
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,278
- Hey, hey, hey. That's enough now.
- Let go!

259
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,567
We got a problem here?

260
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,793
You're bothering my employees, pal.

261
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,694
Why don't you go home
and sleep it off, huh?

262
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,621
Up there, you look like a whore.

263
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,999
And your boyfriend here looks like a pimp.

264
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,063
- Sir, you observed the vehicle?
- What?

265
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,820
- You observed the vehicle?
- Yeah. It was a gray Oldsmobile.

266
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,654
Pretty new, maybe an '83 or an '84.

267
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,705
Oh, the license plate number.

268
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,873
<i>It was 082 UCK.</i>

269
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,757
What the hell are you guys doing here?

270
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,298
You're under arrest, smart guy.

271
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,515
Got a dozen witnesses saw you arguing
with your wife at Madam Tong's tonight.

272
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,018
And we got a witness saw you driving
away from the scene of the shooting.

273
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,101
Did it ever occur to you two
that someone's trying to frame me?

274
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,651
You know what I think?

275
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,861
I think your wife left you,
started dancing at a topless club,

276
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:25,448
showing off all her goodies to a bunch
of horny lowlifes, and you hated it.

277
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,038
And then, when you found out
she was making it with somebody else,

278
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,073
you killed them both.

279
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,251
Why don't you crawl back under your rock?

280
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,547
Come on, Jack.
Come on, let's face it. She was a slut.

281
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,959
Wasn't the first time you caught her
in bed with somebody else, right?

282
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,043
I mean, how many guys was it then? Two?

283
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,713
I'm surprised you didn't knock her off
right then and there.

284
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,013
Unless you enjoyed it.

285
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,178
Did you watch her doing it?

286
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,477
You know, Ed,

287
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,776
I've been wondering something about you
for a long time.

288
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,942
Why is it you never married?

289
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,073
Never even saw you with a girl.

290
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,492
Is it because you're so ugly,
or because you have bad breath?

291
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,495
Of course, a lot of guys have bad breath,
but they also have girls.

292
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,252
Maybe you don't like girls, huh?

293
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:25,220
And maybe that's why you two boys
spend so much time together.

294
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,519
Well, what do you know?

295
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,985
Ballistics identified
your gun as the murder weapon.

296
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,737
You're going to jail, Jack.

297
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,699
And you know what happens
to a cop in jail? Hmm?

298
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,290
You're dead meat, pal. Dead meat.

299
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,410
Your arraignment is set for tomorrow.

300
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,296
Now, the DA will probably go
for second degree.

301
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,503
But, on the other hand,
since you'd been drinking,

302
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,836
I think we can make a case
for diminished capacity.

303
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,135
Say you plead guilty
to voluntary manslaughter,

304
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,675
we're talking maybe eight years.

305
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,141
Which means you should be out
in three to four.

306
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,769
Did it ever cross your mind
that I'm innocent?

307
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,439
Frankly, no.

308
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,408
Sit down.

309
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,381
Must be your lucky day.

310
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:57,180
Well,
if it isn't Sergeant Dick-Brain.

311
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,565
I heard they arrested a cop.
What did you do, rape a nun?

312
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:11,949
Listen, you're gonna have a great time in
San Quentin, 'cause they just love cops.

313
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,033
So how do you like lockup?

314
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,956
Find yourself a girlfriend yet, hmm?

315
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,709
Kiss my squirrel.

316
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,501
Come on, admit it.

317
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,382
You're a dyke, right?

318
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,835
Hey, go jump a flagpole.

319
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,054
You know, I'm a cop.

320
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,053
I know everything that happens up there
in women's detention.

321
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,602
Maybe the first time, they have to hold
you down, but then you get to like it.

322
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,055
Oh, kiss my pantyhose, sperm bank.

323
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,937
I'll bet your girlfriend does that,
and you love it, don't you?

324
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,734
You fucking bastard!

325
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,404
- Hey, you two, knock it off over here!
- Bastard!

326
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,277
- Come on, break it up!
- Faggot!

327
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,654
Break it up! Come on, break it up.

328
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,965
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up, do what I tell you.

329
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,616
Get the keys out of the door.

330
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,743
Quick. Come on.

331
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,046
You! Don't make a sound.

332
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,753
Don't make a sound, or I'll kill her.

333
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,384
Drop your gun and keys on the floor.
Quick!

334
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,928
Come on, come on, hurry it!

335
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,589
Get in that cell.

336
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:16,971
Hurry it. Hurry it.

337
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,347
Lock it.

338
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,100
Come on, come on.

339
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,533
Help! Escaped prisoner!

340
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,780
Help!

341
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,947
This is crazy, man.
You're gonna get us both killed.

342
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,579
You're never gonna get out of here,
you know.

343
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,339
Not by the front door, I won't.

344
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,337
The elevator.

345
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,092
We got escaped prisoners in the elevator.
They're on their way down.

346
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,132
Why don't you just
put that gun down?

347
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,642
I mean, you know,
you seem like a decent enough guy.

348
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,028
Maybe you're just having an off day.

349
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,273
Besides, you don't want to kill me. I'm
actually a very nice person. I really am.

350
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,150
I know we got off on the wrong foot
with me stealing your car,

351
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,286
but that was just a mistake.

352
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,735
By the way, did anyone ever tell you
you've got excellent taste in cars?

353
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,282
Don't you ever shut up?

354
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,443
Why don't you go screw yourself, mutant?

355
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,827
Why don't you watch your mouth?

356
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,746
Why don't you watch your asshole,
asshole?

357
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,303
What's the hell is the matter
with you guys up there?

358
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,328
You all asleep or what?

359
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,792
Can't even keep a guy in lockup?

360
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,831
What's going on?

361
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,508
It's your pal Murphy.
He's got a gun, he's got a hostage.

362
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,837
Shit.

363
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,298
They must've gotten off on another floor.
Let's go.

364
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,678
That's it, I quit! I'm tired of you
pushing me around, booger bits.

365
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,229
If you're gonna...

366
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,477
You can make this hard,
or you can make it easy.

367
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,606
Now which is it gonna be?

368
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,979
Okay.

369
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,111
- I don't hear you.
- Okay.

370
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,187
You were saying?

371
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,573
I said okay,
you snot-sucking garbage dump.

372
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,117
A helicopter? Are you crazy?

373
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,290
I was a crew chief on one of these
during the war.

374
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,991
What the hell does that mean?

375
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,503
It means I can fly one of these things,
a little.

376
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,136
Close that door.

377
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,065
When was the last time you flew
one of these things?

378
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,841
1964.

379
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,144
Oh, my God.

380
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,154
Hi, I need to see your clearance.

381
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,073
This is my clearance.
Back off. Back off.

382
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,833
Murphy!

383
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,411
Put it down and get out!

384
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,793
Come on! Drop it!

385
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,304
Hold your fire, damn it!

386
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,116
Oh, Murphy, you fucking idiot.

387
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,284
I don't like heights.

388
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,579
I don't like planes.

389
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,371
I don't like flying.

390
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,049
And I especially don't like helicopters.

391
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,963
I think I'm gonna be sick.

392
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,976
On second thought, maybe not.

393
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,979
- Can we take that one up?
- Uh, it's got engine trouble.

394
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:54,314
Get a hold of the Coast Guard.
I want another chopper, like, yesterday.

395
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,197
Hey, Airwolf,
where the hell are we going?

396
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,988
Oh, my God, what is it?

397
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,823
Damn, we're out of fuel.

398
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,205
What do you mean, "we're out of fuel"?

399
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,252
We can't be out of fuel.

400
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,999
Oh, my God, we're out of fuel!
Oh, my God.

401
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,130
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

402
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,188
I... I don't want to die. I don't wanna...

403
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,720
Hang on, now. Hang on.

404
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,483
I don't want to die.

405
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,370
I don't want to die.

406
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:52,992
Hey!

407
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,540
We've already landed.

408
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,172
Where are we?

409
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,674
On a barn.

410
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,258
A barn?

411
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,679
I don't believe this is happening to me.
You know what this is?

412
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,682
I'll tell you what this is, man.
This is the worst day of my life.

413
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,060
And you know why?
Why, because of you, barf-bag!

414
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,811
Hey, pubic hair, I'm talking to you!

415
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:20,737
I think we'd better get away from this
place before somebody spots this chopper.

416
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,613
Uh, no way, José.

417
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,695
Uh, I'm staying right here.

418
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,740
As long as we got these,
where I go, you go.

419
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,803
Hello, there!

420
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,854
Get the hell out of there!

421
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,140
Let's go!

422
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,033
Look what the hell you've done to my barn!

423
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,115
- Who are you?
- Help me, please.

424
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:12,782
This guy's an escaped killer, the
helicopter's stolen, and I'm his hostage.

425
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,787
Are you saying you stole
a police helicopter?

426
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,201
What do you think I am, stupid?

427
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,457
It happens to be true, jock itch!

428
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,847
If you don't believe me, all you gotta do

429
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,124
is call the cops,
and let them know where we are.

430
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,635
You hear that, boys?
All we've got to do is call the cops.

431
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,046
Yeah. While we're at it,
let's just call the governor, too.

432
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,301
Yeah, and the president.

433
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,384
Look, penis-envy,
if you don't call the cops, I will!

434
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,515
They're not gonna call anybody.

435
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,268
Look at all this shit hanging around here.
This is a dope farm.

436
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,647
Hey, no kidding?

437
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,237
You guys grow marijuana?

438
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,034
Come on,
let's light up a few joints and party.

439
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,371
This little girl wants to party.

440
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,370
Well, I think we should give
the girl what she wants.

441
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,666
Oh, yes.

442
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,345
- Hey, kiss my ass!
- Get away from her!

443
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,876
You bastard!

444
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,851
Hold this bitch down!

445
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,353
- With pleasure.
- Get off me! Get off...

446
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,894
Get off me,
you fucking son of a bitch!

447
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,162
Want me to hurt you, baby, huh?
You want me to hurt you?

448
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,813
Because I'll hurt you.

449
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,572
No! God!

450
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,034
Nothing you can do about it.

451
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,656
Just lay back and enjoy it.

452
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,030
Don't, you son of a bitch.

453
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,632
Come on, baby. Come on.

454
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,329
No! Murphy!

455
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:44,213
Let's be friends, 'cause I'm gonna give it
to you like you ain't never had it before.

456
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,627
No!

457
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,633
I want her second, Kelly!

458
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,132
Murphy! No!

459
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,135
Get off, you...

460
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,567
Look, don't do it, man! Don't do it!

461
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,271
Don't do it, man. Please, don't do it.

462
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,777
Not having such a good time now,
are you, bad-ass?

463
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,985
Please, man. Don't kill us.

464
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,406
Please don't kill us, man.

465
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:18,243
First one who sticks his head out the door
gets it blown off.

466
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,201
Okay, man. Okay.

467
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,793
Can you wire that truck?

468
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,217
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

469
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,388
Check this out. They left the keys.

470
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,774
Hello?

471
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,818
Anybody here?

472
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,197
Hello?

473
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,498
Murphy, come on. Murphy?

474
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,749
Come on. Murphy, please!

475
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,668
Oh, God.

476
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,842
Don't dump on me, you buffalo shit.

477
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:04,683
Hey. Come on, Murphy.

478
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,187
Hello?

479
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,232
I'm calling you a doctor.

480
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,160
Put that phone down.

481
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,790
Who are you?

482
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,964
There's a friend of yours
in the other room, and he's hurt.

483
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,711
What's his name?

484
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:20,713
Murphy.

485
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,388
Where did you learn to
do stitches like that?

486
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,683
In the Medical Corps in Korea.

487
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,276
He gonna be all right?

488
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,980
Well, he's got himself a concussion.

489
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,779
But he'll probably be okay
in a couple of days or so.

490
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,159
He's gonna have
a hell of a headache, though.

491
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,615
I'm Ben Wilcove.

492
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,249
You got a name?

493
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,749
Arabella McGee.

494
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,628
You hungry, McGee?

495
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,709
Yeah.

496
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
You a Cop?

497
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,211
I used to be.

498
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,008
What happened?

499
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,717
Well, I got shot in the back with a .22
by a 16-year-old kid.

500
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,809
You don't like cops much, huh?

501
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,147
Not much.

502
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,775
I don't either.

503
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,840
How you feeling?

504
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,134
I've seen better days.

505
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,016
Where's Ben?

506
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,518
Outside somewhere.

507
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,357
Hey. You shouldn't be drinking, you know.

508
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,693
Yeah, yeah, I know.

509
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,116
You always this friendly, huh?

510
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,205
Listen, kid.

511
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,786
I know you don't like me.

512
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,956
Well, I don't like you.

513
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,342
I know you don't want to be here,
and I don't want you to be here,

514
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,798
so let's let it go at that, okay?

515
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:26,672
Fine.

516
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,562
Ow.

517
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,306
Damn it.

518
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:40,895
Here.

519
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,606
What the hell is it?

520
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,316
It happens to be an omelet.

521
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,079
I thought maybe you'd like something for
breakfast besides a bottle of Jack Daniels.

522
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,951
Jesus.

523
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,580
If I was gonna eat anything,
it wouldn't be that garbage.

524
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,582
Fine, dog-snot, don't eat it. Wear it!

525
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,764
You know, Murphy,
you have always been a stupid jerk.

526
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,892
But this time,
you are a particular kind of stupid jerk.

527
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,769
What the hell are you talking about?

528
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,774
She just took off,
that's what I'm talking about.

529
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,032
That's fine by me.

530
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,043
Murph.

531
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,041
You're gonna need a gun, man.

532
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,179
This gun looks familiar.

533
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:53,055
It should be. It's my old backup piece,
and it saved my butt, man.

534
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,386
Maybe it can take care of yours.

535
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,813
Yeah, chances are I will need it.

536
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,224
No, you just get the bastard
that framed you.

537
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,653
Take care, old friend.

538
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,049
Murph?

539
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
McGee?

540
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,578
Hey.

541
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,999
Look, Murphy, why don't you
just go away, huh? You're a jinx.

542
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,634
Every time you show up in my life,
things go wrong.

543
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,763
First, I get arrested, right?
Then I get railroaded into this jailbreak.

544
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,218
You know, why don't you just go away before
an airplane falls on me or something?

545
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,386
I'm sorry.

546
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,144
I mean, you're not a bad guy for a cop.

547
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,856
It's just that I don't want to get
involved in your problems, all right?

548
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,440
I got enough problems of my own.

549
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,025
And, uh, don't worry.

550
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,027
When I turn myself in,

551
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,237
I won't tell the cops where you are.

552
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,239
Thanks. Now get in.

553
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:42,863
Get in.

554
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,384
I must have boogers for brains.
What the hell am I doing here?

555
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,220
Hey, pull over. I'm hungry.

556
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,555
I'm not.

557
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,316
Look, whiskey-breath, maybe all you
need is a bottle. I want some food.

558
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,637
You better take a look at this.

559
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,846
Terrific, huh?

560
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,181
They think I'm your accomplice.

561
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,958
He was a pretty nice old guy, huh?

562
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:18,509
God, who would have killed him?

563
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,462
The same son of a bitch
who killed my ex-wife.

564
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,680
Frank Vincenzo.

565
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,808
Jesus. Don't you ever make any friends?

566
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,057
We're gonna split. Go.

567
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,434
Forget it, dog piss!

568
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,787
The only way I get off the hook
is if you get off the hook,

569
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,859
'cause the cops are
looking for me for murder.

570
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:44,444
So, from now on, pal, where you go, I go.

571
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,119
You stay with me, you do what I tell you,
you hear?

572
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,190
How are you this evening,
Judge Kellerman?

573
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,525
Fine, thank you.

574
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,658
The chef recommends you try the breast
of quail, stuffed with fresh dates,

575
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,871
covered with raspberry vinegar sauce,
and sprinkled with roasted hazelnuts.

576
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:36,037
Sounds good.
And a bottle of Veuve Clicquot.

577
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,421
Certainly.

578
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,701
Excuse me, now, I know
this is going to sound very corny,

579
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,739
but have we ever met?

580
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,541
I don't know. Have we?

581
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,702
It's just that you seem so familiar to me.

582
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,664
I was about to have dessert.
Would you join me?

583
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,464
I'd like that very much.

584
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,716
Ah, doesn't that feel good?

585
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,555
Oh, it feels wonderful.

586
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,765
Oh, that feels so good.

587
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,284
How long has it been
since someone's giving you a bath?

588
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,232
Well, I must say,
no one since you've given me a bath

589
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,238
has ever given me a bath.

590
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,322
Oh, come now, certainly
someone's given you a bath before?

591
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,617
Ooh, are you ticklish?

592
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,865
You are ticklish.

593
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,085
Ooh. Tickle!

594
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,856
Right. I'll get back to you.

595
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,250
Hi, guys. Listen, I don't mean to bother
you, but I got a flat tire out there.

596
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,595
And I was wondering if one of you boys
could help me fix it.

597
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,836
- Sure.
- I'm freezing.

598
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,087
Come on inside.

599
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,007
Jack, you want to fix
the lady's tire, okay?

600
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,506
Uh, spare's in the back.

601
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,134
Well.

602
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,011
Nice place you got here.

603
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,019
Bet you a lot of important people
live here, huh?

604
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,224
A few.

605
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,274
Bet you none of them are as
good-looking as you are.

606
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,320
Any of these apartments empty?

607
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,989
Got a couple.

608
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,250
Why don't we go upstairs
and take a look, huh?

609
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,746
I bet the view is fantastic.

610
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,680
Hey, Jack. I'm gonna take a little break.

611
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,516
Be back in about 20 minutes.

612
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,043
Nice bed.

613
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,471
You know what? Pink really gets me hot.

614
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,802
Yeah? Me, too.

615
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,895
- You know what?
- What?

616
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,948
I've never felt anything so small.

617
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,660
Murphy? Where the hell are you?

618
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,363
What took you so long?

619
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,869
I didn't want to interrupt love in bloom.

620
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,712
Pepe's Pizza.
You never had a piece like this.

621
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,004
Hi. $9.75.

622
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,540
Nobody up here ordered a pizza.

623
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,466
Sure they did. Some guy named Guido.

624
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,628
Well, you made a mistake.
There's no Guido up here.

625
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,344
This is the penthouse, right?

626
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:41,475
Well, I got a large sausage and mushroom
pizza for some guy named Guido.

627
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,351
How did you get up here, anyhow?

628
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,100
The elevator, anchovy-breath,
how do you think?

629
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,602
Well, the elevator don't come up here
unless you got a key.

630
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,309
Yeah? Well, it did for me.

631
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,898
Look, all I know is
somebody owes me $9.75.

632
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,276
I'm not budging till I get paid.

633
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,446
I wouldn't if I didn't have to,
pepperoni-breath.

634
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,445
Where's Vincenzo?

635
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,707
Yes.

636
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,210
Mmm-hmm.

637
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,723
I think I'm going to like that.

638
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,223
Mmm, yeah.

639
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:30,974
Do it.

640
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,820
Do it now.

641
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,491
Do it now.

642
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,615
Oh, baby...

643
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,159
Do it.

644
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,040
Hey, hot pants.

645
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,392
If you know what's good for you,
you'd get out of here right away.

646
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,376
- Lock her in the bathroom.
- Come on, Goldilocks.

647
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,680
You son of a bitch.

648
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,509
You killed my ex-wife and my best friend.

649
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,436
I don't know what you're talking about.

650
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,934
Then you had me framed for their murders.

651
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,620
Now, I think you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

652
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,414
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

653
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,566
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

654
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,952
No. You just paid someone else to do it.

655
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:25,570
And I want his name.

656
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,785
I don't have a name. I don't have a name.

657
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,411
You're crazy, you know that!

658
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,545
Murphy, you're just crazy!

659
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,998
You're really nuts!

660
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,674
We're gonna play a little roulette.

661
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,296
One bullet left.

662
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,044
I want a name.

663
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,469
Give me a name, Frank.

664
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,683
You're running out of luck, Frank.

665
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,480
Help me!

666
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,399
Three left, Frank.

667
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,695
Give me a name.

668
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,318
I don't have a name.

669
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,404
A name.

670
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,615
I didn't hurt anybody.

671
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,416
I didn't kill anybody.

672
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,996
I didn't!

673
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,209
Two more left, Frank.

674
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,087
The chances are 50-50, Frank.

675
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,765
I hate to say it, Murphy,
but I think he's telling the truth.

676
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,856
The gun was empty, Frank.

677
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,335
So much for your big play.
Now what?

678
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,846
- I don't know yet.
- Oh, great.

679
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,625
We're both wanted for murder, we've got
a Mafia psycho who wants to bury us,

680
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,460
and you're out of ideas?
Thanks a lot, douche bag!

681
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,671
If you don't want to hang around, go!

682
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,924
Thanks for keeping my seat warm.

683
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:13,888
You know, Murphy, you ain't worth shit,
but right now, you're all I've got.

684
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,042
Oh, shit, Jack!

685
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,499
You almost gave me a heart attack.

686
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,999
Look, Murphy, if I help you,
and the Department finds out,

687
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:47,087
I'm gonna lose my badge, my pension,
my career, and I owe up to here!

688
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,843
My life is on the line.

689
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,387
Someone's framed me for three murders.

690
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,678
If I don't find out who, they're gonna
put me away for a long, long time.

691
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,264
Come on, weenie-roast, help the guy out!

692
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,100
Butt out, sweetheart!
Nobody's talking to you!

693
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,277
Have a hernia, motor-mouth!

694
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,362
Why don't you park your tongue?

695
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,611
Yeah, why don't you pull on it?
If, uh, you can find it.

696
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,947
Why don't the both of you shut up?

697
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,699
Jesus Christ!

698
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,614
<i>What</i> is <i>this? Romper Room?</i>

699
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,958
All right, I've run out of options.

700
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,785
You have to help me.

701
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,589
What do you want?

702
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:27,632
I want a list of homicide cases
that Wilcove and I worked on.

703
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,468
Someone we put away for a lot of years.

704
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,132
Got out in the last couple of months.

705
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,600
Yea, but to do that,
I got to use the computer.

706
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:35,806
Yeah.

707
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,605
Where do you suppose
I get authorization for that?

708
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,890
You'll find a way.

709
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,065
Oh, right, thanks.

710
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,645
You're welcome, dildo-nose.

711
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,152
How much money do I pay you clowns
to protect me?

712
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,659
What happens?
Some cop waltzes in here.

713
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,162
You don't do a goddamn thing about it!

714
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,035
Put the word on the street, $10,000
to anybody who knows where Murphy is.

715
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,289
I want him!

716
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,543
You hear me?

717
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,462
And you better find him for me!

718
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:07,676
Or there's gonna be four corpses
floating in the goddamn marina!

719
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:26,944
What?

720
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,147
Nothing.

721
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,246
Don't you have something to do?

722
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,750
Nope.

723
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,259
Damn.

724
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,680
What am I, a TV?

725
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,977
Maybe you want to look at me,
but I don't want to look at you.

726
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,225
Who says I want to look at you?

727
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,124
Sometimes I've got a big mouth.

728
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,251
No comment.

729
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,291
One of my faults.

730
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,964
Oh, you have faults?

731
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,386
Hey, you ain't no charmer either, you know.

732
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,592
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

733
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,259
Maybe.

734
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,440
You want a sandwich?

735
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:46,979
Sure.

736
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,902
No mayonnaise.

737
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,616
How can you eat a sandwich
without mayonnaise?

738
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,947
I don't like mayonnaise.

739
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,736
Everybody likes mayonnaise.

740
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,331
Okay. No mayonnaise.

741
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,459
- How old are you, kid?
- Why?

742
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,544
Just wondering.

743
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,467
As in, how long have I been stealing cars?

744
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,261
I know, to you I'm just a lowlife.

745
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:20,384
But the way I see it, man,
being a thief is better than being a whore.

746
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,308
I never said you were a lowlife.

747
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,566
Eat your sandwich.

748
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,659
How old are you?

749
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,330
Too old.

750
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,745
For what?

751
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,835
You're not so bad.

752
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:58,881
You stop the boozing,
you'd look a lot better.

753
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,183
Thanks.

754
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:04,973
I'm serious.

755
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,144
Besides, personally,

756
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,941
I like them older.

757
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,861
Is that so?

758
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,775
Is it true what they say about cops?

759
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,109
What?

760
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,570
That their, um...

761
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:26,203
Their guns are substitutes for their wangs?

762
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,127
Don't you count on it.

763
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,753
Oh, yeah?

764
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,960
Prove it.

765
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,551
Yeah?

766
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,137
I got three names for you.

767
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,554
Shoot.

768
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,270
You remember a guy named Red LaSalle?

769
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,730
I don't think this is his style.

770
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,733
Number two is Jerry Myers.

771
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,397
I remember him.

772
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,776
<i>Now you and Wilcove tagged him
for taking out a union leader.</i>

773
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,735
<i>He swore he'd nail you.</i>

774
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:04,988
What about number three?

775
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,950
Uh, it's a real long shot.
This happened about 10 years ago.

776
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,330
Do you remember a woman
named Joan Freeman?

777
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,711
Well, they put her in Camarillo.

778
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,164
Not anymore. They cut her loose.

779
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:18,506
Jesus. Where is she now?

780
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,885
Uh, she's staying in one of those
old downtown hotels called the Sunset.

781
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,303
Listen, Art.

782
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,681
What was the judge's name at her trial?

783
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:31,856
<i>Uh, it's Kellerman, I think. You hear what
happened to him? He fried himself.</i>

784
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,057
Murphy?

785
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,143
You still there?

786
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:43,325
Joan?

787
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,452
Joan?

788
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,462
How've you been doing?

789
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,792
Pretty well.

790
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,375
No trouble adjusting to the outside world?

791
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,959
I don't think so.

792
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,049
I feel pretty good about myself.

793
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,963
Good.

794
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,639
How's the job working out?

795
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,936
Well, actually, I decided not to take it.

796
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:12,930
Why not?

797
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,857
Because I got another job.

798
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,768
A better job.

799
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:18,854
Terrific.

800
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:20,855
Doing what?

801
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,033
In a way, you see, I owe it all to you.

802
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:28,242
You taught me I could do
anything I wanted.

803
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,208
You taught me how to believe in myself.

804
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:37,789
Wonderful.

805
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,544
So what's the job?

806
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,626
I'll show you.

807
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,306
What's this?

808
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,397
My job.

809
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,149
I don't understand.
Who are these people?

810
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,147
The ones who sent me away.

811
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,789
You never should've let me out,
you know?

812
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,292
I really am crazy.

813
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:53,369
The hotel is not responsible
for the loss of personal valuables.

814
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:56,080
I'm talking almost $200, man.

815
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,286
Look, Helen Keller, read my lips.

816
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:03,375
The hotel is not responsible
for the loss of personal valuables.

817
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:04,588
Oh, yeah?

818
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,340
When it comes time to pay my rent,

819
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,922
and we'll see who's responsible
or not responsible.

820
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,091
<i>Fucking schwartze.</i>

821
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,101
Which room is Joan Freeman in?

822
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,108
Sorry, pal.
The hotel guest list is confidential.

823
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,352
Can you count to five?

824
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,527
Sure.

825
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,610
How would you like to try it without teeth?

826
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,445
It's, uh, 604.

827
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,531
Yeah, this is Marty, down at the Sunset.

828
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,620
What are we doing here?

829
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,168
Just looking.

830
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,004
Sounds like fun.

831
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,375
Murphy?

832
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,215
Could you come here a minute?

833
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,545
Come on, man, what room?

834
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,213
They're in 604.

835
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,886
Hey! Where's my money?

836
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:17,971
Who's that stiff?

837
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,269
I don't know,
but I gotta get to Malibu fast.

838
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,641
Malibu?

839
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:25,399
Hey, don't you think
it's a little cold to go surfing?

840
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:09,643
Go!

841
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,617
It happened about 10 years ago.

842
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,916
She had a boyfriend
who worked as a security guard

843
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,293
in the old Bradbury Building, downtown.

844
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:31,674
She was down there visiting him one day,
and they got into an argument.

845
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,261
Then she flipped out, grabbed his gun,
and shot him.

846
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:39,466
By the time we got there,
she was up on the roof with a hostage.

847
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,973
And so that's why she framed you.

848
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:46,981
And she killed Wilcove, 'cause he was your
partner and the two of you arrested her.

849
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,185
Yeah, and Kellerman,
because he was the judge at the trial.

850
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,479
Yeah, but then who's this guy in Malibu?

851
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,984
Albert Skinner.

852
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,404
<i>He was the prosecutor.</i>

853
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,511
Mr. Skinner?

854
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,178
Nice digs.

855
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,481
Hey, this dude must have robbed
a couple banks, huh?

856
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:33,854
I'll take a look upstairs.
If I see any bodies, I'll give a yell.

857
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,400
Mr. Skinner!

858
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,704
Hey, Mr. Skinner!

859
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,787
Hey!

860
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,297
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

861
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:16,813
Skinner?

862
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,120
McGee?

863
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,749
Arabella?

864
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,339
Arabella?

865
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,116
<i>- Homicide.
- Give me Art Penney.</i>

866
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,283
He isn't here.

867
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,462
<i>- Let me talk to the Lieutenant.
- He's not here either.</i>

868
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,296
<i>Oh, damn. Who's this?</i>

869
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,425
This is Sergeant Reineke.
Who the hell is this?

870
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,630
Shit.

871
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,635
Ed, it's Murphy.

872
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,964
Murphy, you son of a bitch!

873
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,133
I know who killed Ben Wilcove.

874
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,721
<i>Yeah, it was you, you bastard!</i>

875
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,224
Shut up and pay attention
to what I have to say.

876
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:34,682
<i>I've been set up, framed by a woman.
Her name's Joan Freeman.</i>

877
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,564
You talk to Art. He knows who she is.

878
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,897
And get a hold of the Lieutenant, have him
send some men to the Bradbury Building.

879
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,071
She's on her way there.

880
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,292
All right, all right, I'll do that,
but come on in, will you?

881
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,659
We'll talk about it. Come on in.

882
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,954
I don't have time for this crap.
The woman has a hostage.

883
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,991
Get ahold of the Lieutenant,
and <i>I'll</i> meet him down there.

884
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,123
Hey, Ed. What are you doing?

885
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,291
Fine. Fine.

886
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:06,090
- He's inside.
- Go get him.

887
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,216
Alone?

888
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,795
What's the matter? Are you afraid of him?

889
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,820
Murphy?

890
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:37,660
Up here.

891
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,345
She's somewhere in the building.

892
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,470
Who? Your fairy godmother?
Hold it right there.

893
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,430
Put your gun down.

894
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,266
Where's the Lieutenant?

895
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,313
He's at home, watching TV.

896
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,769
Put it down!

897
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,908
You don't have to worry, Jack.

898
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,282
I got a friend waiting for you outside.

899
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:19,581
Frankie Vincenzo wants
to share some pasta with you.

900
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,042
You dirty bastard.

901
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,411
You're on the wrong side, Jack.

902
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,043
But it doesn't matter.
You always were a loser, anyway.

903
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,081
Come on.

904
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,430
You're running out of friends,
Murphy.

905
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,765
You better hurry!

906
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,068
We're waiting for you.

907
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:11,893
Where the fuck is he?

908
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,988
Maybe he ain't coming back.

909
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,360
Come on, come on!

910
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,033
Come on! Let's do it!

911
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,698
Who does he think he is? Cochise?

912
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:04,658
Find him!

913
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:16,916
AI?

914
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,296
AI, did you get him?

915
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:22,551
Why don't you come up
and get me yourself, Frank?

916
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:35,181
You remember what I told you
about Murphy's Law?

917
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,412
You remember what I told you.

918
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,829
Don't fuck with Jack Murphy.

919
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,707
You're pretty good, Murphy.

920
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,126
But not good enough.

921
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,109
It's time for your girlfriend to die.

922
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,862
Say bye-bye to the little bitch.

923
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:12,174
What took you so long, butt-crust?

924
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,021
No!

925
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:32,444
Now it's just you and me.

926
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:45,712
Do you really hate me now, Murphy?

927
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:51,672
Could you possibly hate me
as much as I hate you?

928
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:42,519
Please, help me!

929
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:52,899
Help me.

930
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,739
Please.

931
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,295
Help me, damn it!

932
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:29,228
You go to hell!

933
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,686
Ladies first.

934
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,476
Come on, move them back.
Move them back.

935
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,196
Move these people back.

936
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,368
And lift!

937
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,038
- You got it?
- Yeah.

938
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,247
These go over your side.

939
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:36,670
- Yeah, in the socket.
- DOAs.

940
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,547
Hey!

941
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,472
Would you dinosaur dorks move it
before I bleed to death?

942
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,721
- There it is.
- Jesus Christ.

943
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:49,513
What are you grinning at, snot-rag?

944
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:55,602
Next time I get hold of a bar of soap,

945
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,526
I'm gonna wash out your mouth

946
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:01,863
all the way down
to the other end of your body.

947
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:06,204
Yeah, well, blow it out your ass,
sperm-count.

948
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,830
Guess I'll make that a case of soap.

949
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:19,551
<i>LA 's just a movie set
You're a flash in the pan.</i>

950
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:24,426
<i>Sweat drips from your forehead
While your foot's stuck in the sand.</i>

951
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:26,933
<i>You're pushing 105 on the freeway</i>

952
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:29,636
<i>'Cause you've got to get to nowhere.</i>

953
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:32,563
<i>You see the flashing red in your rear view.</i>

954
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,270
<i>But you don't care.</i>

955
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,731
<i>Murphy's Law.</i>

956
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:42,403
<i>If anything could possibly go wrong.</i>

957
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:45,447
<i>It will.</i>

01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:48,287
<i>Hey.</i>

959
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,536
<i>You wait in line to pay the fine.</i>

960
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:53,539
<i>But you're standing at the wrong window.</i>

961
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:58,545
<i>Then she says "We close at five,
so come back tomorrow".</i>

<i>You dodge the traffic
You fight the smog.</i>

<i>But the paper's in the mail.</i>

964

<i>Somehow you knew all along
That you would fail.</i>

965

01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:26,068
<i>Murphy said if anything could
