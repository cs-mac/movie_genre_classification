1
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,673
Come here. I'll take him.

2
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,111
I'll take him. Come on.
Goodness, Chad. Don't be sensitive.

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,437
Hey, that wasn't worth all that fuss,
was it, Alex, hmm?

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,153
Come on now.

5
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,032
- Is he OK?
- He'll be fine.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,997
Well, Paul. Six years, three banks
and $200 million later.

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,634
- Congratulations, Nigel.
- You, too.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,108
Uh, Mr Wagner, it's time to rock and roll.

9
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,551
- Time to rock and roll.
- Good luck, darling.

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,992
Many centuries ago,
a Chinese poet foresaw a Hong Kong

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,670
that glittered like the stars in the heavens.

12
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,350
Today, by providing an underwater tunnel

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,838
to connect Hong Kong Island
with the mainland and the New Territories,

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,556
we hope that
we have brought that prophecy

15
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,558
one step closer to reality.

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,837
And so, ladies and gentlemen, Griffith
Wagner Enterprises proudly present

17
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,113
to the Crown colony of Hong Kong
the Victoria Harbour Tunnel.

18
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,671
Paul. Sure you don't want me
to follow you home?

19
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,916
I can get home without you, Frank.

20
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,556
- I'll believe that when I see it.
- We'll be fıne.

21
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,194
You take the night off. Hey, thanks.

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,755
Without you I could never have done it.

23
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,030
Now, get lost, you bum.

24
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,189
If you say so. Katherine, take a look
under the front seat, would you?

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,231
A little token of my appreciation.

26
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,433
I don't know how Paul's initials
got on there, but they're there.

27
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,077
That's nice, Frank. Really nice.
It's cheap and there's no cigars, but...

28
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,273
But it's... really great.
Thanks for everything, pal.

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,310
Hey, Frank.
It's lovely. Goodnight.

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,594
- Frank? I said take the night off.
- I heard you loud and clear.

31
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,439
Then that's not your car following us?

32
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,552
No, it's...

33
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,992
What's the matter?

34
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,356
Paul, whatever you do, don't get out
of the car. I'll be right there.

35
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,398
Get down! Get the boys down!

36
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,919
Get them down!

37
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,593
My babies! Please, no!

38
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,238
Paul!

39
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,914
Katherine!

40
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,873
Paul! Oh, no!

41
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,354
No! Paul! Oh, my God!

42
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,954
Oh, God!

43
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,789
Oh, my babies!

44
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,917
Oh, babies!

45
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,999
My babies. What'll happen to them?

46
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,760
You'll never know.

47
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,551
Get those kids and get out of there!

48
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,193
Griffith.

49
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,273
# Dormez vous? Dormez vous?

50
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,155
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines...

51
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,033
- # Din din don #
- Bonjour. Qui est-ce?

52
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,750
Oh!

53
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,794
25 YEARS LATER

54
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,154
- How do you feel now?
- Oh, it still hurts.

55
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,794
Oh, I'm so sorry.

56
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,750
OK.

57
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,155
- Maybe you should relax now, OK?
- OK.

58
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,750
Slowly close your legs.

59
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,155
Beautiful. Doing well.

60
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,828
You know, stretching is so important.

61
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,989
For example,
because of my big legs and karate,

62
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,556
I can do the splits, no problem.

63
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,477
Back and forth. Back and forth.

64
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,796
Feels good.

65
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,515
They're right in here.
I'll be with you in a minute.

66
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,358
- Chad.
- Yeah?

67
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,073
I'm sorry. Don't move.

68
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,959
Take over the karate class.

69
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,709
Look, Frankie.
I'm busy with those girls now.

70
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,239
No, this is business.

71
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,512
- Take over the karate class.
- Like this?

72
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,440
Three!

73
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,473
Class!

74
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,313
We got a little problem. Class!

75
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,796
- Jackie, what's wrong?
- No problem.

76
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,513
It's the new guy.

77
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,551
- How you doin'? All right?
- Yeah.

78
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,959
It's gotta be him.

79
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,637
What are you, the ballet teacher or what?

80
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,073
Yeah, I'm dancing, yeah. Also some karate.

81
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,999
- Karate, huh?
- Can You Show me one of your special kicks.

82
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,795
- You wanna see one of my kicks?
- Yeah. C'mon.

83
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,479
Shit.

84
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,272
Chad. Come up to my office, ASAP.

85
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,950
Hong Kong? Uncle Frankie. Get real, man.

86
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,950
We can't just cut out for two weeks.
We got a business to run.

87
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,118
You have another business to run
in Hong Kong.

88
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,118
Make this thing look
like a fucking dog pound.

89
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,437
Another business in Hong Kong.
Uncle Frankie...

90
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,915
Ah! I'm not your uncle.

91
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,633
- You're not my uncle?
- Uh-uh.

92
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,994
Suddenly, after 25 years,
you're telling me you're not my uncle.

93
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,352
Uh-uh. And you weren't born in France.
I just raised you there.

94
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,750
Any more surprises? Like maybe
I own a grocery store in Zimbabwe?

95
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,951
Chad.

96
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,879
Now, listen to me. I raised you
ever since you were six months old.

97
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,914
I brought you up like you were my own kid.

98
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,431
Have I ever given you any reason
not to trust me?

99
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,239
- No.
- Then trust me.

100
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,317
We're going to Hong Kong.

101
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,594
Chad. C'mon, put on your seat belt.

102
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,232
Wow! Look at this, Frankie.

103
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,396
Let's go shopping.

104
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,189
Frankie, check it out.

105
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,748
Driver. How long?

106
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,236
- Hotel. How long?
- We're not going to the hotel.

107
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,908
We're gonna go to this joint first.

108
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,079
Nice little joint. It's highly
recommended in the tour books.

109
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,039
Out. Out.

110
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,549
Thank you. Keep it close.

111
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,512
Hey, Frankie. What is this?

112
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,554
It's a mah-jong parlour. It's a cross
between dominoes and five-card stud.

113
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,955
Try a hand. I'm going to talk to this guy.

114
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,674
Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank.

115
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,235
This is you.
You wanna stay here? Beautiful.

116
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,796
I'll be waiting at the hotel.
I'll take a shower and shave and a sauna.

117
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,151
- It's going to be great,No, No, Trust me.
- we'll go together. Come here.

118
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,715
I want you to see something in here.
C'mon.

119
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,798
- Chad, trust me. C'mon.
- This place sucks.

120
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,629
Hey, boss. Just the way you like it.
Very hot.

121
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,115
For your friend, too?

122
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,874
What's wrong?

123
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,675
- What's wrong with him?
- I dunno.

124
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,475
- What'd he give you?
- Cash, money. I love Hong Kong.

125
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,112
Very nice.

126
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,719
Thank you.

127
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,273
Hey...

128
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,190
Me?

129
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,519
Go on. Go see what she wants.
I think she wants to talk to you.

130
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,317
Go on. I'll be right here.

131
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,310
Did you pick these out yourself?

132
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,318
I am impressed. Haircut, too.

133
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,993
You know,
this really is a lovely colour on you.

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,351
- What else do you have in here?
- Huh?

135
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
Silk underwear.

136
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,395
- Keep going.
- More surprises?

137
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,071
Oh, yeah. Big surprise. Huge surprise.

138
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,711
- Look at him. The way he walks.
- He looks like you.

139
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,869
- The way he touched you?
- I'm sorry. He looks exactly like you.

140
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,071
Look like me?

141
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,273
You, of all people, should know
I'd never in my life wear black silk underwear.

142
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,755
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Look at him. A faggot.I am Looking.

143
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,794
Frank. Frankie. What's going on here?

144
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,271
Chad. He's your brother.

145
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,870
Look at him. For Christ's sake. Look at him.

146
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,675
Just take a look at him.
He's your twin brother.

147
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,916
I don't believe this. My brother.

148
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,511
See that door? You've got both of you
10 seconds to get the fuck out.

149
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,756
Or the fish tank may be better.
Hear at least what they've got to say.

150
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,394
- Five seconds!
- Damn it, Alex.

151
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,910
You stay here.
Don't even think about it, pal.

152
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,032
Don't even think about it.

153
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,514
Sit down.

154
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,596
Sit down.

155
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,317
OK, let's talk.

156
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,154
You ever hear of a guy
named Nigel Griffith?

157
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,920
Like asking a New Yorker
if he's ever heard of donald Trump.

158
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,032
- What about Raymond Zhang?
- Yeah.

159
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,118
- What about him?
- What's this got to do with Alex?

160
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,914
It's simple.
The Victoria Harbour Tunnel

161
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,477
was built by a man I used to work for
after my tour of Nam.

162
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,036
Halfway through construction
he ran into money problems.

163
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,277
They pulled in Griffith
as an equity partner.

164
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,315
Griffith got his cash from a secret loan

165
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,114
courtesy of the Zhang family.

166
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,836
When the tunnel was completed, and
my employer's construction expertise

167
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,513
was no longer needed, they had him
and his wife exxed out by a Triad hit team.

168
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,915
Only, the Triads fucked up

169
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,193
because they had two sons, babies,
who they were gonna wipe out, too.

170
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,154
So they wouldn't come back
and claim what was rightfully theirs.

171
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,156
You're full of shit.

172
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,478
Paul and Katherine Wagner.

173
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,549
And their two sons, Chad and Alex.

174
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,033
- Those two men, can we find them?
- All right,Let's go after Raymond Zhang.

175
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,674
You've got an army waiting outside, or what?

176
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,394
Did you hear what he just told us?

177
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,160
These were our parents. Look at them.

178
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,149
I hear bullshit every day, pal.
You want some advice?

179
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,514
Take your fancy clothes and your
silk underwear and go back to Disneyland.

180
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,836
That's it. I guess you and I, Frankie.
Like always.

181
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,310
OK.

182
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,309
You want some real action, tough guys?

183
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,839
Let's do it.

184
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,552
This is beautiful.

185
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,118
- What's the piece for?
- Just in case.

186
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,673
In case of what?

187
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,957
There.

188
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,719
Let's say hello.

189
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,832
Whoa!

190
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,360
I don't believe this.

191
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,629
A smooth operator.

192
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,669
- Ah.
- OK.

193
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,392
- They don't get those cars in China.
- The UN should give you a prize.

194
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,156
- Cash.
- Yeah.

195
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,599
Right.

196
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,312
This is the Hong Kong Marine Police!

197
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,274
Prepare to have your vessel
boarded and searched!

198
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,234
You set us up. No Mercedes, no cash.

199
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,238
Drop it. Get your asses off the boat.

200
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,350
Chad! Get down!

201
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,392
This is the Hong Kong Marine Police.

202
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,191
- Nice going.
- Nice going?

203
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,791
Nice going, my ass! I almost got killed.
And the cops are still chasing us.

204
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,509
Trust me.

205
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,116
Hey, can this piece of shit
move any faster?

206
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,873
Frankie, help me.

207
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,835
C'mon, baby. C'mon.

208
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,634
Welcome to Hong Kong.

209
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,997
Chad, take a bite. Be a man.

210
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,196
What's it supposed to do?
Make my dick bigger?

211
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,593
All right, Alex. I think that Chad and I
established our credentials yesterday.

212
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,553
Now, what do we do about your tunnel?

213
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,435
- My tunnel?
- Is there proof? Any legal documentation?

214
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,833
There doesn't have to be, girlie.
I was there.

215
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,157
- I got the scars.
- Those won't carry weight in court.

216
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,229
Let me tell you, the only law that Zhang
knows is the law of a 12-gauge shotgun,

217
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,230
one of which he used to splatter
Mr Wagner all over the Victoria Peak Road!

218
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,352
I don't need to listen to this any longer.

219
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,632
Jeez. What's her problem?

220
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,515
She's working for Griffith
for five years now.

221
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,235
Oh, great. She's gonna tell him everything.

222
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,758
Listen here, big guy. You can spend
the rest of your life smuggling cognac

223
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,635
while some other guy collects
the dividends on your father's blood.

224
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,038
- It's your call.
- It's my call, I know.

225
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,511
That's my woman.

226
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,399
That's fucking great.

227
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,954
Danielle, stay.

228
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,199
Sorry. But if I'd sat there another
second, I would have slapped him.

229
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,994
The guy's old, crazy, you know?

230
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,553
Sorry.

231
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,670
Look, just check on what
he was saying. That's it.

232
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,596
And keep it quiet.

233
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,759
Shit.

234
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,478
Alex.

235
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,595
No, it's my brother.

236
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,038
The wrong guy.

237
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,437
Wrong guy.

238
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,279
Alex, it's so good to see you.

239
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,120
Mr Zhang.

240
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,472
I heard you had quite an adventure
the other day, didn't you, Alex?

241
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,911
Honestly, now. The profit of four tons
of German automobile

242
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,033
versus four tons of white powder.

243
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,594
That is what we have to seriously discuss.

244
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,352
Have a cigar.

245
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,316
You don't seem quite yourself today.
Are you all right?

246
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,111
Yeah.

247
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,195
Alex, because of your
little escapade the other day,

248
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,073
I've got the police
breathing down my neck.

249
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,396
Now, if you were in my team,

250
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,831
we wouldn't be bumping heads
this way, would we?

251
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,630
You like that box?

252
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,274
I picked it up at an estate auction.

253
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,438
Together with this lighter.

254
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,393
It was 25 years ago.

255
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,198
Alex.

256
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,359
Alex.

257
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,196
See some familiar faces, Alex?

258
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,552
They're making the kind of money
you'll make when you work for me.

259
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,390
On Thursday, a freighter will deliver
some cargo in Tolo Harbour.

260
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,352
All you need to do is pick it up

261
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,313
and deliver it to my boatyard
in Causeway Bay.

262
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,550
It's simple. And the compensation,
I assure you, is most generous.

263
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,557
So, what you say?

264
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,950
You'll do it, right?

265
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,791
So, what's your answer?

266
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,591
- Hmm?
- Go fuck yourself.

267
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,792
I didn't hear you.

268
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,552
You go fuck yourself.

269
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,914
Big mistake.

270
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,077
Alex, so sorry we couldn't do business.

271
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,237
Oh, by the way, if you get any more
of that French cognac,

272
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,671
you know where to find me.

273
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,314
- How many were there?
- At least eight.

274
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,553
I could have taken them.

275
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,039
Except that big
Chinese ugly mother-fucker

276
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,277
with a big scar on his cheek.

277
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,828
All right, gentlemen.
Let's quit flogging the log, here.

278
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,996
What's it gonna be?

279
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,514
I'm in, Frank. All the way.

280
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,390
I don't know about Alex.

281
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm in.

282
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,114
Everything under control, Miss Wilde?

283
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,718
Yes. Thank you.

284
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,630
- Does Mr Griffith know you're here?
- Yes, of course.

285
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,070
Pardon me, please.

286
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,234
What happened?

287
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,228
I was going through some files
when this security person came in.

288
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,874
So I wasn't able to find out anything.

289
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,595
Look, just keep looking.
And be careful next time.

290
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,473
I'll try. But if I get caught
I'm out of a job.

291
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,831
- Where are you, by the way?
- Uh...

292
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,679
I'm taking my brother on a fishing trip.

293
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,471
Give him a big kiss for me, all right?

294
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,151
Big kiss? I'll give him a big kick
in the ass. That's what I'll give him.

295
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,074
I love you.

296
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,759
Big kiss.

297
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,759
Hey, guys!

298
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,439
That's the place.

299
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,476
Fantastic.

300
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,476
This place is like a goddamn fort.

301
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,557
Good choice, Alex.

302
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,194
Chad! C'mon.

303
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,716
Great place to hit him from, Alex.

304
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,480
They'll be begging us
to take the tunnel back.

305
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,953
C'mon, Chad. We reserved
the Marco Polo suite for you.

306
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,436
I've slept in worse.

307
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,596
Oh, Frankie...

308
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,950
Come on in, Chad.

309
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,875
Don't wait around for the bellboys.
Put your luggage on the floor.

310
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,674
Show me one spot on the floor
without bird shit.

311
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,395
Oh, sorry. We forgot to call the maid.

312
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,679
Very funny

313
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,558
No. That's very funny.

314
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,434
Shit.

315
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,835
Frankie, I dunno about this guy.

316
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,073
Give him time, Alex. He'll be all right.

317
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,192
You think so?

318
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,951
Boom!

319
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,392
Hey.

320
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,879
- Alex, I think they screwed you.
- Let me see.

321
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,831
Next time, I'll make the deal.

322
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,870
Look good to me.

323
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,829
Chad, tell me again exactly...

324
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,552
Chad.

325
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,876
- Chad.
- Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

326
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,312
Tell me again exactly
what Zhang told you about the drop.

327
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,717
Thursday night, Causeway Bay.

328
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,636
Watch my back.

329
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,274
Don't fuck up.

330
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,879
Psst!

331
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,796
Shit.

332
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,354
Shit, Chad!

333
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,756
The fucker, Chad.

334
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,917
Come on, let's go!

335
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,354
Shit.

336
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,437
Yeah. Yeah! Hey, bro, we did it.

337
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,110
Did what? You fucked up.

338
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,079
We're wasting our time. I've worked
for Mr Griffith for over five years.

339
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,192
He's as honest a businessman
as I've ever met.

340
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,356
Just keep looking, OK?

341
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,790
I'll keep looking.

342
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,388
I miss you.

343
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,079
I've got to go now.

344
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,271
Alex?

345
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,952
Mr Griffith is going to an important
meeting at the Klimax Klub tonight.

346
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,559
Yeah?

347
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,799
You know who owns that club.
Raymond Zhang.

348
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,833
Gentlemen, to our latest acquisition.

349
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,600
The Golden Glory...

350
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,035
which will soon be exporting
our shared bounty

351
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,834
to the United States of America.

352
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,032
Let us thank
their Drug Enforcement Agency

353
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,472
for their efforts to stem the flow
of narcotics from South America.

354
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,309
Demand is up. Street prices are up.

355
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,675
And we, in the Far East, are now
more than ready to fill the vacuum.

356
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,872
Kara, would you like to do the honours?

357
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,512
Thank you.

358
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,472
Excuse me for a moment.

359
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,549
Hey, Alex! Didn't think we'd see you
around here so soon.

360
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,797
Those scars healed pretty good,
didn't they?

361
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,992
Huh? You are looking well.

362
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,873
What's in the box?

363
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,469
This is the cognac Mr Zhang asked for.

364
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,990
Can you give this to him, please?

365
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,031
With my compliments.

366
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,039
Now, turning to a more immediate matter.

367
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,237
Last night, our factory was destroyed.

368
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,513
I know you're all aware
of this temporary setback.

369
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,113
Since the police are not claiming
responsibility, one can only assume

370
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,835
that it was the work of an outside rival.

371
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,234
Or worse yet... an inside rival.

372
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,198
Yes, I know. It's terribly bad
for the morale of all concerned

373
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,109
when someone isn't being a team player.

374
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,075
You see, we've been letting
ourselves get soft, gentlemen.

375
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,236
Lax in our attitudes.

376
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,193
We haven't been paying
sufficient attention

377
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,755
to all the little details.

378
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,356
Have we, now... Mr Ngyuen?

379
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,829
No! No! Not me!

380
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,036
More cake, anyone?

381
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,596
Chad, come on. Move your ass.

382
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,790
Hi.

383
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,718
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Alex.

384
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,471
- Alex? Alex who?
- This is the cognac for Mr Zhang.

385
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,355
Just arrived from Marseilles. Number one.

386
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,956
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, why not?

387
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,799
You are very handsome man.
Like Sean Connery.

388
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,911
Uh-huh. What?

389
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,308
- What's that?
- French cognac, sir.

390
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,318
From our friend Alex.

391
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,277
He knew about last night's shipment.

392
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,359
Invite him in here.
We'd like to have a drink with him.

393
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,476
- Would you like to dance with me?
- Uh...

394
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,437
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- OK.

395
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,833
More cognac, eh?

396
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,079
Well, guess what? The big boss
would like to thank you personally.

397
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,034
- Hey, that's nice. Um...
- In there.

398
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,429
I've got one more case of cognac in the car.
I'll be right back.

399
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,676
No. You don't seem to understand.

400
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,759
Mr Zhang would like to thank you now.

401
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,593
Are you hearing me?

402
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,676
Let's go.

403
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,719
There's two of them.

404
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,434
It's another bomb. Get the hell out. Move it.
Come On Get out of here.

405
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,358
We're busted. Out. Out!

406
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,879
Get out!

407
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,919
Chad, this way.

408
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,273
What's the big hurry?

409
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,996
Are you, um... hiding something?

410
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,872
- No.
- No?

411
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,832
That's good, because... I have to frisk you.

412
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,239
And if I don't find anything, well...

413
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,988
I can let you go.

414
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,792
And we can just forget
this ever happened. Hmm?

415
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,956
C'mon, now. Turn around.

416
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,515
That's a good girl, yeah.

417
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,439
And now...

418
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,160
you can frisk me.

419
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,036
Arson investigators
are exploring the possibility

420
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,995
that the mysterious fıres plaguing
properties owned by Transworld Exports

421
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,796
are the result of renewed warfare between
rival Triad families based in the colony.

422
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,595
We'll be back with sports and weather...

423
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,351
- Hello?
- Chad.

424
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,518
- Hey, Danielle.
- May I please talk to Alex?

425
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,156
Uh, Alex and Frankie...
They're in the jungle.

426
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,238
Hey, you can talk to me. I'm a nice guy.

427
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,197
Chad, I found something in the files.
An old document.

428
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,228
I... I really shouldn't talk here.

429
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,793
Chad...

430
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,991
I was just searched.

431
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,478
Searched? What do you mean,
"searched"? Who searched you?

432
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,910
It's not something
I care to discuss on the phone.

433
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,429
You're right. Stop talking.

434
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,111
I'm gonna find Alex
and... and... and... Frankie, uh...

435
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,108
We'll pick you up at Alex's place.
You go there now.

436
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,834
Uh... I'll talk to you soon.

437
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,079
Guys! Guys! Where are you?

438
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,957
Alex! Yo, Frankie!

439
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,074
Honey, we're home!

440
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,319
Chad!

441
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,469
Hell of a time to take a joyride!

442
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,797
- Express service.
- Where's Alex?

443
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,356
Couldn't find him.

444
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,632
I dunno what to tell you, Alex.

445
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,595
I'll be outside.

446
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,515
Frank was right about everything.
About your boss, too.

447
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,472
Yes, I've realised that.

448
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,794
- Oui?
- Is my brother with you?

449
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,072
Sure, boss. He's in the back room.

450
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:42,312
- By himself?
- Uh... No. Danielle, she's with him.

451
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,919
- Everything is OK, boss?
- Put him on the phone.

452
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,829
- Yes, sure. Let me just go to get him.
- Now!

453
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,914
Allô?

454
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,758
Where are they?

455
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,433
- Brothers.
- Brothers?

456
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,710
- Kara.
- What's wrong?

457
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,674
She works for Griffith.
She's the one who searched me.

458
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,438
Don't play stupid with me.

459
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,997
They got guns. We're trapped.

460
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,512
No, we're not. Help me
move this aside. Come, help me.

461
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,033
I love Alex.

462
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,196
I'm gonna kill him!

463
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,351
Hey, this is good.

464
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,312
Excuse me.

465
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,516
Shit.

466
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,153
This way.

467
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,878
C'mon, let's go!

468
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,592
C'mon!

469
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,713
Move!

470
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,433
Move!

471
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,194
Go!

472
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,110
The boat. Let's go!

473
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,873
Jump! C'mon, jump!

474
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,672
Let's move out.

475
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,791
Let's go.

476
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,113
That's it. Let's go back.

477
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,796
Mother-fucker!

478
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,070
- Frankie.
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

479
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,477
And I got to ditch this boat.
Now get outta there.

480
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,954
What's going on?

481
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:53,280
There's been a lot of strange-looking
aircraft floating around here...

482
01:09:53,280 --> 01:10:00,158
- What is she doing here?
- She realised Griffith ain't Mr Clean.

483
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,558
We got enough prima donnas here.

484
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,716
Like I say...

485
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,151
You got a lot of explaining to do.

486
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,874
Madame, your suite is ready.

487
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,155
This is it. Home, sweet home.

488
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,112
Well, well, well...

489
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,116
Ain't this a sweet picture?

490
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,518
Alex, I tried to call you.
Somebody searched me at the office.

491
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,393
Don't stop there, bro.

492
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,875
I think she likes it.

493
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,629
- Alex, it's not what it seems.
- You shut up.

494
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,990
Alex... Cool down.

495
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,236
Chill out, pal.

496
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,510
Chill out, OK?

497
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,109
Chill out?

498
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,515
Chill out.

499
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,229
Chill out.

500
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,351
Mr California.

501
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,552
Mr Silk Underwear.

502
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,671
Mr Perfection.

503
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,474
You wanna see
how we chill out in Hong Kong?

504
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,717
You're drunk, Alex. Stop this!

505
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,598
Don't even think about it.

506
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,273
I was waiting for that.

507
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,956
Alex.

508
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,559
C'mon.

509
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,193
C'mon!

510
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,437
- Alex, he's your brother.
- Brother. Why?

511
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,074
Because he looks like me?

512
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,350
I'm gonna change that.

513
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,757
- Because I'm gonna fuck up his face.
- I'm your brother.

514
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,678
Frank! Frank!

515
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,989
You're not bad for a pussy.

516
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,594
Come on!

517
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,878
Hey!

518
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,393
Chad! Alex! Hey!
You guys outta your mind?

519
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,429
Frank! Stop them!

520
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,394
We're supposed to be fighting
the Zhangs, not each other.

521
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,754
Now you, Alex, you need him more now
than you ever have.

522
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,238
- Don't tell me what I need.
- You're drunk.

523
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,878
Maybe I'm drunk. Tomorrow I'll be sober.
But he'll always be a faggot.

524
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,276
That's it, Frank.

525
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,879
I don't need him.

526
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,390
I don't need him.
I don't need the fucking tunnel.

527
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,751
I'm out of here! Fuck him!

528
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,954
I'm out of here.

529
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,879
- Chad. Chad!
- Fuck him!

530
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,275
- What do you mean, "out of here"?
- I'm going home!

531
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,118
Los Angeles!

532
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,598
We're on an island on the other side
of the fucking ocean.

533
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,109
I'll swim!

534
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,358
- Hey!
- I'll swim!

535
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,594
Damn.

536
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,316
Alex, he is your brother.

537
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,957
Who was there for me,
when I was on the street alone, huh?

538
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,310
Nobody helped me.

539
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,356
Nobody helped me.

540
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,239
I don't have a brother.

541
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,590
I don't have a brother!

542
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,831
Oh, mother-fucker.

543
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,475
Where are they?

544
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,635
- Where are the twins?
- Fuck you.

545
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,913
Stop! They've gone. They've left the island.

546
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,477
She lies. They could take us
somewhere else.

547
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,070
If you find them,
bring back their bodies.

548
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:01,831
I think Griffith would love
to speak to this one personally.

549
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,314
Welcome home.

550
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,520
They've got Frank and Danielle.

551
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,158
- Where?
- I was just about to ask him and...

552
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,954
I hope he'll talk.

553
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,714
He'll talk. Trust me.

554
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,473
So we don't have
the entire cabal in custody?

555
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,955
But we will before the day's over.

556
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,875
- Are they cooperating yet?
- No, sir.

557
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,272
Hello, Frank.

558
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,390
Are you ready to talk?
Or are you ready to scream?

559
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,717
Like I said... fuck you!

560
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,390
Hey, where's your brother? Huh?
Where's your brother?

561
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,875
He's late for the party.

562
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,318
My brother hates parties, man.

563
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,198
You don't know what side your bread
is buttered on, do you, you silly bitch!

564
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,188
Think of all the kindness
I wasted on you over the years.

565
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,794
Move.

566
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,070
Go!

567
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,793
Chad.

568
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,590
What's going on up there?

569
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,237
It's painfully obvious, Raymond.
Would you give me the phone?

570
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,833
This is Nigel Griffith speaking.
Good evening, lads.

571
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,312
Not in a conversational mood, are we?

572
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,919
Fuck you.

573
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,671
Perhaps a word or two from a friend
might serve to break the ice.

574
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,868
Kara, make him scream.

575
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,232
- Stop it!
- Chad! In the boiler room!

576
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,556
In the boiler room!

577
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,549
They know where we are now.
That's good.

578
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,309
We can stop wasting time.
Ring the area with your men. Hurry!

579
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,711
We're still waiting for you, lads.

580
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,435
It's not terribly polite
to treat your friends this way.

581
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:53,269
If you don't hurry, one of them
might have to depart our company.

582
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:57,951
Which one would you prefer it to be?
The young lady?

583
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,875
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

584
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,276
Mr Frank Avery...

585
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,949
Don't fall for their trick, Chad!
Don't fall for their trick!

586
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,750
No!

587
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,154
One down, one to go.
Do hurry, lads.

588
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,992
Griffith...

589
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,432
You're dead.

590
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,832
You're dead!

591
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,836
They're on their way.

592
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,758
Good!

593
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,193
Oh, don't worry, Frank.
Next time we'll make it real.

594
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,951
Come on.

595
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,677
Shit.

596
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,038
Come on!

597
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,354
Come on!

598
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,916
Mr Griffıth! Cargo hold number two!
It's gone! And everybody in it!

599
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,159
- The twins. What about the twins?
- Everybody. They're all dead.

600
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,749
Goodbye, Frank.

601
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,832
Get away!

602
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,957
Don't touch me! No!

603
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,188
- Come on. This ain't gonna hurt.
- No!

604
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,718
Oh, shit!

605
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,479
Alex.

606
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,959
Alex!

607
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:15,237
It's you and I, dickhead. Come on!

608
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,789
Kill him.

609
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,477
Go on, kill him!

610
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,439
Kill him!

611
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,115
Chad!

612
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,793
Chad! Take care of Frank! And Danielle.

613
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,592
Yeah!

614
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,195
He's mine!

615
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,119
Zhang!

616
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,159
C'mon. Stay with me.

617
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,233
Zhang!

618
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,558
Griffith!

619
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,477
C'mon.

620
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,480
Zhang!

621
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,273
C'mon.

622
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,313
Chad!

623
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,430
Come on.

624
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,031
Chad or Alex or whichever one you are.

625
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:27,395
Alex, what's this really about, anyway?
Is it the tunnel?

626
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:36,032
You know, Alex. Griffith - he's too weak.

627
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,952
Don't worry about Griffith.

628
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,958
My brother. He's taking care of him.

629
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,194
Good.

630
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:51,390
Alex... if you're in with me,
I'll give you half... of everything.

631
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,316
Everything.

632
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,396
What about my father?

633
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,794
Come on, come on.
You've got to breathe, haven't you?

634
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,510
Griffith!

635
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,512
Yeah.

636
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,473
What about my father?

637
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,149
Alex... It was Griffith. I swear.

638
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,993
Hey!

639
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,872
Help me!

640
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,272
Stop it!

641
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,279
Alex.

642
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,313
# Jump back and get ready

643
