1
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:04,426
Put your clothes on, Tarzan. Time to
head back to the land of the big P.X.

2
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,867
You got 30 minutes
to pack your gear.

3
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,986
Now, get a move on, son.

4
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:14,066
let’s get out of here.

5
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,787
Obrigado.

6
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,150
Over here!

7
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,471
See what I'm sayin'?
For real! Yeah, yeah.

8
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,232
Check it out.

9
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:50,672
Hey. My man.
Hey, you sellin'?

10
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,552
'Cause I got 20.

11
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,232
What do I get... for 20?

12
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:04,953
Hey, man. What do you think,
you're the only pharmacy in town, man?

13
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:11,033
This information is basic...

14
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:15,033
to the understanding of
20th-century thought and civilization.

15
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:19,073
Charles Darwin’s theory,
"Natural Selection,"...

16
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:22,874
A general description?
Anybody?

17
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:30,354
- We went over all of this material yesterday.
- Yo, Kerrigan.

18
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:32,434
I got your natural selection,
my man.

19
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:35,834
How 'bout I naturally select to walk
out of this boring-ass classroom.

20
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,955
God help us all.

21
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,955
Whoo! Outta here!

22
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,675
Oh.

23
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,475
Mr. Kerrigan?

24
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,355
Louis?

25
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,835
Maybe it's not such a good time.
I- I-I can come back.

26
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,756
Nah. No better or worse
than any other time.

27
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,716
No, no.
Come on in, Louis.

28
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,916
Excuse me. It's been
a rough morning.

29
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:34,516
So, the last I heard...

30
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:39,036
you were off on the great
South American crusades...

31
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:42,196
training our stalwart
indigenous troops...

32
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:45,756
how to fight
the malignant cartels.

33
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:51,637
I spent four years fighting a lot of
bureaucracy is what it comes down to.

34
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:54,517
Now I'm back, and, uh...

35
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:57,077
I'm just trying to find
square one all over again.

36
00:08:57,157 --> 00:09:00,597
And you think maybe
I can possibly help?

37
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,358
Kid, you're in
serious trouble.

38
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:09,077
Come on. let's go down
to the feeding grounds.

39
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,077
What do you think of these?

40
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,318
They installed them
a couple of years ago.

41
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:18,318
Too many kids were getting high,
thinking they were Superman.

42
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:25,238
Either that or they were just throwing
each other off the third story.

43
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,158
- Hello.
- Hiya. How ya doin'?

44
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,718
Janitors got tired
of scrapping 'em off the floor.

45
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,519
I signed on to be a schoolteacher,
Louis, not a zookeeper.

46
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:50,999
I'm tired. I'm tired of trying
to lead the horses to water...

47
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:54,519
and I and everyone else
knows they're not gonna drink.

48
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:59,400
Mr. Kerrigan, people like you
do not just up and quit.

49
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:02,240
They stick around and keep people
like me from quitting.

50
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,200
There was a time,
young Mr. Stevens...

51
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,160
when there were some students,
like yourself, who were worth saving...

52
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,880
but... that's in
the past tense.

53
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,600
Take a look around you
at our current student body.

54
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,920
Seventy-five percent of them
are packing weapons.

55
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,240
Forty-five percent are high. Eighty-one
percent are living in one-parent families.

56
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,640
Is it any mystery
that 12% of the students...

57
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:29,720
who come to Lincoln High School
go full term and graduate?

58
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,840
Well, what about those 12%?

59
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,761
What about the peasants?

60
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,721
The ones who wanted to plant
sweet potatoes and not coca leaves.

61
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,241
I don't see you re-upping
for another four years.

62
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,761
No, I guess you don't.

63
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,721
Sorry.

64
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,882
I'm sorry I came here
in the first place.

65
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:12,202
You'll be selling the product,
or you'll be sorry.

66
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:14,362
- Now, pick it up!
- Aw, man!

67
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:17,002
You better pray.

68
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:19,682
- Shay should just go ahead and...
- Shay, get up, man.

69
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:24,963
Just having a little
family problem here, Teach.

70
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:28,283
little brother here forgot to finish
his homework last night, eh?

71
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,403
Why don't you let the kid go?

72
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,763
I just told you.

73
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:37,403
This is family matters. None of
your damn business. Who is this?

74
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,603
First of all,
I ain't a teacher.

75
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,683
- Oh.
- Second...

76
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,963
I'm in a real shitty mood.

77
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:47,683
Ooh!

78
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:50,764
And third, no law says
I can't make it my business.

79
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,003
So let the kid go!

80
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,724
Well, me man...

81
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:57,724
you just made it
your damn business.

82
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,764
Get him.

83
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:04,604
Come to me.

84
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,444
Yes.

85
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,924
Boss, look at me.

86
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,445
Back! Get back!

87
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,765
Aaah!

88
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,325
- Yeah, mon!
- Come on!

89
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,725
Do it again! Get him!
Good, good, good!

90
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:52,005
Yeah, yeah! Get him!

91
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,606
Come on! Get up!

92
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,966
Yeah. Yeah!
Come on!

93
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:06,566
- Oh!
- Unreal!

94
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,527
He got kicked
right back to Jamaica!

95
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,447
Louis, do you know
what you just did?

96
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:36,367
You did something none of us professionals
have been able to do for the last five years.

97
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:40,607
You got their attention!
Hey, hey! All right! Hey!

98
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:44,087
These kids are no strangers
to violence.

99
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,967
It's been a part of their lives
since the day they were born.

100
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,368
look how they responded
to Louis...

101
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,848
when he threw
those dealers off campus.

102
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,848
And so by teaching them this,
uh, this Brazilian kung fu...

103
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,768
Capoeira. Capoeira.

104
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:59,048
Yes, thank you... we will be
channeling their hyperactive...

105
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,128
hormone-driven energies
into something constructive.

106
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,409
- That's the idea.
- let me get this straight.

107
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:06,689
You propose we scrape the bottom
of the barrel for 12 of our worst kids.

108
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:10,529
Students who are without redemption,
who are prime dropout material.

109
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,009
And in lieu of their gym classes,
young Lawrence here...

110
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,009
- Louis. My name is Louis.
- Teaches them this stuff...

111
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,969
and hopefully...

112
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,889
It'll show them
some respect.

113
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:22,889
- Give 'em something to strive for, to work for.
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

114
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,489
listen to what
we're being sold here, people.

115
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:29,089
Teach violence
to violent kids.

116
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,530
We, ve been told
that this young man...

117
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:35,529
has just returned
from military service in Latin America.

118
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,289
Doing what, pray tell?
Training death squads?

119
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,050
Now, there's a fine role model
for our disaffected youth!

120
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,290
Mr. Kerrigan, we tried.

121
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,930
- It's not gonna work. -
Louis! - Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,050
- Hang on a second.
- I know Louis.

123
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,290
We were both students
at Lincoln together.

124
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,250
When he was
a freshman and a sophomore...

125
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:05,090
he was a troublemaker, going nowhere
like most of the kids in this school.

126
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,490
But someone turned him around.

127
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,011
His 11 th-grade
social studies teacher.

128
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,770
Now I think he's back
to try and return the favor...

129
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:18,531
and if this is a last desperate attempt
to help these kids...

130
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:22,691
because what we're doing
is not working...

131
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,651
I think it might
be worth a shot.

132
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,891
What have we
got to lose?

133
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,651
Hey, Dianna.
Dianna, whoa.

134
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,611
I just wanted
to say thanks.

135
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,972
- Thanks for talking me into it.
- You're welcome, Louis.

136
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,052
Can I help you carry something?
Your books?

137
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,132
Thanks. We're not
in high school anymore.

138
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,372
No, we're not,
and we shouldn't act like it.

139
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,252
So I can take you
someplace nice now.

140
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:50,332
look. You're not
getting it, are you?

141
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:53,492
I liked your proposal.
I thought it was fresh and offbeat.

142
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:56,853
- Thanks.
- I doubt it's gonna work, but at this point, I don't care.

143
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,852
I'm willing to try anything.

144
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:02,532
But just don't think that my support was
based on anything other than those kids.

145
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:05,093
That's all you should expect.

146
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,093
- Hector.
- SI’mi amor.

147
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,772
Will you help me
with these?

148
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:16,053
Thanks.

149
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,294
There's the front door.
Or maybe that...

150
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,654
Yeah, that's
the front door.

151
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:44,814
- What's with the windows?
- Well, we can take those out.

152
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,775
Yeah, that'll help.

153
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,214
Well, at least
we got ourselves a dojo.

154
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:07,455
We got ourselves a disaster, that's what
we got ourselves. look at this floor.

155
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:11,055
Somebody's been using it for a toilet,
and I'm supposed to do handstands on this?

156
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,975
Oh, Louis,
we're in a firehouse.

157
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:15,095
There's got to be hoses
around in here.

158
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:19,095
A hosing ain, t gonna do it.
This place needs to be nuked.

159
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:22,095
Fellas, your lease is up.

160
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,256
look out! look out!

161
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,657
Well, let's see what they sent us.

162
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,017
let's go, guys. Come on.

163
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:14,937
You must be kilng.

164
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,017
Eie. Will you just
line up down here, please?

165
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,818
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say, Kerrigan.
Whatever you say.

166
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:24,897
Danny, stay in the city limits,
would you?

167
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,098
Come on, guys. line up.
Down to your left.

168
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:30,618
That’s it, gentlemen.
Down to your left. Your left.

169
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:33,738
The other left.
Shay, move on in here.

170
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,058
Right in here.
Just follow him down.

171
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:39,618
That's it. Hold it.
This line down here, please.

172
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:43,659
All right. let me have
your attention, please, guys.

173
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,578
As you all know, were it not
for this opportunity...

174
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,299
you, d probably be spending your time in
detention or Mr. Casper’s gym class...

175
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,299
and if you, d like,
those options are still available.

176
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:57,459
- looks like Shay’s place.
- You get my drift?

177
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,499
Oh, no.

178
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,379
Now what?

179
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,019
Ooh! Mrs. Esposito!

180
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,420
look at that sexy mama!

181
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,380
Boy, did we ever scrape
the bottom of that barrel.

182
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,179
Mrs. Esposito.

183
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,420
- School and juvenile records.
- Ah, thanks.

184
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,699
Well, the Vienna Boys' Choir
it ain't.

185
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,980
But I'm sure in a month's time they'll
be saluting and calling you "sir. "

186
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,101
Make us proud, soldier. Ed.

187
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm sticking my neck out for you.
Do not make me look like a fool.

188
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,900
That's gonna be
pretty near impossible.

189
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,421
All right, fellas. let’s go.

190
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,861
Into the firehouse.
let’s line up for roll call.

191
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:48,061
Everybody.
Everybody. Come on.

192
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,861
Hey, Shay, looks like your house.

193
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,261
What a shit-hole.

194
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:06,222
- Place is fallin' apart.
- Those are rat holes.

195
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,301
look at this, man.

196
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,381
Hey, Kerrigan, you oughta
condemn this place, man.

197
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,182
We could hurt ourselves here.

198
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,342
Okay, guy...
Donovan, would you turn that off.

199
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:23,422
- What?
- Turn it off!

200
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:25,582
- This is a class.
- Oh.

201
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,462
All right.

202
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:32,663
Your instructor today...
or mestre...

203
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,583
is Mr. Louis Stevens.

204
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:37,303
- Ooh.
- Oh. The tough guy!

205
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:40,503
- He's a former graduate of Lincoln High.
- He must be a loser then.

206
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,063
He’s also a former Green Beret.

207
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,103
- Ooh.
- And he’s not predisposed to tolerating...

208
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:48,623
any disorder the way
some of your teachers are.

209
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:51,543
He has kindly agreed
to show us...

210
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,744
He's that punk that kicked your brother's
ragged ass out on the lunch yard, man.

211
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,823
I'll do the same to you, faggot.
Any day!

212
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,704
- Hey, listen up.
- I think so, man.

213
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,344
- listen up!
- Take your best shot.

214
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:04,023
Aw, I'll kick
his ass later, man.

215
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:06,024
You!

216
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:09,864
I want you
to turn that music up.

217
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,704
I said turn it up!

218
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:16,184
- Okay. Happy?
- All right.

219
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:21,144
Yeah. I like that.

220
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:24,545
In capoeira,
everything starts out with the ginga.

221
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:27,025
This is a ginga.

222
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:29,585
That's a ginga.

223
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,824
- I know that!
- Yeah, that's it!

224
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:36,384
Think you got it, Eie.

225
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,745
- looks pretty funny, doesn't it?
- Very funny.

226
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:42,945
It's the basis
for moves like this.

227
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:47,465
Hey, man!

228
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,705
This doesn't seem
to be working now, does it?

229
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:56,346
You mind?

230
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,545
No.

231
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:02,506
Mr. Kerrigan, you have that tape?

232
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,346
Now, this is
the real capoeira music.

233
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:11,066
I recorded it in Brazil. It's a little
different, so keep your mind open.

234
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:21,467
Hey, man, turn that
voodoo music off!

235
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:27,386
Give it a chance, guys.
Keep an open mind, huh?

236
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,306
I said turn
that shit off, man.

237
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:32,507
- It's giving me a headache.
- Go back to the jungle.

238
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:35,066
Ooh!

239
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,147
You must think
I'm playing, punk.

240
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:41,508
- Ooh.
- Cut him up, Orlando.

241
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,427
Do it, Orlando!

242
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,548
Hey, give me that!

243
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:48,547
Where you going?

244
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,668
let's dance.

245
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,708
He's only human.

246
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,029
Get up!

247
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,989
Will you turn that off, please?

248
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,310
Okay, that's class for today.

249
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:46,230
Tomorrow I want everybody to show up in
baggy clothes, no shoes and ready to ginga.

250
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,709
That’s it, guys.
You, re dismissed.

251
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,390
- What's your name?
- Eat shit.

252
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,110
You want your blade back,
eat shit?

253
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,110
His name's Orlando Oliveiras, and he has no
business carrying that knife in the first place.

254
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,430
We're not technically
on campus, are we?

255
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:10,111
- No.
- Heads up, tough guy.

256
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,991
- Louis, what are you doing?
- Tomorrow baggy clothes, huh?

257
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:20,550
Louis, that kid has got
a disciplinary file as long as my arm.

258
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:23,111
He's got a cousin
named Silverio...

259
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:25,671
who runs one of
the toughest gangs in the city.

260
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:29,471
Mr. Kerrigan, if we don't start trusting
them, why should they start trusting us?

261
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:34,792
Um, could I borrow this?
I mean, just for tonight.

262
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,512
Just don't forget
where it came from, huh?

263
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:40,272
Promise.

264
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:43,552
- You have a name?
- Yeah. Uh, Donovan.

265
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:46,272
Donovan.
See you tomorrow, Donovan.

266
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:48,592
- Okay.
- Okay.

267
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,192
I hope you have
another copy of that.

268
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,232
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Trust them.

269
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:57,632
Trust them.

270
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,555
Thanks, Mr. Stevens.

271
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,475
What? Oh, this?

272
00:26:10,554 --> 00:26:13,795
Well, you see, I ran your tape
through a MI DI setup.

273
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,715
Your percussion and vocals are panned
from left to right on eight...

274
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,795
and then I filled in the other 16 tracks
with some prefab Brahms samples.

275
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,595
And then I aed
some reverb and some delays...

276
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,515
and some custom-made sounds.

277
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:27,516
It's kind of like a blend
of the old and the new.

278
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:30,075
I hope it's cool with you,
'cause I would not want to offend...

279
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:32,716
any of the ancient mestres
or anything like that, you know.

280
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,476
I think they're gonna like it.

281
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:42,716
Danny.

282
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,836
Come on, guys.

283
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:50,317
- Hurry up.
- What, are we going on a picnic here?

284
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,237
What, are you nuts?
Come on, you big dope! Come on!

285
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,277
Hey, guys.

286
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,437
- Music any better? It's Donovan's mix.
- All right.

287
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,837
- Huh?
- Aww.

288
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:17,637
Yea!

289
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:19,958
Oh...

290
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:23,557
Okay, let's get started.
Um, spread it out.

291
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:25,838
Drop your bags.
Danny, drop your skateboard.

292
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,157
Drop your pants.

293
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:31,678
Come on, guys.
let's start up with the ginga.

294
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:33,638
Shay, why don't you
help me out, man.

295
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:36,118
Everybody, watch, please.
Right leg out.

296
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:38,438
Then left.

297
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,678
Mr. Stevens.

298
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:45,158
I thought we was gonna learn
how to kick ass.

299
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:48,079
- Shut up, Shay.
- All right, listen up.

300
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:54,479
You can't ginga, you can't fight.

301
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,119
- That's the basic of it.
- But, uh, Mr. Stevens...

302
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:00,079
I thought we was gonna
learn how to kick ass!

303
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:03,239
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

304
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,999
Break it up!

305
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,760
Break it up, guys!

306
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,840
All right, class dismissed.
Everyone, out.

307
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,800
Yeah! Whoo!

308
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,799
let's go.
Except you, Shay. You stay.

309
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
- He started it!
- I said you stay!

310
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,800
Forget you, man!
I'll take detention over this shit!

311
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,760
Whoa, whoa. What? You wanna let your brother
keep slapping you around for not selling drugs?

312
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,720
Or do you wanna learn
how to kick ass?

313
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,640
Today's your big chance, man,
because tomorrow...

314
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:40,640
tomorrow it's you and Eie
in front of the entire class.

315
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,600
Now, we got the rest
of the afternoon.

316
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,801
If you want it.

317
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,882
And mark.

318
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,282
Good. Go, Shay.
One more.

319
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:31,402
That’s it. That’s it.
Come to me.

320
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,562
Hey, Mr. Kerrigan.

321
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:36,802
Check this out. All right.
Queixada, queixada, bencao.

322
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:38,883
Now, do it slow one time.

323
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:44,083
Queixada. And light
and slow first one. And bam!

324
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:46,403
Good. All right.
Now this time hard.

325
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:48,483
let’s do it.
Don’t wuss out on me now.

326
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:51,363
All right.
let's do it hard.

327
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:56,683
Queixada, queixada,
and wham!

328
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:06,083
That was pretty good, man.
I knew you had it in you.

329
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,123
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:11,443
All right.
let's do it again.

331
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:16,324
Queixada, queixada.

332
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:20,204
let’s go, Shay!

333
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,044
Get up, man!

334
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:25,324
- You can take him!
- Get up!

335
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:28,565
Teach him a lesson, man!

336
00:30:30,684 --> 00:30:32,645
Come on.
What's up? Get up!

337
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:35,925
Get up, man!
You, re weak, man! Get up!

338
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,804
Get him!

339
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,725
Come on! let's go!

340
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:46,205
Come on. Get up!
What’s wrong with you, bro? Get up!

341
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:48,245
let’s go, Eie. Come on, man.

342
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,485
Come on, Eie.

343
00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:00,045
Oh, man! I felt that one!

344
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:09,286
He’s messed up.

345
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,526
Oh, Eie, man.

346
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,526
You ready to try this yet?

347
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,806
Mr. Kerrigan, please.

348
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,487
Danny, man.
Come on. let's go.

349
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:39,887
That's it. That's it.
loosen up.

350
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,447
Come on in, Donovan.
Yeah.

351
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,487
It's easy, man.

352
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,808
You got it.
See? There you go.

353
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:53,328
You got it, guys.

354
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,208
Ooh. Whoa.

355
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:05,088
Come on, Eie.

356
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:07,368
Do it, man.
Come on.

357
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,808
Break it down, Danny.

358
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:23,209
- Go, Shay.
- Whoa.

359
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,730
Yeah! All right, guys. Not bad.

360
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:11,091
This instrument
is the berimbau.

361
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,890
It sets the pace
for the jogo, the game.

362
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,811
All right, Donovan.
You try to stay with my beat, huh?

363
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,890
Okay. Here we go.

364
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:58,571
- What do you think?
- Nah, man.

365
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:01,052
- Come on, man. Just give it a try.
- No, man.

366
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,892
I know you got this
in your blood. Just try it.

367
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:07,092
You know I've got this
in my blood?

368
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,853
Boy, you don't know
caralho about me, man.

369
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,772
Just 'cause you read some files,
you think you know about me?

370
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:19,413
Man, you don't know nothing
about anybody here!

371
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,213
You're right. I don't. But I'm trying
to learn. That's why we're here.

372
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,253
What are we gonna learn, huh?
What are you gonna teach us?

373
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,133
How to play your poja bongo drums
and dance around like little viados?

374
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:30,813
You're a loser, man.
A loser!

375
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:34,413
lando!

376
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,895
Orlando!

377
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,335
What you lookin' at?

378
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:32,295
Why'd you walk out
on the class?

379
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:38,216
- You gonna hide behind
these guys all night, Orlando...

380
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:40,935
- or you gonna speak up for yourself?
- I already told you.

381
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,856
I don't got time to be playing
your poja games, man.

382
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:47,256
What do you got time for?
Running little errands for your cousin?

383
00:35:47,336 --> 00:35:49,496
Stealing cars
and chopping them up?

384
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:52,176
Yeah, teacher, I do shit for my cousin.
Everybody knows that.

385
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,896
Cops know that,
school knows that.

386
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:56,896
I'm sure you saw it
on my files.

387
00:35:56,976 --> 00:36:01,017
Oh, so now what?
You got something better for me?

388
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:05,056
You gonna pay my mama's rent? Are you
gonna feed me with that jungle music, man?

389
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:09,817
Teacher, let me tell you
something about my cousin.

390
00:36:09,897 --> 00:36:13,816
He don't play no jungle music,
but he takes care of business.

391
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:17,497
He takes care of his family,
and he takes care of his neighborhood.

392
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,498
You better go, man.

393
00:36:36,218 --> 00:36:38,618
We gonna see you
in class tomorrow?

394
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:43,218
Hey, sacana. Now, maybe you
Don’t hear so good. He said go.

395
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,818
Now!

396
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,900
look at this.

397
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,020
Oh, man.

398
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,621
So, you must be the guy.
Eh, primo?

399
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,981
The one who teaches
capoeira, eh?

400
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,660
You must be the cousin.
Silverio.

401
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:01,220
So, tell me, teacher.

402
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,381
How much are they paying you
on the high school?

403
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:12,021
- Enough.
- Don't play with me, cu.

404
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,821
How much?

405
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:16,982
I got a roof over my head.

406
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,222
That's all I need right now.

407
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,382
"A roof over my head. " Ha!

408
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:25,742
You know, my friend...

409
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:30,422
it's been a long time
since I met a real-life santo.

410
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:34,742
A saint. Right before my eyes.
In the flesh and blood.

411
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:39,582
Tell you what, santo.

412
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:42,343
- You see
all this useless garbage?

413
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,302
I need someone...

414
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:49,102
who can take these pieces of shit
and make men out of them.

415
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,143
If you can teach them
how to fight...

416
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:54,742
I'll give you a roof over your head
like you ain't gonna believe.

417
00:38:56,703 --> 00:38:59,463
And probably all
the coke I can snort.

418
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:02,023
Whatever.

419
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,263
I'm a reasonable man.

420
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,983
Just tell me
what you need.

421
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,543
You know what I need?

422
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:13,464
I need to get out of here
before I puke all over your fancy shoes.

423
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:20,024
- Excuse me.
- Hey, santo.

424
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:23,864
Your interview
is not over yet.

425
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:29,544
I still gotta check
your qualifications.

426
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,864
See, you Don’t
fool a man...

427
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:37,944
who was born and raised
in the worst barrio of Rio deJaneiro.

428
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,065
We, re gonna find out
real quick...

429
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:45,465
who's the real capoeira mestre
in this neighborhood.

430
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:24,228
You know what?
You're okay, santo.

431
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:29,788
Get up.

432
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:32,228
I say, "Okay. "

433
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,228
Which means not good enough
to train my boys here...

434
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,148
but good enough
to train my primo.

435
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:40,949
Santo’s gonna teach you the simple shit,
and when you're ready to graduate...

436
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:42,869
I'm gonna be
your college...

437
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:45,789
to teach you what they don't
teach you in the playgrounds.

438
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:54,629
He's my blood, santo.

439
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,629
I got big plans for him.

440
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,469
Don't be putting
no crazy ideas in his head.

441
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,791
I, d say going there
by yourself...

442
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,630
was not the smartest move
you ever made.

443
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:23,550
look who's talkin'...

444
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,871
you waitin' outside the fire station
alone on a night like this.

445
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,870
Yeah, I'd say that's
pretty levelheaded, huh?

446
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:32,111
- Aaah.
- Sorry.

447
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:37,991
- So why did you wait for me?
- 'Cause I know that neighborhood.

448
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:39,951
And I know about
Orlando's family.

449
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:41,992
- I tried to warn you.
- Hey, you know me.

450
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:45,751
If someone says it's a lost cause,
I'm the first sucker in line.

451
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:49,711
Uh-huh. Is that
what these kids are?

452
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:52,392
They just another
lost cause to you?

453
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:54,312
This time it's my backyard.

454
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:57,271
What does that mean?

455
00:42:57,352 --> 00:43:00,352
It means that if I don't do something
about it, I've got to live with it.

456
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,632
We've got to live with it.

457
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:06,072
Is this that same
self-absorbed guy I used to date?

458
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,392
What happened to you
down there?

459
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:14,872
It's okay.

460
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,273
- How's your hand?
- I don't know.

461
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:25,193
let's find out, huh?

462
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:31,233
Oh... God!
Louis, you're crazy!

463
00:43:31,273 --> 00:43:34,593
- Guess the hand's better, Doc.
- Take two aspirin, and Don’t call me in the morning.

464
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:37,954
Wait. It's your turn. I bet you can't
even do a handstand anymore.

465
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,913
- You're right.
- This is a challenge.

466
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,833
You gonna wimp out
on a challenge?

467
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:43,873
Swim, or do a handstand.

468
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,113
- This is my choice?
- This is your choice.

469
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:48,914
- All right, Mr. Show-off.
- All right.

470
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,834
Does teacher need
a spot or some help?

471
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,914
No, no. Just don't look
when I try one.

472
00:43:54,033 --> 00:43:55,714
- So you do need a spot.
- All right.

473
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:58,314
- Just get back.
- Drumroll, please.

474
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,474
Oh, my God.

475
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,914
Oh... Grab me!

476
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:05,634
God...

477
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:09,235
Well, your handstand needs some help,
but your back bend's pretty good.

478
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:12,115
- Are you happy now?
- Could be happier.

479
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,715
How?

480
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,634
Oh, my God.
Louis, what are you doing?

481
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:23,035
- You're crazy.
- I know.

482
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:28,918
Dianna!

483
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:33,477
Dianna, there's a rumor
being circulated...

484
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:35,437
by my own students,
no less...

485
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:37,437
about you
and Mr. Death Squad...

486
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:41,798
who, guess what, turns out to be
a former boyfriend of yours.

487
00:45:41,837 --> 00:45:44,358
Since when did you start teaching
current affairs, Hector?

488
00:45:44,398 --> 00:45:47,317
Since you started
piling on the fiction, Dianna.

489
00:45:47,398 --> 00:45:50,278
look. What is going on
down at that firehouse?

490
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:52,318
I don't think that's
any of your business.

491
00:45:56,878 --> 00:45:59,878
Although it probably wouldn't hurt for
you to come down and see for yourself.

492
00:46:11,198 --> 00:46:13,639
I wasn't expecting this.
This is very... impressive.

493
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,800
So the techniques are
mixed in with the dance?

494
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:25,960
And the rhythm. Yes.

495
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,320
Great. They've learned a more efficient
way to give each other bloody noses.

496
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,400
Apparently, that's not all
they've learned, Senor Cervantes! look!

497
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,240
Ordinarily that would have led to a
shooting, especially with those two kids.

498
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,560
look at what he's done with them.
And these are...

499
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,480
These were the 12 worst kids at Lincoln,
the absolute bottom of the heap!

500
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,640
Hell, I'm ready to give him
Casper's entire gym class!

501
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,080
- let's do it.
- All right.

502
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,680
Granted, he's instilled
a small degree of discipline...

503
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:06,721
but let's not blow this
out of proportion.

504
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:10,961
"Out of proportion"? like taking this proposal
directly to the head of the school board?

505
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,481
- Would that be out of proportion for you?
- What proposal?

506
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:18,802
The capoeira program, Kerrigan. Citywide,
at every high school in the district.

507
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:23,001
God knows, if it works at Lincoln, it'll
work damn near anywhere. You shut up!

508
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:27,109
Come on, Kerrigan.
Get with the program.

509
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,592
It's all right here, and they're
gonna love it when they see it.

510
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:58,657
What they'll want to know
from you, Louis...

511
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,552
is how you're going
to teach this to 1,200 kids.

512
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:05,748
Meanwhile, if there's anything more I can
do for you and the class, just name it.

513
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:07,707
Uh, well, sir,
now that you mention it...

514
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:09,306
I was kind of thinking
about a field trip.

515
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:40,423
We got a flat tire, or what?
- Mr. Stevens?

516
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:42,863
Where you going, man?

517
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:45,060
- This is it!
- Hey, Mr. Stevens.

518
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:48,059
How are you so sure
that this is the place?

519
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:50,981
- Maybe it's me, but you can't see shit out here.
- Trust me.

520
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:54,303
- Oh, yeah, trust you.
- Now, come on. Everybody, out. let's go.

521
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:56,705
Out? What for? I thought
we were sleeping on the bus.

522
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:59,829
Eie, you ever try
to set up a tent inside a bus?

523
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:03,030
- He never tried to set up a tent, period.
- Yeah, what are we, injuns?

524
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,353
Here I thought you're supposed to be
the 12 baest kids in Miami, huh?

525
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:08,513
This don't look like
no Miami I ever seen.

526
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:10,916
This looks
like snakes and alligators, man.

527
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:13,037
- like Frey Krueger be livin, here.
- Dianna.

528
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:15,319
Louis, it's so late.
Wouldn't a hotel be a better idea?

529
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,281
Whoo, Mr. Stevens.
You and the prettiest teacher in school!

530
00:50:19,323 --> 00:50:21,443
- Hotel room?
- Eie!

531
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:24,045
All right.
You wanna stay on the bus?

532
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:27,568
Sleep on the bus. I like the beach.
I will sleep on the beach!

533
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:30,130
Screw it, guys.
I’m goin, with him.

534
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,374
Forget it.
Shut the door!

535
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:39,296
- Shut the door.
- Shut the door. Shut the door!

536
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:51,189
Wow. look at this place.

537
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:43,786
All right! All right, Donovan!

538
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,514
Yeah!

539
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:59,677
Yeah, Orlando!

540
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:03,561
look out!

541
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:13,407
- Oh!
- Ouch!

542
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:17,571
One more time. Please. Okay.

543
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:19,572
Come on, guys.

544
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:31,540
Hey, Mr. Stevens.
When do we eat, 'cause I'm starvin'?

545
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:33,742
Eie, put up the tent.

546
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:45,550
So where's your partner?

547
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:47,953
If you're looking for
Mr. last of the Mohicans...

548
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:49,874
he's over there.

549
00:54:01,762 --> 00:54:04,004
I was supposed to be
working this weekend.

550
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,847
- For your cousin?
- Yeah.

551
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,610
Stripping cars.

552
00:54:12,812 --> 00:54:14,732
It's good money, bro.

553
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:18,815
They'll find somebody else.

554
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,856
One thing for sure,
in my neighborhood...

555
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:24,420
there's always somebody else.

556
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,701
I'd like to think you're
better than that now, Orlando.

557
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:31,023
Yeah, right.
Better for what?

558
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:32,986
Stripping cars is all I know.

559
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:35,868
Oh, and capoeira.

560
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:39,670
That's all your life
is supposed to amount to, huh?

561
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,632
Who sold you on that
load of crap, or should I guess?

562
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,793
I've got some major news
for you, man.

563
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:49,477
This world can be about as big
as you ever want it to be.

564
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:53,600
Or as small
as your own tiny, little hood.

565
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,402
I'm showing you
some choices.

566
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,006
You decide.

567
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:08,570
I'm here.

568
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:28,945
- Hi, Tanya. How you doing?
- Good.

569
00:55:42,035 --> 00:55:45,157
Back to school, gentlemen!
let's go! Hustle up!

570
00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:47,680
- You got about 10 minutes before class starts.
- Party's over.

571
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,081
Hey, look at this.

572
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:55,284
The children’s are back
from the playground.

573
00:55:57,286 --> 00:56:01,410
You had a job you were supposed to do
last night, you little piece of shit.

574
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,051
Silverio...

575
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:06,052
you're family...

576
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:10,816
and I respect you, man...
but... I'm not your slave.

577
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:17,821
Hey! Back off, man.

578
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:21,223
Hey, we got a little rebellion
going on here, huh?

579
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:25,147
You starting to talk that kind of shit
to your brother too, eh?

580
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:29,110
He ain't no brother of mine no more,
and he sure don't own me.

581
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,791
That's why you Jamaicans
are so weak.

582
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:34,193
No loyalty for the family.

583
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:36,553
I'm gonna show you something.

584
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:39,398
Hey, primo!

585
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:43,720
You got me in a bad mood already!
You, re getting in that car!

586
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,243
He's not going anywhere
except to his first class...

587
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:51,405
which starts
in about five minutes.

588
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:55,928
Hey, santo. I should've known you
were the one who started this shit.

589
00:56:57,209 --> 00:57:01,053
- Well, hello.
- Stay on the bus, Dianna.

590
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:02,773
Tell you what, santo.

591
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:06,215
You take my cousin...

592
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,217
and I'll take her.

593
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:11,978
Mr. Oliveiras,
you'd better leave now...

594
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:13,901
without your cousin.

595
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:17,944
My cousin, in case you didn't know,
is not a student of this school anymore.

596
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:20,546
He's now working
for me full-time.

597
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:23,268
Was this his decision,
or was it yours?

598
00:57:23,348 --> 00:57:25,990
You know what, santo?

599
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,792
I'm trying to be a nice guy...

600
00:57:28,832 --> 00:57:31,394
but now you're really
starting to piss me off.

601
00:57:31,473 --> 00:57:34,837
A lot of people in this town
will tell you...

602
00:57:34,877 --> 00:57:38,118
pissing me off is not
a smart thing to do.

603
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:44,324
Vamonos.

604
00:57:47,245 --> 00:57:49,446
Hey, hey!

605
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:53,251
You want to play, santo?

606
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,452
Come on. Come on.

607
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:59,374
You wanna play with me? Huh?
Come on. This time I play for keeps.

608
00:57:59,454 --> 00:58:02,057
And this time I don't play.

609
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:03,895
Come on. Come on. Huh?

610
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,249
Ha, the cops!

611
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:26,059
Well, well, well.
What do we have here? Mr. Oliveiras.

612
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:29,422
Why don't you explain why we
shouldn't run your ass in right now?

613
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,450
Something about violating
a restraining order...

614
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:33,638
not being within a hundred yards
of a school zone?

615
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:38,342
Little family emergency. I just gotta
pick up my cousin and I'm outta here.

616
00:58:38,422 --> 00:58:42,192
It's your choice, lando.
It's your life.

617
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:44,138
He's my family, mestre.

618
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:46,489
Can't go against my blood.

619
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,368
We'll work it out.
I promise.

620
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,340
Excuse me, Officer.

621
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,233
Just gotta say one more little thing
to my homey and I'm outta here.

622
00:59:00,032 --> 00:59:03,110
You want a war
with me, mestre?

623
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,664
You're gonna get one.

624
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:09,971
Have a nice day, Officer.

625
00:59:31,594 --> 00:59:34,684
I still say we shoot
the little bastard.

626
00:59:34,726 --> 00:59:36,757
Not good enough.

627
00:59:36,842 --> 00:59:40,483
These kids are starting to look up to
this guy like he's some kind of a hero.

628
00:59:40,566 --> 00:59:43,528
We need to make
an example out of him.

629
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:06,675
Hey, Teach, what's up?

630
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:10,230
Excuse me.
Can I help you gentlemen?

631
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:38,794
Hi.

632
01:00:38,878 --> 01:00:40,824
How are you?

633
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:43,743
Ooh!

634
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:47,258
Ooh!

635
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:52,038
So, where's your
capoeira mestre?

636
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,437
You give him a message.

637
01:00:56,482 --> 01:00:59,400
If he wants to take over
my territory...

638
01:00:59,485 --> 01:01:03,801
he's got to give me something...
something I want.

639
01:01:03,886 --> 01:01:07,694
- You think he's gonna give it to me?
- No.

640
01:01:07,778 --> 01:01:11,546
Then he better leave...
and never come back.

641
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:14,084
- Ooh!
- Go with your mestre. Bye!

642
01:01:14,127 --> 01:01:18,063
- Bye! Bye!
- Ciao!

643
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,860
Hey!

644
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,697
Hey!

645
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:40,320
Wonder who this
belongs to, huh?

646
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,350
He's gonna kill you for that.

647
01:01:42,436 --> 01:01:44,933
One thing is for sure, old man.

648
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:47,092
Somebody's gonna die.

649
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,627
He saw our faces.
let him turn into toast.

650
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:18,065
Adeus.

651
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:31,481
Donovan, man, look.
Mr. Kerrigan's class.

652
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:33,512
Fire!

653
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,350
Get out, get out, get out!

654
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,764
Mr. Kerrigan!

655
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:56,322
Mr. Kerrigan!
Come on, man!

656
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:00,173
Come on, man!

657
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:10,708
You all right?

658
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:16,081
- I'll be right back!
- Where you going?

659
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,367
- Just stay with him!
- You crazy?

660
01:03:18,452 --> 01:03:22,007
No!

661
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:31,868
Donovan! Get your ass
back here, man!

662
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:34,447
The whole place
is going up!

663
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:08,893
- Stop that guy!
- Louis!

664
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:15,707
Mr. Stevens,
I tried to stop him.

665
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:23,409
Forget it, buy. He’s gone.

666
01:04:45,143 --> 01:04:48,615
Lincoln High finds itself being consumed
by a bloody reign of terror...

667
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:50,728
that was unleashed
when the instructor...

668
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:54,796
of an experimental martial arts program
crossed swords with local gang members.

669
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:59,621
Today, both students and faculty members
alike are asking themselves why.

670
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:02,773
Was the death of a 17-year-old student
and the hospitalization...

671
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:06,245
of two teachers a fair price to pay
for a dubious program...

672
01:05:06,324 --> 01:05:10,032
which we now learn had no official
authorization from the city school board?

673
01:05:10,112 --> 01:05:12,625
These are just a few
of the tough questions...

674
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:15,100
that Lincoln High principal
Donald Cochran...

675
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:17,890
will be facing when he goes
before the board this afternoon.

676
01:05:21,562 --> 01:05:24,392
You, out of my office,
off of my campus!

677
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,220
If I see your face again,
so help me, I'll have you arrested!

678
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,495
Escort him to the sidewalk.
Avoid the cameras.

679
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:34,045
Mr. Cochran, the program worked.
He turned them around. You saw it...

680
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:37,556
Miss Walker! In case
you haven't figured it out yet...

681
01:05:37,635 --> 01:05:39,828
this kung fu business is over...

682
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,903
terminated, banished
from our campus...

683
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:44,855
along with this scum bucket
who brought it here in the first place!

684
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:48,085
What are you waiting for?
Get him out of my sight!

685
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:01,568
One, two, three.

686
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:04,200
One, one, two, three.

687
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:07,391
Two, one, two, three, four.

688
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:12,217
One... What’s the matter? You got a problem
keeping up with the rest of the class?

689
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:14,370
- Mr. Stevens.
- You got a hearing problem too?

690
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:16,750
Just a second, okay?

691
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:21,518
lando didn't show up today.

692
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:23,960
I don't think
he's showing up no more.

693
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:28,848
Hey, wimp. If anybody needs
this exercise, you do.

694
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:31,652
Well, Mr. Capo-whatsis.

695
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:35,577
Correct me if I’m wrong,
but I Don’t think...

696
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,581
that you are supposed to be messing
with my students anymore.

697
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,864
Okay, hotshot, let's go.

698
01:06:42,547 --> 01:06:44,549
I gotta go now.

699
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:49,397
You watch out for yourself. I hear they,
re looking for you. You know who I mean.

700
01:06:49,436 --> 01:06:52,040
Come on, come on, come on.

701
01:07:22,844 --> 01:07:24,765
I ain't supposed to be here.

702
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:28,251
Guess you know that.

703
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:31,094
Yeah. I guess you ain't supposed to be
in school anymore either, huh?

704
01:07:32,456 --> 01:07:35,101
Hey, I didn't have
too much of a choice, all right?

705
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,706
- Yeah. I can see that.
- look. You gotta leave, man.

706
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:42,271
I mean, get out of Miami,
out of Florida, far away as you can go.

707
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:46,117
"Yankee, go home. "
Where have I heard that before?

708
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:48,518
This time it's no bullshit.
They're gonna kill you.

709
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,045
This time it's my home.
This time I don't leave until it's over.

710
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:06,784
So how'd you find out
where the car shop was?

711
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:10,510
- Your cousin's quite famous around here.
- So what you gonna do?

712
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,875
He's got an alibi for all that shit
that went down at the school.

713
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,999
Ain't one person in that neighborhood
gonna speak out against him.

714
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:19,724
They're either scared,
or else they think he's Robin Hood.

715
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,888
Cops can't touch him, and you're just gonna
be one more dead body if you go after him.

716
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:24,930
Yeah, like Donovan?

717
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:27,654
He was your friend, Orlando.
He was my friend.

718
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:29,738
Gonna forget about him
just like that?

719
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:34,704
Man, I just don't want
to see you ending up like him.

720
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,229
You know what Mr. Kerrigan
says in his classes?

721
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:40,712
All that crap about
only the strong survive?

722
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:42,957
Well, let me tell you
something, mestre.

723
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,519
No amount of capoeira,
no amount of Green Beret bullshit...

724
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,482
none of that gonna make you
strong enough...

725
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:49,405
to take on
an entire neighborhood by yourself.

726
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:53,011
Then he'll just keep on being
the master of the plantation.

727
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:56,295
- Is that what you want?
- Doesn't matter what I want. That's just the way it is!

728
01:08:56,335 --> 01:08:58,899
Unless we do
something about it.

729
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:34,215
Anybody know where
I can buy a hot Mercedes?

730
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:23,995
Hey! I got a message
for your boss.

731
01:14:15,895 --> 01:14:19,958
He's got no car. That means
he's still in this neighborhood.

732
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:24,765
You find me this cockroach,
and you bring it to me alive, tonight!

733
01:14:24,848 --> 01:14:28,498
We finish this war!

734
01:14:30,154 --> 01:14:33,886
Hey, where the hell have you been?
Take a look at our shop!

735
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:38,570
See what your mestre did? He's
a sworn enemy, primo, but I'm stronger.

736
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:41,843
In an hour you meet us
at Macumba Grove.

737
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:45,409
We'll find out once and for all
who really owns this neighborhood.

738
01:16:53,585 --> 01:16:57,231
Yeah.

739
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,649
Talk to me.

740
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:03,759
He's near the corner of Biscayne
and 28th. Get your men there pronto!

741
01:17:03,845 --> 01:17:06,711
And remember,
I want him alive.

742
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:10,080
We're on the way.
Make a U-turn now!

743
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:48,836
Alive!
We want him alive!

744
01:18:56,426 --> 01:18:59,728
Hey, little cockroach.

745
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:04,059
- We have a very special treat
for you tonight.

746
01:19:04,143 --> 01:19:06,451
Bring him!

747
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,886
What is this?
Some kind of joke?

748
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,415
We're here to take our teacher back,
and that ain't no joke!

749
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,042
Stop! Back off!

750
01:20:20,124 --> 01:20:22,198
Back off!

751
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:25,262
I would seriously suggest...

752
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,967
that you boys get out of the way
before somebody gets hurt.

753
01:20:29,008 --> 01:20:32,542
And you... I will deal
with you later.

754
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:37,951
Deal with me now, primo, 'cause you ain't
getting past us unless you hand him over.

755
01:20:37,993 --> 01:20:40,364
You bad shit now, huh?

756
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:42,445
I think you're right, primo.

757
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:45,940
We're gonna deal with this shit
right now, right here.

758
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:49,100
- Should we get rid of these ladies, or what?
- Yeah!

759
01:20:55,091 --> 01:20:57,259
Silverio!

760
01:20:57,345 --> 01:20:59,510
Just you and me.

761
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:01,639
This time we finish it.

762
01:21:06,018 --> 01:21:08,811
let's finish it.
let him go.

763
01:21:13,444 --> 01:21:15,986
If I win, these kids
are mine again.

764
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:19,114
If you win.

765
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:25,256
All right.

766
01:26:25,336 --> 01:26:29,151
Is somebody gonna start talking, or are
we all gonna take a ride downtown?

767
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:33,747
Hey, you're that guy
from Lincoln High School, aren't you?

768
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:36,583
Yes, sir.

769
01:26:41,549 --> 01:26:45,469
- Who that?
- His name's Silverio Oliveiras.

770
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:52,056
He’s my cousin. He’s the guy
who started the fire at the school.

771
01:26:54,099 --> 01:26:56,352
He killed my friend Donovan.

772
01:26:57,855 --> 01:27:01,942
Are you willing to swear
to that in a court of law?

773
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,528
- That's right, sir.
- And you, re fully aware...

774
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:06,863
of this man's reputation
for intimidating witnesses?

775
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:09,907
That shit's over, man.

776
01:27:10,408 --> 01:27:13,286
He don't own
this neighborhood no more.

777
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:24,967
Congratulations.

778
01:27:25,047 --> 01:27:27,435

Hey, thanks.

781
