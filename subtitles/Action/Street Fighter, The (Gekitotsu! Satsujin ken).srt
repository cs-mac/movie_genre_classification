1
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:29,959
Got that?

2
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:43,834
Oh, Ryu! Good morning.

3
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,792
Ryu!

4
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,834
You're looking strong today.

5
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,667
Is that because you
brought your girlfriend?

6
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,209
Ryu!

7
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:22,626
I'm writing you a song. Wait a bit longer.

8
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,626
Oh, it's just the stupid foreigner.

9
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,667
If you're a man, show <i>me</i> the evidence.

10
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,792
No? Try not to worry about it!

11
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,334
Good, Ryu.

12
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,126
Your techniques are getting stronger.

13
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,959
Let's <i>leave</i> it <i>there for today.</i>

14
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,792
It looks like they've arrived.

15
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,917
How are you?

16
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,042
Ryu!

17
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,959
What are you doing?

18
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,209
Naughty boy-

19
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,917
Master Goken.

20
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:48,584
<i>Master, we are ready.</i>

21
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,584
<i>Well...</i>

22
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,001
<i>Hello, Master. Hello.</i>

23
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,626
Master, what is this place?

24
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:52,251
This is where I came from.

25
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,251
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

26
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,292
Fire? Fire?

27
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,751
Where?

28
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,251
Master,

29
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,167
how did Gotetsu die?

30
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:07,001
The death of a warrior... in combat.

31
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,834
By knowing where we have come from,

32
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,417
we can better shape where we are going.

33
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:29,001
You both now hold the torch
that Soke Gotetsu once carried.

34
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,709
Pay your respects to him.

35
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,376
Master Goken?

36
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,417
Are you there?

37
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,292
Goken?

38
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:35,667
Satsui no Hado...

39
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,001
Gotetsu.

40
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,876
Ansatsuken [Assassin's Fist] style,
teaches three principal special techniques

41
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:22,001
<i>to generate Hado, with devastating effect.</i>

42
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,334
Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku,

43
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,084
Shoryuken,

44
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:30,334
and Hadoken!

45
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,417
<i>Musha ShU9Y°?</i>

46
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,167
The most deadly Ansatsuken techniques

47
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,001
can only be achieved by
embracing Satsui no Hado

48
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,084
and focusing it upon your opponent,

49
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,834
through your mind,
body, Ki, and technique.

50
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,334
So that you not only strike your target,

51
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,001
but aim to obliterate it!

52
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,209
Understood Goken?

53
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,334
Yes!

54
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,126
Understand Goki?

55
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,334
Yes.

56
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,584
Then begin!

57
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,751
From now on, when you fight,
put aside friendship,

58
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,751
you must see only an adversary,
who must be overcome.

59
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,542
Understood?

60
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,042
Understood?!

61
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,376
Yes.

62
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,792
Follow me!

63
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,417
<i>Now...</i>

64
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,834
<i>Face one another'.!</i>

65
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,501
Fight!

66
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:45,667
Stop!

67
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,001
Your fighting spirits are strong,

68
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:21,042
your techniques fierce!

69
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,834
I encourage ferocious attack
and belligerent defense.

70
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:29,626
These are the cornerstones of Ansatsuken.

71
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,501
Stop!

72
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:39,167
You may well be worthy of
the title "warrior" one day.

73
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,376
Yes.

74
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:47,876
You are still beginners in the Ansatsuken
killing techniques of Satsui no Hado.

75
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:51,376
You are both forbidden to practice
this without my permission.

76
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,084
The consequences could be grave.

77
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,626
I'm sure we can handle it.

78
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,042
Then you'll handle being dead!

79
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:02,751
Betray me at your own risk.

80
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,376
Yes.

81
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,917
Master.

82
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:11,959
My own brother,
my last surviving Ansatsuken rival,

83
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:16,459
lost his mind; Driven mad
by abuse of Satsui no Hado.

84
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,876
No one knows if he's dead or alive.

85
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:25,834
It is important that you purge
your Ki of Satsui no Hado after use.

86
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:30,334
Through your meditation you must
cleanse your minds and bodies.

87
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,167
Understood?

88
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,834
<i>Y es. Y es.</i>

89
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:42,501
Look to the In-Yo.

90
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:00,709
Stop!

91
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:05,626
Focus, be calm.
Will your Ki to surge into your fists.

92
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,376
Begin.

93
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,376
You are rushing, Ken.

94
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,664
"Power of Nothingness" cannot be forced
into release by anger and frustration.

95
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,167
Quite the opposite.

96
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:35,334
Ken! 50 push-ups now!

97
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,709
Yes, Master.

98
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,501
Good Ryu, you are close.

99
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,084
Drive your Ki into your hands. Try this...

100
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,278
This allows me to
concentrate the Ki flow

101
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,876
into my hands before
stepping into stance...

102
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,292
<i>You see'?</i>

103
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,584
Amazing!

104
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,959
Come on.

105
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:19,292
I felt it!

106
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,209
You are on the right path.

107
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,876
Well done, man...

108
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:26,376
Ken, would you like me
to show you the Kata?

109
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:50,376
Inside now!

110
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,542
Close the door!

111
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:13,792
You would be unwise to lie to me.

112
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:20,834
Okay then, let's talk
about Satsui no Hado.

113
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,126
Means nothing to me.

114
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:26,042
Who's lying now?

115
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:28,917
You can go.

116
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,584
Goki.

117
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,417
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,459
You know we are forbidden
to look over Master's scrolls!

119
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,251
What if he catches you?

120
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:13,334
<i>Let him...</i>

121
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,376
I don't care.

122
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:18,126
What the hell is up with you lately?

123
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,792
Stop now,

124
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:23,209
or I will come over there
and you will be sorry.

125
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,251
Interesting...

126
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,459
<i>I'd love to see you try!</i>

127
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,584
Thought so.

128
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,042
I won't wait any longer.

129
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:41,584
Why shouldn't we learn all there
is to know about Satsui no Hado?

130
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,417
Do you really think Master won't find out?

131
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,876
Just look at you, Goki!

132
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,584
You can't control it anymore.

133
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,584
You hold back if you want to,

134
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,876
but I intend to reach my full potential!

135
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:59,459
You'd be foolish to stand in my way.

136
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,542
Uncle!

137
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,626
Killing blow.

138
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,001
Again.

139
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:59,459
Summon your own Ki, like an army,
to unleash hell and destruction!

140
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,042
Goodnight, Master.

141
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,126
Goodnight.

142
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:56,459
Stop!

143
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:37,126
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing here?

144
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,292
Did you come to fight?

145
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:49,126
Hmmmmm... I know a fighter when I see one,

146
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,001
but you're just spectating.

147
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:53,209
1000 yen each.

148
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,542
5000 yen each to fight.

149
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,792
We just want to watch.

150
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:35,042
What are you doing? Don't worry.

151
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,792
One, two, three.

152
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,376
Disgusting!

153
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,667
Stupid foreigner!

154
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:52,667
You're underage, you're underage.

155
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:55,501
Stupid foreigner!

156
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:35,501
Good morning, Master.

157
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,001
Good morning.

158
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,167
Looks like you had a rough night.

159
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,751
Yes.

160
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,917
Master, why is Ken's father really here?

161
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,584
He wants his son to come home.

162
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,376
Is Ken leaving?

163
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:51,792
That is for Ken to decide.

164
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,209
Oh no, not again...

165
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,501
What are you doing?

166
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,001
Yes.

167
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:29,876
<i>I'm done...</i>

168
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:38,709
"Metsu" [Destruction]

169
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:02,834
Begin!

170
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,001
Stop!

171
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,417
Uncle!

172
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,584
Goken, no!

173
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:08,959
Stop it.

174
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:26,209
Goki! In the Dojo now!

175
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:42,584
Kneel.

176
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:51,459
Was your intention to kill your brother?

177
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:54,834
You have become
undisciplined and insubordinate.

178
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:58,834
Those traits have no place in this Dojo.

179
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,959
You will apologize to your brother.

180
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,376
What am I apologizing for?

181
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:09,292
"To achieve one's true potential,"

182
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,292
one must bring everything to the fight

183
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,667
"and not hold back under any circumstance."

184
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,876
Is this not the true
teachings of Ansatsuken?

185
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:19,501
You have betrayed me.

186
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,709
You read the scrolls?

187
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:23,834
Am I not allowed?

188
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,292
<i>Goki...</i>

189
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:30,167
Do not test my mercy.

190
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,209
Please calm down.

191
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:36,209
You're scaring me!

192
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:40,001
He doesn't know what he is messing with.

193
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:43,334
Satsui no Hado?

194
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,084
He can't control it.

195
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,167
It's poisoning him.

196
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:49,501
It is too dangerous.

197
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:51,917
It will be okay.
Uncle just wants to talk to him...

198
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,542
No!

199
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:55,751
You just don't get it, do you?

200
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:03,959
Something must be done,
I'm going to intervene.

201
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,584
Are you mad?

202
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,667
What are you able to do?

203
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:10,084
Go to your room and stay there
until this is resolved.

204
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:11,876
You fool!

205
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:18,542
I can't sit around and do nothing but
watch while this family falls apart.

206
00:52:22,126 --> 00:52:25,751
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

207
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:29,834
If something happens to
Goki, I can't ignore it.

208
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:32,584
I think you've done quite enough for him.

209
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,084
What's that supposed to mean?

210
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:36,667
Goken, join us.

211
00:52:36,876 --> 00:52:38,959
Enough talk.

212
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,834
Go to your room.

213
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:05,334
Goki.

214
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:07,917
<i>Will you leave here?</i>

215
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:14,751
Once you decide, there is no turning back!

216
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,917
Understood?

217
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,876
<i>Master...</i>

218
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:21,626
Brother...

219
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,584
I'm sorry...

220
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,667
This is the end for you
and me as we know it.

221
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,834
Goki.

222
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,417
What do you mean?

223
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:39,084
You are my brother,
my only flesh and blood,

224
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:41,751
<i>but also my greatest adversary.</i>

225
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:48,584
Since we began learning Ansatsuken,
we unknowingly became part of a legacy.

226
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,167
I know now...

227
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,876
that our destinies are defined by it.

228
00:53:58,084 --> 00:53:59,964
Master is trying to protect
you from the truth.

229
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:01,376
Be quiet!

230
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:05,251
A truth he knows is inevitable.

231
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:08,751
There can only ever be one true living
Master of Ansatsuken at any one time.

232
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:09,959
Silence!

233
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:13,626
Master is old, he will soon be gone,
leaving just you and me.

234
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,126
Sooner or later, brother
or not, we will have to...

235
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:18,042
Stop!

236
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:20,042
That's enough!

237
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:22,459
You have chosen your own path.

238
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:27,667
Before the sun sets, gather your
belongings and leave this place.

239
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,376
For if you return,

240
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:31,501
it will not be as a student or family,

241
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:35,251
but as an enemy!

242
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:37,001
Understood?!

243
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:43,626
I understand.

244
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:48,251
I thank you for raising me as your own,

245
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:51,084
and for taking me this far in my training.

246
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:54,584
I am honored that you
chose me as your student.

247
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,792
It has not been in vain.

248
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,917
One day I will make you proud.

249
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:05,876
Until we meet again...

250
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:09,792
<i>in</i> this life... or the next.

251
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,626
<i>Master, please wait.</i>

252
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:40,667
Is there no other way?

253
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:43,751
It is decided.

254
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:45,209
<i>But...</i>

255
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,584
Goki?

256
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:02,209
<i>Say aka.</i>

257
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,584
What are you doing here?

258
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:07,459
What has Goki done to you?

259
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,542
Where is he?

260
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:11,917
How could things get to this point?

261
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,501
He is your brother...

262
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:18,584
How could you let this happen?

263
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,376
It was not my fault.

264
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:23,292
The stubborn fool has done this himself.

265
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,917
Master has made his decision.

266
00:56:31,334 --> 00:56:34,001
You'll find Goki outside.

267
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:40,959
Goki!

268
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:45,292
What did you say to Sayaka?

269
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,667
I merely told her the truth.

270
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:49,834
Our destinies are set,

271
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:52,584
and it's now time for me to leave.

272
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:56,709
Sooner or later you are going
to have to face the same truth.

273
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:57,917
A time will come when...

274
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:01,209
Goki, stop! Just shut up! That's enough.

275
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:05,876
Master is right, Satsui no Hado
is clouding your judgment!

276
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,626
You can't think straight. You are sick.

277
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:14,042
Despite what Master says,
and what you have done here today,

278
00:57:14,251 --> 00:57:17,417
you are still my brother,

279
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:22,667
and I don't want you to go.

280
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:25,376
Let me help you and I will
beg Master to reconsider.

281
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:31,709
Goken, come back into the Dojo.

282
00:57:31,917 --> 00:57:33,667
<i>Goki...</i>

283
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,709
<i>is</i> leaving now.

284
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,417
Now!

285
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:43,626
I guess this is it then.

286
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:45,501
Yes.

287
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:49,376
Until the day our paths
are destined to cross again.

288
00:57:49,584 --> 00:57:51,292
Goodbye, Goken.

289
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:55,334
Train hard and stay strong.

290
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:38,292
The perfect Hado technique ultimately
requires two opposite components.

291
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:42,042
First, to generate stable
Hado in an instant,

292
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:46,584
you must use the "Power of Nothingness."

293
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:52,084
But to deliver it with power and accuracy,

294
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:57,876
requires intense aggression and
the desire to overcome and destroy.

295
00:58:58,084 --> 00:58:59,084
Understand?

296
00:58:59,209 --> 00:59:00,417
Yes.

297
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:04,959
Begin!

298
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,667
Good, Ken. Concentrate.

299
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,917
Ryu, don't let him beat you. Answer back.

300
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:54,584
Strive for Shinku. [True void]
I know it is within you.

301
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:10,501
Ryu, throw it!

302
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:29,376
He has returned.

303
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:43,292
Are you lost, stranger?

304
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,917
No more lost than you are.

305
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:49,584
Who are you?

306
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:51,709
Are you from the monastery?

307
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:56,251
I am not important...

308
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,126
<i>but he might be...</i>

309
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:07,667
This little one I found
wandering in the woods.

310
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:10,167
<i>My duty here is done.</i>

311
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:14,251
He goes with you now.

312
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:29,626
Hello, my child. What is your name?

313
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:33,084
It will take more than that, my friend.

314
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:37,084
If he has a voice, I couldn't find it.
In time maybe you will...

315
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:51,459
I know why you don't speak.

316
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:57,251
You keep your emotions locked deep inside,
so no one can hurt you again.

317
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:04,459
In time, I will teach you to
open up, and free your Ki.

318
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,084
There is a strength deep within you,

319
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:08,876
I have felt it.

320
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:11,584
Your Ki is powerful,

321
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,917
rising like a dragon. [Ryu]

322
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,542
Ryu.

323
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:21,126
Ryu! Be strong...

324
01:03:22,626 --> 01:03:24,959
Be strong.

325
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,876
Shit... Ken!

326
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:42,417
What happened?

327
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:44,834
My <i>Hadoken...</i>

328
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:50,376
His Ki flow is disrupted.

329
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,167
Get going!

330
01:06:21,751 --> 01:06:25,959
I knew one day you would
come for the old man.

331
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:30,376
I have long awaited this moment.

332
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,834
I came here for Master...

333
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,959
<i>not you.</i>

334
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:39,459
His time ended when I sent him to Hell.

335
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,584
Embrace your destiny.

336
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:45,167
<i>I already have.</i>

337
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,584
Then face me!

338
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,751
My path is different to yours.

339
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:56,376
I do not wish to fight you.

340
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:59,709
I walk my own path.

341
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:03,667
There can be only one Ansatsuken Master.

342
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,459
I once believed that killing you

343
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:12,501
would bring me <i>peace</i> from the
anguish you brought on this house,

344
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:14,917
but I realized long ago,

345
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:18,417
that the path you walk, the path of murder,

346
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:22,376
<i>can never lead to peace and enlightenment.</i>

347
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:26,001
You have no choice in your true destiny.

348
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:29,584
You are wrong! There is always choice.

349
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:35,376
I took an oath to never
again use Satsui no Hado.

350
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:40,001
If you want the title of
Ansatsuken Master, then have it.

351
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:42,126
I will not fight you.

352
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:45,792
Pitiful.

353
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,292
Get on your knees and
swear your subservience,

354
01:07:49,501 --> 01:07:51,417
then I will spare you,

355
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:56,042
or else prepare to join
the old man in Hell!

356
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,751
No! Stay where you are!

357
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:01,667
Master?

358
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:06,792
Stop!

359
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,209
<i>You dare deceive me'?</i>

360
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:14,959
First, I will put your cubs down.

361
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:18,334
They are not your concern.

362
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:19,917
Fine.

363
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:22,001
I will fight you,

364
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:25,667
but today is not that day.

365
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:28,542
<i>Now leave this place!</i>

366
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,167
When the time is perfect, you will know.

367
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:38,126
Well then, I shall be waiting.

368
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:50,042
Goken, the day we next meet
will be the last for one of us.

369
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,417
I promise you.

370
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:59,209
That writing on his back...
Master, who was that?

371
01:09:05,917 --> 01:09:09,417
"On the field of battle,
there is no friend or foe,"

372
01:09:09,626 --> 01:09:12,334
no room for compassion,

373
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:16,792
"merely an opponent before
you who must be destroyed."

374
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:21,917
Such is the essence of Ansatsuken.

375
01:09:22,126 --> 01:09:25,501
I am <i>a veteran of the last
great war of our</i> time,

376
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:29,376
what do you know of war?

377
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,917
Ansatsu ken was birthed

378
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,792
from the blood, fire,
and massacre of feudal times.

379
01:09:36,001 --> 01:09:40,042
You cannot follow its words literally.

380
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,001
You will never understand,

381
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:43,667
it is for this reason,

382
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:49,792
I kept the full contents of
the scrolls from Goken and you.

383
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:51,876
Why?

384
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:59,917
It is the only way I can
reach my full potential.

385
01:10:00,126 --> 01:10:04,626
The Shun Goku Satsu, the pinnacle of
mastery of Satsui no Hado, is not a myth!

386
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,126
Why?

387
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,251
To protect Goken and you.

388
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:19,167
Look at you.

389
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:22,417
Your body is twisted by
the power of Satsui no Hado.

390
01:10:22,626 --> 01:10:25,459
Yet you think you can
master its greatest prize?

391
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:27,126
You fool!

392
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:35,542
I thank you for raising me as your own,
and for taking me this far in my training.

393
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:38,126
I am honored that you
chose me as your student.

394
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:44,459
Goki, what is it? I heard
you all shouting in there.

395
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,626
I'm leaving.

396
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:58,376
What happened?

397
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,042
You know very well,

398
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,751
it's time for me to go.

399
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:06,376
Go where?

400
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:08,834
Don't say that.

401
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:14,542
It's okay. Talk to me.

402
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:17,209
<i>Don't...</i>

403
01:11:18,251 --> 01:11:20,959
Don't make this any harder
for me than it already is!

404
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:34,584
We both knew this day would come.

405
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:41,001
It is destiny that today's
events would unfold.

406
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:43,584
I have crossed the point of no return.

407
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:46,251
Master has given me an ultimatum,

408
01:11:46,459 --> 01:11:49,084
and I have chosen my path.

409
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:57,376
<i>Sayaka...</i>

410
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:01,376
I wish more than anything
that I could stay with you...

411
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:19,917
but this is a path I must walk alone,

412
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:22,209
the path of the true warrior,

413
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,667
the Shin Oni. [True Demon]

414
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:31,667
Yes.

415
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:11,126
Goki.

416
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:16,001
What did you say to Sayaka?

417
01:13:16,209 --> 01:13:18,292
I found her in pieces.

418
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:20,542
I merely told her the truth.

419
01:13:22,584 --> 01:13:26,751
Whatever our Master says...
Whatever you <i>do...</i>

420
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:32,042
Goki!

421
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:43,876
<i>Here.</i>

422
01:13:45,876 --> 01:13:47,876
This is for you.

423
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:51,959
Something to eat on your journey.

424
01:13:55,209 --> 01:13:56,876
Thank you.

425
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,376
You're too kind to me.

426
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:06,501
Go back to the house.

427
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:10,334
<i>You have to...</i>

428
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:12,382
before they think you are
running away with me.

429
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:13,876
<i>I know...</i>

430
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:20,459
But I have one more thing to give you.

431
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:32,876
<i>Heaven'?</i>

432
01:14:34,251 --> 01:14:37,751
It represents immortal glory.

433
01:14:37,959 --> 01:14:40,209
The person you are striving to be.

434
01:14:41,584 --> 01:14:46,084
I think it will help you see
clearly your journey's goal.

435
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:53,459
This is my parting gift to you.

436
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:00,792
Farewell, Goki...

437
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:11,209
I hope you've chosen the right path.

438
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,917
It's perfect.

439
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:08,417
The path of the Shin Oni drives me.

440
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:12,626
I shall not rest until Dark Hado is mine.

441
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:23,501
I know you don't want to hear it,

442
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:26,084
but maybe your uncle is right.

443
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,042
I miss him too,

444
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:34,084
but no one has seen or
heard anything for months.

445
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,876
So you think we should just give up?

446
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:41,001
Just forget him?

447
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,959
Even if we could find Goki,

448
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,751
when he left he had made up his mind,

449
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:47,626
he was at peace with his decision.

450
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:53,584
I still feel you should have done more.

451
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:57,209
I know you care for him. I do too...

452
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,792
but don't forget he tried to kill me!

453
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:07,584
He has chosen a path which
no one can follow him on.

454
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:11,751
We have to accept it, and move on.

455
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:32,792
This stops now.

456
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:34,584
Uncle.

457
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:38,417
What do you mean?

458
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,626
You know what.

459
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:44,501
You are hindering Goken's training.

460
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,334
How can you all be so heartless?

461
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:50,917
I'm not getting in the
way of Goken's training.

462
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:55,584
You are still enamored with Goki.

463
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:59,167
I'm just worried about Goki.

464
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:01,292
Shame on you!

465
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:04,376
You think I didn't know about you two?

466
01:21:04,584 --> 01:21:09,417
What matters now is helping Goken.

467
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:13,584
Thinking about Goki ends now!

468
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:17,251
Think of him as dead.

469
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:18,209
Understand?

470
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:20,209
Yes.

471
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:36,501
It is time.

472
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:11,042
Goki was corrupted by Satsui no Hado.

473
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:14,126
I'm not sure whether
the ends justify the means.

474
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:16,667
The risk seems too high a price.

475
01:22:16,876 --> 01:22:21,459
Is there not any other
way to manifest Hado?

476
01:22:25,834 --> 01:22:30,584
Am I not living proof that one can
balance the darkness with light?

477
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:33,626
A master's teachings are
not to be followed blindly.

478
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,876
Ideas evolve with the times.

479
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:41,459
Centuries ago Ansatsuken
was a young man's game,

480
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:47,417
<i>the greatest masters were either destroyed</i>
in <i>battle or consumed by the madness.</i>

481
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:50,667
They never lived past their 40s.

482
01:22:50,876 --> 01:22:56,667
I came to the conclusion that
to have longevity in this art...

483
01:22:56,876 --> 01:23:01,042
one must balance these extremes.

484
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:05,751
This harmony is what
the In-Yo represents to me.

485
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:11,626
For in all life there must be balance.

486
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:14,626
So you agree there must be other
avenues to explore in Hado?

487
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:21,209
You must make your own path.

488
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:23,042
Yes, Master.

489
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:02,376
Wha... what?

490
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:08,001
My <i>face...</i>

491
01:24:14,126 --> 01:24:15,834
<i>Master'.!</i>

492
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:18,876
You were right.

493
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:26,042
No, not yet.

494
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:37,792
<i>I have no choice...</i>

495
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:42,167
I must become stronger.

496
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,792
Nature provides all that I need.

497
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:46,167
For two years I have trained
in nothing but Satsui no Hado.

498
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:52,751
Strengthening my body
day by day, in preparation.

499
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:17,334
<i>I've been speaking to Master.</i>

500
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:20,459
My training under him is coming to an end.

501
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:25,251
He has advised me to go on the
<i>Musha</i> Shugyo. [Warrior's Pilgrimage]

502
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,334
You're leaving?

503
01:27:30,376 --> 01:27:34,084
Not for a while,
I still have much to learn,

504
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:35,917
and...

505
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:39,334
this is where my heart is.

506
01:27:46,834 --> 01:27:49,167
When I return, I will be
the Master of this House.

507
01:27:49,376 --> 01:27:52,542
I want you with me, Sayaka.

508
01:27:57,459 --> 01:28:01,209
What did my uncle say?

509
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:04,501
He thinks it will be good for us.

510
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:06,084
I see.

511
01:28:10,376 --> 01:28:12,834
<i>First you must take the Musha Shugyo alone,</i>

512
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:14,667
as Goki did.

513
01:28:16,126 --> 01:28:18,459
I'm not like him.

514
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:23,376
Just promise <i>me...</i>

515
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:34,209
<i>you'll come back.</i>

516
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:58,834
It represents immortal glory.

517
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:01,542
The person you are striving to be.

518
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,376
Farewell, Goki.

519
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:19,209
One day I'll make you proud.

520
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:22,001
Until we meet again...

521
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,667
In this life...

522
01:30:24,876 --> 01:30:26,834
<i>or the next.</i>

523
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:41,751
To conquer Dark Hado,

524
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:45,459
I must immerse myself in a state of
Satsui no Hado until we become one.

525
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,667
If my spirit is strong
enough, I may survive,

526
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:55,584
and if not, the process could
consume me, and be my end.

527
01:30:55,792 --> 01:30:59,417
I'll pay the price gladly.

528
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:56,001
Master?

529
01:31:57,084 --> 01:31:59,376
May I speak with you?

530
01:32:02,126 --> 01:32:04,834
Last night, I felt something strange.

531
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:07,417
I must have been dreaming...

532
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:25,001
Go on.

533
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:27,626
I think I felt Satsui no Hado.

534
01:32:29,876 --> 01:32:33,292
I prayed that this day would never come.

535
01:32:33,501 --> 01:32:38,209
Beyond the mountains, deep in the valley,

536
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:43,001
<i>I felt a great power never felt before...</i>

537
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:48,251
An explosion of Dark Hado.

538
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:52,834
That of Goki.

539
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:54,042
Are you sure?

540
01:32:54,209 --> 01:32:57,626
He hasn't been heard
from for over two years.

541
01:32:57,834 --> 01:33:01,376
Goki had ambitions of unlocking
the power of Dark Hado,

542
01:33:01,584 --> 01:33:06,334
and ultimately, the Shun Goku Satsu.

543
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:08,459
You taught us that such a thing was myth.

544
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:13,376
Unlocking it would require
such focus of Satsui no Hado

545
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:16,292
that one would become
completely consumed by it.

546
01:33:16,501 --> 01:33:19,042
No one has ever survived it.

547
01:33:20,292 --> 01:33:24,209
It may well have been the death of Goki...

548
01:33:28,126 --> 01:33:32,542
<i>or</i> the birth of something legendary.

549
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:37,001
Something more darkly powerful
than I <i>have</i> ever encountered.

550
01:33:44,084 --> 01:33:46,792
The birth of an Akuma. [Demon]

551
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,501
So what happens now?

552
01:33:53,709 --> 01:33:58,167
I don't know, but if it is an Akuma,

553
01:33:58,376 --> 01:34:00,376
he will come.

554
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:05,376
One Master must seek out
another and destroy him;

555
01:34:05,584 --> 01:34:09,001
It is the nature of Satsui no Hado.

556
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:13,251
I must face him.

557
01:34:13,459 --> 01:34:14,667
<i>Master'.!</i>

558
01:34:14,876 --> 01:34:18,542
I'll face him. Let me.

559
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:23,084
It is my destiny to face the Akuma.

560
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:26,876
I created him...

561
01:34:28,251 --> 01:34:32,292
<i>so</i> I must destroy him.

562
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,542
If I fail,

563
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:38,001
then I fear the balance I have sought
to maintain in Ansatsuken will be lost

564
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:41,292
and darkness will fall.

565
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:45,917
<i>Goken...</i>

566
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:49,209
<i>Look after Sayaka.</i>

567
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,542
Yes, Master.

568
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:59,459
You must take charge of these scrolls.

569
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:03,292
Master, I can't.

570
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:08,501
I understand your reservations
about Satsui no Hado,

571
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:10,584
but do not be na'l've.

572
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:16,292
Goki doesn't know everything
written in the scrolls.

573
01:35:16,501 --> 01:35:20,001
Should you ever have to face him,

574
01:35:20,209 --> 01:35:26,042
you will need the full
knowledge in all the scrolls.

575
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:39,376
Master,

576
01:36:39,584 --> 01:36:42,167
have you felt anything
over the past few nights?

577
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:44,834
No, nothing unusual.

578
01:36:45,042 --> 01:36:47,459
<i>So...</i>

579
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:49,959
You think <i>he...</i> didn't survive?

580
01:36:51,376 --> 01:36:53,834
Come, let us spar.

581
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,709
Let me see if I've taught you well enough

582
01:36:56,917 --> 01:36:59,542
to stand up to an old man like me.

583
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:33,001
Yes, Master.

584
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,751
Akuma.

585
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:36,751
<i>I feel your dark presence.</i>

586
01:39:38,584 --> 01:39:40,751
Come forth and show yourself.

587
01:39:53,001 --> 01:39:55,959
You survived this long.

588
01:39:56,167 --> 01:39:58,959
I see you have been hard at work.

589
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:04,834
Yes, old man,

590
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:08,209
your time is over.

591
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:10,292
This is the end.

592
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:13,417
Is that so?

593
01:40:13,626 --> 01:40:16,042
Tonight, there will be murder!

594
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:19,334
Prepare yourself!

595
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,376
Goken, what is it?

596
01:40:35,584 --> 01:40:36,667
Stay here!

597
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,584
Goken, what's going on?

598
01:40:57,209 --> 01:40:59,584
Is it Goki?

599
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:00,834
Yes.

600
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:02,376
Goken!

601
01:41:02,584 --> 01:41:03,876
<i>Master'.!</i>

602
01:42:17,751 --> 01:42:19,667
Prepare yourself.

603
01:42:20,792 --> 01:42:22,917
One instant, a thousand strikes!

604
01:42:42,251 --> 01:42:45,959
This is annihilation.

605
01:42:56,584 --> 01:43:04,584
<i>You were a great master and even through
your defeat you have taught me much...</i>

606
01:43:05,584 --> 01:43:07,959
Shin Oni.

607
01:43:13,042 --> 01:43:21,042
But now a new Master is born.

608
01:43:58,584 --> 01:43:59,751
Goki!

609
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:01,751
What have you done?

610
01:44:01,959 --> 01:44:04,417
Stop, damn you!

611
01:44:04,626 --> 01:44:06,084
Fight me!

612
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:19,959
You are not ready.

613
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:24,042
<i>Goken, stop please!</i>

614
01:45:37,001 --> 01:45:38,709
<i>Say aka'?</i>

615
01:45:49,501 --> 01:45:51,584
Let's take a walk.

616
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:58,167
Go by yourself.

617
01:46:00,167 --> 01:46:02,834
I'd rather just stay and
finish my painting.

618
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:32,501
Goken my love,

619
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:35,584
I have prepared a bag for you.

620
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:40,251
It is time you left this place and
embarked on your <i>Musha</i> Shugyo.

621
01:46:40,459 --> 01:46:44,667
No good can come of remaining here.

622
01:46:44,876 --> 01:46:48,626
I wish words could explain,

623
01:46:48,834 --> 01:46:52,501
but I can no longer be with you.

624
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:58,001
I pray that you may one day forgive me.

625
01:46:58,209 --> 01:47:02,167
Be strong.

626
01:47:02,376 --> 01:47:03,751
Goodbye.

627
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,542
<i>Say aka.</i>

628
01:47:07,751 --> 01:47:11,459
Goken, forgive me.

629
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:28,376
Masterful reversal, Ryu!

630
01:49:28,584 --> 01:49:32,709
Stupid foreigner. You can't do it,
Ryu is too strong for you.

631
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:35,084
Hey. RY”-.

632
01:49:35,292 --> 01:49:40,251
I've finished your song.
I play for you now.

633
01:49:40,459 --> 01:49:46,209
Shut up! You've been saying that
for a year, you senile old bastard!

634
01:49:46,417 --> 01:49:52,001
Shut up woman. I didn't ask
you to sing over Ryu's song.

635
01:49:52,209 --> 01:49:54,001
Right, I start.

636
01:50:05,292 --> 01:50:06,542
It's perfect.

637
01:50:28,709 --> 01:50:30,501
How was it?

638
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:33,751
Thank you. I love it.

639
01:50:33,959 --> 01:50:38,334
Do that thing, or this
thing, or this thing,

640
01:50:38,542 --> 01:50:40,167
whatever it is just do it.

641
01:50:40,376 --> 01:50:41,584
From there to there.

642
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:45,001
That's a pretty long way.
Not sure I can make it that far.

643
01:50:46,126 --> 01:50:49,251
It's too far for the stupid foreigner,
but not you, try it.

644
01:50:49,459 --> 01:50:51,709
Right, I'm watching.

645
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:54,709
Okay. Here goes!

646
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:11,292
Ah, stupid foreigner.
It's impossible for you.

647
01:51:11,501 --> 01:51:13,792
You could never do it.

648
01:51:22,084 --> 01:51:24,251
It's coming this way...

649
01:51:26,917 --> 01:51:29,459
It didn't reach.

650
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:33,584
You couldn't do it after all.

651
01:54:21,292 --> 01:54:22,709
Fine.

652
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,917
I will fight you,

653
01:54:25,126 --> 01:54:28,459
but today is not that day.

654
01:54:28,667 --> 01:54:34,167
Well then, I shall be waiting.

655
01:54:36,792 --> 01:54:41,959
The day we next meet will
be the last for one of us.

656
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:45,251
When the time is perfect, you will know.

657
01:58:37,876 --> 01:58:41,709
Always fishing...

658
01:58:41,917 --> 01:58:44,959
I don't know why.

659
01:58:45,167 --> 01:58:50,501
Ah, stupid foreigner, are you by yourself?

660
01:58:50,709 --> 01:58:52,459
Is there no one to play with you?

661
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,917
I feel sorry for you.

662
01:58:55,126 --> 01:58:59,251
Okay. Goma will play with you then.

663
01:59:01,042 --> 01:59:04,667
That won't work, I can't
lift this at all. Damn it.

664
01:59:04,876 --> 01:59:07,959
Damn you, look this way.

665
01:59:08,167 --> 01:59:09,292
What are you doing?

666
01:59:09,501 --> 01:59:11,334
Are you daydreaming?

667
01:59:11,542 --> 01:59:14,084
What are you doing? Just look this way.

668
01:59:27,209 --> 01:59:30,376
Hey! Can't you hear me?

669
01:59:30,584 --> 01:59:34,334
I said I'll play with you. Come over here.

670
01:59:42,292 --> 01:59:46,501
Help me, help me.
When did I ask you to kill me?

671
01:59:46,709 --> 01:59:49,542
You keep your Ki and
emotions locked deep inside,

672
01:59:49,751 --> 01:59:52,876
so no one can hurt you again.

673
01:59:55,001 --> 01:59:57,126
In time,

674
01:59:57,334 --> 01:59:59,542
I will teach you to open up,

675
01:59:59,751 --> 02:00:03,084
to let go and be free.

676
02:00:03,292 --> 02:00:06,709
There is a strength deep within you.

677
02:00:06,917 --> 02:00:09,001
I feel it.

678
02:00:09,209 --> 02:00:13,126
Be strong... be strong.

679
02:00:28,126 --> 02:00:28,876
Understood?

680
02:00:29,084 --> 02:00:30,084
Yes.

681
02:00:40,709 --> 02:00:44,459
He'll come at you with everything he's got.

682
02:00:44,667 --> 02:00:46,459
Time to let go of fear.

683
02:00:46,667 --> 02:00:49,376
Show him what you are truly capable of.

684
02:00:49,584 --> 02:00:51,126
Don't hesitate! Let him have it.

685
02:00:51,334 --> 02:00:52,626
Yes, Master.

686
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:55,709
Go.

687
02:04:07,834 --> 02:04:09,209
Ryu.

688
02:04:11,959 --> 02:04:13,334
Ryu!

689
02:04:30,251 --> 02:04:32,167
Satsui no Hado.

690
02:06:45,042 --> 02:06:46,459
Ryu!

691
02:07:00,042 --> 02:07:02,334
<i>Master'.!</i>

692
02:07:08,334 --> 02:07:10,417
<i>Master'.!</i>

693
02:10:47,084 --> 02:10:51,167
I appreciate what you are saying, Master...

694
02:11:20,334 --> 02:11:22,251
Did you call me?

695
02:11:37,084 --> 02:11:38,334
Resting.

696
02:13:08,334 --> 02:13:12,209
I used to see boys lining
up here each morning,

697
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:16,792
now I see men... Warriors.

698
02:13:17,001 --> 02:13:21,084
It looks like your gloves couldn't stand up
to the Hado that you both now wield,

699
02:13:21,292 --> 02:13:25,334
so it's time you inherited these.

700
02:13:27,167 --> 02:13:31,876
Traditional Ansatsuken fighting gloves,
strong enough to withstand Hado.

701
02:13:33,792 --> 02:13:36,376
Shall we?

702
02:15:18,417 --> 02:15:21,251
Senzo, thank you.

703
02:16:18,501 --> 02:16:21,751
The honor has been mine, Ryu.

704
02:16:23,292 --> 02:16:26,709
I've poured all of my knowledge
and wisdom into you.

705
02:16:28,084 --> 02:16:30,334
I love you like a son.

706
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:34,667
Be strong.

707
02:16:42,501 --> 02:16:49,292
As fast as the wind, as
quiet as the forest...

708
02:16:49,501 --> 02:16:55,334
<i>as</i> daring as fire and
immovable as the mountain.

709
02:17:36,334 --> 02:17:38,542
Senzo, let's go!

710
02:20:24,167 --> 02:20:26,167
Did they make the bus to Osaka in time?

711
02:20:26,376 --> 02:20:29,251
Yes, they are safely on their way.

712
02:20:29,459 --> 02:20:30,751
Good.

713
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:32,084
Join me.

714
02:20:40,376 --> 02:20:45,376
Senzo... I owe much to you.

715
02:20:45,584 --> 02:20:49,667
You guided me towards the Buddhist path
and helped me find <i>peace</i> at a time

716
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:52,917
when all I knew was turmoil and rage.

717
02:20:55,334 --> 02:20:59,084
You have seen more of the Ansatsuken
legacy than any person alive or dead.

718
02:21:01,292 --> 02:21:02,792
<i>Yes...</i>

719
02:21:03,001 --> 02:21:05,876
I have seen much.

720
02:21:06,084 --> 02:21:11,834
Flames ignited... flames extinguished.

721
02:21:14,084 --> 02:21:16,251
You have dutifully served
my Master's household

722
02:21:16,459 --> 02:21:18,751
as you have served mine.

723
02:21:19,542 --> 02:21:22,584
Whatever debt of honor you owed my Master

724
02:21:22,792 --> 02:21:25,376
has now been paid.

725
02:21:27,584 --> 02:21:30,501
<i>You are relieved of your services to me.</i>

726
02:21:30,709 --> 02:21:33,792
You have my eternal gratitude.

727
02:21:40,126 --> 02:21:41,917
Thank you.

728
02:21:43,792 --> 02:21:49,126
It has been an honor to serve you.

729
02:21:49,334 --> 02:21:52,584
I ask one final thing of you.

730
02:21:53,834 --> 02:21:55,709
He is close.

731
02:21:57,542 --> 02:21:58,917
Yes.

732
02:21:59,126 --> 02:22:00,751
I haven't much time.

733
02:22:02,334 --> 02:22:05,209
I entrust my journal to you.

734
02:22:09,292 --> 02:22:12,209
Whatever should happen...

735
02:22:12,417 --> 02:22:14,376
ensure that you get it to my boys.

736
02:22:18,376 --> 02:22:20,167
It shall be done.

737
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:10,042
You could no longer resist
the call of your Satsui no Hado.

738
02:23:10,251 --> 02:23:14,834
Your show of force has brought me here.

739
02:23:15,042 --> 02:23:20,042
Brother, look at you, you truly
have lost your humanity.

740
02:23:20,251 --> 02:23:23,376
Lost yourself in darkness.

741
02:23:23,584 --> 02:23:26,084
Lost?

742
02:23:26,292 --> 02:23:29,542
To transcend humanity,

743
02:23:29,751 --> 02:23:32,584
I endured every hardship and loss.

744
02:23:32,792 --> 02:23:35,376
Loss?

745
02:23:35,584 --> 02:23:40,501
You have taken from me everything
lever held dear and sacred.

746
02:23:40,709 --> 02:23:42,126
He is your brother...

747
02:23:42,334 --> 02:23:44,501
How could you let this happen?

748
02:23:44,709 --> 02:23:46,417
You're still my brother

749
02:23:46,626 --> 02:23:48,876
and I don't want you to go.

750
02:23:50,209 --> 02:23:51,626
Goki!

751
02:23:51,834 --> 02:23:53,501
What have you done?

752
02:23:54,376 --> 02:23:56,042
Stop, damn you!

753
02:23:59,751 --> 02:24:03,126
Goken, forgive me.

754
02:24:07,584 --> 02:24:11,334
I've poured all of my knowledge
and wisdom into you.

755
02:24:11,542 --> 02:24:14,501
I love you like a son.

756
02:24:14,709 --> 02:24:18,459
You know nothing of sacrifice.

757
02:24:18,667 --> 02:24:25,209
For the sake of Ansatsuken, I lost
more than you could ever comprehend.

758
02:24:26,334 --> 02:24:31,167
Before the sun sets, gather your
belongings and leave this place.

759
02:24:31,376 --> 02:24:34,251
But this is a path I must walk alone,

760
02:24:34,459 --> 02:24:36,417
the path of the true warrior,

761
02:24:36,626 --> 02:24:38,459
the Shin Oni.

762
02:24:41,584 --> 02:24:44,459
My <i>face...</i>

763
02:24:45,834 --> 02:24:51,417
Would I rather live my life never knowing,
in fear of my true potential?

764
02:24:51,626 --> 02:24:58,209
Or can I truly embrace destruction to find
out, no matter the cost and consequence?

765
02:24:58,417 --> 02:25:06,334
You cannot even comprehend what I
suffered to become Master of Masters.

766
02:27:01,167 --> 02:27:04,334
I walk in the darkness...

767
02:27:05,792 --> 02:27:11,167
even my shadow dare not follow me.

768
02:27:38,626 --> 02:27:42,584
You proved nothing killing Gotetsu!

769
02:27:42,792 --> 02:27:46,334
He died with satisfaction...

770
02:27:46,542 --> 02:27:51,209
for he had lived to witness Shin Oni.

771
02:27:51,417 --> 02:27:53,709
Shin Oni!

772
02:27:54,667 --> 02:27:58,792
His destruction was his release.

773
02:27:59,001 --> 02:28:00,834
Consumed by Satsui no Hado,

774
02:28:01,042 --> 02:28:04,417
you have succumbed to the madness
that took Sensei's brother.

775
02:28:05,709 --> 02:28:11,417
Gotetsu had it wrong, all
the old masters did.

776
02:28:11,626 --> 02:28:13,209
And they died for it.

777
02:28:13,417 --> 02:28:16,042
What are you talking about?

778
02:28:16,251 --> 02:28:21,292
They tried to become utterly
consumed by Satsui no Hado.

779
02:28:21,501 --> 02:28:24,292
And you haven't been?

780
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:31,751
No. I did the unimaginable.
I consumed Satsui no Hado.

781
02:28:46,292 --> 02:28:53,501
Are you ready to face destiny, brother?

782
02:28:53,709 --> 02:28:57,126
The brother I knew once,
and loved, died a long time ago.

783
02:28:57,334 --> 02:29:00,167
All that remains is Akuma.

784
02:29:00,376 --> 02:29:02,334
I took a vow.

785
02:29:02,542 --> 02:29:05,584
Today, I break it!
