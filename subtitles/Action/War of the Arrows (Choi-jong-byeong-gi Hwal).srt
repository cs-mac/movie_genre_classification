1
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:08,274
<i>The defeat and breakup
of the Soviet empire,</i>

2
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>culminating in the crumbling
of the Berlin Wall,</i>

3
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:14,481
<i>is one of the great events
of world history.</i>

4
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,419
<i>There were many heroes
in this battle,</i>

5
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,585
<i>but to Charlie Wilson must
go this special recognition.</i>

6
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:26,021
<i>Just 13 years ago, the Soviet
Army appeared to be invincible.</i>

7
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,026
<i>But Charlie, undeterred,</i>

8
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,195
<i>engineered
a lethal body blow</i>

9
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:34,762
<i>that weakened
the Communist empire.</i>

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,671
<i>Without Charlie,</i>

11
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:41,008
<i>history would be hugely
and sadly different.</i>

12
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,281
<i>And so,
for the first time,</i>

13
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,752
<i>a civilian is being given
our highest recognition,</i>

14
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,845
<i>that of Honored Colleague.</i>

15
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,686
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the Clandestine Services,</i>

16
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,019
<i>Congressman Charles Wilson.</i>

17
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,508
<i>It'd be like Dallas.</i>

18
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:22,576
That's right.

19
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:23,644
You know what I'm saying?

20
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:25,281
<i>Like Dallas but set
in Washington.</i>

21
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:27,155
Yeah. And you should
say it just like that.

22
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,659
When I pitch it.
You should say it just...

23
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:31,322
"Oh, this is fucking great."
You should say it just like that.

24
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,092
<i>Dallas set
in Washington D.C.</i>

25
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,531
You know, with the
intrigue and the power plays

26
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,228
and the overt
natural sex.

27
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:38,702
The glamour,
the power.

28
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,671
<i>Do you know what I'm saying?
It's fucking Dallas.</i>

29
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,968
<i>Or,
or Falcon Crest.</i>

30
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,030
Yes.

31
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,303
That's set in Washington.

32
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:45,969
Say it to Charlie
like that.

33
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:49,208
<i>The resistance fighters
disguised us as one of them.</i>

34
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:50,676
Charlie.

35
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,183
<i>It's like Dallas
but in Washington.</i>

36
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:56,448
With Crystal
in the starring role.

37
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:57,511
Yeah.

38
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,990
You tell me when to watch.
I'll make sure I'm home.

39
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,651
You don't think
I can make it happen?

40
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:03,820
I don't know anything
about how any of that works.

41
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,057
I do. You said that
you would listen to him.

42
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,292
That's why we're here.

43
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,834
Do they routinely give starring
roles on network programs

44
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:12,132
to people who haven't
acted professionally before?

45
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,434
<i>She was just on the fucking
cover of Playboy, Charlie.</i>

46
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,202
Well, I guess that's
just the same thing.

47
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,038
Would you take
this seriously, please?

48
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,340
I am taking it seriously, hon,
but can you all tell me something?

49
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,347
What is... What is Dan
Rather wearing right now?

50
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:23,973
What?
Dan Rather.

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,039
What is he wearing?

52
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,106
You're watching TV?

53
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:27,209
Why hasn't he shaved?

54
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,583
Well, who gives a damn?

55
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,987
Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me,
could you turn that up?

56
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:34,959
Could you just turn up
the volume on the TV?

57
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,494
Oh, I'm completely high.

58
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah. Okay.

59
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,358
Still, could you just
grab the remote there

60
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,731
and find
the volume button?

61
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,360
Charlie, are we
gonna do business?

62
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,531
Dan Rather is wearing a turban,
Paul. Don't you want to know why?

63
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:50,905
He's doing a thing
from India.

64
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:53,001
No, that's Afghanistan.
Got it.

65
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,774
<i>Appreciate it.
We got it... We captured it</i>

66
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,371
<i>from the Afghan, the
Afghan army. Thank you.</i>

67
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,007
<i>Does he have ammunition
for this? He has three.</i>

68
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,052
<i>But does he have ammunition?
A lot of ammunition?</i>

69
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,814
Well, he's talking
about the mujahideen.

70
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,013
<i>No, we don't,
we didn't capture any.</i>

71
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,181
Priests?

72
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:07,851
No, mujahideen means,
like, holy warriors.

73
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:08,916
Priests!

74
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:10,518
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

75
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,722
Paul.

76
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,324
<i>And he was... He is saying that,
you know, America seems to be asleep.</i>

77
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:19,428
<i>It doesn't seem to realize
that if Afghanistan goes</i>

78
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:21,564
<i>and the Russians
go over to the Gulf,</i>

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,904
<i>that in a very short time,</i>

80
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:26,274
<i>it's going to be the turn
of the United States as well.</i>

81
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,609
<i>I'm sure he knows
that in Vietnam...</i>

82
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,012
Excuse me.

83
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,450
We were just wondering
what you do for a living.

84
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,181
I'm not a police officer,
if that's what you're asking.

85
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,816
No. We just... We don't meet a lot
of guys here who both, you know,

86
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,655
know about the world
and like to party.

87
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:42,751
No.

88
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:45,490
I'm a member of the U.S.
House of Representatives.

89
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,826
I'm sorry?

90
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,366
I'm a Congressman.

91
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,901
Are you kidding?

92
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,369
No. No,
I'm absolutely serious.

93
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:56,272
I'm Charlie Wilson. I represent
the Texas Second Congressional.

94
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,639
Texas. And this
is Crystal Lee.

95
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,840
This is Paul Brown.
What are your names?

96
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:03,939
Stacey.
Stacey.

97
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,951
Kelly.
Kelly. Well, it's nice to meet you both.

98
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,184
If you are a Congressman should you
be in here with strippers and blow?

99
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:14,726
Hey, I'm not a stripper.

100
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:15,988
I am a stripper.

101
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:17,323
I'm a stripper.

102
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:19,387
Yes, see, they were
talking about themselves.

103
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:22,059
You know, you do
have a point there.

104
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:24,534
I really should get going.
A little pruney.

105
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:27,663
Look, Charlie, I need
$29,000 to make it happen.

106
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,504
And you know I can make it happen,
and you know you want in on this.

107
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:33,875
Hey, who wants to take a
ride with me to the airport?

108
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,140
Oh, me!
Paul?

109
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:36,909
Okay.

110
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,507
<i>A holy war
against the Soviets.</i>

111
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:43,043
<i>A war they say that,
if they get weapons,</i>

112
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:46,785
<i>from us or anyone else in
the free world, they will win.</i>

113
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,859
Yeah, I'm with Congressman
Charles Wilson and Crystal Lee.

114
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:54,627
I wish he wouldn't do that.
From Texas.

115
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,429
Has there ever been a
show about Washington?

116
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,867
I don't think there has.
Me, neither.

117
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:00,599
Thank you. We got the suite
another night. Comped.

118
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,436
Should I go back?
No.

119
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:03,975
You can't stay another night?
No. No.

120
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,032
Stay another night.

121
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,441
I can't.
I have a vote.

122
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:07,740
What, an important one?

123
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,781
Yes.
What is it?

124
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,441
Well, it's a
non-binding resolution

125
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:13,542
expressing the sense
of the Congress

126
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:16,679
that the Department of Defense should
continue to exercise its authority

127
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:19,087
to support the Boy Scouts of America.

128
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:20,352
Are you fucking kidding me?

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,526
Come on, Charlie,
call, raise or fold.

130
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:24,756
I want to get an answer
on this thing

131
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,819
that Crystal
and I want to do.

132
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,889
First off,
I'd appreciate it

133
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,094
if you didn't throw my name
around quite so much,

134
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,661
'cause, from time to time, I use it
myself, and I need it in good condition.

135
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,900
Second, I'm
from Lufkin, Texas.

136
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,806
I'm the son of an accountant
for a timber company.

137
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:41,745
I take home about 700 bucks
a week, and I pay alimony,

138
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:45,773
so the idea that I got $29,000
in the bank is pretty hysterical.

139
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,980
That said,
I love your idea.

140
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,987
Crys, I'll call you this week.
Okay.

141
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,113
All right.

142
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,320
Stacey, Kelly, nice to meet you
both. Are you Nevada residents?

143
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,861
Yeah.
Well, don't forget to vote.

144
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,726
Bye. We love you!
We love you!

145
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:00,856
Oh, it helps not to know me.
Oh! That is for you.

146
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,127
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

147
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,668
Bye!
Bye, Charlie.

148
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,727
I love Las Vegas!

149
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:07,362
All right, what else?

150
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,804
That Dairy Queen guy,
Larry Liddle,

151
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,341
is sitting in your office.
Hey.

152
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:11,933
Yeah, I told him
he could come in.

153
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,808
He wants to talk
to you about a creche.

154
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,847
What, a nativity scene
with baby Jesus?

155
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,076
Yeah, it's on public property,
and the city's making him move it.

156
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,708
Shit. I thought
he was just coming in

157
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:21,616
to get his picture took, you know?
Congressman.

158
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,949
Yeah?
You're exactly who I need to speak to.

159
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:24,011
You have a moment?
Sure.

160
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,886
Tip asked me to talk to you.
Okay.

161
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,823
He wanted me to talk to you
about John Murtha.

162
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,521
Go ahead.
The prosecutor's gonna go after him.

163
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,029
Well, they ain't
gonna find anything.

164
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,361
John Murtha's as clean
as my mother's kitchen floor.

165
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,832
Yeah, but Tip would
like to put you

166
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,459
on the Ethics Committee
just the same.

167
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:39,231
You're kidding.
No.

168
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,432
Well, Jesus, Donnelly,
everyone in town knows

169
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:42,838
I'm on the other side
of that issue.

170
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,001
Ethics?
Yeah!

171
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:47,978
Well, the Speaker would like to
put you on the committee anyway.

172
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:51,574
Okay. Well, if anyone asks what the
hell I'm doing on the Ethics Committee,

173
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,380
we'll just tell them I like
chasing women and drinking whiskey

174
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,580
and the Speaker felt
we were underrepresented.

175
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,316
One man, one vote.
Exactly.

176
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,755
Tip's gonna want
to return the favor.

177
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,759
Tuesday, right?
That is Tuesday, yes.

178
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,385
So if anything comes up
that you'd like me

179
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,554
to speak with him
about, please...

180
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,688
Yes.

181
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,223
Yes!

182
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,394
I'd like to be on the Board of
Directors of the Kennedy Center.

183
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:11,526
Charlie.
I'm sorry?

184
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:14,596
Turns out Congress appoints the Board
of Directors of the Kennedy Center.

185
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:18,609
It's a great place to take a date,
and I can never afford the tickets.

186
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,542
Consider it done.
Excellent.

187
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:22,571
Go vote.

188
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,617
Another few minutes. Let's
see what's on the wires.

189
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:28,380
Why can't you wait for
newspapers like everybody else?

190
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,718
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

191
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,349
And it makes me one day smarter
than you, which I enjoy as well.

192
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:34,915
I know you do.

193
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,461
You don't think
that's a little crazy?

194
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,689
Pan Am and Eastern
are lowering their fares.

195
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,629
'Cause of Braniff.
What's a little crazy?

196
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,132
Joining the Board
of the Kennedy Center

197
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,135
so you can get free tickets
to the Royal Ballet of...

198
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,295
Hold on.
What?

199
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,100
AP story out of Kabul.

200
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,537
Uzbekistan?

201
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,140
Afghanistan.

202
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:54,401
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

203
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,345
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

204
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,343
Jim Van Wagenen's our
point man on black approps

205
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,785
for the Defense
Subcommittee?

206
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:03,913
Yeah.

207
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:06,219
Have him come to my office
as soon as possible.

208
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,758
How am I voting on this?
Yes.

209
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:08,986
You sure?
Yes.

210
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,551
The Boy Scouts?

211
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,223
Jim Van Wagenen. Get him
and show him that wire story.

212
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,129
Yes, sir.
You are the man I wanted to talk to.

213
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,298
The Congressman will
be here in a moment.

214
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,065
He's just coming up
from a vote.

215
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,606
I'm sure it's
an important one.

216
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:22,800
No. Not really.

217
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,299
So, Marla, can you fit
this into his schedule next week?

218
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:28,106
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

219
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,340
The third...

220
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:31,645
It is? How are you?

221
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,014
Suzanne, can you
help me with this? Okay.

222
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:34,916
I'll be right back.
I'll have him do it.

223
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:35,976
Okay, bye-bye.

224
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,420
Miss?
Yes, sir?

225
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:41,755
It seems to me, looking around, that
it's almost all women working here,

226
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,227
and that they're
all very pretty.

227
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:45,452
Is that common?

228
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,623
Well,

229
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,929
Congressman Wilson,
he has an expression.

230
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:53,665
He says, "You can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits."

231
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,271
Well, that's charming.

232
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,035
Larry!
Congressman!

233
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,943
No, no, no. For $5,000 every two
years you get to call me Charlie.

234
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:04,881
And for 10,000, you can call me Betty
Sue and I'll clean out your rain gutters.

235
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,974
This is my daughter, Jane.

236
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:07,313
Well, now I remember Jane.
Two-L at SMU.

237
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:08,978
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

238
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:10,681
Welcome to the
United States Congress.

239
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:13,088
Hey, I'm gonna talk to your
daddy for a couple of seconds.

240
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,319
Larry, can we
get you a drink?

241
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:16,622
It's 10:00 in the morning.

242
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,856
Well, fair enough,
I guess.

243
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,197
Grab a seat.

244
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:24,903
Now, this situation with the
creche, I want to know all about it.

245
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,959
Well, sir,

246
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,565
Every single year
since the world was young,

247
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:35,244
the firehouse in the Nacogdoches
Township has displayed a creche.

248
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:38,750
Now, the ACLU has filed suit
against the township

249
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:42,309
for displaying a religious
symbol on public property.

250
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,548
It's Christmas time.
It's a creche.

251
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,353
I could understand if we
were in gosh-darn Scarsdale,

252
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:51,055
but this is east Texas, and I
want to know who we're offending.

253
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,961
Except two lawyers
from the ACLU.

254
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:56,467
That is a terribly interesting
and complicated question.

255
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,366
Let me make
this suggestion, though.

256
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:01,270
There's a church about
a block and a half

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,275
from that firehouse, First
Baptist Church of Nacogdoches.

258
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:07,039
They've got a beautiful
rolling lawn out there in front.

259
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,909
No, no. This is a
Christian country, Charlie,

260
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,949
founded on Christian values.
Sure.

261
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,075
We welcome other faiths
to worship as they wish,

262
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,518
but when you can't
put a nativity scene

263
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,681
in front of a firehouse at Christmas
time in Nacogdoches Township,

264
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,190
something's gone
terribly wrong.

265
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,352
Well, that's not
really true, Larry.

266
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:25,021
You could move that creche
over to that church

267
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:26,086
and everything's just fine.

268
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:27,359
That's not the point!

269
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:30,560
Okay. Why don't we just
start back at the beginning?

270
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,830
What can I do for you?

271
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,065
You can intervene in the case
against the creche committee.

272
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,333
Intervene? How?

273
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:36,931
You appointed the judge.

274
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,306
I don't appoint judges.

275
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,242
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

276
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,336
Uh-huh.

277
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,710
I think you and I both know
what that means.

278
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,715
I cannot just call up a
judge and tell him what to do.

279
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,685
Why?
Well, 'cause it's against a shitload

280
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,018
of really good laws, Gary.

281
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,852
Larry.
Larry.

282
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:57,919
I got to go talk to this guy out
here for a second. Will you excuse me?

283
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,190
By the way,
I love Jesus Christ

284
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:00,891
and his mother Mary
as much as anybody.

285
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:04,561
About 38 churches you could move
that creche to, everybody lives.

286
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:05,794
Give me a call.
Okay.

287
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,065
I love Chivas.

288
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,902
Jane, how are you?

289
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:10,601
You need a cup of coffee?

290
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:13,042
Something to drink?
Anything like that? Okay. Mmm-mmm.

291
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,908
Jim.
Congressman.

292
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,880
You see Lederer's
AP story out of Kabul?

293
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,416
Yeah. We're reading
this story every day now.

294
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:19,507
You see Dan Rather
last night?

295
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,075
Yeah. I did.

296
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:23,451
Tell me something. What is the
Defense Subcommittee's budget

297
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,649
for covert ops against the
Communists in Afghanistan?

298
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,918
All in?
All in.

299
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,584
It's 5 million.

300
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:33,358
Well, they can't shoot down
helicopters for $5 million, Jim.

301
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,833
Though they're trying to. Which
is more than I can say for us.

302
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,665
Get everybody together
for me, would you?

303
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,361
And double it.

304
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:41,872
Charlie Wilson's office.

305
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,737
Okay, I'm sorry, sir?

306
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,068
The covert ops budget.
Double it.

307
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,472
Okay.

308
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:52,176
This ain't gonna
be much longer, okay?

309
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,614
Here's what
I'm gonna do, Larry.

310
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:58,656
Charlie Wilson's office.

311
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,861
Maybe in about 20 minutes.
He's just going into a meeting.

312
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,022
Sure.

313
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:09,226
My XO wrote in a report,

314
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:13,704
I was the best officer
he ever served at sea with,

315
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:17,902
and the worst officer
he ever served in port with.

316
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,069
You can look it up.

317
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:22,739
I must've graduated
from Annapolis

318
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,339
with the second most demerits
of any midshipman

319
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,214
in the history
of the Naval Academy.

320
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,777
Well, who had the most?
I want to sleep with him.

321
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:35,190
It's hotter here in D.C.
Than in Nacogdoches,

322
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,821
so I hope you don't mind, I
took off a few of my clothes.

323
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:42,060
Well, I'm just gonna have
to live with that, Jane.

324
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>Just call me angel
of the morning, angel</i>

325
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:52,034
<i>Just touch my cheek
before you leave me</i>

326
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,943
Come on over here. I'm gonna show
you the best view in the District.

327
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,071
You want some of this?

328
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:57,308
No, no, I got this.

329
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,713
I like both.

330
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,877
Well, it must be
great being me.

331
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:02,580
I've heard it is.

332
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,782
Iwo Jima Memorial.

333
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,381
There's the Lincoln.

334
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,984
Washington. Now follow it
around to the right.

335
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,930
The Jefferson Memorial.
The Arlington Bridge.

336
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,934
And there's the Pentagon.

337
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,401
Oh, that's the Pentagon.

338
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,596
That's the Pentagon.

339
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,573
How about I show you the second
best view in the District?

340
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,701
Why, Jane, would you like...

341
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,008
Well, that was predictable.

342
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,177
Just give me one second.

343
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,320
<i>Hello?
That was an extraordinary thing</i>

344
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,878
<i>you did today.</i>

345
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:39,312
Who is this?

346
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,449
<i>It's Joanne.</i>

347
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,020
Joanne!

348
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:44,956
Why, gosh, how nice
to hear from you.

349
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,861
Could I call you back
in a little bit?

350
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,059
<i>Is Ronald Reagan in
your bedroom right now?</i>

351
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:51,193
<i>No.
Then I'm considerably more important</i>

352
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,237
<i>than whoever is.
Is anything wrong?</i>

353
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:56,035
This is gonna take
just a second or two.

354
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,638
Okay, I'm all yours.

355
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:02,979
What did I do that
was so extraordinary?

356
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,208
<i>"Double it."</i>

357
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:06,079
'Cause I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

358
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,140
What?

359
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:09,210
<i>You told Jim Van Wagenen
to double it.</i>

360
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,586
Well, shit, Joanne, I don't
know what you're talking about,

361
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,023
and if I did,
it'd be classified,

362
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:16,760
and I'd wonder where
you got your information

363
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:17,852
on the Subcommittee.

364
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,226
<i>Oh, what do you care, hon?</i>

365
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:23,028
It's a little matter of national
security and I can't help but think...

366
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,160
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

367
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:26,829
Hold on.
I am sorry,

368
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,930
but I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

369
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,440
I don't.
This isn't my girlfriend.

370
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,000
It's the sixth
wealthiest woman in Texas.

371
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,841
Which is still pretty good.

372
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,141
Okay, so, hi.

373
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:38,808
<i>A friend of mine has made a
terrific movie about the need</i>

374
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:41,011
<i>for American aid
to Afghanistan.</i>

375
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,644
<i>He's made a movie?
Yes.</i>

376
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:46,555
<i>I'm gonna run this movie Friday
night at my house at a fundraiser.</i>

377
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,855
<i>You know, you've never
been to my house, Charlie.</i>

378
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,862
You want me to come to
Houston and see a movie?

379
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,093
<i>There'll be women and wealthy
donors. See you Friday.</i>

380
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,532
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:03,932
Hey.

382
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:04,998
Mmm-mmm.

383
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,135
Hey.
Mmm-mmm.

384
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:13,742
Thank you, Joanne.

385
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:18,845
Okay. I know it was difficult for
you to come in here, hat in hand.

386
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:22,917
That's not the kind of upbringing,
I guess, is the word I'm looking for.

387
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:25,758
It's not the kind of man
you are. I understand that.

388
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:29,028
I'm not looking to humiliate
you or exact a price in any way,

389
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:31,001
so why don't you
just apologize?

390
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:33,560
We'll call it water under the dam,
and we'll go about our business.

391
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,629
Excuse me,
what the fuck?

392
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,566
What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

393
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,611
Clair George said you were
coming in here to apologize.

394
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,204
No, I'm supposed to come in here
so you could apologize to me.

395
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,044
According to whom?
Clair George.

396
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:48,086
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize to you?

397
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:51,247
Also, water goes over a dam and
under a bridge, you poncy schoolboy.

398
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,622
Clearly there's been a miscommunication
between Clair George and somebody.

399
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:55,887
Excuse me.
Yes?

400
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:57,223
Does this look all right?
It's fine.

401
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:58,387
Thank you. I can sand it down a little.

402
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:00,658
I, I don't know. I have no
fucking idea who this guy is.

403
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,462
He is here to fix the glass that you
broke the last time you were here.

404
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:06,026
Could you just excuse us for a second there?
Yes.

405
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,128
You tell me to go
fuck myself

406
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,763
and I'm supposed to
apologize? You break my window,

407
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,740
I'm supposed to apologize?
The Helsinki job was mine!

408
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:13,437
The Helsinki job was not yours. If
it was yours, you'd be in Helsinki.

409
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,945
Alan Wolfe stood in this office!
Alan Wolfe

410
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,537
is no longer the Director.
Yeah, it was on the books!

411
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:19,413
Alan Wolfe is no longer the
Director of European Operations.

412
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,849
He does not make
those appointments. I do.

413
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,614
Promises were made.
Not by me.

414
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,985
I've been with
the company for 24 years.

415
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:26,990
I was posted
in Greece for 15.

416
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,824
Papandreou wins that election if I
don't help the junta take him prisoner.

417
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,796
I've advised and armed
the Hellenic army.

418
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,798
I've neutralized
champions of Communism.

419
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,165
I've spent the past three
years learning Finnish!

420
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,204
Which should come in handy
here in Virginia!

421
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,240
And I'm never,
ever, sick at sea.

422
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:45,708
So I want to know why I'm not gonna
be your Helsinki station chief.

423
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,574
You're coarse.
Excuse me?

424
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

425
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:51,543
You don't have them.
Is that right?

426
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,641
That is right. And I don't know
why the hell I didn't fire you

427
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,810
when you broke
my fucking window!

428
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,751
Oh, yes, sure
you do, Cravely.

429
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,880
Look, Gust...
Yeah, you're fucking Roger's fiancee

430
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:00,254
and you know I know.

431
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:04,056
I'm not... I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

432
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:06,063
Yeah, yeah, you're
dignifying her in the ass

433
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,065
at the Jefferson Hotel,
room 1210.

434
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,034
But let me ask you. The
3,000 agents Turner fired

435
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:13,297
was that because they lacked
diplomatic skills as well?

436
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,236
You're referring
to Admiral Stansfield Turner?

437
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:16,365
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

438
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,376
Each and every goddamn one of them
first or second generation Americans.

439
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:21,935
Is that because they lack
the proper diplomatic skills?

440
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,481
Or did Turner not think it
was a good idea to have spies

441
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,882
who could speak the same language as
the people they're fucking spying on?

442
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:30,478
Well, I'm sorry, but you
can hardly blame the Director

443
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,547
for questioning the loyalty to America
of people that are just barely Americans

444
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,616
in the first place. Yeah,
well, I'd like to take a moment

445
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,286
to review the several ways
in which you're a douchebag.

446
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,421
Get the fuck out of my office!
Yes, sir.

447
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,794
Before I end
your career, asshole.

448
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:41,889
Yes, sir!

449
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:45,095
Yeah, my friend, I'm gonna
need you for a second.

450
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,370
God damn it!

451
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,205
My loyalty?

452
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,704
For 24 years, people have
been trying to kill me.

453
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:55,143
People who know how.

454
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:58,205
Now, do you think that's because
my dad was a Greek soda pop maker

455
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:00,683
or do you think that's
because I'm an American spy?

456
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,277
Go fuck yourself,
you fucking child.

457
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:10,826
How was I?

458
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,922
Thank you.

459
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:17,425
There's a woman in Aliquippa,
Pennsylvania, named Nitsa.

460
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:19,694
And she thinks
she's a witch.

461
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:22,171
Yeah, she offered to put
a curse on Cravely for me.

462
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,332
Yeah?

463
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:24,736
And she...

464
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,144
She asked me do I want a
professional curse or a health curse.

465
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,309
"If it's a health curse,
I can do it right away,

466
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:34,079
"but a professional curse
takes longer."

467
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:37,212
Well, I'm living proof
she's right about that.

468
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:39,584
Did you get the brownie?
Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

469
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:40,989
I got you.

470
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,258
I'm reading transcripts
of phone conversations

471
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,026
between French
and German generals

472
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,466
arguing over office space
at NATO headquarters

473
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:55,267
and analyzing wiretaps out
of Mercury Bay, New Zealand.

474
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,969
You know, historically, a
hotbed of anti-American activity.

475
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:02,841
Yeah, nobody will come
near me. I'm in the weeds.

476
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,282
You know,
a typical case officer

477
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:11,350
doesn't walk into his boss's office
and tell him to go fuck himself. Twice.

478
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:14,085
I just told you, I paid a
witch in Pennsylvania $80

479
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,855
to put a curse
on Henry Cravely for me.

480
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,623
Do I sound like a typical case officer?
No.

481
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:22,428
Well, then,
let's assume I'm not.

482
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,661
Listen. If you're really
not doing anything,

483
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,328
why don't you come upstairs
and work with us?

484
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:27,530
What are you doing?

485
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,038
Killing Russians.

486
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:34,640
<i>Our next slave girl is a Texas
rose named Ashley Rensler.</i>

487
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:39,511
<i>Ashley is prelaw at U. T.,
and her three sorority sisters</i>

488
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,644
<i>from Delta Delta Delta
will wash your car or truck</i>

489
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:45,815
<i>in special outfits they
have chosen for the occasion.</i>

490
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,384
<i>So, who wants their wheels cleaned clean
as a whistle by a 19-year-old lawyer</i>

491
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:52,623
<i>and her three friends
from Tri-Delt?</i>

492
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:56,598
<i>I have 10,000, who'll give
me 11? 11, 11, I got 11.</i>

493
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,568
<i>I got 15 right here.
Thank you very much.</i>

494
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,900
Oh, my God,
she is a Minute Woman.

495
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,769
No, she's a Tri-Delt.

496
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,573
No, she is a
Minute Woman, Charlie.

497
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:06,905
Oh. Joanne.

498
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:10,812
Yeah, she's a direct descendant
of George Washington's sister.

499
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:13,678
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

500
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,846
Former Miss Cotton Bowl. Had her
own local television talk show.

501
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,118
Look. Pakistan's Honorary
Consul to Houston, Texas.

502
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,590
How's that
for a title, huh?

503
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,822
This is an ultra-right wing
group of anti-Communist fanatics.

504
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,363
They're not
ultra-right wing.

505
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,194
What are they?

506
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,029
Well, they're
ultra-right wing.

507
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:32,501
What are you doing
hanging around this woman?

508
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,233
Did you hear me say she was
a former Miss Cotton Bowl?

509
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:37,501
You are unbelievable.

510
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:38,735
Oh, come on.
You're gonna love her.

511
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,744
And, you know, one of the things
she's trying to do over there

512
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:42,336
is liberate the women.

513
00:22:42,414 --> 00:22:45,247
And what better way than
through a slave girl auction?

514
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:46,544
Charlie.

515
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,654
So sorry for keeping
you waiting.

516
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:53,850
Oh, it's no problem,
Joanne.

517
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,415
This is Bonnie Bach.

518
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:57,290
So nice to meet you.

519
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:04,764
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mrs.
Herring. This is a wonderful party.

520
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,597
Why don't you
give us a few moments?

521
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:11,004
Yes, sir.

522
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:16,376
Oh, Bobbie, if you could ask someone
for a Bombay martini up, very dry?

523
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:18,541
Oh, I'm not a slave girl, actually.

524
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,777
I'm the Congressman's
administrative assistant.

525
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:22,183
Isn't that wonderful
for you.

526
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,481
Yes.

527
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:26,422
Two olives, please. Tell them
it's for me, they'll know.

528
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:27,822
Certainly.

529
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:31,420
She doesn't like me.

530
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:32,588
Everybody likes you.

531
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,097
She's a liberal.

532
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,928
Well, I'm a liberal.

533
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,164
Not where it counts.

534
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,000
Have you seen the house?

535
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:43,165
Well, I've seen the
downstairs, what's upstairs?

536
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,572
Fourteen bedrooms.

537
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,075
I should have a look.

538
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:47,168
What did you think
of the movie?

539
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:48,940
What, that thing
we just saw?

540
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,072
The reason
for the party, yes.

541
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:53,913
Well, I'm not an expert
in the field or anything,

542
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:56,818
but the production quality
seemed amateurish to me.

543
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:58,378
Yeah, I'm not
submitting the thing

544
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:00,686
for a Golden Globe
nomination, Charlie.

545
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:03,022
You know what
I'm talking about.

546
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:05,722
Well, as a member
of the Defense Subcommittee,

547
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:07,128
did you think
I wasn't aware

548
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,393
that the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

549
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,401
Yes, I believe
my government is aware,

550
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,960
but I was wondering if they were
thinking of doing anything about it

551
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,235
other than boycotting the Olympics,
which I think you'll agree,

552
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:18,866
was a fairly
impotent response

553
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:21,138
to the greatest national
security threat we've faced

554
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:22,611
since the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

555
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,843
Well, I don't think making more
movies about it is gonna do the trick,

556
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,509
if that's what
you're asking.

557
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:28,847
It's not.

558
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,852
Exactly how much power do you have
as a member of the Subcommittee?

559
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:34,414
Which one? I'm on two.

560
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,618
Foreign Ops.

561
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,821
Eight members and myself hand out
11 billion in foreign assistance.

562
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:41,229
And what about
the Defense Subcommittee?

563
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:42,288
Our budget is hidden.

564
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:43,732
It is also unlimited.

565
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,268
Yeah.

566
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,901
Would you like
to see my room?

567
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,132
Yeah.

568
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,268
So, unless I'm wrong, and
that would be unusual for me,

569
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:58,239
you sit at the intersection
of the State Department,

570
00:24:58,316 --> 00:25:00,284
the Pentagon and the CIA.

571
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,744
You meet in a soundproof room
underneath the Capitol,

572
00:25:03,821 --> 00:25:07,154
and you preside over a
secret and unlimited budget

573
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:10,854
for the three agencies you would
need to conduct a covert war.

574
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,556
Isn't that right?

575
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,860
I also have seats
at the Kennedy Center.

576
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:18,300
Isn't that how you were able to
double the CIA budget for black approps

577
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,803
in Afghanistan
just by saying so?

578
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:24,501
Why are you only asking me questions
you already know the answers to?

579
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:27,443
Why is Congress saying one
thing and doing nothing?

580
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:29,412
Well, tradition mostly.

581
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:37,118
Come here.

582
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:38,814
Okay.

583
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:52,030
I do not understand the
energy women have after sex.

584
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,936
You're dancing around,
you're baking a pie.

585
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,906
Charlie?
Yes, ma'am?

586
00:25:56,975 --> 00:26:00,103
Why is the CIA running
a fake war in Afghanistan?

587
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:02,169
They're doing
everything they can.

588
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:04,111
They're doing it badly.

589
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:06,715
The CIA is arming
the mujahideen.

590
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:07,978
Where do you think they're
getting their weapons?

591
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:11,385
They're arming them with
12.7 millimeter Dishukas

592
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:13,083
which would be good,

593
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,320
except the Soviets have specifically
armor-plated their Hind helicopter

594
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:19,295
to resist
a 12.7 millimeter shell.

595
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,564
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

596
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:25,330
<i>but didn't give them the
look-down-shoot-down radar.</i>

597
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:26,461
If this were a real war,

598
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,937
State would issue a white paper
outlining the Communist threat

599
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,202
the way they did
in El Salvador.

600
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:35,109
If this were a real war, there'd
be a National Bipartisan Commission

601
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,809
on Afghanistan, headed by Henry Kissinger
the way they did in Central America.

602
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:44,082
If this were a real war, Congress
would authorize $24 million

603
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:47,420
for covert operations
the way you did in Nicaragua.

604
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,817
If this were a real war...

605
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:52,927
You may be
the sexiest woman ever.

606
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:55,363
I'm not kidding.
You are Helen of Troy.

607
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:56,695
Are you patronizing me?

608
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:59,168
What do you want me
to do, Joanne?

609
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:01,328
This is what
I want you to do.

610
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:04,534
I want you to save Afghanistan
for the Afghans.

611
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:07,001
I want you to deliver
such a crushing defeat

612
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:08,807
to the Soviets
that Communism crumbles,

613
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,246
and in so doing,
end the Cold War.

614
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,407
I'll tell you,
I'd do it, too,

615
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,974
but I got this Dairy Queen
problem in Nacogdoches.

616
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:19,046
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.

617
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:21,553
What exactly
do you want me to do?

618
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:23,059
Go to Pakistan
and meet with Zia.

619
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,321
Zia?

620
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:26,559
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

621
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:28,659
He's the President
of Pakistan.

622
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,257
I've already arranged it.

623
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:33,269
You've arranged a meeting between
me and the President of Pakistan?

624
00:27:33,337 --> 00:27:34,326
Yes.

625
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:35,565
You're going
to Israel next week

626
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,471
to meet with Zvi Rafiah
about the Lavi jets.

627
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,477
I want you to tack Pakistan
on the end of your trip.

628
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:41,739
And meet
with the President?

629
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,976
Let him convince you that
it's a Christian imperative

630
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,246
to let the Afghans rid
their country of Communism.

631
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,854
Okay. It's not likely the President
of Pakistan is a Christian,

632
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:55,586
but I'm gonna do this
for you, Joanne,

633
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,390
'cause you saved my ass
once with the pro-lifers

634
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:02,695
and I owe you my seat in Congress
and because you look very good naked.

635
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,794
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

636
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:09,339
How many Jews do you have
in your district?

637
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,431
Seven.

638
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,567
But congressmen aren't
elected by voters,

639
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:14,008
they're elected
by contributors,

640
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:17,070
and mine are in, well, New
York, Florida, Hollywood,

641
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:19,639
because I'm one of
Israel's guys on the Hill.

642
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:20,945
And I don't know
how they're gonna feel

643
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:23,486
about me taking up
the cause of Muslims.

644
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,885
Well, that's
your problem.

645
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,253
Yes, it is.

646
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,482
Go fight this war
and win it, Charlie.

647
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,995
Everything possible is on the
line, including your manhood.

648
00:28:32,063 --> 00:28:34,861
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

649
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:40,027
Well, I guess it ain't
gonna be twice tonight.

650
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,629
Well, I guess
somebody can't count.

651
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:45,232
Oh, darling,
I was talking about me.

652
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,246
Congressman Charlie Wilson.

653
00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:57,303
Mr. Congressman.

654
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,042
Mr. President.

655
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:02,912
Yeah.

656
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,421
Joanne Herring speaks
very highly of you.

657
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,980
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

658
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,856
These are two
of my brightest advisors

659
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,862
when it comes to the
problem of the Soviets.

660
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,192
This is Brigadier Rashid.

661
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,258
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

662
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:18,700
Colonel Mahmood.
How do you do?

663
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,259
Pleased to meet you.

664
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,327
Please come.

665
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:22,565
Thank you.

666
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:27,845
You must be thirsty.
Can we get you a drink?

667
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:31,712
Oh, actually I'd love a glass
of ice and any kind of whiskey.

668
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:33,373
Rye, Canadian.

669
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:35,474
Uh...

670
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:39,482
I'm sorry, Congressman,
we don't have alcohol

671
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:41,787
in the Presidential Residence.

672
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:45,658
Of course, you don't.
I apologize.

673
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:48,858
Fruit juice?

674
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:52,827
Bet a lot of people
make that mistake.

675
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,329
No.

676
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:56,996
Okay.

677
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:58,132
Brigadier?

678
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:01,971
So you understand the
situation on our border?

679
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:05,912
Yes, sir, I think I do.
And I think it's terrible.

680
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:09,749
And I know I speak for all the people in
the Texas Second Congressional District

681
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,345
when I say our thoughts and
our prayers are with you.

682
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,914
All the people of the Texas
Second Congressional District,

683
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:16,357
you say?
Yes, indeed, sir.

684
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:20,454
Three million Afghan refugees are
living like poorly treated livestock.

685
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,294
Another two million
have fled into Iran.

686
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:23,833
And two million
more angry men

687
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,926
is just what the doctors ordered
for Iran, don't you think?

688
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,563
People are dying
by the tens of thousands.

689
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,699
And the ones that aren't are
crossing into Pakistan every day.

690
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,243
Would you like
to know how many?

691
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,142
One fifth of Afghanistan
now lives

692
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,806
in Pakistan's
North-West Frontier Province.

693
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,850
So, what I have
been wondering is

694
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,080
why your State Department
would send someone here

695
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:45,384
who thinks he understands the problem.

696
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:48,948
'Cause I don't think the prayers of
the Texas Second Congressional District

697
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,357
are going to turn
the trick.

698
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:53,454
Well, now, I wasn't sent here by
the State Department, Mr. President.

699
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:55,522
I was asked to come here
by our friend in Houston.

700
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,794
So this is
a courtesy call.

701
00:31:57,868 --> 00:32:01,736
I don't need courtesy. I need
airplanes, guns and money.

702
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:06,505
Well, we just doubled the
CIA budget for covert ops...

703
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:08,010
From 5 million
to 10 million.

704
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,070
That's right.
Is that a joke?

705
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,508
No.
Is that meant to be a funny joke?

706
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,573
No, sir.

707
00:32:14,652 --> 00:32:16,449
Congressman,
what they're saying is

708
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,183
$10 million from the U.S.
To fight the Russian Army

709
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,889
is such a low figure that it
can be mistaken for a joke.

710
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:27,692
I caught up to the sarcasm there, sir.
Let me be clear.

711
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,860
The United States is
eager to assist you.

712
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:31,993
No, you're not.
You're not.

713
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:33,764
Absolutely not.
I went to Oxford

714
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,135
and I know what
that word means.

715
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,436
The U.S. Is not eager
to assist us.

716
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:40,375
Well, now it's my understanding
that we offered to sell you F-16s.

717
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:41,433
You didn't want them.

718
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:43,173
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

719
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,509
So to hell with that.

720
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:47,915
And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

721
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:49,475
when it comes
to fighting the Soviets.

722
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,488
To hell with it!
You sell us the planes but not the radar.

723
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,719
You offer Afghans rifles
from the First World War

724
00:32:56,127 --> 00:32:59,426
while Soviet helicopters are
killing everything they can find,

725
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:02,125
people, animals, food supplies.
So to hell with it!

726
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,463
Yeah.
You sell the Israelis the radar,

727
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,526
so that's why he says,
"To hell with it."

728
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:08,731
Again, I understood. Yeah.

729
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:12,375
Also, the arms and funding
should flow through us.

730
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:15,469
I'm sorry?

731
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,275
That's been part
of the problem.

732
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:19,873
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

733
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,578
We have experience
with warfare of this kind.

734
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:25,588
And your CIA has an
unimpressive track record.

735
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,817
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

736
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:31,794
They missed 130,000 Soviet
soldiers walking into Afghanistan.

737
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,457
Okay, we blew that call.

738
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:36,056
I would say so.

739
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:46,105
Well, I don't want to use up
any more of your hospitality,

740
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:51,046
so I will take your message
back to my committee chairman,

741
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,913
and we will give it
our fullest attention.

742
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,245
Let me walk you
to the door.

743
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,719
I learned about you
before you came here.

744
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:07,093
I learned that you're a man
of many character flaws.

745
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,390
I am.

746
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:10,592
But I also learned that
you never promise anything

747
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,397
you cannot deliver.

748
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:14,264
No, I don't,
Mr. President.

749
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:15,828
Then promise me this.

750
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:19,000
Go to Peshawar
and see the refugee camps.

751
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:20,970
Right now. Today.

752
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,277
Go to Peshawar and see
with your own eyes.

753
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:27,178
I have a helicopter
waiting to take you.

754
00:34:28,085 --> 00:34:29,950
All right, I'll do it.

755
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,745
Thank you,
Mr. Congressman.

756
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,119
Mr. President.

757
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:40,697
All right, you,
come on.

758
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,226
How did it go?

759
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:45,563
Well, there were
three of them.

760
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:48,764
It was like getting slapped around
by a Pakistani vaudeville team.

761
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,170
You know you've pretty
much hit rock bottom

762
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,936
when you've been told you
have character flaws by a man

763
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,001
who hanged his predecessor
in a military coup.

764
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,068
Can we go home now?

765
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:58,809
No. No, we have
to make one more stop.

766
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:56,359
I've seen enough.

767
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:03,529
About 350 people in three
small villages at Kandahar.

768
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:06,599
But instead of doing
it all at once,

769
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:09,111
the Russians would
make the parents watch

770
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:11,670
as they slit the
throats of the children.

771
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:21,919
So, the Russians gathered all the
defectors and piled them like wood

772
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,187
in the center
of the village.

773
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:27,094
Then they ran over them
with their tanks.

774
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:33,598
I saw something shiny
on the ground. I thought it was a toy.

775
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:39,364
When I reached down to grab
it, it exploded in my hand.

776
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:41,676
I should have known.

777
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:46,773
Because last year my little brother
tried to pick up a piece of candy.

778
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:50,249
It split him in half.

779
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:54,617
It takes more work to take care
of a wounded child than a dead one.

780
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:57,525
So when the Russians
cover fields with toy mines,

781
00:37:57,594 --> 00:38:01,826
adults who might help with the war
effort have to take care of the children.

782
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,060
You can see yourself.

783
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:06,160
Like a bug.

784
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,069
They're beautiful.

785
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:16,174
How many children
do you have?

786
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:21,916
She had six.

787
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:27,055
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

788
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:13,362
Hi. I have Congressman Wilson here
to see the station chief, Harold Holt.

789
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,133
Down the hall.
Second door on the left.

790
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:18,366
I'll wait outside.

791
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,610
Look, normally,
a congressional delegation,

792
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:25,079
we'd give them a courtesy briefing
on the situation, but as you can see,

793
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:28,516
it's getting pretty late, we don't
have a whole lot of time anyway, so...

794
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:30,348
Well, make the time.
Huh?

795
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:33,917
Fuck your time, Harold.
I'm on Defense Appropriations.

796
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:36,858
I'm catching a plane back to
Washington in just a few minutes.

797
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:40,090
Now, I need a full
classified briefing right now.

798
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,666
Hundred and twenty thousand
Soviet troops in all.

799
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:46,725
Hundred and twenty thousand?

800
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:48,965
40th Army is garrisoned
in the cities

801
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,199
and in the airports.

802
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:52,936
Your seventh and eighth
infantry divisions are in Kabul.

803
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,774
The 18th in Mazar-e Sharif,
the fourth armored...

804
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:56,835
Anything inside?

805
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:58,006
I'm sorry?

806
00:39:58,081 --> 00:39:59,742
They controlling
anything inside?

807
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,409
Soviet advisors
have appropriated

808
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,646
the Afghan intel service
and the ministries.

809
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,153
Which ministries?

810
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,621
All of them.

811
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:11,223
Anyway, the fourth armored
covers Bagram Airbase.

812
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:12,523
Seventh Armored is...

813
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:15,394
Why ain't they shooting down
them helicopters?

814
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,694
I'm sorry?

815
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,394
The helicopters, Harold.

816
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:21,905
Why ain't we giving them something
to shoot down them helicopters?

817
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:25,464
The helicopters
are a problem.

818
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:28,708
You think?

819
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:31,845
Congressman...
They're shooting at Soviet gunships

820
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:35,612
with Enfield rifles. That's
basically what Davy Crockett used.

821
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:38,519
The Soviet Hind gunship is especially
armor plated to resist bullets.

822
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,548
Yeah, I know, I know. So you tell
me what you need to shoot them down.

823
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:43,615
What do you mean?

824
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:45,423
Tell me what you need.

825
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:47,755
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

826
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:51,699
You tell me what you need, and I
will go about getting it for you.

827
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:54,100
Congressman, I appreciate
your generosity,

828
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:59,040
but a sudden influx of money and
modern weaponry would draw attention.

829
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:02,468
What?
A sudden influx of money and modern...

830
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,571
Wait, it would
draw attention?

831
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:05,672
Yeah.

832
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:09,211
Why, I don't even know
what that means.

833
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:11,049
This is the Cold War.
Everybody knows about it.

834
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:12,179
Should I continue
with the briefing?

835
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:16,352
Have you been to these refugee
camps? Have you heard these stories?

836
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:19,623
Congressman, I am required
to give you a briefing.

837
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:21,658
Should I continue?

838
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:23,455
No. Thank you.

839
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:42,175
You know, I had a neighbor, growing
up, with a name right out of Dickens.

840
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,481
Mr. Charles Hazard.

841
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:50,020
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighborhood dogs

842
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,186
messing up his flower beds.

843
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:54,594
One day, I heard a bunch of
yelling from across the street,

844
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:56,098
so I ran on over
to Mr. Hazard's,

845
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,932
and there were about 15 grown-ups
standing around my dog, Teddy,

846
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:03,905
who was writhing on the
ground in obvious agony.

847
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,306
Blood was pouring
out of his mouth.

848
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,708
Mr. Hazard had
ground up a glass bottle

849
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:12,044
and put it in a bowl of
dog food and fed it to him.

850
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,342
What did you do?

851
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:18,980
Well, I got some gasoline and
burned down his flower beds.

852
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:21,490
But that wasn't
satisfying enough.

853
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:26,255
And then I remembered, Mr.
Hazard was an elected official.

854
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,662
He was the head
of the town council.

855
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:31,633
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

856
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:36,139
So come Election Day, I drove
over to the black section of town.

857
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:39,505
Now, these people hadn't voted
in any of these elections, so...

858
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:42,477
I was only 13,
but I had a farmer's license

859
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:45,504
and I filled up my car
with black voters

860
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:46,844
and drove them
to the polling place

861
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,248
and then waited,
then drove them on home.

862
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,253
But before they got out
of the car to vote

863
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:56,452
I said, "I don't mean to influence
you, but I think you should know

864
00:42:56,526 --> 00:43:00,121
"Mr. Charles Hazard has
intentionally killed my dog."

865
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:05,228
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

866
00:43:05,302 --> 00:43:07,896
I drove 96 of them
to the polls.

867
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,099
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

868
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:18,170
And that's the day I
fell in love with America.

869
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,515
What time do we land?

870
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:26,179
7:30 a.m. In D.C.

871
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,484
I want the CIA in my office at 10:00.

872
00:43:30,293 --> 00:43:32,818
Assistant Deputy Director
or higher.

873
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,892
Tell them that if I don't
see someone at 10:00,

874
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:40,903
I'm gonna start docking their allowance
at a rate of $1 million a minute.

875
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,366
Yes, sir.

876
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,139
And get me another
one of them, would you?

877
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:47,438
Yes, sir.

878
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:52,215
The AKs,
RPG-7 grenade launchers

879
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:55,342
and 82 millimeter mortars are
coming into Pakistan by air and sea,

880
00:43:55,585 --> 00:43:57,246
and then trucks take them
to the Afghan border.

881
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,220
Then we take them
across on mules,

882
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:00,916
which are running a little
more than we thought.

883
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:02,686
The mules?
They're 2,400 a piece,

884
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:04,727
plus we got to get them checked out.
For what?

885
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:08,060
Diseases. Foot and mouth. Plus they
have to have their ears cleaned.

886
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,497
The mules are getting better
health care than the Afghans.

887
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,866
Plus, they're gonna cost a
little extra if we want them pre-trained.

888
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:15,461
To do what?
Walk over a mountain

889
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,665
with ammunition
on their back.

890
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,071
Aren't they born
with that instinct?

891
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,837
I mean, isn't that something
they want to do naturally?

892
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:24,142
You think Afghanistan might, one day,
think about building some fucking roads?

893
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:25,977
Gust.
Yeah?

894
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,017
I got something for you.

895
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:30,384
I need you
to be specific...

896
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:32,922
The whole thing has changed.
Get your diary. I'll show you.

897
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:34,081
Okay.

898
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,259
No problem.
Thank you.

899
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:39,955
He should be here
any moment.

900
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,692
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

901
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:45,930
Good morning.
Good morning, Congressman.

902
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,629
Welcome back.
Yeah. Marla.

903
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:49,137
Welcome back.
Suzanne.

904
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:50,673
Welcome back.

905
00:44:52,008 --> 00:44:53,032
Who are you?

906
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,304
This is Gust Avrakotos.

907
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:56,140
He's come up from Langley
to bring you the information

908
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,204
that you wanted.
Bonnie!

909
00:44:58,715 --> 00:44:59,704
Yes, sir?

910
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:01,375
I said Assistant Deputy
Director or higher.

911
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,351
I know, sir. I called...
No, Assistant Deputies don't come

912
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,512
to the Hill
without a subpoena.

913
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:07,284
I'm the guy you want to talk to,
Congressman. I'm on the Afghan desk.

914
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:09,257
You're on the Afghan desk?
Yeah.

915
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:11,920
Well, I wouldn't be too proud of
that. I just got back from there.

916
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:14,327
Oh, I know.
And that's a hell of a flight, too.

917
00:45:14,397 --> 00:45:16,228
That nine hours flying time
against the jet stream.

918
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,426
Probably had to stop in Brussels,
plus the time difference.

919
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:19,833
I'd be a little grumpy
myself.

920
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:21,495
I ain't grumpy
because of the plane.

921
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,767
We want to give you this 'cause
we know you like single malt.

922
00:45:25,842 --> 00:45:27,309
It's called Talisker,

923
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,368
and it's mentioned in a
Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

924
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,277
<i>The Scotsman's Return
from Abroad.</i>

925
00:45:31,348 --> 00:45:33,213
"The king o' drinks,
as I conceive it,

926
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,774
"Talisker, Isla
or Glenlivet!"

927
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:38,343
Who are you again?
Gust Avrakotos.

928
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:41,156
Have Bonnie come
into this meeting.

929
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:42,782
Yes, sir.

930
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:45,220
What's the gift for?

931
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:48,162
It's from the Afghan desk for
doubling the budget for the mujahideen.

932
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:50,961
Oh. Well, thank you.

933
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,125
It was nothing.

934
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:55,894
Well, it's a nice
bottle of Scotch.

935
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:57,730
Must've been hard to get.

936
00:45:57,808 --> 00:45:59,571
No, doubling
the budget was nothing.

937
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:02,669
I mean, $10 million for covert ops
against the Russian Army is meaningless.

938
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:05,237
What are you, an infant?
Now, you hang on just one second.

939
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:06,304
I don't remember your name.

940
00:46:06,383 --> 00:46:07,714
Gust Avrakotos.

941
00:46:07,784 --> 00:46:08,773
Gust Avrakotos.

942
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:09,841
Yeah.

943
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,615
Okay, you mind
if I call you Gus?

944
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:14,122
Yeah, well, my name's Gust
with a "t," but I don't care.

945
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:19,629
Fifteen hours ago, I offered Harold
Holt the keys to the safe, okay?

946
00:46:20,463 --> 00:46:24,695
I stood there in the office in Islamabad,
and I said, "How much do you need?"

947
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:26,292
And I was apparently
annoying him.

948
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:29,133
Well, Harold Holt's a massive tool,
Congressman. He's a cake-eater.

949
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,901
He's a clown.
He's a bad station chief.

950
00:46:30,974 --> 00:46:34,034
And I don't mean to cast aspersions on
a guy, but he's gonna get us all killed.

951
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,270
Really?
Yeah.

952
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:38,246
Well, how does he expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...

953
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,374
He said, "A sudden influx of money..."
Yeah, an influx of money

954
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,815
and new weaponry
would draw attention.

955
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,353
He's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

956
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:45,513
What the hell
are you talking about?

957
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,888
Excuse me.

958
00:46:50,026 --> 00:46:51,721
I'm the Congressman's
aide, Bonnie Bach.

959
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:52,989
Gust Avrakotos.

960
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:54,724
Gus, I need the room
for a second.

961
00:46:54,798 --> 00:46:56,493
Sure.
Jailbait!

962
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:02,831
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
Whoa, all right.

963
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,100
Just tell me
what's happening.

964
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:06,404
A Justice Department task
force that was formed last year

965
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,671
to investigate reports of sex
between members of the House

966
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,679
and their male interns
has recently widened

967
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,544
to include the use
of recreational drugs

968
00:47:12,616 --> 00:47:14,550
by senators and congressmen.

969
00:47:14,618 --> 00:47:15,880
Do you know a man
named Paul Brown?

970
00:47:15,952 --> 00:47:17,146
He doesn't have
to answer that. Keep going.

971
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,209
Oh, shit.

972
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:22,019
Paul Brown, under investigation
by federal prosecutors for fraud.

973
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:25,694
He wanted me to invest
in some TV show for Crystal.

974
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:28,128
Well, he's saying he witnessed
you doing cocaine nine times

975
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:30,166
in a fantasy suite
in Las Vegas.

976
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:32,929
Brian Ross at NBC is
breaking the story.

977
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:37,028
All right, guys. I was in Las
Vegas with Crystal and Paul Brown,

978
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:39,405
because she wanted me to
talk to him about this thing.

979
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,137
There was cocaine?

980
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:44,304
I want you to go in the other
room and start on a statement.

981
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:45,905
Let's get Stu on the phone.
Okay, I'll call him.

982
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:47,040
Okay, Bait,
you just need to start...

983
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,106
It's all right,
everybody.

984
00:47:48,184 --> 00:47:49,708
It's gonna be all right.
I want to get back to...

985
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:50,844
Gus!

986
00:47:52,689 --> 00:47:53,747
You having problems?

987
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:56,049
No.

988
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,720
What do you mean, he's not
trying to defeat the Soviets?

989
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,423
Well, he wants to bleed them.
Payback for Vietnam.

990
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,022
Make it so they just have
to keep sending troops in,

991
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,396
keep sending money,
and troops, and money

992
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,367
until they just go out of their
fucking minds the way we did.

993
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:09,098
You mean to tell me that the
U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan

994
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:11,163
is to have the Afghans keep
walking into machine gun fire

995
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:12,401
till the Russians
run out of bullets?

996
00:48:12,475 --> 00:48:13,567
That's Harold Holt's
strategy.

997
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,543
It's not U.S. Strategy.
What is U.S. Strategy?

998
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:17,045
Well, strictly speaking,
we don't have one.

999
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:18,205
But we're working
hard on that.

1000
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:19,748
Who's we?
Me and three other guys.

1001
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:23,247
Would you excuse me?

1002
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:29,048
All right,
what do you have?

1003
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:32,356
"Representative Charles Wilson has learned
he is joining several members of Congress

1004
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:35,296
"who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task force that is..."

1005
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:36,627
Don't say task force.
It makes it sound

1006
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,962
like Eliot Ness is running the thing.
Okay.

1007
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:40,628
Who is running the thing?
Who's the prosecutor?

1008
00:48:40,704 --> 00:48:42,433
Rudolph Giuliani,
New York, Southern District.

1009
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,063
You know him?
No.

1010
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,267
Well, it's been going on
forever. We should say that, too.

1011
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:49,437
"Representative Charles Wilson has learned
he is joining several members of Congress

1012
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:51,844
"who are under investigation
by the Justice Department

1013
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:54,645
"in what is now an 18-month
long, wide-ranging examination

1014
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,618
"that has resulted
in no convictions."

1015
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:58,711
"Congressman Wilson has not
been charged with any crime,

1016
00:48:58,788 --> 00:49:00,688
"nor has he been questioned
by the authorities.

1017
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:03,487
"He denies any allegation of
illegal or improper behavior

1018
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,528
"and will fully cooperate with
the ongoing investigation."

1019
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:06,653
Okay. Run it by Stu.

1020
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,890
Yes, sir.

1021
00:49:09,632 --> 00:49:10,690
Gus!

1022
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,128
You and three other guys?
Yeah.

1023
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:20,006
Well, I'll tell you what I told
Harold Holt. I can get the money.

1024
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:23,068
Now, the 10 million is a joke?
Fine. What do you need?

1025
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:24,875
To do what?
To shoot down the helicopters.

1026
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:26,074
To shoot down
the helicopters.

1027
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:28,709
If we can help them shoot down
the goddamn helicopters,

1028
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:30,150
everything's gonna
start going our way.

1029
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,656
You know, there's a story about
a Zen master and a little boy.

1030
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,623
All right, and... Yeah.

1031
00:49:38,862 --> 00:49:39,886
It's Stu.

1032
00:49:39,963 --> 00:49:41,453
You should be on this.

1033
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,491
Stu?

1034
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:46,901
No. No,
it's gonna be fine.

1035
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,938
It was a party in Vegas.

1036
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:51,205
Lot of drugs, lot of people
I don't know.

1037
00:49:51,274 --> 00:49:54,573
I was there with Crystal Lee
and this guy Paul Brown

1038
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:57,807
who wanted me to invest
in a TV show for Crystal.

1039
00:49:58,281 --> 00:49:59,305
I don't know.

1040
00:49:59,382 --> 00:50:02,408
<i>I don't know, it's gonna be
like a Dallas set in Washington.</i>

1041
00:50:02,485 --> 00:50:04,646
What... Stu,
what does it matter?

1042
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:05,813
Okay.

1043
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:07,548
Okay.

1044
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:10,354
Will Crystal back up your
story that you weren't using?

1045
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,725
Just go put out
the statement.

1046
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,386
You know what?

1047
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:18,258
You never should have been
in the same room, Congressman.

1048
00:50:20,737 --> 00:50:21,795
Gus!

1049
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:26,564
Yeah.
The Swiss make an antiaircraft gun

1050
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:28,440
called the Oerlikon.
Listen, Charlie.

1051
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,138
Twenty-millimeter cannon,
high rate of fire.

1052
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:31,805
I know the Oerlikon.

1053
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,781
Don't forget
the limo driver.

1054
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,908
What do you mean?

1055
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:37,782
Well, you took a limo from
the casino to the airport.

1056
00:50:37,854 --> 00:50:40,550
Maybe it's easy enough to track down
a limo driver, hand him a subpoena,

1057
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:42,250
ask him if anything was
going on in the back seat,

1058
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,316
so, you know, in terms
of cleaning up this...

1059
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:45,884
Were you listening
at the door?

1060
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:47,793
I wasn't listening at the
door. Were you standing

1061
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:49,991
at the goddamn door listening to me?
No.

1062
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:52,500
How could you even...
That's a thick door!

1063
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,366
You stood there
and you listened to me?

1064
00:50:54,437 --> 00:50:55,768
I wasn't standing at the door.
Don't be an idiot.

1065
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,136
I bugged the Scotch bottle.

1066
00:50:57,207 --> 00:50:58,265
What?

1067
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:00,401
Yeah, it's got a little
transmitter on it.

1068
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:03,344
I got a little thing
in my ear. Get past it.

1069
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:06,746
I don't believe this. Who the
fuck... Who the fuck are you?

1070
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:08,545
It's not in my ear right now.
Take it easy.

1071
00:51:08,618 --> 00:51:11,018
I was gonna tell you about it, but
I had to leave the room for a second

1072
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:13,112
'cause you were getting indicted.
I ain't getting indicted.

1073
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:15,589
Is there a camera in here?
No, that's a little paranoid.

1074
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:16,818
That's right.

1075
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:19,953
Will you take the bug
off my Scotch bottle now?

1076
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,422
Sure.

1077
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:27,297
I saw two kids,
had their hands blown off

1078
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:29,433
when they tried to pick
up something shiny.

1079
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,498
Sometimes the kids think
those bombs are toys.

1080
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:34,907
For children to pick up.
Yeah.

1081
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:37,002
They're raping the women and...
Yeah.

1082
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,277
...bayoneting the pregnant ones.
It's as bad as it can be.

1083
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,444
But they still want to go out
and fight the Red Army.

1084
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,579
Each and every one of them.
I've never seen anything like that.

1085
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,247
No, me, neither.

1086
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:50,519
Let's be clear. I want to kill
Russians as much as you do.

1087
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:53,653
Is the Oerlikon the right gun?
Is that what they should have?

1088
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,459
Now, you know what?

1089
00:51:55,698 --> 00:51:56,722
You've had a long flight.

1090
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,494
You're under a lot of stress.
You're under arrest.

1091
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:00,092
I ain't under arrest.

1092
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,762
Do you drink?
Oh, God, yeah.

1093
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:03,362
Well, should we try
this Scotch,

1094
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:05,168
or is it gonna release
sarin gas when I open it?

1095
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:08,176
Oh, I don't think so,
but open it over there.

1096
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:16,207
How'd a guy like you get
into the Agency?

1097
00:52:16,286 --> 00:52:19,517
What, you mean a street guy?
You ain't James Bond.

1098
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:23,025
And you ain't Thomas Jefferson,
so let's call it even.

1099
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:24,318
Deal.

1100
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:27,553
Since there's no other reason
I should be here,

1101
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,690
let's assume it's 'cause
I'm very good at this.

1102
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:35,671
They need to shoot down
the helicopters, Gus.

1103
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:38,298
They need at least,
what, 50 Oerlikons.

1104
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:40,342
Yeah, it's gonna cost
a lot more than $10 million.

1105
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,310
And I say for the fourth time,
I can raise the money.

1106
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:43,675
Yeah, how?

1107
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,909
Is the Oerlikon the gun
I should be recommending?

1108
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,483
I'm not sure.

1109
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:51,076
Who is sure?
A weapons guy named Mike Vickers.

1110
00:52:51,154 --> 00:52:53,384
I'll call him.
Yeah. Let's call him right now.

1111
00:52:59,395 --> 00:53:01,386
All right, here's a test.

1112
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:03,626
You see the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt

1113
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,759
playing against
the four guys at once?

1114
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:06,824
Yeah.

1115
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:09,528
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons expert

1116
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,733
with the CIA?

1117
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:15,337
That was a trick question,
Charlie.

1118
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:17,879
It's the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt.

1119
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,574
All right, no reason this
can't be fun, you know.

1120
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:22,243
Mike!
Yeah, just a second.

1121
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:24,448
Need you now, Mike.

1122
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:30,025
Keep playing.

1123
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,522
Mike Vickers, this is
Congressman Charles Wilson

1124
00:53:33,596 --> 00:53:35,587
of the Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee.

1125
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:38,156
How are you, sir?
Fine, thank you.

1126
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:42,003
How old are you?
I'll be 30 next week.

1127
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:44,471
This is the CIA's weapons
expert?

1128
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:46,235
One of them.
But he's the most senior.

1129
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:47,333
Look...
Mike!

1130
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,708
Yeah, bishop to queen's
knight 7.

1131
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:51,406
See? He's playing without
even looking at the board.

1132
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,607
That's a useful skill

1133
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:55,708
if Afghanistan's ever invaded
by Boris Spassky.

1134
00:53:55,785 --> 00:53:58,083
Did my office not make it clear
to Langley that I'm in no mood

1135
00:53:58,154 --> 00:53:59,178
to be fucked around with?
Charlie...

1136
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:01,416
You answer to me or you answer
to Jim Baker. Which do you want?

1137
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:04,358
All right, the guy's a fucking Green
Beret, Charlie. He trained with the SEALs.

1138
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:06,952
No one's trying to fuck with you!
Mike?

1139
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,965
Yeah, what was your move?
Knight to queen's bishop 5.

1140
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:11,625
All right, queen to king's
rook 3.

1141
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:14,727
Guy on the right, you don't
want to trade queens with me.

1142
00:54:14,804 --> 00:54:15,896
Shit.

1143
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,730
All right, I apologize.

1144
00:54:18,808 --> 00:54:20,799
Okay.
Everybody friends?

1145
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,243
As a former naval officer myself,
Mike, I should've known better.

1146
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:26,339
As a former naval officer, I'd
have been surprised if you had.

1147
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:27,440
Now, what the fuck?
Hey.

1148
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,382
He said he was sorry.
Hey.

1149
00:54:29,452 --> 00:54:30,942
What can I do for you, sir?

1150
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,853
All right, he wants to make a
recommendation to his Subcommittee.

1151
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:36,915
Now, the Swiss made Oerlikon S.T.A.
Antiaircraft cannon, that's what you'd use

1152
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:39,484
to shoot down the Ml-24 Hind
gunship in the mountains, right?

1153
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,688
Well, the Oerlikon's
a good start,

1154
00:54:40,763 --> 00:54:43,027
but the Russians will just start
flying higher altitude missions.

1155
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:44,123
So what else do they need?

1156
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,964
Same thing you give us.
AK-47 s, AK-74s, AKMS.

1157
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:49,095
The Soviets didn't come into
Afghanistan on a Eurail Pass.

1158
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:50,662
They came in T-55 tanks.

1159
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,470
The fighters need RPG-7
anti-tank grenade launchers,

1160
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:57,946
Katyusha 107 mm rockets, wire mines,
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

1161
00:54:58,014 --> 00:54:59,447
ammunition for
all the above

1162
00:54:59,515 --> 00:55:01,278
and frequency-hopping radios
and burst transmitters

1163
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:03,979
so these guys aren't
so fucking easy to find.

1164
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:06,021
Well, I've written it all
in a report you can read.

1165
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:08,387
You'd be the first
one who did.

1166
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,857
Send a copy of it to me
by secure courier right away.

1167
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:14,158
I will. All right.
All right.

1168
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:17,965
There was a report?

1169
00:55:18,034 --> 00:55:19,296
It's not that simple.

1170
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:22,767
Why not?
Well, for one thing it's covert.

1171
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:24,466
When an Afghan freedom fighter
gets captured,

1172
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,973
it can't be with an
American-made weapon on him.

1173
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:27,942
That's how a cold war turns
into an actual war,

1174
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,944
and that's something you
want to keep a good eye on.

1175
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:32,003
So anything we give them
has to look like

1176
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:34,982
it could have plausibly been
captured from the Soviets.

1177
00:55:35,051 --> 00:55:36,746
Yeah, that's right.
You know who's good at that?

1178
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:39,151
Israel and Egypt.
That's right.

1179
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:42,190
You know what Vickers
just described back there

1180
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:44,692
could cost as much
as $40 million.

1181
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,589
I can get the appropriation.
But how?

1182
00:55:48,564 --> 00:55:50,623
I want to know how are you gonna
get the approval of Congress

1183
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,395
when they're saying no
to the Contras for nothing,

1184
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:55,130
for $5 million, a request
made by the President?

1185
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:57,263
When a black approp makes it
through this Subcommittee,

1186
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,570
the full body has
to vote on it blind.

1187
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:01,803
They know the dollar amount, but
they don't know what it's for.

1188
00:56:01,878 --> 00:56:05,905
So, theoretically, your $10
million can become 40 million

1189
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:08,007
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

1190
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:09,949
Because Congress wouldn't
know what it was voting on.

1191
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,077
That's the beauty of it!

1192
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:12,917
All you need are the nine
other Subcommittee members.

1193
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:14,513
All I really need is
the Committee Chairman.

1194
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,353
Doc Long.
Doc Long.

1195
00:56:16,692 --> 00:56:19,786
And with Doc's backing, you'll get the
votes of the other Committee members.

1196
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:20,988
Yep.
I don't believe you.

1197
00:56:21,063 --> 00:56:22,087
I don't care.

1198
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:23,427
And until the phone rang
this morning, Charlie,

1199
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:25,763
I didn't know
I'd never heard of you.

1200
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,462
Well, ask around.

1201
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:29,730
I did.
And what'd you find out?

1202
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,797
That your greatest legislative
achievement in six terms

1203
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:33,341
was getting reelected
five times.

1204
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:34,433
Anything else?

1205
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,842
That you hold more IOUs
than any member of the House.

1206
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:39,538
How about that?

1207
00:56:39,715 --> 00:56:43,344
I represent the only district in
America that doesn't want anything.

1208
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:46,354
They want their guns, they
want low taxes, that's it.

1209
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:49,220
I can do favors.
I get to vote yes a lot.

1210
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:54,624
Now, me and three other guys
are killing Russians.

1211
00:56:54,697 --> 00:56:55,959
I mean, is it possible

1212
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:59,832
that I've met the only elected
official in town who can help?

1213
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:04,036
Give me a week
to set things up.

1214
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,837
Go pack a bag.
I have a friend, an arms dealer in Israel.

1215
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:10,279
He's who we need for this,
God help us.

1216
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:12,541
Should be interesting.
Yeah.

1217
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:14,473
All right.

1218
00:57:15,785 --> 00:57:17,275
We need you, Zvi.

1219
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:19,821
You're gonna be our man
inside the Israeli Parliament.

1220
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:21,652
I'm not in the Israeli
Parliament.

1221
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:23,715
That's what's gonna
make you so effective.

1222
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:26,091
No one has your pull
with the 10th Knesset.

1223
00:57:26,162 --> 00:57:28,255
No one has your relationship
with the Speaker.

1224
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:30,561
And we are gonna...
We're gonna need your arm around Menachem,

1225
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:34,535
when he finds out that we're
working with Egypt and the Saudis.

1226
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:37,838
Tell him.
Tell him why we need him.

1227
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:40,901
I'm not saying anything.
Why not?

1228
00:57:41,244 --> 00:57:43,872
I don't know who the fuck
these two other guys are.

1229
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:46,039
Well, ain't they bodyguards?
Not ours.

1230
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:47,206
Zvi?

1231
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:54,049
Now, just to sum this
up in a nutshell.

1232
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:57,218
You want me
to move Israel

1233
00:57:57,827 --> 00:58:02,457
toward a partnership with
Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1234
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:04,159
And Saudi Arabia.

1235
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:08,861
Well, just a couple of problems I
can foresee off the top of my head.

1236
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:09,962
Look.

1237
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:11,063
Charlie...
I know.

1238
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,304
...Pakistan and Afghanistan don't
recognize our right to exist.

1239
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:19,246
Calm down.
We just got done fighting a war with Egypt

1240
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:22,648
and every person who has ever
tried to kill me and my family,

1241
00:58:22,718 --> 00:58:24,743
has been trained
in Saudi Arabia.

1242
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,050
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1243
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:29,551
I mean, some of them
were trained by us.

1244
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:31,092
Gus, come on.

1245
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:35,187
It's his sense of humor.
It's a bit of an acquired taste.

1246
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:37,289
Now, Zvi, look at me.

1247
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:40,700
This is the front
of the Cold War.

1248
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:43,739
It's not in Berlin, it's not in
Cuba, it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1249
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:46,366
It's in a pile of rocks
called Afghanistan.

1250
00:58:46,442 --> 00:58:49,036
These are the only people who are
actually shooting at the Russians.

1251
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:51,875
Now, you and I know we have
to get Soviet-made weapons

1252
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:53,313
into the hands
of the mujahideen.

1253
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:55,111
And you and I know
where the largest stockpile

1254
00:58:55,184 --> 00:58:58,085
of Soviet weapons
outside the Soviet Union is.

1255
00:58:58,154 --> 00:58:59,746
I can't tell you offhand
how many

1256
00:58:59,822 --> 00:59:02,052
and what kind of weapons
we've confiscated.

1257
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:06,458
I can. These are Keyhole-11
satellite photos.

1258
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:10,323
They've been degraded
so I can show them to you.

1259
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:12,194
All right, that's
a five-wheeled chassis tank.

1260
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:14,828
That's not the Mk.1,
that's the T-55.

1261
00:59:14,904 --> 00:59:17,873
And it and four others are
about 12 miles from here.

1262
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,204
What do you want tanks
in mountains for?

1263
00:59:20,276 --> 00:59:22,710
Oh, we don't. I just wanted
you to know I know you got them.

1264
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:26,179
$35.5 million.
Which you'll be able to appropriate.

1265
00:59:26,382 --> 00:59:27,406
Yeah.

1266
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,451
Without the press asking
questions about it.

1267
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:30,542
You know,
there's good news there,

1268
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,453
because the press is going to be
busy asking about a weekend in Vegas

1269
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:35,888
and his pending arrest on
charges of narcotics possession.

1270
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:38,984
Oh, Gus.
Shit, Charlie.

1271
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:41,120
It's nothing.
Is this true?

1272
00:59:41,197 --> 00:59:43,290
No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

1273
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:45,027
Thank you.
I was just explaining to him

1274
00:59:45,101 --> 00:59:47,228
that as long as the press sees
sex and drugs behind the left hand,

1275
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:48,998
you can park a battle carrier
behind the right hand

1276
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:50,333
and no one's gonna
fucking notice.

1277
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:51,532
What the hell happened?

1278
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:53,472
It's not germane.
It's not germane to these people

1279
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:56,978
who are fighting and dying, and
being massacred in their homes.

1280
00:59:57,046 --> 01:00:00,072
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them

1281
01:00:00,149 --> 01:00:02,049
shoot down these fucking
helicopters?

1282
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:06,817
I love you, Charlie,

1283
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:09,623
but you are a grown man

1284
01:00:09,925 --> 01:00:14,760
who still hasn't learned to look both
ways before he crosses the fucking street!

1285
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:22,736
Yes, I'm in.

1286
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,103
But I don't like this guy.
I know how you feel.

1287
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:32,647
What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.

1288
01:00:32,715 --> 01:00:35,013
This meeting's gonna be run professional?
Oh, absolutely.

1289
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:37,109
We'll be talking
to the Deputy Defense Minister

1290
01:00:37,186 --> 01:00:40,485
while his boss gets a belly
dance from a friend of Charlie's.

1291
01:00:40,556 --> 01:00:42,615
What?
A good friend of mine back in Texas

1292
01:00:42,692 --> 01:00:43,886
is a well-known
belly dancer.

1293
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:47,554
It's always been her dream to
perform in Egypt, so she's our way in.

1294
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,532
While she's dancing for the Defense
Minster, we'll be talking to the Deputy.

1295
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,932
Oh, my God.
No, she's supposed to be good.

1296
01:01:30,005 --> 01:01:32,803
That's an extraordinary woman.
Oh, yeah.

1297
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:39,740
That's not any belly dance
I'm familiar with.

1298
01:01:39,815 --> 01:01:43,114
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

1299
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:46,947
This is your girlfriend? Carol's
a friend. She's an old friend.

1300
01:01:47,022 --> 01:01:50,583
I understand her father didn't allow
dancing because of the religion?

1301
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:53,321
Yeah, that's correct.

1302
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:54,862
And what religion is that?

1303
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,795
You know, she's a Baptist.

1304
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:03,230
As I was saying, the Russians will
learn, I'm quite afraid the hard way,

1305
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:05,796
to fear God's vengeance
upon those

1306
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:09,572
who oppress his humble servants
who submit to him in Islam.

1307
01:02:09,879 --> 01:02:12,677
Their skulls will hang
from the treetops.

1308
01:02:12,748 --> 01:02:16,377
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

1309
01:02:16,552 --> 01:02:22,457
What has Gus here concerned is a SA
surface-to-air missiles you all have.

1310
01:02:22,525 --> 01:02:24,254
For some reason, he thinks
they were stored poorly.

1311
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,817
No, no, no, the SA-7 s
were stored properly.

1312
01:02:26,896 --> 01:02:30,593
Excuse me. What about
the oppression of my people?

1313
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,327
Oh, Zvi.
I beg your pardon?

1314
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:33,868
Fellows, we have
to do this now.

1315
01:02:33,936 --> 01:02:38,464
I am about to arrange
for $35 million worth of guns

1316
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,133
to be put into the hands
of Muslims!

1317
01:02:40,209 --> 01:02:43,542
I meant no disrespect.
Oh, really?

1318
01:02:43,612 --> 01:02:46,172
Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

1319
01:02:46,248 --> 01:02:49,217
You have Soviet-licensed factories
that can put out Kalashnikovs

1320
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:51,219
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

1321
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:54,381
That's correct.
What about city warfare devices?

1322
01:02:54,456 --> 01:02:56,515
What kind?
Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

1323
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:57,854
plastic, tripwire mines?

1324
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:00,054
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

1325
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:04,161
We can't improve
the price now,

1326
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:07,691
but when we come back for
more, we'll make it up to you.

1327
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:09,031
I agree.

1328
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:11,069
All right.

1329
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:25,111
Hey, you did good back there
ignoring the religious shit.

1330
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:27,955
'Cause these people are
totally fucking unspooled,

1331
01:03:28,023 --> 01:03:30,924
and I'm not just talking
about the Muslims.

1332
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:33,884
Zvi's all right.
Oh, I know he is.

1333
01:03:34,196 --> 01:03:35,356
He is Mossad, by the way.

1334
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:38,594
What I'm talking about is
your friend in Houston.

1335
01:03:38,868 --> 01:03:42,929
Now, she's got to stop throwing fundraisers
and she's got to stop doing press.

1336
01:03:43,005 --> 01:03:45,565
Joanne is raising awareness.

1337
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:52,774
She's using
a non-secular vocabulary

1338
01:03:53,115 --> 01:03:55,640
and framing this
as a religious war.

1339
01:03:56,752 --> 01:03:59,016
And America doesn't
fight religious wars.

1340
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,724
Is that right?
Yeah, that's why I like living there.

1341
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,589
<i>Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen. This is your captain.</i>

1342
01:04:05,694 --> 01:04:07,491
<i>We will begin our initial
descent</i>

1343
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:10,930
<i>into Washington Dulles Airport.
I got to go down to Houston, so...</i>

1344
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,025
<i>... I would like to thank you
and hope...</i>

1345
01:04:13,102 --> 01:04:16,003
Well, talk to her.
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1346
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:21,976
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

1347
01:04:22,044 --> 01:04:24,342
Just for this one purpose,
yes, Mr. President.

1348
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:28,941
The Israelis have the largest stockpile
of Soviet-made weapons in friendly hands.

1349
01:04:29,018 --> 01:04:30,417
I know that.

1350
01:04:31,153 --> 01:04:34,589
I need to trust that this
arrangement will remain secret.

1351
01:04:34,657 --> 01:04:38,957
Pakistan and Israel would have to
appear to be enemies in the public eye.

1352
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:41,496
Yeah, I don't think
that's a tough sell.

1353
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:43,292
You have authority
to do this?

1354
01:04:43,365 --> 01:04:46,459
None whatsoever. In fact, I'm pretty
close to violating the Logan Act.

1355
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:48,400
Well, I don't know
what that is.

1356
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:49,869
But, Charlie.
Yes, sir.

1357
01:04:49,939 --> 01:04:52,840
If I see one fucking
Star of David on a crate...

1358
01:04:52,908 --> 01:04:54,705
You won't. I promise.

1359
01:04:56,645 --> 01:04:57,703
Hey.
Excuse me.

1360
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,544
You want me to take a look
at those remarks?

1361
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:02,641
Why? Just... Well, your introduction,

1362
01:05:02,718 --> 01:05:07,052
want me to look it over?
It's an introduction, Charlie. I'll be fine.

1363
01:05:14,863 --> 01:05:18,526
<i>Today we honor President
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.</i>

1364
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:35,912
<i>Before we go any further, I
would like you all to know this,</i>

1365
01:05:36,218 --> 01:05:38,652
<i>President Zia did not
kill Bhutto.</i>

1366
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:41,550
<i>In the time that
he's been President,</i>

1367
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:44,558
<i>the fortunes of Pakistan
have changed radically.</i>

1368
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,854
<i>I've asked you all here
today...</i>

1369
01:05:54,236 --> 01:05:56,329
You disappeared.

1370
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:58,529
Well, they weren't
selling alcohol in there.

1371
01:05:58,607 --> 01:06:01,075
It's a traditional
Pakistani gathering.

1372
01:06:01,143 --> 01:06:02,940
You think they might be
a lot happier over there

1373
01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:06,379
if they could just get women and booze
in the same room at the same time?

1374
01:06:06,448 --> 01:06:08,245
I think they'd be a whole
lot happier over there

1375
01:06:08,317 --> 01:06:09,784
if the Communists got out.

1376
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:12,412
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

1377
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:16,346
That's not something you usually
hear in introductory remarks.

1378
01:06:16,425 --> 01:06:19,883
He didn't, Charlie. Bhutto had
a trial and was found guilty.

1379
01:06:19,962 --> 01:06:21,589
Shocking verdict.

1380
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:25,025
What did you need
to talk to me about?

1381
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:29,598
Joanne, darling,
dial down the religion.

1382
01:06:29,938 --> 01:06:32,270
What?
It could alienate people

1383
01:06:32,341 --> 01:06:34,070
whose support we need.

1384
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:36,839
It's luncheons like this that
are raising the money we need.

1385
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:39,779
This thing is not gonna get
done by ballrooms full of people

1386
01:06:39,848 --> 01:06:41,076
in the Houstonian Hotel.

1387
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,517
It's gonna get done by the
CIA, Israel, Egypt and Pakistan,

1388
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:46,213
and it's gonna get
done quietly.

1389
01:06:46,288 --> 01:06:47,653
Now, you start making
people think

1390
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:50,191
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity.

1391
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:53,456
I was saved by Jesus Christ,
Charlie, and I am not ashamed of it.

1392
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:56,760
My fervor is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion,

1393
01:06:56,832 --> 01:06:57,890
which we have, they want,

1394
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:00,230
and the Communists
are slaughtering them for.

1395
01:07:00,302 --> 01:07:03,601
And I get it.
Just tamp down the fervor.

1396
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:07,507
Well, I can't modulate
God's will, sweetie.

1397
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:09,142
You can try.

1398
01:07:10,045 --> 01:07:13,640
Now, I got to get back to D.C. They've
set up a briefing for me at Langley.

1399
01:07:13,715 --> 01:07:16,081
On what?
On getting the guns.

1400
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:20,511
Afghanistan's barely
a country.

1401
01:07:20,589 --> 01:07:22,853
There's no phones or roads
outside the cities.

1402
01:07:22,925 --> 01:07:24,358
It's likely that a villager
would live his life

1403
01:07:24,426 --> 01:07:26,986
without having contact with another
village just three miles down the road

1404
01:07:27,062 --> 01:07:29,121
unless he was going
to war against them.

1405
01:07:29,198 --> 01:07:31,826
Now, my thinking is instead
of 400,000 sloppy guys,

1406
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,597
we concentrate on several elite
forces totaling about 150,000.

1407
01:07:35,671 --> 01:07:37,161
Give these guys
real training,

1408
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:40,174
20 different courses covering
irregular warfare disciplines.

1409
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:41,766
And do you have anybody
in mind?

1410
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:44,938
The most successful rebels
today are in the Panjshir Valley.

1411
01:07:45,013 --> 01:07:47,504
They're called the United Front
of the Council of the North.

1412
01:07:47,616 --> 01:07:49,641
We've earmarked them
for 10 million in weapons

1413
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:52,312
and 10 to 15 agency advisors
for training.

1414
01:07:52,387 --> 01:07:55,447
Who's their leader?
Ahmed Shah Massoud.

1415
01:07:55,524 --> 01:07:58,982
He's Tajik, so he's not well
liked by the Pashtun.

1416
01:07:59,061 --> 01:08:02,224
So the... What, the Tajiks
have a problem with the Pashtuns?

1417
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:04,458
Well, they say when a Tajik
wants to make love to a woman,

1418
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:07,331
his first choice is always
a Pashtun man.

1419
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:11,261
It's funnier in
the original Pashto.

1420
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,271
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

1421
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:17,843
All right, don't fuck
us up now.

1422
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:19,840
Awesome pep talk.

1423
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:24,181
Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia,

1424
01:08:24,253 --> 01:08:27,051
these are all totalitarian
dictatorships.

1425
01:08:27,122 --> 01:08:31,559
And they'd like to blow the only democracy
in the region right into the Mediterranean.

1426
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:34,687
Now, you heard me say that
Israel's gonna be on board.

1427
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:37,459
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's
out of his mind.

1428
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:41,795
These people are draconian thugs,
and in an evil and twisted derby

1429
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,236
between the Communists
and the Fundamentalists,

1430
01:08:44,306 --> 01:08:45,864
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

1431
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:48,341
No, you're wrong about that, Doc,
and you know you don't mean it.

1432
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:52,210
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets
raped, but there's a witness.

1433
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:54,772
Now, in Pakistan it takes
four witnesses.

1434
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,284
So the rapist walks away
and the girl is in prison.

1435
01:08:57,352 --> 01:08:58,876
Can you tell me why?

1436
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:01,684
Well, fornication.
That's right.

1437
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:04,783
Mr. Chairman, President Zia is the
only one willing to shoulder the risk

1438
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:08,023
of actively training
and funding the mujahideen

1439
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:09,461
while Egypt
and Saudi Arabia...

1440
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:12,261
Now, the Saudis are matching
any funding from Congress?

1441
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:14,859
That's right.
So when you say 40 million to me,

1442
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:16,165
you're really talking
about 80 million.

1443
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,364
Only 40 from us.

1444
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,532
You want to put $80 million
in the hands of these people?

1445
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:21,735
No, see, Doc, now, if you took
a trip with me to the border,

1446
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,505
you'd stop calling them
"these people."

1447
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:27,071
They are farmers and children mostly,
and they are fighting our enemies for us.

1448
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:28,639
I know.
And that should be impossible for America.

1449
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:30,617
I know.
It should be impossible for America

1450
01:09:30,686 --> 01:09:34,247
to sit on the bench while little kids
and their mothers fight our enemies.

1451
01:09:34,323 --> 01:09:37,156
Now, all you have to do to
change that is to support me

1452
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:38,693
in the Committee,
Mr. Chairman.

1453
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,094
I'm sorry, Charlie, but doubling
from 5 to 10 million is one thing,

1454
01:09:43,165 --> 01:09:45,929
but, you know,
I just can't get behind this.

1455
01:09:49,204 --> 01:09:51,934
Joanne Herring's
residence. Who's speaking?

1456
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:54,805
Miss Herring, Congressman
Wilson for you.

1457
01:09:57,346 --> 01:09:58,745
<i>Hello.
Hey.</i>

1458
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,972
Tell me what's happening.

1459
01:10:00,048 --> 01:10:03,176
Well, I need Doc Long,
and he's not getting on board.

1460
01:10:03,252 --> 01:10:06,278
Now, he's a church-going guy,
so I thought,

1461
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:08,414
<i>you know, maybe you could...
So now you need God.</i>

1462
01:10:08,957 --> 01:10:11,255
Yeah. Let me give you
his private line.

1463
01:10:11,693 --> 01:10:13,092
I've got it.

1464
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,124
Trish!
Yes, ma'am.

1465
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:18,189
Boss?
Yeah.

1466
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:21,395
Hey, that's a nice sweater.
Oh, thank you.

1467
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,938
<i>The Washington Times wants to
know if you've ever been in rehab.</i>

1468
01:10:24,006 --> 01:10:25,997
Well, what are you gonna tell them?
That you won't go to rehab

1469
01:10:26,074 --> 01:10:27,336
'cause they don't serve
whiskey there.

1470
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:29,570
Well, that's why you're
the press secretary, boo-boo.

1471
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:32,808
I've got Stu on the line. Can you jump on?
Yeah.

1472
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:34,742
Hey, Stu, it's me.

1473
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:36,314
All right.

1474
01:10:36,551 --> 01:10:40,214
No, she's not a stripper, Stu.
She just posed for the cover...

1475
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:42,086
Oh, what the hell
difference does it make?

1476
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:44,148
They're talking
to Crystal today.

1477
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:45,318
Yeah.

1478
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:48,019
Giuliani subpoenaed
the limo driver.

1479
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:50,024
Oh, that's what Gus
said he'd do.

1480
01:10:50,098 --> 01:10:52,191
Well, the limo driver said
he didn't see anything.

1481
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:53,393
He didn't see anything.

1482
01:10:53,468 --> 01:10:55,595
So Giuliani subpoenaed
every limo driver

1483
01:10:55,671 --> 01:11:00,870
between Arlington and Silver Spring to see
if any of them can recall you using cocaine.

1484
01:11:01,243 --> 01:11:04,974
Joanne Herring's on the phone.
Hey, you.

1485
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,577
We're all leaving
in the morning.

1486
01:11:06,648 --> 01:11:08,047
<i>You're kidding?
No.</i>

1487
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,945
Well, what did you have
to promise him?

1488
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:13,487
There's a blind girl in jail
'cause she was raped.

1489
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:15,045
<i>Yeah.
You're gonna get her out.</i>

1490
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,451
What, I got to bust somebody
out of jail?

1491
01:11:17,526 --> 01:11:19,721
Don't be stupid, Charlie. You're
gonna tell Zia to pardon her.

1492
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:21,490
That's Doc's condition.

1493
01:11:21,563 --> 01:11:25,055
I'll fly in tonight. Buy me a drink?
Yes, ma'am.

1494
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:27,661
We're almost there, Charlie.

1495
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,408
<i>I'm going back to Pakistan tomorrow!
Let's party!</i>

1496
01:11:40,782 --> 01:11:41,942
Charlie!
Oh, that was... I'm gonna...

1497
01:11:42,017 --> 01:11:43,314
You want a refill here, darling?
Thanks.

1498
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,046
Can we get another round?

1499
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,280
Mario!

1500
01:11:46,822 --> 01:11:49,154
Oh, Charlie.

1501
01:11:54,763 --> 01:11:56,162
Hey, Joanne.

1502
01:11:57,799 --> 01:11:59,926
Can I call you Joanne?
Yes.

1503
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,831
You'll want to dress
considerably more modestly

1504
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:05,270
when we're at the border.

1505
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,537
Well, thank you, but I have
been passionately involved

1506
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,475
with the cause of the Afghans
for three years.

1507
01:12:10,545 --> 01:12:12,240
I've been there many times.

1508
01:12:12,314 --> 01:12:14,407
Okay, well, then I'll just
go fuck myself.

1509
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:17,179
I am not easily shocked,
Mr. Avrakotos.

1510
01:12:17,986 --> 01:12:20,477
I knew you two were gonna
hit it off right away.

1511
01:12:20,555 --> 01:12:21,783
Charlie!

1512
01:12:21,957 --> 01:12:25,051
Sorry, Stu's on the phone.
You can take it at the bar.

1513
01:12:25,127 --> 01:12:28,028
Stu. This can't be good.

1514
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:32,633
How'd you hook up
with Charlie?

1515
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:35,670
Are you also passionately involved
with the cause of the Afghans?

1516
01:12:35,737 --> 01:12:38,638
No, I just wasn't really
doing anything else.

1517
01:12:38,707 --> 01:12:41,107
I mean, how did you
get into the CIA?

1518
01:12:41,176 --> 01:12:43,974
Oh, I didn't. I'm with
the Department of Agriculture.

1519
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:47,173
Food and Plant Division.
Specifically apple imports.

1520
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:50,412
Now, you don't seem like the apple type.
I know.

1521
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,178
What's that mean?

1522
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,584
Where are you from?
What do you care?

1523
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,355
Are you a Catholic?
Greek Orthodox, Mrs. Herring.

1524
01:13:00,429 --> 01:13:03,330
That's still Christian.
Imagine my relief.

1525
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:06,032
What's your problem with me?

1526
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:08,035
You know, I've found,
in my business,

1527
01:13:08,103 --> 01:13:11,595
that when people with time on their
hands get involved in politics,

1528
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:14,301
I start forgetting what I'm
supposed to be shooting at.

1529
01:13:14,376 --> 01:13:16,571
That would be in the apple
import business.

1530
01:13:16,645 --> 01:13:18,044
Yes, ma'am.

1531
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:20,308
I'll have to remember that.
Please do.

1532
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:22,280
It's over!

1533
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:26,783
It's over! It is over!

1534
01:13:26,855 --> 01:13:30,018
That was Stu, and it is over.
Wait, wait, wait. Crystal didn't name you?

1535
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:32,423
Well, she witnessed
me doing coke

1536
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:34,325
in the Cayman Islands.
Oh, shit, Charlie.

1537
01:13:34,396 --> 01:13:37,627
No, it's all right. That's out of
the Justice Department's jurisdiction,

1538
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:39,189
so it is over.

1539
01:13:39,668 --> 01:13:41,192
I'm going home!

1540
01:13:42,537 --> 01:13:47,440
Gus, Joanne, the most important
trip of our lives is in the morning,

1541
01:13:47,509 --> 01:13:49,807
so let's get plenty of sleep.
I'm going home.

1542
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:52,176
Jailbait, slap my hands!
Yeah!

1543
01:13:52,747 --> 01:13:54,442
Mario, this is all on me.

1544
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:55,778
Yes, sir.

1545
01:13:56,384 --> 01:13:59,148
He may be in trouble with the
press, but he stayed out of jail.

1546
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:00,950
You don't see
God's hand in this?

1547
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:02,785
Well, reasonable people
can disagree,

1548
01:14:02,858 --> 01:14:05,691
but I don't see God anywhere
within miles of this.

1549
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,489
On the other hand,
if you slept with me tonight,

1550
01:14:07,562 --> 01:14:10,087
I bet you I could change
my mind in a hurry.

1551
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:11,962
Oh, you would.
Yeah.

1552
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:17,428
I'll see you on the plane.

1553
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:25,939
Sluts.

1554
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,332
Doc's eating this up.
Yeah?

1555
01:14:53,408 --> 01:14:55,933
We're gonna get the money.
Charlie?

1556
01:14:57,512 --> 01:14:58,740
Charlie!

1557
01:14:59,247 --> 01:15:01,044
Guy's a little senile.
Don't be fooled.

1558
01:15:01,116 --> 01:15:02,640
He chairs a Subcommittee?
Mmm-hmm.

1559
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:07,120
Charlie, Joanne, this has been an
absolutely eye-opening experience.

1560
01:15:07,188 --> 01:15:09,019
I mean, it's absolutely
stunning.

1561
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:12,389
Tell them what we saw,
Mr. Papadropolous. Tell them.

1562
01:15:13,528 --> 01:15:15,553
They only want to go back
there and fight.

1563
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,995
And you're their savior,
Mr. Chairman.

1564
01:15:17,065 --> 01:15:18,896
Oh, I wouldn't go that far, no.
Watch this.

1565
01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:20,400
She's gonna lock it right on up.
Mr. Chairman,

1566
01:15:20,468 --> 01:15:23,596
these people have been waiting for
you. They have been sitting here

1567
01:15:23,672 --> 01:15:26,732
and bleeding and waiting
and praying for you.

1568
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:30,341
It's only gonna be a man
like you who can save them.

1569
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:33,272
We know, don't we,
about our men,

1570
01:15:33,682 --> 01:15:36,344
what they can do when
they summon themselves.

1571
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:38,648
Charlie, I think they want
you to make some remarks.

1572
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,086
No, you should do it,
Mr. Chairman.

1573
01:15:41,156 --> 01:15:44,091
These people have been
waiting a long time for you.

1574
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,184
Show Muriel what you can do.
Show your wife.

1575
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:49,424
I'm a little bit emotional
about what I've seen here today.

1576
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:50,759
Show her.

1577
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:54,257
You can do it.

1578
01:15:55,804 --> 01:15:56,964
Go on.

1579
01:15:57,806 --> 01:15:59,137
All right.

1580
01:16:03,211 --> 01:16:06,408
Papadropolous.
Well, it's Greek. It's in the ballpark.

1581
01:16:06,481 --> 01:16:08,540
<i>(MAN TRANSLATING IN FOREIGN
My friends,</i>

1582
01:16:08,617 --> 01:16:11,643
<i>my son served in Vietnam.</i>

1583
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,748
<i>He was wounded fighting in battle
against the Soviet oppressors.</i>

1584
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:18,622
I didn't know that
about his son.

1585
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:21,025
<i>So, you see,
I'm no stranger,</i>

1586
01:16:21,096 --> 01:16:25,157
<i>no stranger at all to the horrors
and atrocities of the Communists!</i>

1587
01:16:29,504 --> 01:16:30,994
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1588
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:36,641
I talk about God for
one simple reason.

1589
01:16:36,711 --> 01:16:39,703
<i>As God is my witness today...
We need him on our side.</i>

1590
01:16:39,781 --> 01:16:43,808
<i>... these Russian gunships,
every last one of them,</i>

1591
01:16:43,885 --> 01:16:46,012
<i>are gonna be blown right
out of the sky.</i>

1592
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:50,820
<i>We're gonna see that you have guns and
we're gonna see that you have training!</i>

1593
01:16:54,262 --> 01:16:55,627
Thank you.

1594
01:16:57,432 --> 01:16:59,332
Well, what I think's got
Gus worried

1595
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:03,599
is that sooner or later
God is gonna be on both sides.

1596
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:07,906
<i>This is good against evil.</i>

1597
01:17:07,976 --> 01:17:11,207
<i>And I want you to know that
America's always going to be</i>

1598
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:13,543
<i>on the side of the good.</i>

1599
01:17:14,182 --> 01:17:17,583
<i>And God will always punish
the wicked!</i>

1600
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:31,598
God is great!

1601
01:17:32,634 --> 01:17:34,101
God is great!

1602
01:18:17,912 --> 01:18:20,540
<i>This has been a
year of setback and frustration.</i>

1603
01:18:20,615 --> 01:18:23,083
<i>And the Soviet Army, more than
at any time since the war began,</i>

1604
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:26,283
<i>Now has the upper hand.</i>

1605
01:18:26,354 --> 01:18:28,652
<i>The mujahideen are
pinned down.</i>

1606
01:18:29,023 --> 01:18:32,720
<i>The Afghan resistance has been
sanctified by the United States,</i>

1607
01:18:32,794 --> 01:18:37,197
<i>but the support has not been
translated into military hardware.</i>

1608
01:18:37,265 --> 01:18:40,166
<i>The guerrillas still cling to the
Kalashnikov, but it's not enough.</i>

1609
01:18:41,703 --> 01:18:44,365
<i>They're waiting in vain
for bigger modern weapons</i>

1610
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:46,270
<i>to turn on the Red Army.</i>

1611
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:48,639
<i>The guerrillas survived
the raid.</i>

1612
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:53,678
<i>The Soviets now are conducting some
of the heaviest bombing of the war.</i>

1613
01:18:53,748 --> 01:18:57,206
<i>The Soviets have put more
troops and equipment back in.</i>

1614
01:18:58,052 --> 01:18:59,781
Communist bastards.

1615
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:12,691
Don't send us rice
and bandages,

1616
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:16,134
give us weapons so that we
can shoot down their gunships.

1617
01:19:19,607 --> 01:19:22,303
It's called the MILAN
anti-tank missile.

1618
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:25,175
Can the Afghans win without it?
No.

1619
01:19:26,447 --> 01:19:27,675
End of discussion.

1620
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:30,616
I would like to have the
previously approved sum increased

1621
01:19:30,685 --> 01:19:32,676
by an additional 30 million,

1622
01:19:32,754 --> 01:19:36,451
bringing the total
appropriation to 70 million.

1623
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:39,493
I'd like to introduce
the MILAN anti-tank missile.

1624
01:19:40,028 --> 01:19:41,359
We've got 300 in the field.

1625
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:42,794
Yeah!
Yep.

1626
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:45,756
Let's kill some Russians!

1627
01:19:57,879 --> 01:20:00,973
Voting to pump up the money for
the freedom fighters is the only way

1628
01:20:01,049 --> 01:20:03,279
for the northeastern liberal
to prove that he's serious.

1629
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:04,648
How much are you asking for?

1630
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,687
I'd want to go from 70 million
to 100 million.

1631
01:20:06,754 --> 01:20:10,087
And if you vote for me, I can deliver
the Black Caucus for the farm subsidy.

1632
01:22:52,387 --> 01:22:54,355
And they asked him,
quite reasonably enough,

1633
01:22:54,422 --> 01:22:55,855
"How did you vote on that?"

1634
01:22:55,923 --> 01:22:59,188
And I swear to God, he
looks over at his staff guy.

1635
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:03,953
He had to check with an aide
for an answer to that question.

1636
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,327
I don't know how that guy
stays in office.

1637
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:42,127
It was the Bamian-led group.
They set an ambush here

1638
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:43,864
at the Fuladi Bridge.
What'd they get?

1639
01:23:43,938 --> 01:23:46,839
Four supply trucks coming out
of Bagram Airbase.

1640
01:23:46,908 --> 01:23:50,002
They hit a Soviet motorized
rifle battalion on horseback?

1641
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:52,739
You bet your ass.
Then these guys are pretty good.

1642
01:24:16,804 --> 01:24:18,897
We can't control this
thing anymore.

1643
01:24:18,973 --> 01:24:22,101
The man stood in my office
in Islamabad, and I told him,

1644
01:24:22,176 --> 01:24:23,768
"A sudden influx of money

1645
01:24:23,845 --> 01:24:27,337
"and weaponry..."
Could you hand me that belt, please?

1646
01:24:28,316 --> 01:24:30,045
Thank you.
I mean, how is it possible

1647
01:24:30,118 --> 01:24:32,814
that this congressman
of no particular importance

1648
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:34,411
is doing this by himself?

1649
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:36,480
I will admit it's not
unimpressive.

1650
01:24:36,557 --> 01:24:39,390
Is this the war we want
to be fighting, Henry? Huh?

1651
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:44,227
Harold, whatever he's doing,
believe me, it's working.

1652
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:08,246
The CIA estimates that seven out of
every 10 times the muj fires a Stinger,

1653
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,915
a Soviet chopper or a plane
falls out of the sky.

1654
01:25:11,993 --> 01:25:16,157
Now, Russian MiGs go for $20
million, Stingers go for 60-70,000.

1655
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:17,663
What do you want to do?

1656
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:19,495
Well, I'd like to double
to 250 million.

1657
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:22,468
Remind me again,
where did this thing start?

1658
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,237
5 million.

1659
01:25:35,283 --> 01:25:38,582
<i>Hello?
Is this Mrs. Joanne King Herring Davis?</i>

1660
01:25:39,654 --> 01:25:41,019
Where's it at, Charlie?

1661
01:25:42,456 --> 01:25:43,980
How's the honeymoon?

1662
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:47,517
<i>Am I ever gonna see you
naked again?</i>

1663
01:25:48,262 --> 01:25:49,456
Where's it at, Charlie?

1664
01:25:50,965 --> 01:25:54,423
500 million.
Matched by the Saudis.

1665
01:25:55,102 --> 01:25:56,660
One billion dollars.

1666
01:25:56,737 --> 01:25:59,137
<i>That's right.
Billion with a "b."</i>

1667
01:26:00,474 --> 01:26:03,204
Where does this rank relative
to other covert wars?

1668
01:26:03,844 --> 01:26:06,005
There's never been anything
else like it.

1669
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,445
<i>Since when?</i>

1670
01:26:08,983 --> 01:26:10,075
Ever.

1671
01:26:12,019 --> 01:26:13,748
I miss you, Charlie.

1672
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:15,452
I, Joanne,

1673
01:26:17,425 --> 01:26:19,052
I always miss you.

1674
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:25,030
<i>I better go.</i>

1675
01:26:35,076 --> 01:26:37,101
There's nothing
wrong with that!

1676
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:39,874
And out in Polk, there's the polecat
who took us over the side there.

1677
01:26:39,947 --> 01:26:42,609
You know, that's the truth.
What do you got?

1678
01:26:42,683 --> 01:26:44,617
Is that Gus? You got it.

1679
01:26:44,685 --> 01:26:45,811
Hey, Gus!

1680
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,484
<i>Congratulations on your reelection.
Yeah, thank you.</i>

1681
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:51,684
<i>Tell me what you know.
All right. Doc Long is gonna lose.</i>

1682
01:26:51,759 --> 01:26:53,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw that coming.

1683
01:26:53,995 --> 01:26:56,623
Yeah, so who's gonna be
our wallet now?

1684
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:59,358
<i>John Murtha.
And is that good news?</i>

1685
01:26:59,433 --> 01:27:00,764
<i>Yep.
Why?</i>

1686
01:27:01,936 --> 01:27:04,632
I was his vote on
the Ethics Committee.

1687
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:09,209
You know, you're a very, very
easy man to like, Congressman.

1688
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,444
Call me tomorrow morning
at high noon.

1689
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,772
I will. Bye-bye.

1690
01:27:24,558 --> 01:27:27,186
We present you with
this Stinger tube.

1691
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:37,094
<i>There was wild jubilation
inside the country of Afghanistan</i>

1692
01:27:37,171 --> 01:27:40,572
<i>as last weekend it became
the first country in history</i>

1693
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:43,109
<i>to defeat the mighty
Soviet Union.</i>

1694
01:27:44,945 --> 01:27:48,676
<i>The retreat of Soviet military
power from Afghanistan is complete.</i>

1695
01:27:48,749 --> 01:27:52,276
<i>The last of Russia's regular
army invasion force is out.</i>

1696
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,418
<i>Fear and uncertainty
were mixed with joy today</i>

1697
01:27:55,489 --> 01:27:57,252
<i>as the commander
of Soviet troops</i>

1698
01:27:57,325 --> 01:27:59,555
<i>followed the last of his men
across the border.</i>

1699
01:27:59,627 --> 01:28:03,256
<i>CBS News Moscow correspondent,
Barry Petersen, begins our coverage.</i>

1700
01:28:03,331 --> 01:28:06,767
<i>It was the last hurrah.
The final Soviet combat troops</i>

1701
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:08,802
<i>crossing the Friendship Bridge
on the border</i>

1702
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:11,337
<i>between Afghanistan
and the Soviet Union.</i>

1703
01:28:11,405 --> 01:28:12,929
<i>The Soviet commander,
Lieutenant...</i>

1704
01:28:13,007 --> 01:28:15,100
Look what you did, Charlie.

1705
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:17,842
Hey, it's... Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey!

1706
01:28:17,912 --> 01:28:21,541
It's traditional to make a
gesture towards the vanquished.

1707
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:24,517
Gus, it's your honor.
Okay.

1708
01:28:24,585 --> 01:28:27,076
<i>Reports that some Afghan
units have...</i>

1709
01:28:27,154 --> 01:28:31,352
Well, here's to you,
you motherfuckers.

1710
01:28:32,593 --> 01:28:37,087
<i>... determined to show the world that
the era of Soviet military intervention</i>

1711
01:28:37,164 --> 01:28:40,031
<i>in other countries
is now over.</i>

1712
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:46,996
Well, I told you.
Told me what?

1713
01:28:47,074 --> 01:28:50,168
All we had to do was
shoot down the helicopters.

1714
01:28:52,913 --> 01:28:55,746
Listen, not for nothing,
but do you know the story

1715
01:28:55,816 --> 01:28:57,477
about the Zen master
and the little boy?

1716
01:28:57,551 --> 01:28:59,143
Oh, is this something
from Nitsa,

1717
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,018
the Greek witch of Aliquippa,
Pennsylvania?

1718
01:29:02,123 --> 01:29:04,489
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

1719
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,659
There was a little boy, and on
his 14th birthday he gets a horse.

1720
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:12,699
And everybody in the village says,
"How wonderful! The boy got a horse."

1721
01:29:12,767 --> 01:29:15,361
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1722
01:29:15,836 --> 01:29:17,997
Two years later, the boy falls
off the horse, breaks his leg.

1723
01:29:18,072 --> 01:29:20,097
And everybody in the village
says, "How terrible!"

1724
01:29:20,174 --> 01:29:22,768
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1725
01:29:23,144 --> 01:29:24,441
Then a war breaks out,

1726
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:26,002
and all the young men
have to go off and fight,

1727
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,843
except the boy can't 'cause
his leg's all messed up.

1728
01:29:27,915 --> 01:29:29,542
And everybody in the village
says, "How wonderful!"

1729
01:29:29,617 --> 01:29:32,211
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1730
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,911
So you get it.

1731
01:29:34,989 --> 01:29:37,514
No. No, I don't
'cause I'm stupid.

1732
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:40,082
You're not stupid.
You're just in Congress.

1733
01:29:40,161 --> 01:29:41,924
Send them money.
You can start with the roads.

1734
01:29:41,996 --> 01:29:44,191
Move on to the schools, factories.
Gus, now, it's a party.

1735
01:29:44,265 --> 01:29:45,630
Restock the sheep herds.
Hey.

1736
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:47,462
Give them jobs, give them hope.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1737
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:49,503
Yeah, well, try harder.
I'm fighting for every dollar.

1738
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:53,199
Yeah, yeah.
I took you from 5 million to a billion.

1739
01:29:53,674 --> 01:29:55,164
I broke the ice on the Stinger
and the MILAN.

1740
01:29:55,242 --> 01:29:58,234
I got a Democratic Congress in
lockstep behind a Republican President.

1741
01:29:58,312 --> 01:29:59,506
Well, that's not good enough

1742
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,946
'cause I'm gonna hand you a code
word classified NIE right now,

1743
01:30:02,016 --> 01:30:03,847
and it's gonna tell you that
the crazies have started rolling

1744
01:30:03,918 --> 01:30:06,978
into Kandahar like it's
a fucking bathtub drain.

1745
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:10,682
Jesus, Gus, you could depress
a bride on her wedding day.

1746
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:11,849
Hey.

1747
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:17,627
Listen to what
I'm telling you.

1748
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:38,676
You did a hell of a job for
the son of a soda pop maker.

1749
01:30:39,286 --> 01:30:42,949
"We'll see,"
said the Zen master.

1750
01:30:58,305 --> 01:31:00,432
$1 million for school
reconstruction?

1751
01:31:00,508 --> 01:31:01,770
Oh, shit, Charlie.

1752
01:31:01,842 --> 01:31:04,572
Listen.
He's like the congressman from Kabul.

1753
01:31:04,645 --> 01:31:08,376
Did you hear me say it was a million,
not a billion, for school construction?

1754
01:31:08,449 --> 01:31:10,383
Yeah, we heard you.
Everybody heard you, buddy.

1755
01:31:10,451 --> 01:31:12,112
They heard you in Dover,
Delaware.

1756
01:31:12,186 --> 01:31:13,653
Well, I sure hope I'm not
annoying you, Bob,

1757
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:15,586
'cause that's the last thing I want to do.
Look...

1758
01:31:15,656 --> 01:31:18,625
I was in the Roosevelt Room
with the President last week.

1759
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:19,784
You know what he said?

1760
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,055
He said, "Afghanistan?
Is that still going on?"

1761
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:23,528
Well, it is.

1762
01:31:23,697 --> 01:31:25,164
Half the population
of that country

1763
01:31:25,232 --> 01:31:26,563
is under the age of 14.
Charlie.

1764
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:30,229
Half the population is
under the age of 14.

1765
01:31:31,105 --> 01:31:32,595
Now, think how fucking
dangerous that is.

1766
01:31:32,673 --> 01:31:35,403
They're gonna come home and
find their families are dead,

1767
01:31:35,476 --> 01:31:37,000
their villages have
been napalmed.

1768
01:31:37,077 --> 01:31:39,841
And we helped kill the guys who did it.
Yeah, but they don't know that, Bob,

1769
01:31:39,914 --> 01:31:41,882
<i>'cause they don't get home
delivery of The New York Times.</i>

1770
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:45,146
And even if they did,
it was covert, remember?

1771
01:31:45,886 --> 01:31:49,686
This is what we always do. We
always go in with our ideals

1772
01:31:49,757 --> 01:31:52,590
and we change the world
and then we leave.

1773
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,552
We always leave.

1774
01:31:54,962 --> 01:31:57,760
But that ball, though,
it keeps on bouncing.

1775
01:31:57,831 --> 01:32:00,231
What?
The ball keeps on bouncing.

1776
01:32:00,434 --> 01:32:01,765
Yeah, we're
a little busy right now

1777
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:03,769
reorganizing Eastern Europe,
don't you think?

1778
01:32:03,837 --> 01:32:05,600
We've spent billions.

1779
01:32:05,739 --> 01:32:09,470
Let's spend a million on
H.R.118 and rebuild a school.

1780
01:32:09,543 --> 01:32:13,070
Charlie, nobody gives a shit
about a school in Pakistan.

1781
01:32:13,681 --> 01:32:15,080
Afghanistan.

1782
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:41,567
<i>So, for the first time, a civilian
is being given our highest recognition,</i>

1783
01:32:42,142 --> 01:32:44,167
