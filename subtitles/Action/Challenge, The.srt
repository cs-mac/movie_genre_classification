00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,950
No.

Anyways, speaking of...

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Park Myung Soo has ended up at 
the edge spot he hates so much.

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,060
This was Park Myung Soo's 
biggest fear on this show.

40
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,770
A spot at the edge.

41
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,660
It happens with just one missing.

42
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,940
I'm sorry but that can be the edge, too.

43
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,500

Out of the ones who showed more interest 
with big data analysis of viewers' opinions

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,400
and through the research of 
many producers and writers,

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,030
we invited 8 candidates with the 
hottest responses out of the total 21.

50
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,870
It was a survival game!

51
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,840
The most important thing 
here is their strong will.

52
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,580

This is all we've prepared.

111
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,550

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,860
I felt like I have to 
at least be next to you.

124
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,420
What about being next to us?

125
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,400

and true spot next to #1.]

about Star King and Ho Dong.

They said they'll send me off.

Waiting to hear from here.

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,610

off, but you said it wasn't true.

[On SBS Star King last week, 
a cool good-bye to Kwang Hee.]

They haven't confirmed anything yet!

136
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,450
[Tough position.]

137
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,760
Why do you keep going back and forth?

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,520
Then you come here when we call.

139
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,730
I need to keep a foot in a door 
in case this doesn't work!

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,590
I asked my company to try...

141
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,600
some corruption, some lobbying.

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,500
Lobby for what?

143
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,470
Nice, nice.

144
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,470
But they said you didn't 
take any of that!

145
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,390
Can't talk to you guys at all.

146
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,640

was on Infinity Challenge.

You know why?

164
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,740

Si Wan and Hyung Shik.

up and I have trash piling up!

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,650
[Kang Gyun Sung - Noel member, 
Big data 3rd place, Experts' choice 3rd place.]

181
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,020
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: 
Funny, hit, laughter, perverted, shocking, new...]

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,060
[Not an easy rival...]

183
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,240
[Long strides forward.]

184
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,940
[Immediately enters stage 1 
without facial recognition.]

185
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,800
[Kang Gyun Sung's reaction?]

186
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,640
[Run away.]

187
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,580
It scared me.

188
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,800
[Running without the chance 
to see his reaction.]

189
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,430
[The horn. His reaction?]

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,430
[The swift scaredy-cat runs again.]

191
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,480
[Stage 3 drop.]

192
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,180
[Reactionless sprinter.]

193
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,560
[Ended with a short scream.]

194
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,410
Why are you running?

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,810
I thought I should come quickly.

196
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,820
[Second Sixth Man candidate, 
Kang Gyun Sung.]

197
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,680
Gyun Sung.

198
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,350
Go to the spot you want.

199
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,880
- Where? 
- Where you want to stand.

200
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,840
Where you would stand 
in Infinity Challenge.

201
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,590
[Taking the great spot 
he had put dibs on.]

202
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,140
One, two...

203
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,770
Three. Is that it?

204
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,230
I like it here.

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,660
[This is my spot.]

206
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,720
- He's nice. 
- Why?

207
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,750
He's so different from Kwang Hee.

208
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,420
Come on, man!

209
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,780
Why? Why?

210
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,710
- What? 
- Why?

211
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,910
I think it would be easier for the 
others to manipulate me in this spot.

212
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,330
Manipulate me in this spot.

213
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,950
[Passive position.] [Leading position.]

214
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,580
In the interview you said no one 
but you would be a good fit.

215
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,580
One person who can't be.

216
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,620
Kang Gyun Sung.

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,980
Why so sad?

218
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,790
Except for him! What one 
person? None of them!

219
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,130
Not you either.

220
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
Not you either.

221
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,100
No.

222
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,940
He keeps flip flopping.

223
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,820
[You said that?]

224
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,680
Kwang Hee.

225
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,670
Why were you looking at him like that?

226
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,780
It's a competition now.

227
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,270
Since he came as a candidate.

228
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,710
Did you expect to get an invitation?

229
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,780
Me?

230
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,280
Of course!

231
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,340
[Insolent hoobae.]

232
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,990
To be honest.

233
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,800
- You knew it would come? 
- Yes.

234
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,460
They're really so different.

235
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,310
Gyun Sung and Kwang Hee have 
completely different personalities.

236
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,280
Different...

237
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,190
- I don't know. 
- Excited and calm?

238
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,400
Know-it-all?

239
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,660
Not you either!

240
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,260
Kwang Hee, how do you 
think you are different?

241
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,230
He's different because...

242
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,330
instead of being funny with words,

243
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,770
he's funny because of imitating 
voices and being bipolar.

244
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,810
Wasn't he so funny that day?

245
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
First of all, Kwang Hee 
has many strengths.

246
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,050
Like what?

247
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,720
No army service yet.

248
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,930
[A biting comment with his soft voice.]

249
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,290
You're too harsh.

250
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,490
Not you either!

251
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,500
[Battlefield with flying bombs.]

252
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,060
That differs from what you said earlier.

253
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,600
You say hurtful things so calmly.

254
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,280
[Quiet sniper of mean 
comments, Kang Gyun Sung.]

255
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,320
[Third candidate arrives.]

256
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,800
[Coming]

257
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm curious about the next person.

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,180
[What sort of rival is next?]

259
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,820
[A dark shadow falls on the young lambs.]

260
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,950
[Jang Dong Min - Popular comedian, 
Big Data 9th place, Experts' choice 1st place.]

261
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,390
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: Honest, 
expectant, funny, cursing, intense, laughter, good...]

262
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,250
Dong Min.

263
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,020
Why did you invite him?

264
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,970
Myung Soo's curses are selfish.

265
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,640
Mine are curses of justice.

266
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,940
[He has finally come...]

267
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,270
Ring the bell... Facial recognition...

268
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,070
Facial recognition?

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,640
He's very suspicious.

270
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,030
It's manual.

271
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,820
Recognition, yeah right.

272
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,450
[Flare welcome greeting.]

273
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh, my God.

274
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,930
Scared me.

275
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,040
Something wrong?

276
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,150
[Manly man.]

277
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,000
[Stage 2: Horn.]

278
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh, my God.

279
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,970
[As aloof as if bitten by a mosquito.]

280
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,500
What's this?

281
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,370
[Final stage for the fearless Dong Min.]

282
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,610
Oh, my goodness.

283
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,220
[Ghost drop.]

284
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,270
What the?

285
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,800
[Identical to Myung Soo.]

286
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,420
[Doppelganger?]

287
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,430
I ought to rip it down!

288
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,850
His reaction is just like Myung Soo's.

289
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,920
How could they be so similar?

290
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,070
He's a young Myung Soo.

291
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,970
I ought to just...

292
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,360
He wasn't very scared.

293
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,510
[Rising star of anger, Jang Dong Min.]

294
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,730
Young potty mouth.

295
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,200
Now...

296
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,790
[Myung Soo hyung.]

297
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,730
[Ignore]

298
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,700
[Infiltrates the center 
as smooth as water.]

299
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,490
You naturally went to that spot?

300
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,000
Then where should I go?

301
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,330
[Arrival of a powerful enemy.]

302
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,240
You just swooped into this spot.

303
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,130
Can I not stand here?

304
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,000
He's so similar to Park Myung Soo.

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,650
The way we kick is the same.

306
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,400
I was scared.

307
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,840
Have you ever worked 
with Myung Soo before?

308
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,620
Yes, I have.

309
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,900
It was his first time working with me.

310
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,850
He would yell at female 
idol singers and stuff.

311
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,310
I figured that's just him.

312
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,120
Then he suddenly got mad at me.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,380
So I said, "What!?"

314
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,490
He reacted like this.

315
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,090
Then during the break time,

316
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,820
I clearly remember hearing this.

317
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,860
"I don't think Dong Min fits in."

318
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,050
And then,

319
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,930
I was supposed to be permanent.

320
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,260
But I didn't film anymore after that.

321
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,310
[Two people with a history.]

322
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,320
You talked to the producers 
to get Dong Min fired!

323
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
That's not it.

324
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,560
I don't remember saying that.

325
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,800
Don't remember or didn't do it?

326
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,340
He was a bit too much.

327
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,910
He yelled more than me.

328
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,500
That's why? Jang Dong Min, 
after you aired on Sixth Man,

329
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,710
how was others' responses?

330
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,720
- There was a lot of talk. 
- Like what?

331
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,550
That I definitely have to do this.

332
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,620
[Short but heavy response from others.]

333
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,030
Who?

334
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,210
Yoo Sang Moo and Yoo Se Yoon 
even said to quit other stuff.

335
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,000
They said I definitely have to do this.

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Even your colleagues...

337
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,000
Kwang Hee is so...

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
He was so bright earlier.

339
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,500
How do you feel meeting him, Dong Min?

340
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,770
He got a lot of mean comments.

341
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,550
He was sad.

342
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,170
So how did he have the 
balls to come here?

343
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,800
[Definitely the rising star of anger.]

344
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,140
- He's unexpectedly shy in front of Dong Min. 
- Balls, that's good.

345
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,750
Who do you think is the 
strongest candidate?

346
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,730
Who?

347
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,150
Gyun Sung's good.

348
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,660
[You're too kind.]

349
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,580
I saw the multiple personalities.

350
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,630
It reeked of acting.

351
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,520
[Reeked of acting...]

352
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,150
Smells travel through TV?

353
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,920
[Flinch]

354
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,480
You do something, too!

355
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm not good at fighting. 
Things like fighting.

356
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,020
Who's fighting right now?

357
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,010
I'm not good at fighting.

358
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,730
I'm not good at fighting.

359
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,010
[Fourth candidate arrives!]

360
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,410
They're here!

361
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,030
[The fourth strong 
candidate for Sixth Man?]

362
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,620
[Choi Siwon - Super Junior member, 
Big data 6th place, Experts' choice 5th place.]

363
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,730
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: Good fit, 
good-looking, positive, let himself go, shocking...]

364
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,820
He has the highest point for passion.

365
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,390
[Guarding himself]

366
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,630
Why did he come here?

367
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,860
[Enters while whistling 
with an actor vibe.]

368
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,810
He's got an attitude.

369
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,790
He's fearless, right?

370
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,480
Probably.

371
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,000
[Knock knock.]

372
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,020
[At the facial recognition, 
he tries voice recognition.]

373
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,050
[It opened!]

374
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,420
- He came in. 
- Let's see his first reaction.

375
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,300
[Flare gift.]

376
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,980
[What... so different from the first three...]

377
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,370
[Like 007 after completing a mission?]

378
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,090
It's like a movie.

379
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,050
[What? Do they want me to do something?]

380
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,890
[Coughing with satisfaction.]

381
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,310
American reaction!

382
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,310
American reaction.

383
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,350
[Fixes his clothes like a 
Hollywood secret spy...]

384
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,840
[Entering stage 2!]

385
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,950
[Mommy!]

386
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,860
[Welcome!]

387
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,620
[His agent footwork.]

388
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,860
Did you see that?

389
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,290
[Sad reenactment of the American moves.]

390
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,770
[Continues to maintain his spy charisma.]

391
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,010
[Calmly walks to stage 3!]

392
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,270
Be quiet!

393
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,140
The ghost.

394
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,040
[Boo]

395
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,510
What is this?

396
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,150
[Spy charisma shatters in one blow.]

397
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,090
[American agent reveals his humanness.]

398
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,820
How dare you act cool?

399
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,000
American reaction.

400
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,530
He was surprised.

401
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,260
American reaction.

402
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,130
So cool.

403
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,430
I was so surprised.

404
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,830
I was so surprised.

405
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,000
- So good-looking. 
- You weren't shocked at all.

406
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,170
Except Gyun Sung, everyone looks 
like a squid in comparison.

407
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
My face?

408
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,410
My face? No way!

409
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,870
Kwang Hee. Come here and look.

410
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,520
No!

411
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,980
Excluding Gyun Sung, everyone 
looks like a squid.

412
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,820
You know how much silicone I got?

413
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,480
Be grateful to your silicone.

414
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,990
[Only as bad as a squid 
thanks to the silicone.]

415
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,990
Siwon!

416
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,930
[Will his amazing looks be a pro or con?]

417
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,060
He's so good-looking.

418
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,300
Incredible.

419
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,170
Siwon. Please be honest and go to 
the spot you would like to be in.

420
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,680
Looking at height, I think I belong here.

421
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,620
For balance.

422
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,240
Why here?

423
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,520
For balance.

424
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,210
Jun Ha is on the right.

425
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,680
On the left now.

426
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,710
Gyun Sung is on the right.

427
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,480
You're on the left.

428
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,440
Dong Min and Kwang Hee are next to me.

429
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,630
[Lumps of ambition.]

430
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
We're very realistic.

431
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,780
Idealistic over here.

432
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,030
All of Siwon's movements are...

433
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,700
slightly Hollywoodesque.

434
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,260
Especially when surprised.

435
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,680
[Fancy footwork.]

436
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,370
[Calm 1, 2 step.]

437
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,310
I felt like Michael Jackson.

438
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,980
It was a new reaction.

439
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,960
Something never seen 
before in entertainment.

440
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,840
It was slightly cheesy.

441
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,210
My appeal is that I'm fresh.

442
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,490
[He's good.]

443
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,550
Fresh.

444
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,540
[Was I good?]

445
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,860
I blocked his path to you.

446
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,550
[Going for a high five with Ha Ha.]

447
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,560
[Quick with the other hand.]

448
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,190
[Top at adjusting to new situations.]

449
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,460
Both hands are ready.

450
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,240
Siwon is amazing.

451
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,440
[Jealous...]

452
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,140
Kwang Hee.

453
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,900
You're both idols.

454
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,620
Why are you suddenly...

455
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,700
taking a step back now?

456
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,440
Because he just has so much.

457
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,540
And you just can't beat SM.

458
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,570
Look at him.

459
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,710
Only incredible people are here.

460
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,320
Your boss is going to be so upset.

461
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,790
My dream is to go to SM.

462
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
I'll even go to a subsidiary company.

463
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
[Asking for trouble...]

464
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,690
Even at Infinity Challenge,

465
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,930
you keep looking to go somewhere else.

466
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,900
I need to go to a good 
place. Noblesse oblige.

467
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,640
That's about moral duty, 
it's not applicable here.

468
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,910
[Just let complicated things go.]

469
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,980
Take your hands out. You're on air.

470
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,670
Should I just freeze to death?

471
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,040
[Taken aback.]

472
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,690
You have a jacket on.

473
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,850
You're good.

474
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,690
[Stay on your toes.]

475
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,610
We have four Sixth Man candidates here.

476
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,730
As one of our members couldn't 
come due to another filming...

477
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,700
Who? Who's missing?

478
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,420
- The fat one. 
- Ah, yes.

479
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,560
Ah, yes.

480
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,860
He's good.

481
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,200
It's a new reaction.

482
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,850
[Was I good?]

483
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,650
We have the next candidate.

484
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,810
Please sit.

485
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,850
Hang your jacket.

486
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,290
[Sitting in their places...]

487
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,130
Kwang Hee, come here.

488
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,560
[Kwang Hee standing far away.]

489
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,960
Why are you being so shy?

490
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,350
SM makes me uncomfortable.

491
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,320
[Fifth candidate arrives.]

492
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,660
The next candidate. 
It's the fifth candidate.

493
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,920
[A very slim man...]

494
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,740
What is that?

495
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,160
Leon?

496
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,440
[An extraordinary fifth candidate?]

497
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,310
[Hong Jin Kyung - Big data 12th place, 
Experts' choice 7th place.]

498
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,620
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: Positive, 
laughter, strong, honest, passion, shocking...]

499
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,680
Why did she come like that?

500
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,050
Why'd she do that?

501
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,760
I thought she was a monkey.

502
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,800
[Entering stage 1!]

503
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,030
[Entrance present!]

504
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,010
[Scared me...]

505
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,060
Scared me.

506
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,070
[Bearded ahjusshi is unfazed.]

507
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,690
[Passing stage 2 like a real man.]

508
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,270
Scared me.

509
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,320
[Fearless manly man.]

510
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,910
Scared me.

511
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,330
She doesn't get scared.

512
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,670
[Last chance, stage 3.]

513
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,380
What is it?

514
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,700
[Boo!]

515
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,450
Oh, my God!

516
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,460
Oh, my God!

517
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,920
Mommy!

518
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,620
[Got her!]

519
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,830
[The entertainment reaction comes alive.]

520
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,540
[Fully satisfied.]

521
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,940
My goodness.

522
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,880
Why did you draw a beard?

523
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,330
[Completely prepared 
to be the Sixth Man.]

524
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,770
Jae Suk hyung!

525
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,540
What are you doing?

526
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,240
What do you mean, hyung?

527
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,950
There were a lot of comments 
that said no woman.

528
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,120
[Jin Kyung came dressed as a man.]

529
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,150
They said a woman can't do it.

530
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,980
[They look like brothers.]

531
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,100
[She's unstoppable.]

532
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,700
What are you doing?

533
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,900
It's a hermaphrodite theme today.

534
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,490
[She's a strong rival...]

535
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,350
That's my theme today.

536
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,240
Where did you do your beard?

537
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,830
At home with a sponge.

538
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,370
- You have it at home? 
- Yes.

539
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,660
[She gets an A for dedication.]

540
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,810
I'm very prepared.

541
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,460
You look like Lee Yoon Suk.

542
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,800
She looks like Han Ki Bum.

543
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,150
[Exactly the same!]

544
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,840
[So proud.]

545
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,820
Hong Jin Kyung, thank you.

546
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,060
We did this for everyone else.

547
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,000
If you were to join, please 
pick where your spot would be.

548
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,210
- Jung Hyung Don is there? 
- Yes.

549
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,160
Pick comfortably.

550
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,730
I've seen this man before.

551
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,000
If I join, I'll stay here.

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,900
Why?

553
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,670
Here?

554
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,660
You seem easiest to get along with.

555
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,780
This is a really hard spot.

556
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,620
When I talk like this, you have to move.

557
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,770
I can do this.

558
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,710
[Gap attacks possible.]

559
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,320
First of all, her face is just too funny.

560
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,360
[Fitting appearance for gap attacks.]

561
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,300
Her looks fit in with us.

562
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,300
Out of everyone, she's the first 
to make us laugh with looks.

563
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,800
- She's too strong. 
- Hong Jin Kyung...

564
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,840
- As soon as she arrived... 
- First time the appearance cracks me up.

565
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,200
Jin Kyung, the other candidates are here.

566
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,780
What do you think?

567
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,410
I called Kwang Hee during the day.

568
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,500
I heard.

569
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,550
I asked what he's doing 
and he said he's taping.

570
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,530
I asked what he was doing later at 9pm.

571
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,640
He said Infinity Challenge.

572
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,720
[The two knew the other was coming.]

573
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,670
I also called Kim Young Chul.

574
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,520
When I asked, he said let's drink.

575
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,230
[He wasn't invited...]

576
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,250
He doesn't know we're filming tonight.

577
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,570
He wanted to drink.

578
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,400
That must be why he called me.

579
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,640
I didn't say anything 
but he saw an article.

580
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,300
He said to call Producer Kim Tae Ho.

581
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,010
Say he's making a mistake.

582
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,340
[They said they would call us soon 
but why haven't they called me yet?]

583
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,150
Have strength, Super Power!

584
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,720
[The others all arrived by car...]

585
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,430
The sixth candidate walks in on his own.]

586
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,090
Who?

587
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,280
[Who is it...?]

588
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,390
[The petite sixth candidate?]

589
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,230
[Yoo Byung Jae - Writer/Actor - 
Big data 1st place, Experts' choice 6th place.]

590
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,330
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: 
Honest, positive, sincere, rejection, charming...]

591
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,070
He said he didn't want it.

592
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,440
He went back and forth.

593
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,470
[Following the directions 
for facial recognition.]

594
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm curious about his reaction.

595
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,490
[Come on in!]

596
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,420
[Byung Jae falling over with joy.]

597
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
[That punk is... impressive...]

598
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,010
[Sending a gaze of resentment.]

599
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,770
His reaction is good.

600
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,660
[Wavering]

601
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
[Surprised]

602
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,680
[Nervous without anything happening.]

603
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,540
It really shocked him.

604
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,600
Come out!

605
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,530
Come out!

606
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,470
Are you there?

607
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,310
I know you're there.

608
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,060
Hmph!

609
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,460
[Bluffing]

610
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,150
[Arriving at stage 2.]

611
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,200
[If that was stage 1...]

612
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,400
[The end of the world.]

613
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,150
[Save me!]

614
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,800
[Blockbuster reaction right 
in front of my eyes!]

615
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,100
[I won't let this go...]

616
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,630
[Calms his heart and enters stage 3.]

617
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,660
Ah, s###!

618
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,760
[Exciting dance moves.]

619
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,820
[Amazing]

620
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,320
[Standing ovation.]

621
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,410
I'm sorry.

622
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,980
[If you're sorry, one more time!]

623
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,310
[Stop doing this...]

624
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,260
Yoo Byung Jae!

625
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,930
[High hopes for the rising 
star of reactions.]

626
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,140
He's strong.

627
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,960
[Fully satisfied.]

628
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,580
[Oh, my tears.]

629
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,310
[Sixth Sixth Man candidate, 
Yoo Byung Jae.]

630
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,610
[A hand's length shorter than Ha Ha.]

631
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,940
You are really small!

632
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,940
[Right into my arms!]

633
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,620
Ha Ha's the happiest to see him.

634
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,630
Why are you laughing at her?

635
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,660
[How can you not laugh?]

636
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,670
Ah, my beard?

637
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,270
- I really like her. 
- Really?

638
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,220
What do you like about me?

639
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,200
You're so funny.

640
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,360
- What are you doing? 
- He said he likes me.

641
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,080
- Be still. 
- Yes.

642
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,930
Your clothes are really nice today.

643
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,340
They said to dress like K*******.

644
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,520
He's like a kindergartener.

645
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,030
Kindergartener!

646
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,410
[His short friend betrayed him.]

647
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,260
How can you say that?

648
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,860
What do you mean kindergartener?

649
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,160
- Byung Jae. 
- Yes.

650
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,700
Have you made a decision?

651
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,370
I was very conflicted.

652
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,700
How do you really feel?

653
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,940
I want to do it.

654
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,080
Honestly, it's a sweet offer...

655
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,840
It's a heavy crown to inherit.

656
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,350
So, I don't want to do it.

657
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,480
You just said...

658
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,050
You just said you wanted it.

659
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,600
- Have you decided to do it? 
- Yes.

660
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,730
Let's pick your spot.

661
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,340
Just say where you would like to be.

662
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,840
Pretend Hyung Don is here.

663
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,720
- Hyung Don's here. 
- Just go where you want to go.

664
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
On the very end.

665
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,210
You won't be seen.

666
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,110
I don't need that. Don't 
really want the spotlight.

667
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,670
Don't lie!

668
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,010
Then don't come here!

669
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,910
[Logical response instead of curses.]

670
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,780
Why did you come?

671
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,930
For the spotlight.

672
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,160
Film me only! Nowhere else!

673
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,360
[Is he really my doppelganger?]

674
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,960
- He's exactly like Myung Soo. 
- Come here.

675
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,920
- He's like a young me. 
- So cute!

676
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,310
As you can see, Byung Jae is in his 20s.

677
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,940
- What? 
- I didn't know.

678
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,960
- 28. 
- He's 28.

679
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,700
Same age as Im Si Wan.

680
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,410
I'm 28, too! How dare you 
use Im Si Wan as an example?

681
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,170
[Neurotic about Im Si Wan!]

682
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,940
[Hard to escape from Si Wan's shadow.]

683
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,060
What did you do today?

684
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,280
I came earlier and ate just out front.

685
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,480
What did you eat?

686
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,440
Buckwheat noodles and dumplings.

687
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,520
By yourself?

688
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,790
- You don't have a manager? 
- No.

689
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,260
No company?

690
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,420
Why are you talking down?

691
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,130
Why are you talking down?

692
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,130
[Fickle man shuts Kwang Hee up.]

693
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,740
[Let's have some manners...]

694
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,610
[He's not wrong.]

695
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,870
I was asking for you.

696
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,360
How dare you?

697
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,500
Hey!

698
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,550
Why don't you have a company?

699
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,300
I don't. I'm a writer.

700
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,100
He's a writer?

701
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:02,890
You didn't know?

702
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,690
What's a writer doing here?

703
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,700
Just keep writing.

704
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,080
He came all the way here.

705
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,450
So this is our sixth Sixth Man candidate,

706
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,320
Yoo Byung Jae!

707
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,900
He's got an incredible height.

708
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,200
So funny.

709
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,930
[Waiting for the next candidate.]

710
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,440
You came like this?

711
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,570
Yes.

712
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,810
Not here?

713
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,480
I came from the salon like this.

714
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,150
They're here.

715
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,050
Not the last one but...

716
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,130
[The seventh candidate?]

717
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,680
[The celebrity pose.]

718
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,830
[Seo Jang Hoon - Now a celeb, 
Big data 8th place, Experts' choice 9th place.]

719
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,160
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: Good, 
honest, big, uptight, incredible, new, laughter...]

720
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,010
[Folded in half for the facial recognition.]

721
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,340
He's so funny. He gets scared easily.

722
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,800
He gets scared so easily.

723
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,460
The door is open.

724
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,650
Facial recognition?

725
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,240
[Entering stage 1.]

726
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,980
[Boom!]

727
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,300
[Flapping]

728
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,210
[Game begins from stage 1.]

729
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,250
[What is this?]

730
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,560
[Staggering]

731
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,710
So surprised...

732
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,600
He gets scared easily.

733
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,700
Look at him.

734
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,020
[Jang Hoon cowering.]

735
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,320
He was Goliath.

736
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,360
He gets scared very easily.

737
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,090
[The dignity of Goliath 
has vanished and now...]

738
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,450
[The master of reactions.]

739
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,680
Seriously!

740
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,360
[Such a celebrity...]

741
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,980
So surprised.

742
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,800
[I'm so scared...]

743
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,690
He has a comedian's face.

744
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm so scared of these things.

745
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,150
[Bam]

746
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,330
[Mommy!!!]

747
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,330
[I want to go home!]

748
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,020
[Running away to the entrance.]

749
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,540
- Hurry up. 
- It's over, come in.

750
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,400
It's over.

751
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,050
[Something else is going to happen...]

752
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,040
There's nothing else!

753
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
So suspicious!

754
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,980
He's a softie.

755
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,100
Our seventh candidate for Sixth Man.

756
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,280
Don't act like you don't want to do it.

757
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,470
He'll say no.

758
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,090
No, that's not it.

759
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,520
I came with different thoughts.

760
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,620
What kind?

761
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,920
[Such a chatty hyung...]

762
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,440
You wore a nice suit!

763
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,280
Looks good.

764
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,470
Different thoughts.

765
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,730
What kind of thoughts?

766
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,720
You will see a new me today.

767
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,880
What will you show us?

768
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,060
The reason I came today 
is because it's so unfair.

769
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,040
What's unfair?

770
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,880
I was mentioned from the very 
beginning for no reason.

771
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,600
I dealt with so many mean comments.

772
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,550
You did?

773
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,810
Since I dealt with that anyways,

774
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,630
it makes sense to take 
that after I've tried it.

775
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,380
[Blabbing on and on.]

776
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,690
So today I'm going to 
be different from usual.

777
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,160
If you want it, just say you want it!

778
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,040
I've let it all go.

779
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,800
And really, I'm furious.

780
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,340
Great, anyways. Whether you felt it was 
unfair or not, thank you again for coming here.

781
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,450
So seven of the Sixth Man 
candidates have gathered here.

782
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,560
One person hasn't come yet.

783
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,650
This person will come after 
a pre-scheduled event ends.

784
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,020
They're too busy!

785
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,750
So with the eight Sixth Man candidates 
who received invitations,

786
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,960
and with all of you 
who have participated,

787
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,460
Infinity Challenge!

788
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,770
[Sixth Man Secret Member]

789
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,160
[Byung Jae enters alone.]

790
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,010
[Empty]

791
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,800
[Enjoying the freedom of the empty room.]

792
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,040
[Gyun Sung enters just in time.]

793
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,900
[The two candidates sit far apart.]

794
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,290
[Hoobae singer Siwon enters.]

795
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,420
Hee Chul's hair is 
about as long as yours.

796
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,520
Hee Chul?

797
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,020
[Cheery with their talk.]

798
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,580
[Sitting on pins and needles.]

799
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,360
I didn't know Choi Siwon would come.

800
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,410
Last week, I thought he was just a guest.

801
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,780
He really came.

802
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,220
I wondered if he really wanted to do it.

803
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,990
It's cold.

804
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,850
[Everyone nervous at the 
fighting rooster's entrance?]

805
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,730
Byung Jae.

806
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,230
[So happy to just hear his name.]

807
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,370
[Daddy long legs Jang Hoon.]

808
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,920
[Youngest Kwang Hee.]

809
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,340
[All the candidates gather.]

810
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,520
[Eyes sparkling.]

811
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,570
As soon as I saw Jin Kyung, 
I thought she'd get it.

812
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,150
I think it's a good opportunity to 
add a new aspect of her as a woman.

813
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,080
To be honest, Hong Jin Kyung.

814
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,470
Hong Jin Kyung.

815
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,190
Too funny.

816
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,520
[Her prediction is Kwang Hee!]

817
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,120
Jang Dong Min.

818
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,360
Not sure.

819
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,240
[Not even the candidates can predict.]

820
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,200
Will someone really get picked?

821
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,800
[Out of us?]

822
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,320
It'll really be one of us?

823
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,260
No. It might not be.

824
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,020
If it's not one of us, 
Infinity Challenge will be in trouble.

825
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,540
Imagine if it's one of us.

826
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,680
[One of us... maybe me?]

827
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,640
Siwon looks like a work of art.

828
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,910
[Responding with an American reaction.]

829
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,400
And he happens to be next 
to Jang Hoon and Dong Min.

830
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,890
A work of art.

831
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,790
My eyes feel refreshed.

832
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,740
Why did you sit here?

833
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,820
[What is it?]

834
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,000
After filming,

835
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,440
you will all vote to pick four people.

836
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,840
We'll let you know the 
results afterwards.

837
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,660
The eight Sixth Man 
candidates invited today.

838
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,950
The final candidates will 
be decided by their votes.

839
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,180
Who will be the final 
Sixth Man candidate?

840
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,930
[After the producer's announcement...]

841
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,220
[Thinking...]

842
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,240
[Only half of us will be picked?]

843
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,430
[A silence fills the dressing room.]

844
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,780
Many people just physically can't do it.

845
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,720
Siwon definitely can't.

846
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,380
It's not possible? 
You can wrap things up.

847
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,990
I think they want Siwon the most,

848
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,880
but the world won't let him be.

849
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,180
Don't be fooled, Infinity Challenge.

850
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,760
It's up to Siwon.

851
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,360
He could if he stayed in 
country. He goes international.

852
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,270
There's too much money involved.

853
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,370
He would be fine without the money.

854
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,580
Come on.

855
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,900
He wants it, why do you 
think it won't happen?

856
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,330
Why put up the fences?

857
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,990
[Siwon is the #1 competition.]

858
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,520
Why put up the fences? I'm just grateful.

859
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,350
I've been abroad a lot so I think I could 
create some more humorous scenes.

860
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,320
[Sixth Man Secret Member]

861
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,760
[Agent Jung Hyung Don joins in 
the Sixth Man headquarters.]

862
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,010
[The candidates enter the 
heart of Sixth Man project.]

863
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,660
[Let's see...]

864
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,130
Jin Kyung.

865
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,940
Oh, my God!

866
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,920
[Hyung Don's first time 
seeing Jin Kyung.]

867
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:49,970
What the?

868
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,310
Nice.

869
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,460
Hong Jin Kyung.

870
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,980
- It's cheating. 
- Her face is cheating.

871
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,940
[Face clearly cheating.]

872
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,350
She's a girl.

873
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,940
There were so many comments saying 
I couldn't do it because I'm a girl.

874
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,380
It's just too funny.

875
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,910
I came because I wanted to show you 
that I could play a man and woman.

876
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,900
[Not fair.]

877
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,190
Anyways, everyone.

878
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,530
Thank you all for being here.

879
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,400
The member who couldn't come yet due 
to his schedule will arrive soon.

880
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,990
Who's not busy? Why wait 
for someone like him?

881
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,040
I changed my flight time.

882
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,340
From when to when?

883
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,570
From evening to day.

884
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,300
[Dedicated enough to return to 
Korea because of Sixth Man.]

885
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,010
Subtitles Ripped By www.vikisubtitle.com
Great attitude.

886
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,290
I had a two part shoot today.

887
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,260
I See Your Voice.

888
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,920
But I just didn't film the 
second part because of this.

889
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,740
But this guy's working?

890
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,750
How arrogant...

891
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,130
[The last candidate arrives just in time.]

892
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,870
[The final person to join Sixth Man?]

893
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,300
[Huh?]

894
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,870
[Jeon Hyun Moo - Multi-entertainer, 
Big data 7th place, Experts choice 2nd place.]

895
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,880
[Related key words after Sixth Man aired: 
New, busy, hard, not a good fit, popular, good...]

896
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,040
[Arriving with bananas on his head.]

897
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,900
[Shape of bananas visible from afar.]

898
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,620
Is this it?

899
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,500
Ring the bell and open 
after facial recognition.

900
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,990
[Why's it so quiet...]

901
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,900
[Boldly opens the door and enters.]

902
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,700
[Trembling]

903
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,230
Oh, my God!

904

like a poplar tree.]

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,280
It scared me.

906
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,820
[One more time.]

907
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,730
What is that?

908
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,380
[Doesn't lose bananas.]

909
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,200
That scared me.

910
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,520
[Looking around.]

911
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,780
[Even the silhouette of the 
banana head is strange.]

912
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,120
I'm scared, is this a haunted house?

913
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,890
[Goes closer to the empty 
car while on edge.]

914
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,220
[Stage 2: Honking the horn!]

915
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,930
[Hot mess.]

916
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,480
[Offbeat footsteps.] 
[Still doesn't lose the bananas.]

917
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,520
[Clear voice that shows his 
background as an announcer.]

918
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,550
[Rich reaction at a high decibel!]

919
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,240
Where do I go?

920
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,700
Don't!

921
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,880
[Nothing there yet...]

922
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,520
[Embarrassed...]

923
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,280
Don't!

924
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,120
[Creeping]

925
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,130
[Quickly]

926
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,110
[Sudden roadblock by the ghost doll.]

927
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,220
[A scene created with a powerful 
voice and a giant fuss.]

928
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,060
[100% insane.]

929
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,320
[Much more scary looking 
than the ghost doll.]

930
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,960
Fine, I won't do it!

931
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,320
[Should I go or not?]

932
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,670
[After screaming one more time.]

933
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,620
[With no one around to watch him.]

934
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,850
[The final candidate completes the course.]

935
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,010
Before he comes,

936
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,290
what did you do today?

937
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,120
Siwon?

938
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,340
I arrived this morning.

939
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,930
From where?

940
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,450
From the US.

941
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,780
[Surprised]

942
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,100
- Who did you meet? 
- A Hollywood movie?

943
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,940
Drama and a movie.

944
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,210
Do that!

945
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,300
He's busy even without this.

946
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,010
[Rough voice fits right in.]

947
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,150
For a moment I thought you were a thief.

948
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,480
Aren't you Lee Won Seung?

949
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,780
Pizza please!

950
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,760
I thought she was a thief.

951
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,920
I thought you were a thief.

952
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,830
What did you do, Jin Kyung?

953
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,950
For me, I did my makeup this morning.

954
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,210
[She merely told the truth.]

955
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
Yoo Byung Jae, what did you do?

956
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,170
An interview and meeting.

957
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,640
You look so tired.

958
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Right?

959
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,380
No, I'm not really.

960
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,040
Kang Gyun Sung looks very tired.

961
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,540
- Kang Gyun Sung? 
- They're so competitive.

962
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,980
- Your eyes always half closed? 
- Yes, I have thick double lids.

963
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,040
Then your eyes should be more 
open, not halfway closed.

964
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,420
You only curse?

965
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,320
That side is intense.

966
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,760
Overall, there are some 
intense people here.

967
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,430
Are you saying that side is weak?

968
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,260
This side is at ease.

969
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,320
[Eyes that don't seem at ease.]

970
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,620
Hong Jin Kyung?

971
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,310
[Intently looking for someone.]

972
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,170
Looking for PD Kim Tae Ho again?

973
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,120
I don't see him.

974
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,210
Where's PD Kim Tae Ho?

975
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,380
[Gaze continuously going to one place...]

976
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,780
You're noticing the 
producer's reaction a lot.

977
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,520
I tend to look a lot. If he doesn't seem 
pleased, I move on to the next topic.

978
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,150
You keep looking for him.

979
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,210
Look at honeybee producer.

980
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,630
[Just then!]

981
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,960
[Finally, the last candidate.]

982
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,230
[Entrance of magnificent color.]

983
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,550
A commercial.

984
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,970
Everyone here has filmed 
a commercial before!

985
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,740
You should have left it, 
why did you wear it here?

986
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,540
I wanted to show off.

987
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,420
I'm sorry for being late.

988
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,600
Nice to see you.

989
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,530
[Confused]

990
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,880
Jeon Hyun Moo.

991
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,920
What? We were waiting for Jeon Hyun Moo?

992
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,720
[Feeling of injustice after the long wait.]

993
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,620
Jeon Hyun Moo.

994
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,480
- You have many shows but you know about this, right? 
- Of course.

995
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,730
Looking at your jacket, it 
seems you don't know at all.

996
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,430
They didn't tell me what to wear at all.

997
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,460
I had no idea I had to wear a suit.

998
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,600
Everyone, thank you again 
to all of you participating.

999
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,780
Out of the 21 Sixth Man candidates,

1000
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,310
we sent invitations to 8.

1001
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,210
And so, we are here today.

1002
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,350
- Again, welcome. 
- Welcome!

1003
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,270
To verify the talents and 
qualifications of the Sixth Man,

1004
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,220
we will have an Investigative Debate.

1005
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,170
[Candidate Investigative Debate.]

1006
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,030
Why should you be the Sixth Man?

1007
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:03,060
Please introduce yourself 
in the given thirty seconds.

1008
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,130
First,

1009
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,450
Hwang Kwang Hee.

1010
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,100
Why me first?

1011
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,470
Please.

1012
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,940
Going first is the best!

1013
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,440
[Cheers up.]

1014
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,140
30 seconds. Start.

1015
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,860
Yes, yes.

1016
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,910
It started.

1017
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,780
Oh, yes.

1018
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,900
So I...

1019
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,510
Um...

1020
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,720
I need a breakthrough, sunbae.

1021
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,120
I think it's time to 
add some young blood.

1022
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,100
I thought Star King would be very 
upset to hear I was coming here,

1023
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,120
but they said they'll send me off.

1024
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,820
If I get cut here, I have 
no job on Saturdays.

1025
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,680
I must do this.

1026
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,740
Oh, no. No time left.

1027
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,780
- I would really like it. 
- Okay, please sit.

1028
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,510
We're strict on time.

1029
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,650
To make it fair for all candidates.

1030
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,380
Next is Kang Gyun Sung.

1031
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,080
I was ahead of myself.

1032
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,360
[I was a bit too rash.]

1033
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,480
Choi Siwon!

1034
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,350
[American style gestures.]

1035
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,350
Next is Kang Gyun Sung.

1036
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,570
Hello.

1037
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,910
I'm Kang Gyun Sung.

1038
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,020
I'm...

1039
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,060
...crazy.

1040
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,980
[Multiple personalities 
jumping out without warning.]

1041
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,110
If you trust me...

1042
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,480
I will become the new psycho.

1043
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,500
NP.

1044
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,000
Not the same character.

1045
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,400
Young.

1046
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,380
[Ending like a pretty flower.]

1047
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,690
[Perfect timing.]

1048
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,900
[So scary.]

1049
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,740
Short and sweet!

1050
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,510
Wow! In just a few words.

1051
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,310
Got it.

1052
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,490
Next.

1053
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,060
[Finally me?]

1054
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,750
Seo Jang Hoon.

1055
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
- Two each. 
- Funny.

1056
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,090
As I've said many times,

1057
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,940
I had no ambitions in the beginning.

1058
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,160
I said I wouldn't do it.

1059
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,830
So why did I come today?

1060
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,070
The people who said mean things. 
I came because of them.

1061
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,380
Starting today,

1062
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,720
I will relieve all the 
resentment in my heart.

1063
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,650
[Honestly expressing his competitiveness!]

1064
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,670
Great. Next is Choi Siwon.

1065
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,090
[Overly good-looking...]

1066
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,080
So good-looking.

1067
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,050
Start.

1068
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,380
What use are words?

1069
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,820
[Right...?]

1070
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,860
[American reaction only possible by him.]

1071
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,080
American expression!

1072
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,560
In simpler terms,

1073
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,090
Hollywood hand movements.

1074
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,000
I am ready to become the...

1075
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,180
[Like watching a commercial.]

1076
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,190
perfect candidate.

1077
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,300
[He's good.]

1078
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,340
I am ready to let go.

1079
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,860
To let myself go.

1080
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,860
You be the judge.

1081
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,040
[Okay?]

1082
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,800
[Feels like they already lost to 
the classy American gestures.]

1083
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,410
Every move is a photoshoot.

1084
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Every move is a photoshoot.

1085
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,180
Next, Jang Dong Min.

1086
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
[Jang Dong Min has a different vibe.]

1087
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,420
Hello, I'm Jang Dong Min.

1088
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,640
For the past ten years, Infinity Challenge 
gave us a taste of humor.

1089
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,760
[Copying Siwon's hands.]

1090
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,410
But you know, with taste...

1091
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:55,260
people want something 
even stronger and bolder.

1092
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,680
If you've sucked it dry for 10 years,

1093
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,640
what's left?

1094
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,340
[He's... good.]

1095
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,760
You need something stronger and bolder

1096
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,250
for Infinity Challenge to last 20, 30 years.

1097
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,660
- I'll let you be the judge. 
- One last curse.

1098
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,680
Shut up, %$#@.

1099
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,980
[Alarm rings perfectly on time.]

1100
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,420
I needed to talk.

1101
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,220
Myung Soo's nervous.

1102
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,160
[Sense of danger for the old potty mouth.]

1103
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,260
And now next,

1104
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,400
Lee Won Seung.

1105
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,180
[Fits better than her real name.]

1106
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,150
Now, our...

1107
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,000
Hong Du Kkae.

1108
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,040
Oh, my belly button.

1109
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,250
Everyone here is talented and 
influential in the celebrity world.

1110
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,430
Dumplings, please.

1111
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,460
You turn on the TV and...

1112
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,570
Kimchi dumplings!

1113
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,480
these hottest and the most 
talented here come on.

1114
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,470
However, you cannot 
find me on any channel.

1115
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,920
That's how it is.

1116
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,240
My rarity.

1117
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,190
Rarity?

1118
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,190
Not scarcity?

1119
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,260
[Not enough time to correct them.]

1120
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,200
That's it.

1121
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,220
[Tearing up.]

1122
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,520
Hong Jin Kyung. Time's up.

1123
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,260
- I understand. 
- I'm sorry, but...

1124
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,520
[Same gaze.]

1125
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,860
Hong Jin Kyung. Where are you looking?

1126
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,980
At the writer.

1127
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,480
[A speech with nothing except her face.]

1128
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,160
It's scarcity, not rarity.

1129
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,250
Yoo Byung Jae.

1130
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,820
[Same height standing.]

1131
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,400
I love his height.

1132
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,460
Hello, I'm Yoo Byung Jae. 
Thank you for having me again.

1133
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,390
From the beginning and now, 
Infinity Challenge has always

1134
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,170
been about being less than average.

1135
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,170
I think I can fulfill that.

1136
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,750
As you mentioned, my height is 5'4".

1137
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,440
Same as my mom.

1138
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,450
[He fits best with the 
Infinity Challenge mentality.]

1139
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,580
I am truly below average.

1140
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,650
He's funny.

1141
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,530
- You're saying, that's me. 
- Yes.

1142
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,340
Next is the man who wore 
a jacket to K*******.

1143
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,180
It's kind of small.

1144
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,740
[Tight]

1145
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,350
Jeon Hyun Moo, please.

1146
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,720
It seems you all have one 
thing in common excluding me.

1147
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,830
Look at the camera.

1148
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,620
Ten seconds have passed!

1149
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,090
[Even accepts the advice of rivals.]

1150
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,310
A lot of time has passed, Jeon Hyun Moo.

1151
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,450
[Hehe]

1152
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,000
To be honest, I have want for nothing.

1153
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,600
I am a multi-celebrity.

1154
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,300
I have 9 shows.

1155
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,560
But the fact that I still came here

1156
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,000
means Infinity Challenge needs me.

1157
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,060
- You need me. 
- That's it.

1158
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,640
[The clock shuts his mouth.]

1159
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,960
- Some more time... 
- Please sit.

1160
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,930
You need to manage it.

1161
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,520
In the given time.

1162
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,250
[Sweating...]

1163
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,180
You started as a KBS announcer.

1164
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,860
This is the old MBC meeting room.

1165
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,100
I failed an announcer exam here.

1166
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,680
- Here? 
- Here.

1167
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,100
Lost to Oh Sang Jin.

1168
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,490
Please stop talking about that.

1169
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,640
[Oops]

1170
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,620
He's trying hard.

1171
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,480
[Depressed...]

1172
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,870
[Everyone bring themselves down.]

1173
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,200
[Sixth Man Project Endorsements.]

1174
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,340
Hello, I'm Park Hyung Shik. 
Nice to meet you.

1175
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,760
I heard Kwang Hee is 
a Sixth Man candidate.

1176
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,270
I am an eternal fan of Infinity Challenge

1177
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,580
so even if he doesn't become a member, 
I will be a viewer forever so...

1178
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,460
Kwang Hee, fighting.

1179
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,000
Infinity Challenge, fighting!

1180
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,190
Honestly...

1181
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,580
[He's not sure about his support either.] 
[Heo Ji Woong]

1182
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,110
Jang Dong Min...

1183
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,880
I want to nominate Yoo Sang Moo.

1184
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,360
Why wasn't he a candidate?

1185
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:42,900
On TV, I think Gyun Sung 
was exceptionally funny.

1186
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,070
Dong Min...

1187
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,710
Right, I came to talk about Dong Min.

1188
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,360
Jang Dong Min is...

1189
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,060
[This is hard...]

1190
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,040
It could be good.

1191
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,570
Try Dong Min out then.

1192
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,900
He'll probably have a scandal soon.

1193
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,580
[A pro that he could 
be easily swapped out.]

1194
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,060
What Hyun Moo's best at is dancing.

1195
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,640
There aren't a lot of people who can 
confidently dance a variety of dances.

1196
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:15,380
If he was on Infinity Challenge,

1197
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,630
he could be in charge of dancing.

1198
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,700
For Seo Jang Hoon,

1199
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,210
in Kevin and Giant of Temptation

1200
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,990
he showed that he has good 
chemistry with the members.

1201
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,070
To be honest, Infinity Challenge has used

1202
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:35,080
a lot of people discovered on Radio Star.

1203
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,800
I strongly advocate Seo Jang Hoon.

1204
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,640
[From the original voice 
imitator to the new.]

1205
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,660
Hello, I'm Nam Bo Won.

1206
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,870
I think he's quite talented.

1207
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,500
He was born with a great voice.

1208
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,120
If he works hard, he 
can also be number one.

1209
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,200
She lies so well.

1210
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,830
I've been tricked so many times.

1211
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,760
Seriously.

1212
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,840
Not just a few times.

I'm proud of you.

1216
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,400
I'm always cheering you on.

1218
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,520
Lend me some money.

Hello, I'm Yoo Byung Jae.

1220
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,040
I don't have any celeb friends

1221
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,520
so I asked a hyung I hang out with.

1222
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,850
I'm very worried.

1223
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,380
Hello, I'm Yoo Gyu Sun.

1224

Just do it.

1228
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,410
Just do it?

1229
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,490
As the Sixth Man...

1230
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,480
Byung Jae doesn't have 
a driver's license.

1231
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,250
That means it can't get revoked.

1232
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,700
Know what I mean?

1233
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,600
I recommend candidate Yoo Byung Jae!

Hello everyone, I'm Eddie Peng.

1236
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,640
He is hilarious, man. 
You guys just have to pick him.

1237
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,380
You never know.

1238
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,520
I could be the seventh if you want.

1239
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,850
I mean, him.

1240
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,080
I heard Choi Siwon was chosen 
as a candidate for Sixth Man.

1241
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,340
I'm here to offer words of endorsement.

1242
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,990
Choi Siwon is a very dedicated 
and sociable young man.

1243
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,200
One concern is that...

1244
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,960
because this is a show with 
many long term projects,

1245
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,220
whether Siwon, who spends a lot 
of time abroad, could handle it.

1246
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,300
I do have this concern, 
but that's his problem.

1247
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,180
Regardless, Infinity Challenge!

[Solid]

1258
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,830
Let's begin part 1.

1259
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,820
As you all know, as a celebrity

1260
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,620
at times we receive a lot 
of compliments and applause,

1261
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,120
but there are also times we 
receive tough love and criticism.

1262
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,390
We will now assess how 
you deal with this.

00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:26,100
In order to check your coping skills, 
we will check your heart rate.

1264
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,470
[Famous with international top stars,

1265
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,380
[Heated interest about Sixth Man.]

1266
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,180
[How will they react to some tough love?]

1267
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,580
- They're reading comments? 
- Yes.

1268
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,270
They say the experienced take it well.

1269
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,400
[Pricks his conscience.]

1270
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,690
Ask him!

1271
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,000
[Why me...]

1272
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,890
Among us, the eldest hyung.

1273
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,660
He has some great experience 
receiving mean comments.

1274
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,500
[He won't read them himself.]

1275
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,230
We'll see how he handles it.

1276
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,040
You can see his heart rate 
on the screen, 63 bpm.

1277
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,310
He's at a very calm state.

1278
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:08,710
I will now read the comments.

1279
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,860
If you've had enough, say stop.

1280
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,280
Such a thrill to see Myung Soo 
feel nervous about Dong Min.

1281
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,750
It's going up.

1282
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,600
Just by mentioning Jang Dong Min.

1283
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,180
Can I go on?

1284
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,700
With just the mention of Dong Min.

1285
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,170
Why do you look like such a bird?

1286
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,700
[Pretending to be calm 
but heart rate rising.]

1287
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,860
Shall I go on?

1288
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,120
Park Myung Soo! Yoon Jong Shin! 
Clothes don't matter, they're so ugly.

1289
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,410
[Heart rate dropping at being called ugly.]

1290
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,040
It dropped at being called ugly.

1291
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,480
Myung Soo found his peace 
again after being called ugly.

1292
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,720
He's okay with being ugly but not a bird?

1293
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,820
It's like a lullaby to him.

1294
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,920
We did this as a brief test.

1295
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,390
Now, everyone.

1296
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,430
Even as you read the numerous mean 
comments about yourselves one page at a time,

1297
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,430
if you can't take any 
more, you can say stop.

1298
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,570
- Got it? 
- Yes.

1299
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,340
First, we'll start with Kang Gyun Sung.

1300
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,340
Probably not much.

1301
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,800
[Heart rate shown in live time.]

1302
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,440
It's showing up.

1303
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,110
Low heart rate.

1304
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,030
[Fascinating]

1305
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,450
[I must control my feelings!]

1306
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,700
He just seems crazy.

1307
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,150
It went over 100.

1308
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,890
It shot up.

1309
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:38,300
His expiration date is up. 
He's already run out.

1310
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,500
[Oh, really?]

1311
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,120
He's very...

1312
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,520
[Calm down.]

1313
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,600
You can stop if you 
don't want to see more.

1314
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,430
I won't watch if he gets picked.

1315
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,720
How is he funny?

1316
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,610
Is he going to imitate voices forever?

1317
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,660
You think I will?

1318
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,880
You can reply back.

1319
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,360
You can reply back.

1320
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,900
Multiple personalities.

1321
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,000
Kang Gyun Sung.

1322
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,220
He was quiet as a guest, but he 
suddenly wants to be the Sixth Man?

1323
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,580
So two-faced.

1324
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,630
I never said I wanted it.

1325
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,230
It's not true!

1326
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,520
Next.

1327
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,140
- I'm nervous. 
- I just did this.

1328
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,720
Yelling with multiple personalities 
is typical of one hit wonders.

1329
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,190
You just did that!

1330
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,540
I'm one hit.

1331
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,720
Knock you out in one hit with laughter.

1332
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,260
[Goosebumps!]

1333
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,590
Nice.

1334
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,190
I'm done.

1335
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,220
[Unbeatable multiple personalities.]

1336
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,200
Kwang Hee.

1337
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,230
Read one page at a time.

1338
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,510
Kwang Hee seems the type 
to get hurt easily.

1339
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,540
- You can say stop. 
- It's already rising.

1340
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,480
He's anticipating it.

1341
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,000
Kwang Hee. Ready?

1342
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,370
I'll start.

1343
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,530
Not funny, noisy, chaotic.

1344
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,500
Why the heck is he a candidate?

1345
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,300
[Not bad.]

1346
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,550
This is fine.

1347
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,700
Kwang Hee? He's old news.

1348
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,130
He's long been a wallflower 
now thanks to Im Si Wan.

1349
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,070
Is it going up?

1350
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,040
[What'd you say?]

1351
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,620
Will you continue?

1352
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,740
I can do it.

1353
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,080
[Exciting]

1354
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,430
It's getting close to 90 bpm.

1355
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,760
Kwang Hee has a soft will like tofu.

1356
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,980
Isn't it obvious from his whining?

1357
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,020
[Shaking...]

1358
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,980
It got him.

1359
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,010
[Smiling but his heart rate...]

1360
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,750
You seem very angry.

1361
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,780
- Are you okay? 
- Yes, one more.

1362
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,650
I'm curious.

1363
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,620
[Have strength!]

1364
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,600
Can I not read it and just sit?

1365
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,330
You can stop.

1366
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,310
You can stop.

1367
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,960
I'm curious.

1368
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,500
My goodness.

1369
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,000
Can't you tell he's a one time thing?

1370
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,060
He's not good enough to fit.

1371
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,170
[Calm]

1372
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,570
- Are you okay? 
- It's going up.

1373
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,550
I make a good living and 
I came with a happy heart.

1374
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,440
Tell them to show their face.

1375
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:15,460
[Anger explosion in 10 seconds!]

1376
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,020
They need to use their real names!

1377
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,550
Kwang Hee's not good enough.

1378
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,020
You think you're good enough?

1379
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,120
You try!

1380
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,400
You try!

1381
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,600
[Hitting the breaking point.]

1382
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,660
I came of my own free will!

1383
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,970
What a weird person.

1384
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:37,980
Please sit.

1385
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,500
[Refreshing blunt response technique.]

1386
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,460
Choi Siwon, next.

1387
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,780
He has mean comments?

1388
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,900
I have a lot.

1389
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,410
That person would get in 
huge trouble from fans.

1390
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,620
These days, the fans do it.

1391
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:53,720
[Smile]

1392
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,940
Look at his smile.

1393
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,800
[Disgusting imitation.]

1394
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,520
When did he laugh like that?

1395
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,090
Just now!

1396
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,000
How?

1397
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,560
[Totally different grins.]

1398
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,150
[Disgust]

1399
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,740
Like before.

1400
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,200

Siwon.

1404
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,630
I wouldn't take Siwon's face.

1405
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:19,000
No thanks to that weaselly Chinman.

1406
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,080
He sort of looks like him.

1407
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,280
Where does this person live?

1408
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,950
Mokdong.

1409
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,280
Next.

1410
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,420
He's too sleazy.

1411
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,800
- You can stop. 
- I know.

1412
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,290
[Wink]

1413
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,780
[Entranced...]

1414
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,990
Seriously, Siwon.

1415
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,380
Do you have a sleazy move?

1416
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,770
- Sleazy pose? 
- The end to all sleaziness.

1417
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,610
Be as cute as possible.

1418
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,510
Giving a cocktail to a woman.

1419
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,530
Use me as a model.

1420
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,620
[Excited Mr. Hong.]

1421
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,540
I can't get into character.

1422
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,720
[Shall we?]

1423
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,480
[Like oil.]

1424
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,360
[American reaction.]

1425
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,130
[Happy eyes.]

1426
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,330
Great.

1427
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,370
Even when he laughed by himself.

1428
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,700
[King of American reactions.]

1429

Great, great.

1431
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,260
His life is an exaggeration, especially 
him trying to be on Infinity Challenge.

1432

[Rising at the mention of Sixth Man.]

[You feel me?]

1436
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,220
They say he's popular in China, 
but he's less so in Korea.

1437
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,840
I'm popular in China 
because I am in Korea.

1438

I'm sick of his English pronunciations.

1442
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,780
I don't wanna be like you.

1443
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,100
[Nice, right?]

1444
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,660
Should I be stiff then?

1445
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,210
When in Rome, do as the Romans do!

1446
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,710
Nice, nice.

1447
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,700
Next is Hong Jin Kyung.

1448
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,990
[Clip clop.]

1449
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,880
Hong Jin Kyung.

1450
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,830
[What's wrong with you...]

1451
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,730
Like my dad.

1452
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,300
[Her energy has plummeted 
since the beginning.]

1453
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,990
Are you already tired?

1454
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,080
Slightly.

1455
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,360
What is your weakness?

1456
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,260
My stamina is very weak.

1457
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:25,310
I get tired very quickly.

1458
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:27,500
Physical strength is very important.

1459
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,410
If I do it, I'll just film 
the opening and leave.

1460
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Just the opening.

1461
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,800
[Overcoming her limits past the opening.]

1462
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,700
Every time I see her, she 
looks like Son Heung Min.

1463
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:48,800
She does look like him!

1464
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,620
You do!

1465
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,410
[Mr. Hong can't deny it.]

1466
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,420
This unni looks like a cucumber.

1467
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,950
Please read slowly.

1468
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:01,490
Including the talk about capitals,

1469
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:04,710
she's ignorant but pretends she's smart.

1470
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,960
Are you ignorant or smart?

1471
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,820
I...

1472
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,640
don't think it's a problem of either one.

1473
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,220
Ask us one difficult 
capital we won't know.

1474
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,390
[Thinking]

1475
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,150
Maldives.

1476
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,780
The capital of Maldives.

1477
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:22,550
Do you know?

1478
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,000
What is it?

1479
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Mali.

1480
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,620
Mali's a country.

1481
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:27,980
Male.

1482
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,420
Male.

1483
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,750
It's right. Mali, Male.

1484
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,950
It's right!

1485
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,560
[Arguing with her shallow knowledge.]

1486
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,030
Let's go with Seo Jang Hoon.

1487
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,130
- It's originally high. 
- He's always angry.

1488
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,120
Seo Jang Hoon?

1489
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,890
Is this show for the 
middle aged or something?

1490
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,680
120!

1491
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,310
Next.

1492
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:58,620
Buying any eyes that haven't seen 
Seo Jang Hoon's "Up Down" dance.

1493
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,110
[What's that?]

1494
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,200
Oh, my eyes.

1495
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,490
Oh, my eyes.

1496
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,680
Eyes that haven't seen his dance.

1497
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,560
I was wondering what that meant.

1498
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,080
[Eyes that haven't been 
contaminated by this sight.]

1499
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,310
[Slow to understand comments.]

1500
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,700
Jang Dong Min.

1501
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,480
The mean commenters need to worry.

1502
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:30,140
[Expert in curses of justice.]

1503
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:30,180
You can say whatever you want.

1504
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,570
It's already 154 bpm.

1505
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,470
[About to explode from anger 
even before starting.]

1506
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,690
Don't do it!

1507
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,220
I already have high blood pressure.

1508
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,900
[Assessment ended for the 
safety of his health.]

1509
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,370
Yoo Byung Jae, start.

1510
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,360
It's already starting at 135.

1511
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,170
I hate Yoo Byung Jae's pathetic face.

1512
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,710
[Curious]

1513
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:58,650
[Sorry...]

1514
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,210
It's automatic!

1515
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:03,950
Yoo Byung Jae sucks.

1516
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,980
I hate his loser character.

1517
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,340
[You hate me that much...?]

1518
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,510
[Pitiful face incites sympathy.]

1519
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,420
Next is Jeon Hyun Moo starting at 103.

1520
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,360
Let's go.

1521
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:25,160
I don't want to imagine it, but 
he looks like he's hairy all over.

1522
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,600
What is that?

1523
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,970
On your back?

1524
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,600
Back, stomach, everywhere.

1525
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,870
Shoulders, too.

1526
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,110
Like seaweed.

1527
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,260
Is it all connected?

1528
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,830
Must you use your hands like that?

1529
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,120
It is connected.

1530
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,130
[Safely gets past the 
first mean comment.]

1531
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,400
Another?

1532
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,480
Hyung Moo's face looks like a dog.

1533
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,530
It really does!

1534
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,160
I look like a dog. A shih tzu.

1535
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,750
But you really do.

1536
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,880
Shih tzu.

1537
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,270
It's slowly going up.

1538
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,390
115.

1539
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,400
[About to read the next comment.]

1540
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,040
Want to stop?

1541
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:08,510
Jeon Hyun Moo is the type of man I'd 
hate to meet in person in everyday life.

1542
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,510
Want to stop?

1543
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,750
- Jeon Hyun Moo. 
- No.

1544
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,110
[Oh, no.]

1545
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,920
- Want to stop? 
- I can't respond.

1546
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,440
You can stop.

1547
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,120
I'll keep going.

1548
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,790
He's on every single 
channel, so sick of him.

1549
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,800
Seems like quantity over quality. 
He must be obsessed with money.

1550
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,600
This was written by one person?

1551
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,170
One person wrote a long one.

1552
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,710
One person wrote a continuous one.

1553
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,970
The style is similar.

1554
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,120
He said quantity over quality.

1555
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,440
I came here to go for 
quality over quantity.

1556
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,480
Next.

1557
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,980
He wants to take a part of 
God Yoo's hosting, is he crazy?

1558
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,400
He must think he's really good.

1559
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,320
OMG.

1560
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,520
[Heart rate rising.]

1561
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,920
It's going up a lot.

1562
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,220
Can he continue?

1563
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,980
- Stop? 
- Keep going.

1564
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:56,870
Great.

1565
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,900
[Freeze]

1566
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,490
I'll stop here.

1567
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,130
One last one.

1568
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,500
I just hate him.

1569
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,250
[Assessment ends painfully.]

1570
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,780
What was the worst?

1571
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,060
The type of man I'd hate to meet 
in person in everyday life.

1572
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,700
It really hurt.

1573
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,080
It's okay to not want to see me on TV.

1574
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,920
But they hate me in real life, too.

1575
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,250
Hate to meet.

1576
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,000
Like asking me to leave Korea.

1577
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,750
Overall the many sides of you all,

1578
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,960
for each one of you...

1579
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,710
Hong Jin Kyung!

1580
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,330
She has a serious face.

1581
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,900
Like a picture.

1582
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,270
Hong Jin Kyung!

1583
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,300
[Eyes about to close.]

1584
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,830
It's like you're at a 
parent teacher meeting.

1585
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,170
[After ending the simple part 1...]

1586
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,440
Everyone.

1587
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,640
It's not exactly humiliating but...

1588
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,120
we have some impressive 
pictures of you all.

1589
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,890
[A test of strong mental strength.]

1590
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,240
[First, Kwang Hee.]

1591
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,520
Kwang Hee.

1592
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,500
[Embarrassed x100.]

1593
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,890
[Born again thanks to 
the almighty doctor.]

1594
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,240
[Oh, my stomach.]

1595
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,760
[Kwang Hee's pre-surgery picture 
where he looks like Baekga.]

1596
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,720
[Mr. Hong exhausted from laughing.]

1597
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,980
[Undoubtedly Kwang Hee.]

1598
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,050
Really?

1599
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,340
- It's Kwang Hee. 
- There's more?

1600
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,850
Let's look at Jang Dong Min.

1601
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,460
Why?

1602
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,720
[Cheap]

1603
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,880
[Why did I do that?]

1604
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,600
Jang Dong Min. This is nothing.

1605
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:40,900
The next one.

1606
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,080
[Call me Min oppa.]

1607
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,140
[Dark past of young fashion courage.]

1608
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:50,170
Are you Gong Gil?

1609
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,180
[The King and the Clown.]

1610
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,780
Is this Bae Yong Joon?

1611
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,420
[Continuous visual attacks.]

1612
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,880
[Man]

1613
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,000
[Tearing up.]

1614
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,560
[What happened back then?]

1615
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,260
Next is Choi Siwon.

1616
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,290
I have a lot.

1617
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,000
[Lightly starting with a 
cute picture of his past.]

1618
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,600
[Titled "Kim Siwon Fortune Cookie".]

1619
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,260
[Embarrassed]

1620
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,720
Siwon's aren't very...

1621
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,710
[Manly]

1622
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,060
[Strong man.]

1623
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,060
[I think I look cool.]

1624
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,700
[Addicted to Siwon's actions.]

1625
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,370
[Follow me!]

1626
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,800
[So fun!]

1627
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,920
[Different than me.]

1628
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,640
I love those kind of pictures.

1629
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,120
You know!

1630
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:56,730
[Smooch!]

1631
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,760
[Worked up.]

1632
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,290
[So cool!]

1633
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,470
Get ready to grab your stomachs.

1634
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,270
Why?

1635
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,860
[Why are you looking at me?]

1636
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,440
Hong Jin Kyung.

1637
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,420
[Powerful enough to 
prevent proper hosting.]

1638
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,550
[Nervous]

1639
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,900
[Automatic American reaction.]

1640
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,450
Seriously.

1641
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,300
Your stomachs will hurt.

1642
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,930
[Boom]

1643
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,840
[Oh, my goodness.]

1644
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,610
[Could this be what fairies look like?]

1645
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,640
[Escaping reality.]

1646
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,020
[Funny no matter how 
long you look at it.]

1647
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,570
Enough!

1648
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,920
[Now bursting just from looking at her.]

1649
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,410
Are you her husband?

1650
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,640
[The fairy and lumberjack...]

1651
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,060
I need to hang this up.

1652
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:57,600
We really need to hang this one up.

1653
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,440
Where was that taken?

1654
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,720
[Alluring]

1655
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,540
[This must be a dream.]

1656
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,240
[One more please!]

1657
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,240
These two.

1658
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,670
[Fiery appearance.]

1659
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,640
Are they siblings?

1660
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,610
[Noona]

1661
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,100
Stop!

1662
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,290
[Complete the collection.]

1663
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,430
[Save me.]

1664
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,080
The triple combo.

1665
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,740
[The next person.]

1666
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:35,830
[Seo Jang Hoon!]

1667
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,210
[Squinting]

1668
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,300
[Back when he couldn't see anything.]

1669
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,300
Why didn't you open your eyes?

1670
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,000
Where is this from?

1671
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,580
[That's not all!]

1672
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,100
[Funny screen capture.]

1673
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,260
[I'm angry.]

1674
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,670
Isn't that a mask?

1675
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,780
Like a stretched stocking.

1676
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,760
This is nuclear bomb level.

1677
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,460
[Hyun Moo frozen in time.]

1678
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,030
The face of someone you 
don't want to meet.

1679
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,050
Someone like that.

1680
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,860
[The last card!]

1681
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,940
[A particular body part pulls your gaze.]

1682
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,020
[Shy]

1683
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,180
[Mouth hanging.]

1684
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,520
[Rich in furry chest hair, Hyun Moo.]

1685
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,690
[Can't believe our eyes.]

1686
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,820
[Stop looking.]

1687
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,580
Thanks to you all, we 
really laughed a lot.

1688
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,480
While laughing and chatting with you all,

1689
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,570
part 1 has already ended.

1690
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,790
We will see you soon for part 2!

1691
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,500
[Shall we take a quick breather?]

1692
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,960
Now let's begin part 2.

1693
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,900
Right away?

1694
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,500
We need to start. 
We will ask a few questions

1695
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,170
to test your character.

1696
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,060
Character is very important.

1697
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:00,980
In these few questions, you 
can only answer yes or no.

1698
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,280
First, we will start with Park Myung Soo.

1699
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:05,690
Park Myung Soo.

1700
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:12,630
Just watch Park Myung Soo 
as a systems test.

1701
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:16,800
In the case that you answer with a lie,

1702
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,290
we use cutting edge technology

1703
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,710
to know immediately.

1704
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,880
- A lie detector? 
- Yes.

1705
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,860
Lies light up red.

1706
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,720
The truth will light up blue.

1707
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,170
[Amazed]

1708
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,170
It's my first time seeing one.

1709
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,340
- Ready? 
- Yes.

1710
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:34,070
Let's ask some questions.

1711
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:39,330
Is there someone here that you 
would like to have as our member?

1712
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,620
[Straightforward bomb 
for the first question.]

1713
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,050
No.

1714
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,500
[No?]

1715
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,570
[Truth]

1716
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:54,530
[Steady graph doesn't change.]

1717
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,960
[I dislike all of you.]

1718
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:02,120
[His confession leaves scars 
on the candidates' hearts.]

1719
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,670
He means it.

1720
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,700
Just as expected.

1721
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,760
- You're too much. 
- He really means it.

1722
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,670
- He sheds no blood or tears. 
- He means it.

1723
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:12,500
Then is there a current member who 
should be nervous about the new member?

1724
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,140
Yes.

1725
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,490
[A member should be nervous!]

1726
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,210
[Truth]

1727
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,160
[Of course there is.]

1728
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:23,610
- Is that person on your right... 
- Yes.

1729
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,690
I'm the only one on the right!

1730
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,900
I'm the only one on the right!

1731
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,390
Yes.

1732
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,340
- Yes? 
- Yes.

1733
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,880
[Truth]

1734
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,800
[I'll be nervous...]

1735
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,680
[I'll work harder.]

1736
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,140
Great.

1737
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,170
Then in the past month,

1738
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,030
have you kissed anyone?

1739
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,920
[Small waves.]

1740
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,560
Yes.

1741
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,200
Yes?

1742
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,780
[Truth. Consistent graph.]

1743
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,650
[The Brangelina couple!]

1744
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,660
The final question!

1745
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,560
In the next life, would 
you marry your wife again?

1746
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:01,940
Yes.

1747
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,240
Let's see.

1748
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,160
[Lie]

1749
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,940
[Graph shoots up.]

1750

[Sigh...]

1751
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,180
Park Myung Soo, step out.

1752
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,700
[His true feelings revealed.]

1753
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,980
This is the test.

1754
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
It's accurate.

1755
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,070
Very accurate.

1756
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,560
[Systems test complete.]

1757
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,980
Test your character as 
a Sixth Man candidate.

1758
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,500
I'm better than Jung Hyung Don?

1759
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,910
[American reaction.]

1760
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,880
[Even in uncomfortable situations...]

1761
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,730
[How will they react?]

1762
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:33,780
In the past month,

1763
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,130
have you kissed anyone?

1764
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:41,930
[Deadly talents?]

1765
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,060
Everyone,

1766
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,770
[The fate of these 8 are in their hands!]

1767
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,400
we only have the final voting round left.

1768
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,600
Do you really want do 
become the Sixth Man?

1769
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,310
[Who will seize the poisoned Holy Grail?]

1770
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,810
[Sixth Man Secret Member]
