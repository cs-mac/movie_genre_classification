1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:40,020
During the nation's early years, powers compete to conquer China,
each furthering their own military reach and empire.
Warlords big and small side with foreigners at the expense of the people.
Endless battles turn the land into hell on earth.

2
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:49,532
Dengfeng, Henan.

3
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:02,784
Amitabha.

4
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:31,548
Amitabha.

5
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:08,052
Brother, we have a live one here.

6
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,062
Wake up!

7
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:20,564
Wake up!

8
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:27,246
Quickly! Don't let them escape!

9
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:38,677
After them!

10
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,280
Kill! Leave not one!

11
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:32,315
Sir, eat it slowly.

12
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,005
Eat it while it's hot.

13
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,104
Thank you.

14
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,835
Brother, yet another two hundred arrive.

15
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:49,235
Jingkong, winter will come soon.

16
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:51,844
Before the blizzards reach the mountain,
we must build more shelters.

17
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,546
We've already run out of wood and straw.

18
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,177
What else do you want me to build with?

19
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:58,115
Then take what we can out of our rooms
and give it to these people.

20
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:01,756
No way, I am deathly afraid of the cold.

21
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,985
Look at these mantou,
each day it gets smaller and smaller.

22
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,998
So we needn't worry about freezing to death.

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,627
Even before winter arrives,

24
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:15,131
You will have already starved to death.

25
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:31,584
After him!

26
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:46,535
Search!

27
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:56,477
Come out!

28
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:03,387
Out of the way! Bring him out!

29
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,257
- Stop!
- Don't move!

30
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,036
- You! Over here!
- Stop! Don't move!

31
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,540
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

32
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,680
Out of the way!

33
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:39,183
Out of the way!

34
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:43,002
You can't enter!

35
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,941
Stop!

36
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,102
You can't enter!

37
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:51,603
Off the horse!

38
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:57,306
Off the horse!

39
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,394
Abbot, save me.

40
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,666
Stinkin' monks!

41
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:10,034
Commander Hou wants this man's head!
Those who harbour him will share in his crime!

42
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,538
I don't care who you are!
You will not disturb these grounds!

43
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:12,731
Come then.

44
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,904
Hey! Hey!

45
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,943
Save him and I'll send you
to meet the Buddha.

46
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:19,015
He's lost a lot of blood.

47
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,365
Quickly, get the haemostatic powder.

48
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,654
Yes, Abbot.

49
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:28,158
Commander Hou arrives!

50
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:46,037
These people have welcomed you
with a display of their Shaolin kungfu.

51
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,541
And you reply with guns?
You are without manners.

52
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:55,382
Commander Hou.

53
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,673
Sir, please don't move.

54
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,473
Abbot, you also don't move.

55
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:15,972
He's nearing death.

56
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:18,813
Help him, send him off.

57
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:22,052
Amitabha.

58
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:24,253
Buddha sends the fated.

59
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:27,723
He has arrived,
even if it is on his last breath,

60
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:30,323
I must still help him.

61
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:34,233
I ask sir to show compassion.

62
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:38,104
No more meaningless deaths.

63
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:40,436
If he doesn't die,
I will not sleep easy.

64
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:44,744
When the heart is removed from dread,
dreams will no longer be troubled.

65
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,246
With a benevolent heart,
everywhere you go will be the Pure Land.

66
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,617
The Pure Land?

67
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:55,119
Abbot, you've stayed at Shaolin temple
for far too long, you're confused.

68
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,986
If I don't kill him,
the fighting will continue.

69
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,258
This will mean more killing.

70
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:05,761
How will we reach the Pure Land then?

71
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,739
Hou Jie.

72
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:11,010
I admit defeat.

73
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:14,439
Dengfeng City is already yours.

74
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:17,280
If you spare me...

75
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:21,784
I will give all my wealth and money to you.

76
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:24,162
This...

77
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,671
Is the gold I buried.

78
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,303
Take it.

79
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:32,662
If you don't kill me, I promise...

80
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:37,166
I will never return.

81
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,159
Thank you, Abbot.

82
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,578
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

83
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,179
Sir!

84
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,682
Sir!

85
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:29,600
Defend the temple!

86
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:34,104
Jingneng, Jingkong, stand down.

87
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:53,793
A joyous arrival to a sad departure...

88
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:57,393
The void in our world is once again felt.

89
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:00,434
Would it not have been better
to have not come and gone...

90
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:04,164
To be free from happiness and sadness?

91
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,265
Amitabha.

92
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,770
Go.

93
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,841
[ PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial Arts ]
[ GRAFFITI : Empty words. ]

94
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:16,014
Big brother,
we are meeting with the foreigners tomorrow.

95
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,516
What for?

96
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:21,384
With proper funding,
we can buy many machine guns and cannons.

97
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,726
With it, we can take Zhengzhou.

98
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,230
More guns is good, but useless if you dont fire them.

99
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:32,901
Tell me, back at Shaolin, why didn't you fire?

100
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,238
Compassion?

101
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:40,749
Remember this, when you gain the upper hand...

102
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:44,748
And you hesitate a moment too long...

103
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,420
The one dead will be you.

104
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,190
Next time...

105
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:51,120
The next time I come across someone
standing in Brother's way...

106
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:54,910
I will definitely kill him.

107
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:59,414
Then you've learned.

108
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:01,302
Song Hu has already arrived.

109
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:04,801
That's "Commander Song".

110
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,213
Commander Song.

111
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:09,312
The bastard, we fight without
seeing any of his men.

112
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:13,817
But come time to divide the spoils,
he's here ever so quickly.

113
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:23,324
Brother Hu, Dengfeng City has been taken.

114
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,225
Huo Long is dead.

115
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:28,635
For a nobody such as Huo Long...

116
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,566
Why such a commotion?

117
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:34,934
I would think you were still
seeing the coffin off.

118
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,577
We are in rememberance of the
hundreds of brothers lost.

119
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,478
Is that so?

120
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,078
I am in your debt then.

121
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:45,547
Against Huo Long,
I didn't come, not to take advantage of you...

122
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:48,019
If it weren't for these two bum legs...

123
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:51,358
My horse and gun alone would
have been enough to sort him out.

124
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:52,991
Isn't that right, brother?

125
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,200
Of course...

126
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,998
What is a little loss on my part?
I do not fret.

127
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:03,503
I know that.
You fret because of DengFeng City.

128
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,221
Sister-in-law, it's been too long.

129
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,223
Big brother.

130
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:17,792
Shengnan, my darling girl.

131
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,054
Greet your Uncle Song.

132
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,364
Hello, Uncle Song.

133
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,523
Hello, Nan-Nan.

134
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:26,592
Sister, your Nan-nan is
growing up to be very polite.

135
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,105
More beautiful with age.

136
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:32,033
With a daughter like her,
be careful someone doesn't steal her away.

137
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,374
It's decided,
this child will be one of the family.

138
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:38,175
My future daughter-in-law.

139
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,916
When was this arranged?

140
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,815
It doesn't matter, now is all the same.

141
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:45,756
What? You disagree?

142
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,260
If you disagree then let's fight.

143
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,704
Good.

144
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:30,944
Good gun.

145
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,612
This is a fully automatic weapon.

146
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,913
You can't buy it anywhere else.

147
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,484
We want eighty units.

148
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,914
How shall we do this?

149
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,418
I won’t take a penny if...

150
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:52,297
General Hou supports our railway into Dengfeng.

151
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:07,077
What did you say?
I didn't hear properly.

152
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:10,817
I said, I won't take a penny...

153
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:15,088
If you support the building of our railway.

154
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,189
I don't want the guns anymore.

155
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,190
General.

156
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:22,692
I don't want the guns anymore!

157
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:31,344
Go, we head to the city's east.

158
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:36,611
I believe, General Song Hu
will show more interest.

159
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:43,115
Mr Peter, please wait.

160
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:47,626
Brother, this gun is truly marvellous.

161
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:52,167
If Song Hu takes them...

162
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,866
Show them out!

163
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,106
Yes!

164
00:16:57,108 --> 00:17:01,608
Please.

165
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,686
Next time, choose your words carefully
when you speak to me.

166
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,656
I don't take orders from you.

167
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,027
Maybe when you're in my position, then we'll talk.

168
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,557
You hear what I'm saying?

169
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:21,061
Am I being clear enough?

170
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:43,283
To use the lives of our countrymen
and take the wealth of the people.

171
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:49,431
Agreeing to build their railway...

172
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,935
Is like opening the doors for them to take our land.

173
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,802
The land of the Chinese
belongs to the people of China.

174
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:01,943
The foreigners' hands reach to take it...

175
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:06,447
I will chop them all off.

176
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:11,088
I hope Song Hu feels the same.

177
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:15,724
I don't think you've listened to what I've said.

178
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:20,228
These twenty years, I've called him brother.

179
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,740
Do not badmouth him.

180
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:33,781
And even if he is bad,
it is not for you to say!

181
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:04,484
I'm dizzy.

182
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,154
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,264
Eating biscuits.

184
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,993
Biscuits?

185
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:13,792
I'm eating noodles now.

186
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,904
You've gone mad from hunger.

187
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:19,503
What do you know?
This is called having an idea.

188
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,876
Idea? Having an idea?
All you know is having ideas.

189
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,545
You might be able to do that,
But how about the people out there?

190
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,016
What can they do?

191
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:30,685
In times of famine, Judge Bao
would feed the people with his own stores.

192
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,256
What if we became masked avengers?

193
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:37,285
We'll hit back at the warlords' armies.

194
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,927
Brother,
why don't we become masked avengers?

195
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:44,029
Masked avengers?

196
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,798
That's right,
we'll become avengers that save people.

197
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,099
Brother, that's against the rules.

198
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,240
What are you afraid of?

199
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:52,679
When the sky falls,
Second Brother will hold it up.

200
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:56,349
Brother is most generous, am I right?

201
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:57,512
Of course.

202
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:02,013
Of course! Of course!

203
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:06,693
Little Miss, please don't run.

204
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:10,191
- Quickly get up
- Shengnan!

205
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,332
Are you injured?

206
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,373
What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you to hold her hand!?

207
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,674
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you watch her!?

208
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:16,773
- I'm sorry, Master.
- You want to die!?

209
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:18,474
- I'm sorry.
- Papa.

210
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:22,973
It doesn't hurt anymore,
please don't be angry with her.

211
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,844
I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry.

212
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,944
Leave us.

213
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:30,454
- Does it hurt?
- How does it feel?

214
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,556
I'm not hurt

215
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:32,656
Are there any injuries?

216
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,156
- Let Papa see.
- Papa.

217
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:38,658
I made a drawing for you.

218
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,780
[My daddy likes fighting]

219
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,080
Is this Papa?

220
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,979
Here, Papa will carry you.

221
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,549
Hold on.

222
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,919
Is Papa this mean?

223
00:20:55,922 --> 00:21:00,422
Big brother.

224
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:05,022
Hold it for now, give it to me later.

225
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:19,139
Ive personally delivered the
marriage contract to Commander Song.

226
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,910
He was very happy.

227
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,781
Tomorrow night, Zhongyue Restaurant.

228
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,452
Commander Song and wife, their son.

229
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:32,956
Eating begins on the dot.

230
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,839
I want to ask you a question.

231
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:54,445
Since Song Hu already knows
that I have Huo Long's gold...

232
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:58,949
Why does he not ask me about it?

233
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:04,357
He wants it all.

234
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:08,861
Including DengFeng City.

235
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:16,472
The one who strikes first wins.

236
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:21,272
Then this is a good opportunity.

237
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,281
Correct.

238
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:28,784
Pick thirty of your finest and
make preparations at the Zhongyue Restaurant.

239
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:45,007
If he's not dead, I can't sleep.

240
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:53,818
Big brother is wise.

241
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:06,898
You want to kill Brother Song?

242
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,065
It would be better if you didn't know.

243
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,077
Be he is your brother.

244
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,346
Please think again.

245
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:25,852
Song Hu wants to take me down.

246
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,921
Do you have any other solution?

247
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,589
Spit it out now, it's not too late.

248
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:36,093
Don't ask me, I don't know.

249
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:43,075
I only have just one request...

250
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:46,971
Don't let your daughter see it.

251
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:51,475
Okay?

252
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:36,129
A mouse?

253
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:40,632
Brother, once we've stolen the rice,
how about noodles next?

254
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:44,879
Could you not call it "stealing"?
We are "taking".

255
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,941
Then how much are we "taking"?

256
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,451
A bag we'll take,
two bags we'll also take.

257
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:50,981
Take however much we can.

258
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:52,323
Jinghai.

259
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,352
As masked avengers, we should leave a calling card.

260
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,691
What should we use?

261
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:59,154
How about your shiny head?

262
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:03,656
You!

263
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,555
Rice.

264
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:25,853
Son, we have rice.

265
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,497
Brother, its rice!

266
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,857
The gods have opened their eyes.

267
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,026
Thank you! Thank you!

268
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,530
There's rice!

269
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,995
Wait until I knock on the table...

270
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,436
You take our daughter to the toilets.

271
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:39,505
Papa, we are here to eat.
Why do we need to go to the toilets?

272
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,808
Listen to Papa now...

273
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,310
And Papa will listen to you one day.
Don't argue.

274
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,030
Please.

275
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:04,532
This way.

276
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,533
Big Brother.

277
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:26,764
Sister.

278
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,533
Brother, you're late again.

279
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:30,694
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

280
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:31,505
Say hello.

281
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:33,604
Hello, Uncle Song.
Hello, Auntie.

282
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,035
Wanshan, greet Uncle and Auntie.

283
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:37,275
Uncle.

284
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:38,636
Auntie.

285
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:40,635
Well behaved.

286
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:43,475
Really well behaved.

287
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:46,985
Sirs.

288
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,017
The Song family's Young Master
was born in the year of the rabbit.

289
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,558
The Hou family's Little Miss
was born in the year of the sheep.

290
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,187
A great match.

291
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:56,525
Moreover, their dates of birth
are very auspicious.

292
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,567
Their five elements complimenting,
fortunes will equally flourish.

293
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,267
A match made in heaven.

294
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,770
I dare say, this match will bring
wealth and fortune to both families.

295
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:08,409
Together till their hair turns grey.

296
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:11,578
Thereafter, a hundred children and
a thousand grandchildren.

297
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:13,479
Great, great.

298
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:17,982
Actually, as Buddhists we talk about
fate being the cause of all things.

299
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,450
Without fate, things do not converge.

300
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,960
With fate, I believe...

301
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,092
They would have come together sooner or later.

302
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,431
So what are we waiting for?

303
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:29,031
Quick, quick, quick!
On with the wedding invitations!

304
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:30,432
What are you so anxious about?

305
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:32,372
How can I not be?

306
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,842
If I were to lose such a
wonderful daughter-in-law...

307
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,043
Where would I find another one?

308
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:40,012
Sirs, please exchange invitations.

309
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:43,882
This betrothal is finalised.

310
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,014
Agreed!

311
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,414
Here.

312
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,984
Congratulations! Congratulations!

313
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:53,487
Big brother,
I'll go settle the marriage rites.

314
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:16,651
Brother, now that we are one family...

315
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,647
I can speak my mind.

316
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:23,927
Speak.

317
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,428
How are we going to split Dengfeng City...

318
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,029
Between the two of us?

319
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:35,533
You tell me.

320
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:46,455
Didn't we already settle this?
One man, one half.

321
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:49,493
It's all yours.

322
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,996
From today on, Dengfeng City
is not split between you and me.

323
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:56,493
Only one person will have all the say.

324
00:29:56,497 --> 00:30:00,997
This is the most peaceful solution.

325
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:04,745
What do you mean by this?

326
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:08,104
Brother, I am getting old.

327
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,476
I can't fight any more.

328
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,347
Look at this leg, acting up again.

329
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,856
It's time for me to retire.

330
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,086
What's more, we're family now.

331
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,458
Even if I give it to you today...

332
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:26,228
In the future, will it not be left to my son?

333
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:30,731
I've thought it through, I don't lose out.

334
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:34,878
I've held this wine for many years
but could never bring myself to open it.

335
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:37,379
But today I will.
Here, drink!

336
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:41,883
Drink up and this matter is settled.

337
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:48,053
Commander, we've received a secret message.

338
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:09,043
Son, do you need to go pee?

339
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:10,285
No need.

340
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:14,787
Listen to me, ask your mother
to take you to the toilets.

341
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:19,428
Sister, take Shengnan as well.

342
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,299
Let's go.

343
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:32,571
Run.

344
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,179
- Vice Wang.
- Here!

345
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,449
Leave us.

346
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:44,951
Yes.

347
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:11,275
[ NOTE: General, be careful. ]
[ Hou Jie has an ambush ]

348
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:17,124
You!

349
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:20,363
You bastard!

350
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:22,994
I've always treated you as my own brother.

351
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,735
We conquered the world together.

352
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:26,865
I would never have thought,
today you wanted to kill me.

353
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:31,368
- Is this true!?
- Enough!

354
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:55,539
Shengnan!

355
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,909
Mama!

356
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:03,413
Mama come quickly!

357
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:27,565
Go already.

358
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:54,269
Mama, save me!

359
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:03,011
Mama.

360
00:34:10,252 --> 00:34:12,660
Mama! Mama.

361
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,191
Mama.

362
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:17,160
Shengnan!
Get out of here, Shengnan!

363
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,061
- Mama.
- Run quickly!

364
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:22,929
Shengnan! Run quickly!

365
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:27,434
Run away, Shengnan! Don't look back!

366
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:00,939
Shengnan...

367
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:02,547
General!

368
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:06,716
Papa! Papa!

369
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,056
Shengnan!

370
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,559
Stop!

371
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,858
Commander! Run!

372
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:25,361
Run!

373
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:37,082
Shengnan!

374
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,322
- Shengnan.
- Papa.

375
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:59,825
Over there!

376
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:12,575
Kill!

377
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:17,597
Shengnan, don't be afraid!

378
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:11,284
Papa... Papa...

379
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:18,341
Papa...

380
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:22,845
Shengnan!

381
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,452
Abbot!

382
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,592
Sir! Sir!

383
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:42,264
Please slow down!

384
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,193
Save her!
Abbot! Save her!

385
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:48,702
Save her.

386
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,465
Save her! Save her!

387
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,705
Quick! Save her!

388
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:56,207
Make way! Quickly!

389
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,505
Silver needles! Guanyin paste! Hot water!

390
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:00,346
Yes!

391
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:04,848
Hurry!

392
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,025
Shengnan, it'll be alright, it'll be alright.

393
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,097
Shengnan, don't fall asleep.
Wake up.

394
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,367
Madam!

395
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,936
Madam! You are not yet healed! You mustn't run!

396
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,637
Please be careful.

397
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,639
Shengnan

398
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:29,141
Shengnan, be good.

399
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:52,272
Shengnan.

400
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:55,442
Say something to Papa,
Say something to Papa.

401
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:58,742
Shengnan, say something to Papa.

402
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:03,246
Shengnan, say something.

403
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,524
Why did you stop? You can't stop!

404
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:08,425
Hurry up and save her!

405
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,054
Do you want me to beg?

406
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:15,558
Then I'll beg!
Save her! Save her!

407
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:17,497
Papa...

408
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:20,505
Papa, don't scold them.

409
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:23,536
And don't be angry with them.

410
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,678
Papa will listen.

411
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,077
Papa will listen! Papa will listen!

412
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:28,178
I beg of you.

413
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:29,079
Shengnan!

414
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,818
- I beg of you.
- Shengnan.

415
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:31,449
Mama...

416
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:32,820
Shengnan!

417
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:34,090
She's going to be okay.

418
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:37,888
- Mama, I missed you.
- She's alright!

419
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:43,998
Mama, let's go home together.

420
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,671
Shengnan, wake up.

421
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:49,100
Save her.

422
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:51,770
I'm begging all of you.

423
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:54,410
Only you can save her.

424
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:56,112
Shengnan, wake up.

425
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:58,481
Say something to Mama, Shengnan.

426
00:43:58,484 --> 00:43:59,713
Shengnan.

427
00:43:59,715 --> 00:44:02,682
Shengnan!

428
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:07,186
Shengnan!

429
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:12,633
She's alright.

430
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:14,634
Say something to Papa, say something to Papa.

431
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:15,505
- She's fine.
- Shengnan!

432
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,003
She can't be dead.

433
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:22,507
Shengnan! Shengnan!

434
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:25,445
Please wake up, you can't die.

435
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:26,877
Shengnan can't die.

436
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,516
Mama is here, look at Mama.

437
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,286
Jinghai, receive the body.

438
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:34,057
- Yes.
- She can't be dead!

439
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:36,886
I beg you! Save her!

440
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:39,198
I beg you.

441
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,700
I beg you. Save her.

442
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:48,801
Quickly save her.
Abbot have compassion, save her!

443
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:53,578
If you can't save her, I'll tell you now!

444
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,210
Don't none of you ever think of living!

445
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,551
I will burn Shaolin temple to the ground!

446
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,980
- Abbot, save her!
- Enough!

447
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,581
Amitabha.

448
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:06,090
Have the gods not yet punished you enough!?

449
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,061
It's your fault!

450
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:09,592
She's not dead!

451
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:11,602
I am full of regret!

452
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:13,633
She is not dead.

453
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:14,964
- If it wasn't for you...
- She is fine.

454
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,933
How can my daughter be dead!?

455
00:45:16,936 --> 00:45:17,805
She's not dead.

456
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:20,043
Look! She's dead!

457
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:21,074
She's not dead.

458
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,374
- She can't see anything anymore!
- She's not dead!

459
00:45:22,377 --> 00:45:23,944
She's not dead, you understand!?

460
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:28,446
The one who should be dead is you!

461
00:45:30,117 --> 00:45:34,617
Shengnan.

462
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:38,765
Mama is sorry.

463
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,366
She can't be dead.

464
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:43,735
She's not dead.

465
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,768
Save her!

466
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:48,405
You speak of compassion!
How could you just watch her die!?

467
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,778
Fine! Don't save her!

468
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,977
I will kill each and every last one of you.

469
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:58,481
I'll start with this damned old man.

470
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:01,959
- Sir!
- I'll kill you all!

471
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:05,159
I'll kill you all!

472
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,990
Sir!

473
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:10,801
Kill you all!

474
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,301
Sir!

475
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:16,803
Restrain him!

476
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:31,515
I'll kill you all!

477
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:43,597
I'm going to kill you all...

478
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,007
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

479
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,077
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

480
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:21,916
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

481
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:24,579
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

482
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:28,817
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

483
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,928
Leave Shaolin...

484
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:35,459
This one doesn't count.

485
00:48:35,463 --> 00:48:38,700
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

486
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:40,931
Leave Shaolin...

487
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:45,434
Is anyone there!?

488
00:48:53,456 --> 00:48:55,923
I set a trap for pigs, how come a man is here?

489
00:48:55,927 --> 00:49:00,023
What are you up to, covered in blood?

490
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:02,664
I know you, you are that Hou Jie.

491
00:49:02,668 --> 00:49:04,665
You still want to kill people?

492
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:07,335
When a man is without common sense
is when they are worse than pigs.

493
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:10,664
Given you're in this situation, best lie still.

494
00:49:10,668 --> 00:49:12,037
Don't howl.

495
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:16,539
Relax a bit,  I'll be back later.

496
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:21,809
Amitabha.

497
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,234
Hey, something to eat.

498
00:50:07,236 --> 00:50:10,872
Careful, it's hot.

499
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:15,376
Cool on the outside, hot on the inside.

500
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,755
Why has it come to this?

501
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,259
Why?

502
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:46,009
Your wife has left Shaolin.

503
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:50,511
Your daughter's funeral has been left to you.

504
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:18,816
Will it be a burial or cremation?

505
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:22,324
The Abbot asked me to ask you.

506
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:26,827
With burials, you can see them on holidays.

507
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:29,865
But who can really see them?

508
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:32,464
I guess you can dig them out but that's not easy either.

509
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:36,204
I think cremation is more convenient.

510
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,566
You can see them anytime and take them with you if you move.

511
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,070
To where ever you go.

512
02:05:35,179 --> 02:05:42,173
Synced By ChE
0neClickMovies.blogspot.com

513
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:46,109
I think cremation is better.
What do you think?

514
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,658
If its cremation...

515
00:51:56,661 --> 00:52:01,161
Then after you've finished your noodles,
we'll go light the fire.

516
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:25,525
Take all this and burn it!

517
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:37,034
So you'd rather die than submit?

518
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:41,537
At least I'll see Brother in the afterlife.

519
00:52:41,947 --> 00:52:44,814
Fire!

520
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:47,185
When you were being hunted...

521
00:52:47,188 --> 00:52:49,955
It was Big Brother who saved you.

522
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,286
Who would have thought...

523
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:56,295
You'd repay his kindness with hatred!

524
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,800
What is kindness?

525
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:06,066
He didn't save me, he used me.

526
00:53:06,071 --> 00:53:10,206
I've known that for a long time now,
he needed me.

527
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:13,708
In battle, it was I that killed the most people.

528
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:17,250
Was there a bit of land I didn't help him conquer?

529
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:21,218
Then why did I betray Hou Jie?

530
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:23,960
Answer correctly and I will spare you.

531
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:26,730
Because...

532
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:31,234
You are a dog!

533
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:39,545
Wrong answer.

534
00:53:44,746 --> 00:53:49,246
I betrayed him, because he was afraid.

535
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:53,353
With fear, comes defeat.

536
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,765
He deserved this.

537
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:59,495
Now begins my reign.

538
00:53:59,498 --> 00:54:03,998
You understand?

539
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:31,433
The streets are filled with them,
everywhere with wanted posters.

540
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:35,540
Actually, it's the same whoever captures you.

541
00:54:35,544 --> 00:54:37,741
Anyway, I've to make rice for you again.

542
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:42,100
Otherwise, I'll have made fifty thousand silvers now.

543
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:43,703
[ WANTED: Hou Jie ]
[ REWARD: Ten thousand silvers ]

544
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:48,205
Eh? It's now a hundred thousand.

545
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:50,324
Just kidding.

546
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:54,826
Shaolin temple preaches compassion,
I wouldn't do that to you.

547
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:59,702
So what now?

548
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,835
I don't want to leave.

549
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:06,337
You can't treat this place as your home.

550
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:34,639
What's this?

551
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:36,240
Throwing a tantrum?

552
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:40,742
Made up your mind?

553
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,910
Want some help?

554
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,990
- Brother.
- Brother.

555
00:56:49,822 --> 00:56:52,789
There is suddenly a lot more rice in the kitchens.

556
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,960
How did this happen?

557
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:59,463
A lot more rice?

558
00:57:00,304 --> 00:57:04,340
Oh! Our prayers have been answered!

559
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:08,609
Amitabha, amitabha, amitabha.

560
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:10,942
Then you better ask Buddha...

561
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:14,752
Why there are shadow men jumping
about on the rooftops at night?

562
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:17,483
Shadow men?

563
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:19,824
How can there be shadow men
at the temple?

564
00:57:19,826 --> 00:57:22,393
They came to steal the rice.

565
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,897
It's to steal the rice back here,
not steal the rice.

566
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:35,005
All involved present to the training grounds
after morning lessons for your punishment!

567
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:39,509
Yes, Elder Brother.

568
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:54,427
You again!

569
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,269
What the hell do you want?

570
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,130
Amitabha.

571
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:02,632
Master.

572
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:07,279
Abbot, I want to stay at Shaolin.

573
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,681
That's not for you to decide.

574
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:10,081
You are now wanted.

575
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:14,583
Isn't so you can avoid capture?

576
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,952
I've decided to become a monk.

577
00:58:16,954 --> 00:58:21,454
Shaolin will not become your battlefield,
The decision is not yours to make.

578
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:23,833
Return to whence you came.

579
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:28,061
Did the Abbot not say once,
"Buddha sends the fated"?

580
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:30,674
Who says you are fated?

581
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:34,043
Master.

582
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:37,973
You'll only receive his body,
you won't receive his heart.

583
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:40,884
His sins are great.
He is a warlord, Master.

584
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:45,084
Master, a person like him will
sully the name of Shaolin Temple.

585
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:48,724
There is the essence of Buddha in all.

586
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:52,925
We should not discriminate.

587
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,396
Everything is empty,
only fate is with substance.

588
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,900
His heart is full of hatred and revenge,
it will not receive the enlightenment.

589
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,738
Well said.

590
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:07,241
But we cannot deny the teachings
of Buddha by closing the way.

591
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:10,078
Nor can we, if we tried.

592
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:14,388
Troublesome is the Bodhi,
since understanding is confusing.

593
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:17,759
The old ways are dying.

594
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:22,263
I think, we should let him stay for now.

595
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:30,601
The Abbot has dumped you on me again?

596
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:32,273
But being in Shaolin is alright.

597
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:35,512
Out there, it's a dog eat dog world.

598
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:37,743
Wait outside.

599
00:59:37,745 --> 00:59:40,552
New Baldy, it's cold, wear this.

600
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:45,056
Off to work!

601
00:59:48,737 --> 00:59:53,237

- Morning.

Thank you.

607
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,359
Not so hard, eh?

608
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,041
Not hard.

609
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:34,543
Don't push, don't push.
Plenty, plenty.

610
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:46,024
Strike without the fist being seen.
Not the way if it is.

611
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:51,664
Practice to the Way.

612
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,204
Actions are fluid.

613
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:55,303
Move with feeling.

614
01:00:55,306 --> 01:00:56,975
Know the fine.

615
01:00:56,977 --> 01:01:01,477
Awaken to the Zen.

616
01:02:05,786 --> 01:02:07,744
Quickly bring the wooden container
to hold the food!

617
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:12,247
Okay.

618
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,308
Hey.

619
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:33,579
Have you practised before?

620
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:34,580
What?

621
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:37,017
- Kungfu
- Kungfu?

622
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:41,157
Truth is, when I was younger I trained for two years.

623
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:45,157
But like you, my heart was not focused.

624
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:48,799
So I worked in the kitchen.

625
01:02:48,803 --> 01:02:52,668
You want to learn,
learn the Dharma.

626
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:55,469
Dharma.

627
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:57,201
Faced the wall for nine years.

628
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:59,881
What was he refining?
The heart.

629
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:03,450
Without conflict, gained wisdom
from every inch of his body.

630
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:07,180
The thoughts from his hair
is as the hair on our head.

631
01:03:07,185 --> 01:03:11,685
This level is called the Zen Wu.

632
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:42,058
Let's practise together.

633
01:04:42,498 --> 01:04:45,925
Fists and heart as one.

634
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:49,935
Elbows and knees as one.

635
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,836
Shoulders and hips as one.

636
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,367
Heart and mind as one.

637
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,848
Mind and breath as one.

638
01:04:57,851 --> 01:05:00,148
Breath and strength as one.

639
01:05:00,152 --> 01:05:02,619
Practise to the Way.

640
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:04,689
Actions are fluid.

641
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,318
Move with feeling.

642
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,988
Know the fine.

643
01:05:09,992 --> 01:05:14,492
Awaken to the Zen.

644
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:17,100
Stay strong!

645
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:20,701
They're hopping down, we're squatting down.
Both ways build strength.

646
01:05:20,704 --> 01:05:25,204
Straighten up!

647
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:39,791
Hold down this meridian.

648
01:05:39,796 --> 01:05:44,296
It'll be alright.

649
01:05:54,508 --> 01:05:57,635
You go now, go.

650
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:02,139
For you.

651
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:08,126
The weather is cold,
why are you not inside resting?

652
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:11,267
Precisely because it is cold,
I am here practising.

653
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,716
Are you cold?

654
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:15,137
A little.

655
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:19,005
Then practice with me.

656
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:23,510
Okay.

657
01:08:16,207 --> 01:08:20,707
Abbot, his form is a bit off.

658
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:25,408
From the heart it follows,
from thoughts give rise.

659
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,486
He is fine as he is.

660
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:35,487
In practising martial arts,
the vengeance in his heart is released.

661
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,327
I do not practise martial arts,
this I do not understand.

662
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:43,831
Practising martial arts is Zen,
cooking is also Zen.

663
01:08:44,102 --> 01:08:47,609
The principles are roughly the same.

664
01:08:47,613 --> 01:08:52,340
Wudao, the most important things in
life are experience and practise.

665
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:55,511
I've said it many times.

666
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:59,380
Leave Shaolin Temple,
go see the world outside.

667
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,953
All I know is how to cook.

668
01:09:00,955 --> 01:09:03,152
Out there, I'm of no use.

669
01:09:03,154 --> 01:09:04,652
I'm not going.

670
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:08,331
A piece of gold and a pile of dirt.

671
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:10,003
Which has more use?

672
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:11,564
I guess the piece of gold.

673
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:14,772
And if I gave you a seed?

674
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:18,273
Don't sell yourself short.

675
01:09:18,277 --> 01:09:22,777
Everyone is useful in their own way.

676
01:09:56,052 --> 01:10:00,552
Cao Man, you want us to help the foreigners build the railway.

677
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:04,689
But you mustn't forget,
Mangshan is the resting place of our ancestors.

678
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:08,329
Disturb the soil and you break the Feng Shui.

679
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:12,834
The ancestors will never agree to this!

680
01:10:12,845 --> 01:10:16,342
If you are really going to do it, I have nothing to say.

681
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:19,572
I'm just worried that the foreigners are playing us...

682
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:24,076
And making deals under the table.

683
01:10:25,456 --> 01:10:29,956
Cao Man, your betrayal of Hou...

684
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,995
We don't care.

685
01:10:31,997 --> 01:10:35,393
He previously said,
building the railway is just a cover.

686
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,834
It's true intent is to take our land.

687
01:10:37,838 --> 01:10:40,106
Okay, okay, okay.
Say no more.

688
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:43,975
Henan Province's interests are not for one man to decide.

689
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:47,874
But looking at Cao Man's attitude, it seems
he's already made an agreement with the foreigners.

690
01:10:47,879 --> 01:10:52,316
There was no intention to hear us out.

691
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:56,821
Go.

692
01:11:22,684 --> 01:11:27,184
Listen well.
Standing in my way...

693
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:30,363
Is not in your best interests.

694
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:32,593
They are fortunate.

695
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:35,033
But their families...

696
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,463
Will die much more horrible deaths.

697
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:41,733
Whether to become my friend or my enemy...

698
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:46,237
Is for you to decide.

699
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:50,245
Have a think.

700
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:54,748
If there is money to be made, noone loses out.

701
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:08,571
What do we do now?
He hasn't returned yet.

702
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:15,810
Don't cry, Aunt.
Okay?

703
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:20,118
Crying won't bring him back any sooner.

704
01:12:20,122 --> 01:12:21,780
What has happened?

705
01:12:21,782 --> 01:12:26,282
Master, our Daniel has been gone
for over twenty days now.

706
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,941
What should we do?

707
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,092
[ NOTICE: Seeking all able men aged 16 to 40 for work on the Zhengsong railway. ]

708
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,131
Cao Man is building a railway?

709
01:12:31,134 --> 01:12:35,634
Our family depends on him.

710
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:46,043
Work quickly, on pain of death.

711
01:12:46,046 --> 01:12:49,183
You hear?

712
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:53,687
Faster! Faster!

713
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,718
Who's there!?

714
01:13:22,722 --> 01:13:27,222
What the hell are you up to?

715
01:13:28,463 --> 01:13:30,360
Commander Hou.

716
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,999
Why did you kill so many people?

717
01:13:33,002 --> 01:13:36,229
It was...
It was Commander Cao's orders.

718
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:39,170
Leave.

719
01:13:39,174 --> 01:13:40,811
Leave!

720
01:13:40,813 --> 01:13:45,313
Hou Jie still lives!
Hou Jie still lives!

721
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:59,897
Let's go.

722
01:14:02,296 --> 01:14:04,633
Cao Man lied to us about building the railway.

723
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:08,133
Who knew he was really digging for
artifacts for the foreigners.

724
01:14:08,137 --> 01:14:11,943
Each one we found, we gave to them.

725
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,916
In exchange for guns and cannons.

726
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:19,419
He was worried it might leak it out,
so he had them silenced.

727
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:34,169
The Cao Villa still holds many of our brothers.

728
01:14:34,172 --> 01:14:38,672
At the end of tomorrow's work,
they will all be killed.

729
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:44,578
I am sorry.

730
01:14:44,582 --> 01:14:45,980
Go home.

731
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:50,483
Quick! We're going.

732
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,220
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

733
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:44,877
Go have a look.

734
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:49,381
How could this be!?

735
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:34,433
In life till now, committed terrible crimes...

736
01:16:34,437 --> 01:16:38,937
All stemming from the greed of man.

737
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,085
The actions of one...

738
01:16:44,089 --> 01:16:48,589
Today begs for the Buddha's forgiveness.

739
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:51,888
Evil came to trouble the mind...

740
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:55,856
Enough!

741
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,360
Hereon will trouble no more.

742
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:02,970
Shengnan!

743
01:17:02,972 --> 01:17:05,739
Corruption is without value...

744
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:09,108
How can my daughter be dead!?

745
01:17:09,112 --> 01:17:13,612
Purity without excess.

746
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:24,264
Forget bygones with one cut,
one cut to sever all.

747
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:29,501
Then will you understand all
that is before you.

748
01:17:29,505 --> 01:17:33,942
From today on,
this rite bestows the Three Jewels.

749
01:17:33,947 --> 01:17:36,444
The Buddha is realised.

750
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:39,143
The Way is straightened.

751
01:17:39,147 --> 01:17:43,054
The monk is at peace.

752
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:48,424
Hereon, you will be known
by this order as Jingjue.

753
01:17:49,389 --> 01:17:52,695
Amitabha.

754
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:57,199
Amitabha.

755
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:12,459
Capture Hou Jie alive!

756
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:13,960
Capture Hou Jie alive!

757
01:18:13,962 --> 01:18:18,462
Capture Hou Jie alive!

758
01:18:31,255 --> 01:18:35,755
Sir!

759
01:18:50,588 --> 01:18:53,584
It's Cao Man! I'm going to stop him!

760
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:55,385
Get back here!

761
01:18:55,388 --> 01:18:56,856
Sit down!

762
01:18:56,858 --> 01:19:01,093
Calm down.

763
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:04,525
He's come at a good time.

764
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:07,396
Seize the moment, I will take him back.

765
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:10,566
After sunset, go to Cao Villa.

766
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:11,708
Rescue the people.

767
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,338
You'll go?

768
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:15,308
You are walking to your own death.

769
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:18,817
If my life can be exchanged for countless others...

770
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:21,978
What is death?

771
01:19:21,982 --> 01:19:26,482
Jingjue, you must be careful.

772
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:53,356
Nobody move!

773
01:20:10,778 --> 01:20:15,278
- Nobody move!
- Nobody move!

774
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:24,990
Amitabha.

775
01:20:40,573 --> 01:20:43,879
Please Sir, release the meat cleaver.

776
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:48,383
Continue committing sins
and suffer disastrous consequences.

777
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:01,833
That was for my daughter.

778
01:21:01,836 --> 01:21:04,033
Amitabha.

779
01:21:04,036 --> 01:21:07,473
That sure is my Big Brother.

780
01:21:07,477 --> 01:21:11,841
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

781
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:14,844
Brother, I thought of you terribly.

782
01:21:14,847 --> 01:21:19,347
Thought of me?

783
01:21:20,058 --> 01:21:22,355
If I don't die, you can't sleep, right?

784
01:21:22,358 --> 01:21:24,985
Don't be ridiculous.

785
01:21:24,988 --> 01:21:29,488
Nothing of the sort.

786
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:32,736
Don't pretend.

787
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:37,240
You're afraid I will take you down.

788
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:50,249
Jingjue's actions are to
give us an opportunity...

789
01:21:50,252 --> 01:21:51,590
So we can save lives.

790
01:21:51,593 --> 01:21:53,290
Your impulsiveness will ruin the plan.

791
01:21:53,293 --> 01:21:57,793
You understand!?

792
01:22:06,205 --> 01:22:08,342
You once taught me...

793
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:12,845
Gain the upper hand and you hesitate a moment too long,
the one dead will be you.

794
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:18,616
I remembered.

795
01:22:21,957 --> 01:22:26,457
Pull back your men, I'll go with you.

796
01:22:43,879 --> 01:22:45,617
String the Abbot up.

797
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,086
Do anything rash and I'll send him to the gods.

798
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:53,590
No objections, everyone stand down.

799
01:23:01,873 --> 01:23:06,373
Come then.

800
01:23:23,195 --> 01:23:26,632
You promised to have these at Zhengzhou before dawn.

801
01:23:26,636 --> 01:23:27,534
Relax.

802
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:32,036
With Cao's troops, noone will dare block our way.

803
01:23:32,176 --> 01:23:35,672
Remain vigilant.

804
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:40,177
Make way! Make way!

805
01:23:55,930 --> 01:24:00,396
Get down! I'm talking to you!

806
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,567
Get down!

807
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:05,578
Quickly!

808
01:24:05,581 --> 01:24:10,081
Get in quickly!

809
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:15,083
Big brother, isn't this place more beautiful than before?

810
01:24:16,353 --> 01:24:19,489
You bring me here...

811
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:23,659
Wasn't just for me to praise you, was it?

812
01:24:23,663 --> 01:24:25,661
Of course not.

813
01:24:25,664 --> 01:24:29,730
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

814
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:34,000
I hope that Brother will once again take me in.

815
01:24:34,005 --> 01:24:38,371
Conquering the world and
achieving great things.

816
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,782
Brother, look...

817
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,383
This was all for your sake.

818
01:24:43,386 --> 01:24:45,014
This throne is yours.

819
01:24:45,016 --> 01:24:49,516
This imperial robe is also yours.

820
01:24:54,568 --> 01:24:57,894
Brother.

821
01:24:57,898 --> 01:25:02,398
Is money and power really that important to you?

822
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:08,576
Listen to me.

823
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:13,079
Don't become like me.

824
01:25:14,922 --> 01:25:18,788
Faking compassion?

825
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:22,558
I was messing with you...

826
01:25:22,562 --> 01:25:25,428
To see how you would play along!

827
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:27,399
I have a gift for you.

828
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:31,902
Bring her out here!

829
01:26:05,478 --> 01:26:07,545
I found him for you, Sister.

830
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:12,047
I spared her, so man and wife can be reunited.

831
01:26:28,561 --> 01:26:33,061
Get down!

832
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:41,442
About face!

833
01:27:07,636 --> 01:27:12,136
You've suffered.

834
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:17,593
I used to think I was powerful.

835
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:21,834
I could take care of both of you.

836
01:27:21,838 --> 01:27:26,338
But instead, I destroyed us.

837
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:48,697
Ready guns!

838
01:27:48,701 --> 01:27:53,201
Don't shoot!

839
01:27:53,843 --> 01:27:58,343
Raise arms!

840
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:03,150
Fire!

841
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:05,352
Fire!

842
01:28:05,354 --> 01:28:07,342
Guards stay! The rest follow me!

843
01:28:07,345 --> 01:28:11,845
Yes!

844
01:28:23,038 --> 01:28:27,538
Master, save us! Save us!

845
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:33,446
You men! Go see what's happening!

846
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:37,949
Yes!

847
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,400
The artifacts are being stolen!
After them!

848
01:29:04,553 --> 01:29:09,053
Out of my way!

849
01:29:49,839 --> 01:29:51,406
Hou Jie!

850
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:54,476
Let go of her!

851
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,978
Let go of her!

852
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,108
Big brother...

853
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:59,917
You're crying!

854
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,418
Let her go!

855
01:30:01,421 --> 01:30:04,148
Your death alone...

856
01:30:04,152 --> 01:30:07,258
Won't satisfy me.

857
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:09,459
You watched your daughter die...

858
01:30:09,463 --> 01:30:13,029
Now I want you to watch your wife die.

859
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:17,533
Then I can be happy.

860
01:30:21,744 --> 01:30:23,671
You animal! Let her go!

861
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:28,174
Let her go!

862
01:30:32,455 --> 01:30:35,922
Sister is very pretty.
What a shame...

863
01:30:35,926 --> 01:30:40,426
You are a monk.

864
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:53,077
Cao Man! Stop it!

865
01:30:57,578 --> 01:31:00,785
Commander!
Shaolin monks have stolen the artifacts!

866
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:05,289
Attacked the prison and released the prisoners!

867
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:19,157
You deceived me.

868
01:31:19,161 --> 01:31:23,661
Kill him.

869
01:31:51,115 --> 01:31:55,615
Jingjue! Go!

870
01:31:56,888 --> 01:32:01,388
Go quickly.

871
01:32:34,192 --> 01:32:38,692
Go!

872
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:47,773
Eldest brother!

873
01:33:05,906 --> 01:33:10,406
Go!

874
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:13,806
Go!

875
01:33:13,808 --> 01:33:18,308
Go!

876
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:24,517
Eldest brother!

877
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,817
Go!

878
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:28,917
Go!

879
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,420
Eldest brother!

880
01:33:39,471 --> 01:33:43,971
Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother!

881
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:47,838
You won't listen to my orders!?

882
01:33:47,843 --> 01:33:51,849
Go!

883
01:33:51,853 --> 01:33:53,751
Go!

884
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:58,254
Go! We'll escort the villagers first!

885
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:43,757
What do you want?

886
01:35:43,759 --> 01:35:48,259
Back inside!

887
01:35:48,529 --> 01:35:50,327
Abbot.

888
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:54,830
Get back inside.

889
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,878
Hey!

890
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,778
Little monk, don't force me.

891
01:36:01,781 --> 01:36:03,779
I warn you to go back inside now.

892
01:36:03,782 --> 01:36:08,282
I don't want to kill children.

893
01:36:24,204 --> 01:36:26,642
Sir, please show compassion.

894
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:28,302
Let us save the Abbot.

895
01:36:28,304 --> 01:36:32,804
You will attain wealth and happiness.

896
01:36:36,986 --> 01:36:39,452
Sir, Abbot always said...

897
01:36:39,456 --> 01:36:41,953
A brave man is one who knows to return
after having lost his way.

898
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:44,324
Put it down and go home.

899
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:48,827
I'm sure your family is waiting for you.

900
01:37:02,509 --> 01:37:04,077
Insolence!

901
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,580
Want to rebel? Catch them!

902
01:37:23,543 --> 01:37:28,043
Amitabha.

903
01:37:32,643 --> 01:37:34,980
I don't want to fight!
I don't know kungfu!

904
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:39,484
Amitabha.

905
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:55,374
Stop fighting!

906
01:37:55,377 --> 01:37:59,877
Don't want to fight anymore!

907
01:38:11,329 --> 01:38:15,829
I'll fight you with my life!

908
01:38:29,712 --> 01:38:31,179
Abbot!

909
01:38:31,181 --> 01:38:35,681
Are you hurt?

910
01:38:41,094 --> 01:38:45,594
Uncle! Toss them like you were frying vegetables!

911
01:39:01,486 --> 01:39:05,986
Uncle! Beat them like you were kneading dough!

912
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:33,428
Uncle! Great!

913
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:35,518
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

914
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:38,498
Are you alright?

915
01:39:38,501 --> 01:39:40,079
We must get inside quickly.

916
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:44,583
- Okay.
- Go.

917
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:07,196
It's them!

918
01:40:09,946 --> 01:40:14,446
Huzi!

919
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:20,476
Mother!

920
01:40:23,608 --> 01:40:28,108
Father!

921
01:40:43,241 --> 01:40:46,977
Jingneng's sacrifice was not in vain.

922
01:40:46,982 --> 01:40:51,482
Don't be too attached.

923
01:41:08,874 --> 01:41:13,374
Sirs and Madams, please ready and pack your things.

924
01:41:13,775 --> 01:41:18,275
We are leaving Shaolin Temple.

925
01:41:33,398 --> 01:41:36,764
I know you are scared.

926
01:41:36,768 --> 01:41:39,574
But I am not.

927
01:41:39,577 --> 01:41:44,077
Because my loved ones are gone,
my family is already lost.

928
01:41:44,948 --> 01:41:49,448
Who wouldn't be scared?

929
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,056
These few days...

930
01:41:55,059 --> 01:41:59,559
I felt just like you...

931
01:42:00,301 --> 01:42:03,568
Shaolin Temple is a happy place.

932
01:42:03,572 --> 01:42:07,168
It has become our home.

933
01:42:07,172 --> 01:42:10,239
Shaolin Temple might...

934
01:42:10,243 --> 01:42:14,078
Meet its end today.

935
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:16,950
But the spirit of Shaolin...

936
01:42:16,953 --> 01:42:19,930
Every flower and blade of grass...

937
01:42:19,935 --> 01:42:22,492
Its beams and columns,
its bricks and tiles...

938
01:42:22,494 --> 01:42:25,961
Will forever stay in our hearts.

939
01:42:25,966 --> 01:42:29,492
The spirit of Shaolin...

940
01:42:29,496 --> 01:42:33,996
Taught me to persevere and show courage.

941
01:42:34,777 --> 01:42:39,277
To never abandon hope.

942
01:42:40,627 --> 01:42:45,127
I ask you all to live your lives as best you can.

943
01:43:29,054 --> 01:43:30,622
I have a favour to ask of you.

944
01:43:30,624 --> 01:43:34,689
What?

945
01:43:34,694 --> 01:43:36,832
You lead them out of here.

946
01:43:36,835 --> 01:43:38,203
No, no, no.

947
01:43:38,205 --> 01:43:40,162
I have never left Shaolin Temple.

948
01:43:40,165 --> 01:43:43,732
No, no, no.
I'm scared.

949
01:43:43,737 --> 01:43:45,344
You're scared?

950
01:43:45,346 --> 01:43:47,514
Look at them.

951
01:43:47,516 --> 01:43:50,542
They need you.

952
01:43:50,547 --> 01:43:55,047
They are more scared than you.

953
01:43:55,758 --> 01:44:00,258
I...
Let me think...

954
01:44:04,618 --> 01:44:07,266
Fine.

955
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:11,770
I'll go.

956
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:45,643
We must distract them.

957
01:44:45,645 --> 01:44:48,481
We must escort the villagers up the mountain.

958
01:44:48,484 --> 01:44:50,952
Jinghai, take the Abbot first.

959
01:44:50,956 --> 01:44:52,953
Jingkong, you lead.
I'll catch up.

960
01:44:52,956 --> 01:44:55,803
- Move quickly!
- I'll fight them with my life!

961
01:44:55,806 --> 01:44:57,693
Quickly!

962
01:44:57,696 --> 01:45:02,196
Move quickly!

963
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:22,287
Go quickly!

964
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:46,777
You bastards! Want to destroy Shaolin!?

965
01:46:46,781 --> 01:46:51,281
I'll destroy you!

966
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:59,740
Cao Man, wake up already.

967
01:48:00,282 --> 01:48:04,782
You must know, you've always had more than you need.

968
01:48:06,153 --> 01:48:10,653
Put it down, discontinue this path.

969
01:48:13,264 --> 01:48:17,499
We are in a war, it has always been like this.

970
01:48:17,504 --> 01:48:20,941
Don't be like me.

971
01:48:20,945 --> 01:48:25,445
I've come to realise my past crimes.

972
01:48:27,786 --> 01:48:29,383
It's time to stop.

973
01:48:29,385 --> 01:48:31,652
Could we not fight?

974
01:48:31,656 --> 01:48:36,156
What do you think?

975
01:49:45,367 --> 01:49:49,867
I yield.

976
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:17,699
Shaolin Temple?

977
01:51:41,774 --> 01:51:46,274
Shaolin Temple will not be dishonoured.

978
01:51:57,685 --> 01:52:02,185
Buddha is compassionate.

979
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:25,686
Madam! You can't leave! It's dangerous outside!

980
01:52:25,688 --> 01:52:27,586
Abbot! My child is missing!

981
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:30,285
My child is missing!

982
01:52:30,289 --> 01:52:34,789
Mama!

983
01:52:46,792 --> 01:52:47,530
Brother.

984
01:52:47,531 --> 01:52:50,578
- Brother!
- Brother!

985
01:52:50,582 --> 01:52:51,770
Quick! Quick!

986
01:52:51,772 --> 01:52:54,319
Brother...

987
01:52:54,322 --> 01:52:58,822
Brother!

988
01:53:03,804 --> 01:53:06,331
- Brother!
- Jinghai...

989
01:53:06,334 --> 01:53:10,834
Brother!

990
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:17,875
Amitabha.

991
01:53:19,357 --> 01:53:21,164
- Brother!
- Brother!

992
01:53:21,167 --> 01:53:22,455
Brother!

993
01:53:22,457 --> 01:53:25,214
- Brother!
- Brother!

994
01:53:25,217 --> 01:53:27,984
I will stay behind!
You all must deliver the villagers safely!

995
01:53:27,987 --> 01:53:32,487
Abbot!

996
01:54:54,749 --> 01:54:59,249
It's time you woke up...

997
01:55:28,013 --> 01:55:32,513
Hold onto me!

998
01:56:04,589 --> 01:56:09,089
Amitabha.

999
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:17,067
Evil is borne from the heart.

1000
01:56:17,072 --> 01:56:21,572
Repent.

1001
01:57:26,151 --> 01:57:30,651
Why?

1002
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,576
Uncle...

1003
02:01:59,578 --> 02:02:03,774
The temple is gone.

1004
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:07,497
It's okay.
Shaolin Temple is in our hearts.

1005
02:02:07,501 --> 02:02:12,001
It will never be burnt down.

1006
02:02:38,263 --> 02:02:41,680
Life follows fate.

1007
02:02:41,684 --> 02:02:46,184
Fate follows life.
From which we can live at ease.

1008
02:02:48,047 --> 02:02:50,214
Here.

1009
02:02:50,216 --> 02:02:54,716
Hereon, she will keep you company.

1010
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:12,589
You won't go?

1011
02:03:13,649 --> 02:03:17,705
Cao Man is here.

1012
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:20,757
His mistakes are also mine.

1013
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:25,260
Only I can help him.

1014
02:03:27,121 --> 02:03:31,621
You've really changed.

1015
02:03:33,502 --> 02:03:38,002
I know...

1016
02:03:38,943 --> 02:03:43,443
We can't be together again.

1017
02:03:44,773 --> 02:03:49,273
But...

1018
02:03:49,595 --> 02:03:54,095
I am really happy for you.
