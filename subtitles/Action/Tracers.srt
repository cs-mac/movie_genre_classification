00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,006
Got it. Thank you.

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,491
Bye-bye.

4
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,411
Cam! You guys seen...
You seen Cam?

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,767
Cam? Where in the hell is he?

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Tell me where you at, buddy.

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,241
Damn.

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,081
Cam! Uptown Express, okay?

9
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,406
You okay?

10
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,721
Yeah, I'm fine.

11
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,891
You! Come back here!

12
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,121
Sorry about your bike.

13
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,326
Come back here!

14
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,361
Cam.

15
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,441
Cam?

16
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,840
You want your check or not?

17
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,247
Sorry.

18
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,410
Lonnie, I need more runs.

19
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,363
Cam, I'm happy to help you out,
but you need a bike first, man.

20
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,168
Got a friend that can loan you one?

21
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,281
Yeah.

22
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,045
Keep your head up, man.

23
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,841
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,001
- Hey!
- What?

25
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,406
Where you been hiding?

26
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,081
What you got there, Cam?

27
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,083
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

28
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,246
Okay, so, what,
you forget about us or what?

29
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,767
No, I didn't forget.
I just... I didn't have it.

30
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,967
I just got that.

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,566
Okay. Well, what else you got?

32
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,726
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

33
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,326
Are you serious?

34
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,364
I am serious.

35
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,720
What is that, 9 dollars?

36
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,410
Yeah, 9 doll... probably.

37
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
- Where's all your money going, man?
- To you guys!

38
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,807
You came to us
for a loan, right, Cam?

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,365
You accepted our terms.

40
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,081
1,500 on the first
of each month, every month?

41
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,447
I know.
I know. I'm sorry.

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,285
I'm sorry I missed the payment.
It won't happen again.

43
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,442
No, it won't. Now...

44
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,605
sign this, please.

45
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,444
Jerry, I owe somebody rent.

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,802
And what?
You think I'm doing this for fun?

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
No. I can't...

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,923
This is my job, Cam, okay?

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,401
I got a boss
just like you got a boss.

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,006
Now just sign it, okay?

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,480
This is the second time
you been late,

52
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,246
and, uh, that makes us, um...

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,401
What does that make us?

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,688
- Nervous.
- Nervous.

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,763
- See? Hu is nervous.
- Yeah.

56
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,844
So you owe us $15,000,

57
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,486
and just don't miss
another payment.

58
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,441
I won't.

59
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,729
Don't miss another payment.

60
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,881
I know.

61
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,083
- You good, buddy?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,241
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,242
You all right?

64
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,242
Yeah, I'm good.

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,731
Okay.

66
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,564
Where's your bike?

67
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,200
I, uh... I hit a pothole.

68
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,125
Yeah, looks like
you got bigger problems.

69
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,486
Let's get in here.

70
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,486
All right.

71
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,330
When are we gonna go for a ride?

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,125
Car's still broken, buddy.

73
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,691
I haven't had time to work on it.

74
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,569
And I don't have the money
for the parts I need.

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,926
Maybe you ought to sell her.

76
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,005
Yeah, maybe.

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,531
Joey?

78
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,887
All right, you're good to go.

79
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,366
Thanks a lot, Cam.

80
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,806
You're welcome.

81
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,684
I told you to give Cam his space.

82
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,089
Chillax, Mom, it's all gravy.

83
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,050
Chillax? Sorry about that.

84
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,400
Don't worry about it.
He's a good kid.

85
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,805
Hey, Ange?

86
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,246
Can I talk to you for a second?

87
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
Gonna be a little late
on the rent this month.

88
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,011
I'm sorry.
I'll get it to you as soon as I can.

89
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,451
I know you're good for it,

90
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,125
but I'm having a tough month.

91
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,406
Try your best, please, Cam?

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,971
I know. I will.

93
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,767
Thank you.

94
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,086
Yeah?

95
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,685
You coming in today or not?

96
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,000
What are you talking about?

97
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,610
Do you not remember?

98
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,081
What do you want me
to do with your new bike then?

99
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,284
What new bike?

100
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,886
The one your girlfriend
dropped off here this morning.

101
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,968
I don't have a girlfriend.

102
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160

To... To say thank you.

123
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,240
- For what?
- What do you mean, for what?

124
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,209
For the bike you got me.

125
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,964
You're welcome.

126
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,610
Do you, uh...

127
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,485
How did you learn
how to do parkour?

128
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,369
What, did I say it wrong?

129
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,601
I gotta go.

130
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,841
Wait, what's your name?

131
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,800
Do you ride?

132
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,042
No. Bike's a ball and chain.

133
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,530
Oh, yeah?

134
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,886
All right.

135
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,964
Well, you know,
anybody can hop up

136
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,527
and climb this thing.

137
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,569
I'd like to see that.

138
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,402
All right. You got it.

139
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,006
Oh, boy.

140
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,400
Maybe you should
stick to the bike.

141
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,611
I'm Cam.

142
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,205
Nikki.

143
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,244
You gonna show me
something else?

144
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,966
Oh!

145
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,811
God.

146
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,205
You gotta learn how to see.

147
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,771
I can see just fine.

148
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,161
If you want to vault the car,
don't look at the car.

149
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,606
Look where the car isn't.

150
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,807
Okay.

151
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,122
Whoa, hey!
How did you get over there?

152
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,964
Nice to meet you, Cam.

153
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,641
Who are you?

154
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,122
What are you
doing here, Dylan?

155
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,049
I'm just looking out
for you, Niks.

156
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,561
So, what? You're just
spying on me the whole time?

157
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,484
You working out alone?

158
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,721
So what?

159
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,720
So you gotta be careful.
That's all I'm saying.

160
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,484
You gotta stay off my ass, Dyl!

161
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,130
Who is this guy?

162
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,726
He's nobody.

163
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,722
Haven't seen you around.

164
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,120
I haven't been around.

165
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,406
Where'd you find him?

166
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,326
He found me.

167
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,326
You following her?

168
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,001
No, no.
Just saw her in the park.

169
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,650
You know, this is dangerous stuff.

170
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,928
You get hurt if you
don't know what you're doing.

171
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,040
Let's bounce.

172
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,486
Wonderful.

173
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,644
Well, some of this stuff
is kind of beat up,

174
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,122
but, uh, I'll give you 450.

175
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,049
Look, my rent's 550.

176
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,201
You got that?

177
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,248
1, 2, 3, 4, 550.

178
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,881
Thanks.

179
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,361
Thanks a lot.

180
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,325
How much
for the muscle car, kid?

181
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,485
It was my dad's.

182
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,963
I'm gonna have to hold onto it.

183
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,804
Too bad. Nice car.

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,365
Hey, Cam.

185
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,521
You saw that, Mom?

186
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,926
Yeah, I did, baby. Come on.

187
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,121
Joey?

188
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,371
Not much to look at.

189
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,284
O...kay.

190
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,169
Watch the potholes this time,
all right?

191
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,321
Hey, buddy.

192
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,042
Looks like somebody's
been practicing.

193
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,445
You should come
work out with us.

194
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,051
I never see you guys around.

195
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,929
We're a tight group.

196
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,241
We like to keep to ourselves.

197
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,087
Loujaine floating terminal
in Brooklyn. You know it?

198
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,241
No.

199
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,889
Pier 62, Gowanus Bay.

200
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,371
I'll see you at dawn.

201
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,646
All right!

202
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,687
Hey, guys.

203
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,690
I'm Dylan.

204
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,001
This is Tate, Jax.

205
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,161
How's it goin'?

206
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,566
- Cam.
- What's up?

207
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,449
This is my sister, Nikki.

208
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,806
We already met.

209
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,726
This is awesome.

210
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,486
What are we supposed to do?

211
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,321
Try and keep up.

212
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,723
<i> Yeah, yeah, wait for me, girl <i>

213
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,087
- <i> Wait for me <i>
- <i> Hey! <i>

214
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,924
<i> Wait for me, girl <i>

215
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,570

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,931

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,650
<i> Oh, yeah <i>

227

228
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,564

229
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,087

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,002

237
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Holy shit!

238
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,446
He's dead, dude.

239
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,769
Hey, there.
You must be Cam.

240
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,282
Dylan tells me
you're new to parkour.

241
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,329
He also said you're pretty good.

242
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,926
Might have to, uh, work
on this jump, though.

243
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,601
I'm Miller.

244
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,966
If you fight with gravity
before you're ready,

245
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,160
you tend to get a beating.

246
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't know what I'm doing.

247
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,246
That's the great thing
about parkour, my friend.

248
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,681
There are no rules.
You all right?

249
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,889
I'm good.
Just trying to keep up.

250
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,370
Cam?
That short for Camaro?

251
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,606
You have a learning disability, dude.
Excuse him.

252
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,807
Where you from?

253
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,161
Queens.

254
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,360
Finished with high school?

255
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,686
No, I barely went.

256
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,008
I, uh, tried baseball once.

257
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,241
Did some martial arts.

258
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,084
Yeah, I wasn't much of jock
in high school, either.

259
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,049
Look at you. Hello.

260
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,166
Where'd you do your time?

261
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,691
It's okay. You're not the only one
in here with a record.

262
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,928
Abbott House, Hillside.

263
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,411
Juvie.

264
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,405
Yeah.

265
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,642
Did 6 months in Otisville
a couple of years ago.

266
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,131
No shit. What for?

267
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,445
B&E, boosting cars.

268
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,045
Just bullshit stuff.

269
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,481
You ever go in hard?
Pull some holdups.

270
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,450
No. Didn't want to go that way.

271
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,371
All right.
So what you do for money?

272
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,563
I'm a bike messenger.

273
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,882
50 points for the bike messenger.

274
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,486
What you guys deliver?

275
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,881
Documents, just business stuff.

276
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,767
At least that's
what they tell you.

277
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,968
I don't know. I mean,
they hand me a package, I drop it off.

278
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,042
Sure, but it could
be anything, right?

279
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,770
I guess.

280
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,400
You never look inside the bag?

281
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,245
No.

282
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,441
Never?

283
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,644
No. Why would I do that?

284
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,325
Just curiosity.

285
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,925
It's none of my business.

286
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,441
But you're the one
carrying the package.

287
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,162
Look, as long
as after I drop it off,

288
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,810
they pay me my money,

289
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't really care
what's inside the bag.

290
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,481
So what do you guys do?

291
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,809
We do whatever we can
not to get caught.

292
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,685
That looks like fun.

293
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,850
There are no limits, my friend,
only plateaus.

294
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,761
Plateaus?

295
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,890
You've got to constantly push past
what you think you can do,

296
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,081
or you stay stuck.

297
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,601
What else you got?

298
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,961
Well, how about this?

299
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,451
This whole thing, parkour,

300
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,364
free running, tracing,
whatever you want to call it,

301
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,727
it's just a state of mind.

302
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,928
Now, the real obstacles
are not out there.

303
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,162
They're in your head, okay?

304
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,811
Mmm, I don't know,

305
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,689
those obstacles
look pretty real to me.

306
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
Well, you're gonna have to start
seeing them differently.

307
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,564
Got it.

308
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,722
So look where the car isn't.

309
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,921
Exactly.

310
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,362
So, uh, how's
that new bike treating you?

311
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,965
It's good. Thanks again.

312
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,161
Where is it?

313
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,205
I left it at home today.

314
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,361
Liar.

315
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,409
Somebody clipped it,
and I didn't want to say anything.

316
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,203
I get it.
You're one of those kind of people.

317
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,324
What... What kind
of people is that?

318
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,685
Who can't hang
onto anything nice.

319
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,488
Guess I haven't
had enough practice.

320
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't worry about it.

321
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,081
Should have known better.

322
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,642
I mean, next time, I'll just take
my wallet and burn it.

323
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,044
Hey, Niks! Let's go!

324
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,685
You guys all work together?

325
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,566
See you around, Cam.

326
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,681
Good to meet you, Cam.

327
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,127
Don't let these guys
get you in trouble.

328
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,291
Oh, shit!

329
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,810
Excuse me, is Jerry here?

330
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,481
- Back there?
- Yeah.

331
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,687
Okay.

332
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,202
Excuse me, sir.
Is Jerry here?

333
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,407
You just missed him.

334
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,561
Do you know
when he'll be back?

335
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,210
When he returns.

336
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,681
Okay.

337
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,805
Hey! Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

338
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,883
Hey, Cam!

339
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,000
You didn't tell us you had
such a sweet ride, man.

340
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,246
I have your cash right here!

341
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,286
Here!

342
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,001
- There you go. Take it.
- All right.

343
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,401
We're taking 5 grand
off your tab for the car,

344
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,600
but you got one month
to get us the rest, all right?

345
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,887
How am I supposed to get
10 grand in a month, Jerry?

346
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,371
Not my problem, Cam.

347
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,602
Jerry, cut me some slack,
come on!

348
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,080
You still don't understand
how this works, do you?

349
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,566
If you don't pay,
we don't shoot you.

350
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,445
You got one month, Cam.

351
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,326
Go inside house, Joey, now.

352
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,646
Joey.

353
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,201
Hey, Angie, I'm sorry.

354
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,927
Your friends gave Joey a ride home
from school today, Cam.

355
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,562
Those assholes brought
my son home from school.

356
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,921
I don't know
what you're involved in,

357
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,167
and I don't want to know.

358
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,964
Stay away from us.
I mean it.

359
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,325
Hey, look who's here.

360
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,160
Hey, what's up, buddy?

361
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,611
You okay?

362
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,886
I want in.

363
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,161
You are in.

364
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,565
We don't just let
anybody train with us.

365
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,326
No. I'm talking about work.

366
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,921
Whatever you guys got going on,
I want in on it.

367
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,207
What's your problem?

368
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,600
What, do you guys think I'm a narc
or something? Come on.

369
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,280
Hey, Dylan,
I need to talk to Miller.

370
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,646
Hook me up.

371
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,482
No. It's a bad idea.

372
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,965
Why?
You know something I don't?

373
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,164
We're
in the transport business, Cam.

374
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,924
We move valuables.

375
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,880
People hire us to make
obstacles go away,

376
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,804
change hands,
land with someone else.

377
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,964
The difference is,
I provide assurances

378
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,531
that other people can't.

379
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,849
I guarantee the work.

380
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,486
You want
some evidence to disappear?

381
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,165
We can take care
of that for you.

382
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,800
It's a profession.
We're not thrill-seekers

383
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,724
who pull any score
that comes along.

384
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,845
The key is speed and silence.

385
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,445
In and out, fast and quiet.

386
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,210
We do our research,

387
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,930
plan every move,
work as a team.

388
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,565
Everyone knows their job.

389
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,725
Documents, chemicals,
technology, anything.

390
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,881
We don't take sides.

391
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,770
Now, I've just got two rules.

392
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,561
The first is, if you get in trouble,
I'm your first call.

393
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,164
The second,
stay out of Chinatown,

394
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,046
even if you're not on a job.

395
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,641
Why is that?

396
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,928
I'm inviting you to sit down
at the dinner table.

397
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,089
Show me you know
how to be a good guest.

398
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,721
Nice work!

399
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,007
Dyl!

400
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,850
Turn around!

401
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,684
- Hold him! Don't move!
- I'm not!

402
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,922
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

403
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,840
Who do you work for?

404
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,604
I said,
who do you work for, huh?

405
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,966
It's a question!

406
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,207
No one.

407
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,687
What's in the bag?

408
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,486
Tell me what's in the bag!

409
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,527
I don't know what's in the bag.

410
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,727
- Give it to me.
- No!

411
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Give it to me!

412
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,121
Give me the bag!

413
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,848
You tell me
what's in that bag!

414
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,331
You tell me
what's in that bag,

415
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,481
or I'm gonna blow
your brains out right now,

416
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,648
I swear to God.
What is in the bag?

417
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,961
I just carry the bag!

418
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,041
Good work, Cam.

419
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,250
What's going on?

420
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,402
You pulled some serious moves
out there, pal.

421
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,562
Dude, we heard
about the bust-out. Sick!

422
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,006
You were hauling ass.

423
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,725
Hey, it's all right, buddy.

424
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,126
We just had to make sure
you had our backs.

425
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,725
You're family now.

426
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,921
What do you think?

427
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,249
I think
you're a bunch of assholes,

428
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,811
especially you.

429
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,806
Hey.

430
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,001
Hey.

431
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,730
Where you taking me?

432
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,923
All right.

433
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,525
Where are the others?

434
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,047
They're busy.

435
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,647
Well, you want to grab
a coffee or something?

436
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,961
This isn't a date.

437
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,683
I didn't...
I didn't mean it like a date.

438
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,289
Let's just get this done, okay?

439
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,560
So how long you been
working for Miller?

440
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,687
Few years.

441
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,126
Did you grow up in the city?

442
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,326
No.

443
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,200
Where'd you learn
how to do parkour?

444
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Here.

445
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,041
You still live with Dylan?

446
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,248
Okay, enough
with the questions, okay?

447
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,165
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

448
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,209
Yeah, but you wanted to be in?

449
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,805
Guess what? You're in.

450
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,008
There's nothing left to discuss.

451
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,766
- What's your deal?
- My deal?

452
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,365
- Yeah. What's your deal?
- I don't have a deal.

453
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,487
Then why are you
acting like this?

454
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
There is no deal.
Acting like what?

455
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,485
I don't know.
I just thought we...

456
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,007
Look, I didn't
ask you to come find me.

457
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,411
Really?

458
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,641
Are you sure about that?

459
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,166
You did give me that bike.
Not sure what...

460
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,321
All right, I'm gonna tell Miller

461
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,209
you can work
on your own next time.

462
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,486
You don't need a babysitter.

463
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,441
Okay.

464
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,206
This the new guy?

465
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,850
Yeah.

466
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,524
Good luck, new guy.

467
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,284
Dylan, Jax, Nikki, Tate,

468
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,002
employee of the month, Cam.

469
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,007
Angie?

470
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,449
What are you doing here, Cam?
I'm working.

471
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,761
I know.

472
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,887
I brought your rent money.

473
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,809
I don't care what you brought.

474
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,644
I told you
to leave us alone, right?

475
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,641
Angie.

476
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,126
Angie, please.

477
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,125
Hey.

478
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,961
Please take it.

479
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,406
Okay?

480
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,924
It'll hold you over until you find
somebody else to move in.

481
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,804
This is too much.

482
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,604
What kind of trouble
are you in?

483
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,328
My mom got sick
after she lost her job.

484
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,840
So I borrowed
some money off the street

485
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,445
to try and help
her keep the house.

486
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,165
It wasn't enough,

487
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,800
so the bank foreclosed on her
a week before she died.

488
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,608
You got a good heart, Cam,

489
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,926
but you gotta be careful.

490
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,522
The farther you go
down the wrong road,

491
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,882
the harder it gets
to find your way back.

492
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,049
I have to get to work.

493
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,088
Wait, one sec, one sec.

494
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,690
Can you give this to Joey?

495
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,328
You don't have
to tell him it's from me.

496
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,130
I'm sorry for everything.
I really am.

497
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,168
I won't bother you guys again,
I promise.

498
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,561
Hey!

499
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,048
What do you think, man?

500
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,123
Factory paint, green gray.

501
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,289
14-inch rally wheels.

502
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,325
You got something for us?

503
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,010
Uh, there's not
even 2 grand here, man.

504
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,161
I need 10.

505
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,203
Give me a few more weeks,
I'll get it to you.

506
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,085
Well, that's past
the deadline, Cam.

507
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,805
I was hoping
we could renegotiate.

508
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,530
Look, I got a new job.

509
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,170
You can raise
the vig if you want to.

510
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,321
Oh!

511
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,644
You're still acting
like I'm the boss, Cam.

512
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,609
I'm not, all right?

513
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Chen is the boss.

514
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,320
The money you owe me,
I owe Chen.

515
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,764
You put me
in a tight spot here, Cam.

516
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,524
Now, I don't want
to see anything happen

517
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,882
to your friend and her little boy,

518
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,169
but you don't make this right,
it will.

519
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,326
Those are the rules.

520
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,001
2 weeks, Cam.

521
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,165
10 grand.

522
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Ohh.

523
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,526
Yeah?

524
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,727
We're goin' out tonight.

525
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,927
You want to come?

526
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,804
Work?

527
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,086
More like play.

528
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
Hold Tate tight.

529
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,406
Can I get a water?

530
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,401
Hey, what happened here?

531
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,086
- This?
- Yeah.

532
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,844
I bit the wall trick.

533
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,525
Oh, how is the wall?

534
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,847
Check this out.
Got it on a broken rail.

535
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,081
That's nothin', man.

536
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,049
Check this out.

537
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,161
Razor wire.

538
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,120
Dyl, why don't you show them
what happened right here, huh?

539
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,844
Is that from a curb?

540
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,082
- Nah.
- It was a older lady.

541
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,924
- Hello, grandma!
- He loves the cougs.

542
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,761
She was a nice girl.

543
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,570
She was Chinese.
She was real smart.

544
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,200
I met her on the subway.
Whatever, whatever.

545
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,806
I see her walking down
the street one night with this guy.

546
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,883
I assume it must be
her cousin or something,

547
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,367
so I go up to her,
I give her a big hug and a kiss,

548
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,884
and she freaks out
like she's never seen me before.

549
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,485
Goes totally ape-shit.

550
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,530
Turns out the cuz
was her husband.

551
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,729
Yeah, husband,
mixed martial artist.

552
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,211
Bad news for the lady killer.

553
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,760
Is that why we can't
cut through Chinatown?

554
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,484
Nah, that's on Miller, man.

555
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,409
He's got bad blood
with the gangs there.

556
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,761
With the Tongs?

557
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,491
Yeah, yeah.
Since the business went south,

558
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,688
he had to cut a deal,
promise to stay away.

559
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,685
You know,
Nikki's got some cute marks.

560
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,887
Hey, hey!

561
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,800
I don't know
what he's talkin' about.

562
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,440
Not happening.

563
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,250
If I show you,
I'd have to kill you.

564
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,481
He said it.

565
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,131
There she is,

566
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,089
the future Mrs. Jackson Smith
right there.

567
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,241
Oh, yeah?

568
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,731
That's gonna be
my future ex-wife.

569
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,321
Yeah, we're gonna move
to the countryside,

570
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,881
make lots of sweet ginger babies
every night of the week...

571
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
- Oh! That's terrible!
- For the rest of our lives.

572
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,326
Ugh!

573
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,205
I know, you're jealous.

574
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,280
You guys know
nothin' about women.

575
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,201
Hey.

576
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,601
Hey, hey.
What happened?

577
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,650
Nothin'. It's just stuffy
as hell in there, that's all.

578
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,523
Do you want to...
You want to get out of here?

579
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,880
You want to go
somewhere else?

580
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,244
Not right now, no. I can't.

581
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,731
Hey, what's wrong with you?

582
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,166
Nothin'.

583
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,810
Nikki, what are you afraid of?

584
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,921
Hey, guys.

585
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,727
Sorry I missed the fun.

586
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,609
Had some business
to take care of.

587
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,801
Yeah.

588
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,401
Hey, you okay?

589
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,521
Yeah, I'm fine.

590
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,843
Hey, Cam,
if you need anything at all,

591
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,729
call me, all right?

592
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,041
Yeah.

593
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,920
Coming back in?

594
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,126
No, I'm tired. I'm...

595
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,486
I'm gonna hit it.

596
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,601
Hey.

597
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,171
What are you doing here?

598
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,726
I wanted to talk to you.

599
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,680
How did you find me?

600
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,491
Why are you living
on the roof?

601
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,844
Why didn't you tell me
you're with Miller?

602
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,002
Dylan got into some trouble.

603
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,927
And Miller made it go away.

604
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,204
So your brother
pimped you out to the boss.

605
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,441
Sounds pretty simple to me.

606
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Miller doesn't own me.

607
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,846
Is that right?

608
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,131
Why are you here?

609
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,361
What's the point?

610
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,366
I should have told you.

611
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,200
It's my fault, but, Cam, you wouldn't
even be here if I hadn't...

612
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,281
So you want me to quit?

613
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,680
You can still walk.

614
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
Is that what you want?

615
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,564
I don't want you
to owe Miller like we do!

616
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,563
Do you want me to go?

617
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,651
No.

618
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,569
I heard once
tattoos are like scars

619
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,886
that you wear on the outside

620
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,840
to show the pain
that's on the inside.

621
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Is that true?

622
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,091
I don't know.

623
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,361
Why don't you have any?

624
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,928
'Cause I don't
want anyone to know.

625
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,883
I owe people money, Nikki.

626
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,248
And as soon as I pay them off...

627
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,201
I'm gone.

628
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,005
And this moment
was brought to you

629
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,162
by the sounds of summer
in New York City.

630
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,282
Yeah, or in an overcrowded prison.

631
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,808
- I don't really mind it.
- No?

632
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,167
No. I mean, before I left Florida,

633
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,529
I'd never even seen a town
bigger than 500 people.

634
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,203
Well, you're lucky,

635
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,482
'cause all I've
ever seen is this jungle.

636
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,444
You've never been
outside the city?

637
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,451
No.

638
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,122
I mean,
I don't count my jail time.

639
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,650
I tried to leave.

640
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,881
When?

641
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,609
After my mom died.

642
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,008
When she passed away,
I found out that

643
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,843
she had my dad's old car,

644
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,368
and she never told me
while she was alive,

645
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,960
'cause she was afraid
if I found out,

646
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,923
I'd sell it to try and help her out.

647
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,686
So, uh...

648
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,250
she kept it a secret.

649
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,209
She wrote me a letter.

650
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,121
She said she wanted me
to fix it up,

651
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,691
get it running again,

652
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,083
just hop in
and drive somewhere.

653
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,607
I don't know where, far away.

654
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,131
California maybe.

655
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,646
That was the plan.

656
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,044
Well, where's the car now?

657
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,522
The, uh...

658
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,886
The bank took it.

659
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,121
The bank?

660
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,607
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

661
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,160
Guess I'm just
one of those people

662
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,208
who can never hold
onto anything nice.

663
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,646
I'll agree with that.

664
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,205
What?

665
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,000
Where have you been, baby?

666
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,206
I went for a walk.

667
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,811
Anything wrong?

668
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,008
Hmm? No.

669
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,287
Nothing. You know, I just get
nervous before the big jobs,

670
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,726
that's all.

671
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,086
You sure that's all?

672
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,089
You seem kind of distant.

673
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,208
Yeah.

674
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,646
Like you're somewhere else.

675
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,370
No. I'm right here, James.

676
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,525
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

677
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,365
You know that.

678
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,205
I'm just tired.

679
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,529
I'm gonna go to bed.

680
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,926
Sure.

681
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,329
Gettin' better.

682
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,360
Nikki and I were living
on the streets when we found parkour.

683
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,969
We got hooked.

684
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,281
It's like being kids again,

685
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,568
and the whole city
is our playground.

686
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,570
Is that where you met Miller?

687
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,683
Uh-huh, yeah.

688
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,286
Miller raised us,
taught us everything we knew,

689
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,441
got us off the streets.

690
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,926
We'd be nowhere without him.

691
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,003
Yeah, Nikki said that he, uh...

692
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,888
got you out of some
sort of trouble or something.

693
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,040
Nikki said that?

694
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,961
Yeah.

695
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,050
What did she tell you exactly?

696
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,923
Uh, nothing specifically.

697
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,249
Just that you got
in some sort of trouble,

698
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,448
and he made it go away.

699
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,404
Look, she really cares about you.

700
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,125
She doesn't want
to see you get hurt.

701
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,966
Are you in some sort
of trouble, Cam?

702
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,724
'Cause if you are
and Miller finds out,

703
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
it's not just you.

704
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,160
That's trouble for all of us.

705
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,884
And he always finds out.

706
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,166
No, I'm all good.

707
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,246
Good.

708
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,484
I got the last one.

709
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,640
Unit 17, code.

710
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,926
All clear! Good job!

711
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,969
Whoo!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

712
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,610
That's how we do it!

713
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,560
Wait.

714
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,688
I'll, uh, catch up with you later?

715
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,808
Sure. Talk later.

716
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,840
Well, what do you mean?
Where's our money?

717
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,008
Payday's next week, Cam.
Same as usual.

718
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,411
Uh, okay.

719
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,760
When's the next gig happening?

720
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,001
Soon.

721
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,766
Hey, you did a good job.
Get some rest.

722
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,888
You don't understand.
I need that money.

723
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,525
Do we have a problem?

724
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,724
No, no. Got no problem.

725
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,048
I've got a big job
coming up next week.

726
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,362
It's worth 15,
20 grand each at least.

727
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,086
Does that work for you guys?

728
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,044
- Sweet.
- Sounds good.

729
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,929
How about you, Cam?
Work for you?

730
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,531
Yeah, that works.

731
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,241
Good.

732
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,044
You look just like your dad.

733
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,485
I get that a lot.

734
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,603
It's a nice, constant reminder
of the amazing father he was.

735
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,080
Well, if it's any consolation,

736
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,488
my dad wasn't exactly
a real winner, either.

737
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,249
Sometimes
it's better not to know.

738
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,041
Yeah.

739
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,124
Just gonna leave, aren't you?

740
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,771
You should come with me.

741
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,966
Yeah, right.

742
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,929
- Why, yeah, right?
- I can't.

743
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,889
Why not?

744
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,764
It's complicated.

745
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,081
Well...

746
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,809
I'm not going anywhere
without wheels.

747
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,046
Hold onto this for me.

748
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,401
Thank you.

749
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,684
Nice spot.

750
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,206
I can see all the way
into the future from up here.

751
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,120
Yeah, what happened
to staying in the moment?

752
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,045
You're a good student, Cam.

753
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,080
Now you're moving
beyond what you been taught,

754
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,201
beyond the rules.

755
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,284
But outside, there's a natural order
to things, you know.

756
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,602
There can only be
one alpha for every pack.

757
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,202
And that, my friend,
I learned the hard way

758
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,203
a long time ago

759
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,845
in the back
of a Chinese restaurant,

760
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,162
trying to beg for my life
with a gun in my mouth.

761
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,481
Is there something
you need to tell me, Cam?

762
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,561
There's nothing.

763
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,840
You sure?

764
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,131
Yeah, I'm sure.

765
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,170
Should get some plants up here.

766
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,844
Liven this place up a bit.

767
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,324
Pickup tomorrow at 9:30.

768
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,285
Hey, guys.

769
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,241
Where's Nikki?

770
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,931
Gave her the day off.

771
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,485
2 minutes.

772
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,085
You'll be needing this.

773
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,651
Hey, we're goin' in strong?

774
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,720
I told you it was big, my friend.

775
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,881
We're gonna get a cut.

776
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,929
20 grand each, maybe more.

777
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,642
I didn't sign up for this.

778
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,800
Okay, it's up here on the corner.

779
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,565
Hey, we're doing a bank?

780
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,962
Old bank, new money.

781
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,326
BTK bought it.

782
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,561
BTK?

783
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,960
Vietnamese bangers.

784
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,207
This is their Laundromat,

785
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,567
and they keep a big stack.
Couple hundred K.

786
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,960
Well, how do you know all this?

787
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,126
It's my job.

788
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,691
How we gettin' in this thing?

789
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,244
Through the front door.

790
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,606
What?

791
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,208
I'm risking a lot here, man.

792
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,328
Tell your men
to make this look good.

793
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,086
Okay, game time.

794
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,605
Who's got my piece?

795
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,040
You're carrying the baggage.

796
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,127
You'll be all right.
We've done this before.

797
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,600
We don't even shoot these things.

798
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,764
Be safe, kids.
Stay out of trouble.

799
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,085
Masks.

800
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,007
Hand off the gun!

801
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,446
Toss him the gun.

802
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,845
Toss him the gun!

803
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,965
You deaf?
Toss him the gun!

804
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,769
You don't like to listen, huh?

805
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,001
Get on the ground.

806
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,322
You think this is funny?
You think this is a game?

807
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,322
Get on the ground!

808
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,970
Are you deaf?!

809
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,884
Get on the floor!

810
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,331
We gotta get movin', guys!

811
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,720
Oh!

812
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,805
What...
What's the combination?

813
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,849
Break it down!

814
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,530
Tell me how we get inside!

815
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,647
Think this is funny?

816
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,564
Tell me what the combo is!

817
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,200
What, is everybody
deaf and dumb here?

818
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,241
Answer his question!

819
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,047
What's the combination?

820
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,201
I don't have it.

821
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,486
Is there another way in?

822
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,767
Yo, come on!

823
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,005
I can get in.

824
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,280
What the hell are you doing?

825
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,765
I can't see shit with this thing!

826
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,851
We gotta move, guys!

827
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,331
There's nothing! It's empty!

828
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,566
Check again!

829
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,520
Where's the money?

830
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,920
I don't know, Dude!
I don't know!

831
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,047
What are you laughing, big guy?

832
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,531
They picked it up early.

833
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,970
But he wouldn't have known that.

834
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,121
Would you?

835
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,405
Would you?

836
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,845
- Dude, let's just go!
- You're dead.

837
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,206
Back off!

838
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,406
Aah!

839
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,965
Go! Now!

840
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,601
Oh! Come on!

841
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,764
Aha! Where you goin',
you little bitch?

842
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,681
Fuck!

843
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,682
Go! Go! Go!

844
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,604
You better run!

845
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,524
Aah! Oh!

846
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,286
Aah!

847
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,250
Jax, stay in place!

848
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,127
Aah!

849
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,285
Come on! Come on!

850
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,600
Freeze!

851
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,930
Stay down!

852
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,890
Put your hands up
where I can see 'em! Now!

853
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,280
Stay right there.

854
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,885
Get down!

855
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,680
How about your dead buddy, huh?

856
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,210
Has he got a name?

857
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,010
I don't know. Might be nice
to let his family know

858
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,571
where to pick up his remains.

859
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,364
He doesn't have any family.

860
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,363
What the hell did you do
to get half the BTK

861
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,249
to chase your little asses
down the street?

862
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,607
Look, if you had anything real

863
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,240
to charge me with, you wouldn't be asking.

864
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,881
The Feds would
like a word with you.

865
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,280
Ooh!

866
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,286
Have fun, kid.

867
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,765
- Miller?
- No sudden moves, okay?

868
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,961
What are you doing here?

869
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,485
James Hatcher.
I'm with the DEA.

870
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,966
You thought jumping a 20-foot gap
5 stories up was a rush.

871
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,201
What the hell
are you talking about?

872
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,560
Just breathe for me,
Cam, okay?

873
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,726
We don't have much time.

874
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,286
Hey, where's Dylan and Tate?

875
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,800
They're in the van
on the way home.

876
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,841
They should be hitting
the tunnel by now.

877
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,200
Wait, do they know about this?

878
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,241
Cam, they all know.

879
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,811
How the hell
do you think I ran this circus?

880
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,961
Miller's the man on the ground...

881
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,645
Shipping and receiving,
HR, transpo.

882
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,531
Hatcher's upstairs... due diligence,
client relations, new business.

883
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,920
Neither one of them
gets much sleep,

884
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,200
but they work well together.

885
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,566
You got to be kidding me.

886
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,370
I been working
for a dirty Fed this whole time.

887
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,760
Yeah, or a clean criminal.
Depends on your point of view.

888
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,080
What about Jax, huh?

889
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,365
Okay, I got bad intel
on this one, okay?

890
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,045
And Jax is gone.

891
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,362
But that's the past.
All we have is the moment,

892
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,521
and right now, in this moment,

893
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,240
New York PD thinks
you're one of my Cls.

894
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,362
That means you get to walk
out of here with me

895
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,521
right now under my protection.

896
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,690
Yeah, so they can find my body
in a dumpster tomorrow morning?

897
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,841
No, thank you.

898
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,843
Cam, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I need your help.

899
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,604
The cops are rousting
the whole gang.

900
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,524
Sooner or later, someone's gonna
talk themselves out of trouble,

901
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,250
and that will lead back to me.

902
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,170
It's time for me to cash out.

903
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,808
Is this your "one last score" speech?

904
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,961
Save it.

905
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,360
It's my exit plan,

906
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,170
but I cannot do it
without your help.

907
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,731
If you want me,

908
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,121
I need my 10 grand today,
right now!

909
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,406
Then we'll talk.

910
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,164
That's not gonna happen.

911
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,608
Fine. Then I'm not
helping you, all right?

912
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,171
I'm out.

913
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,480
The thing is, Cam,

914
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,881
it's not just about you
anymore, is it?

915
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,883
Because you
became part of a family,

916
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,041
so you have to think
about the welfare of others.

917
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,771
Where is she?

918
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,048
I don't want Nikki
mixed up in this anymore,

919
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,120
so you and I
are gonna finish this.

920
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,327
Hey!

921
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,688
Why didn't you tell me?
Hmm?

922
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,921
I told you to get out.

923
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,451
You played me from the start.

924
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,641
No.

925
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,040
- The bike? That was all bullshit?
- No.

926
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,326
This has been a setup
the whole time?

927
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,000
- Cam, I swear, that was all me.
- Yeah, right!

928
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,128
I felt bad for wrecking you out.

929
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,520
I wanted to get you a new one.

930
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,404
I didn't think all of this
was gonna happen.

931
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,483
Well, then what did you think?

932
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,361
You wanted in, Cam.

933
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,887
No, I wanted you.

934
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,685
I'm sorry.

935
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,209
I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you.

936
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,806
I did, but I ju... I couldn't.

937
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,601
Why not?

938
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,961
Because of Dylan.

939
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,480
What do you mean,
because of Dylan?

940
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,560
What did Dylan do that's so bad

941
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,005
that you couldn't
tell me this whole time?

942
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,400
He ju...

943
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,929
You know,
Dylan's your older brother, Nikki.

944
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,491
You don't need to babysit him.

945
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,563
You can let him deal
with his own problems.

946
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,848
Somebody did something
to me, okay?

947
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,331
Back in Florida?

948
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,163
Some scumbag came
into my bedroom late at night.

949
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,970
He started touching me.

950
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,403
Dylan walked in,
and he beat him into a coma.

951
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,607
The cops came after us.

952
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,569
They chased us
all the way over here,

953
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,165
and then I met Miller,

954
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,288
and Miller made it all go away.

955
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,720
Dylan was there
that night to protect me,

956
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,081
and now it's my job
to protect him.

957
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,765
Cam, I was scared to tell you
anything else, because...

958
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,969
'Cause I didn't want you to go.

959
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,966
Look...

960
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,322
if I can get us
a clean exit tomorrow...

961
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,126
will you come with me?

962
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,009
Miller's not gonna
let us just walk away.

963
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,686
Do you want to leave
Miller or not, Nikki?

964
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,007
I told you what could
happen to Dylan and to us

965
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,447
if anything ever went wrong.

966
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,601
Do you remember?

967
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,522
Yeah.

968
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,522
What?

969
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,727
Yes.

970
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,484
I'm getting us out of this life...

971
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,211
and we're gonna start over.

972
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,126
Just you and me
this time, okay?

973
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,926
Where we going?

974
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,721
Guys and I got a plane
to catch when we're done.

975
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,480
We'll drop you on the way
to the airport,

976
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,529
after you get
your 10 grand, of course.

977
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,168
Here.

978
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,401
Put these on.

979
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,607
Let's go.

980
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,805
Nikki and Tate, pull lookout

981
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,325
while we make the pickup, okay?

982
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,241
Where are we?

983
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,165
It's a safe house.
Russians keep their VIPs here.

984
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,049
They stash other stuff, too.

985
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,565
Well, what do you need me for?

986
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,484
It's a two-man job.

987
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,687
Well, why can't Dylan
go in with you?

988
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,484
Dylan's watching our exit.

989
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,843
How are we getting in,
through the skylight?

990
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,001
Copy that.

991
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,361
What's inside there?

992
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,164
A new plateau, my friend.

993
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,405
It's not loaded.

994
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,364
Can't we go in unarmed?

995
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,241
I'm going in with you.

996
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,243
It's you and me together
this time, all right?

997
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,448
You're really down
with this, Dylan?

998
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,171
How about you just
do your job, all right?

999
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,120
Hey, get your head in it,
Cam, right now!

1000
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,601
We're doing this for Nikki,
remember?

1001
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,324
- Pull over.
- Why?

1002
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,970
'Cause I gotta take a piss.

1003
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,245
Tate, come on!

1004
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,731
- I can't.
- What?

1005
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,687
Come on, Nikki.
Everybody knows about you and Cam.

1006
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,761
Stop the van, Tate.

1007
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,081
- No.
- Pull over!

1008
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,685
Would you shut up already?

1009
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,681
Pull the fuck over.

1010
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,481
Once we're inside,
just do everything I say.

1011
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,360
I've got this all worked out.

1012
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,968
On 3. Ready?

1013
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,606
1, 2, 3.

1014
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,681
Be quiet!

1015
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,890
Don't move! Don't move!

1016
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,800
Sit! Sit down!

1017
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,480
What's going on?

1018
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,681
Watch them!

1019
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,201
Don't move.

1020
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,291
What's the exit plan?

1021
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,601
Huh?

1022
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,970
This is the exit plan, Cam.

1023
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,687
Dylan, what are you doing?

1024
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,211
- Don't... Don't move.
- Dylan.

1025
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,283
Do it! He's got the diamonds!

1026
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,401
Dylan.

1027
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,560
Dylan, put the gun down!

1028
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,641
Don't move!

1029
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,250
All units, 10-10, shots fired

1030
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,402
at 2-3-1 West 23rd.

1031
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,329
Repeat, shots fired.

1032
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,245
DEA! I'm taking your car!

1033
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,526
No!

1034
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,006
Nikki! Nikki, are you okay?

1035
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,161
- Huh?
- Are you okay?

1036
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,129
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Come on. Come on.

1037
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,320
Come on.

1038
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,806
This way!

1039
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,651
No, no, no.

1040
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,521
I'm done!

1041
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,327
Move away, Nikki.

1042
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,641
I don't want to hurt you.

1043
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,766
I'm not gonna ask
you again, baby.

1044
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,081
Move away.

1045
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,966
Agent Hatcher.

1046
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,287
Chen?

1047
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:57,483
James...

1048
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,129
Okay, listen, I can explain.

1049
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,801
There's been a mistake.

1050
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,405
There has.

1051
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,561
You made it.

1052
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,285
Yeah, I believe
it was rule number 2.

1053
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,166
Stay out of Chinatown.

1054
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,288
- You son of a bitch!
- Watch your language.

1055
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,811
You're in Chen's house now.

1056
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,884
I told you a long time ago

1057
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,646
to keep your business
out of my neighborhood.

1058
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,326
And I did, Chen.
I did, but this is personal.

1059
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,720
So is this.

1060
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,240
You've been making
too much trouble

1061
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,765
for too many of my friends.

1062
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,924
Okay, Chen,
listen to me, please...

1063
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,329
There is a boat leaving
for Macau in 2 hours.

1064
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,721
Mr. Hu will make sure you're on it.

1065
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,285
Time to close you out.

1066
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:52,405
You're dead, both of you.

1067
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,486
You're dead.

1068
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,091
But enough about him.

1069
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,091
You have something for me?

1070
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,491
If I were you,
I'd seriously consider leaving town.

1071
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,041
Congratulations.

1072
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,366
Your debt is clear.

1073
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,962
That's it?

1074
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,406
We're all done.

1075
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,641
Wait.

1076
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,165
What about our deal?

1077
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Where to?

1078
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,685
Let's just drive.

1079
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,604
<i> Can I borrow your time? <i>

1080
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,162
