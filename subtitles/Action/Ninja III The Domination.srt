1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,399
The police are searching for Robert
Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,039
who disappeared earlier this evening
from her home.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,079
What are you doing to find her?

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,239
- Sarah Lund. Who is this?
- The girl's all right.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,759
I'm collecting on a debt.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,559
We're looking into a connection between
this case and the Zeuthen kidnapping.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,399
Those killed have been
instrumental in closing the case.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,559
- They're willing to pay 100 million.
- I can get more out of it than that.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,639
Why didn't you
let me take her home?

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,439
- What case?
- I don't know anything about it.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,719
It's important to the perpetrator.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,479
Get a hold of the directors.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,039
- Make sure we're not hiding anything.
- Hiding what?

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,039
Maja is looking for the smallest thing.
Perhaps one ought to look elsewhere.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,919
PM Kamper broke off his electoral tour
in Jutland to return to Christiansburg.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,759
- A 13-year old girl was found dead.
- Did you intervene?

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,719
No. There was nothing to suggest,
the case wasn't solved.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,919
No, but there bloody well is now!
Emilie's life depends on this case.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,999
- You can't get personally involved.
- I know what I'm doing, thanks.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,199
He's asked me to tell you,
that he'll pay anything.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,839
I have a suggestion.
A life for a life.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
I'll get Zeuthen,
and you'll get the girl.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,199
If he loves his daughter enough,
then he will save her.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,799
Prepare Zeuthen.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,519
And, Lund...
remember, this is your last chance.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,079
THE KILLING III

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,239
The situation is very tense tonight,
and sources have revealed,

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,079
that the kidnapping of Emilie Zeuthen
may be entering its final phase.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,239
The Prime Minister has rushed back
to Christiansburg,

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,839
after once again denying all criticism
of the government's handling of the case.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,079
Zeuthen is in the car,

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,439
the perp hasn't called,
and no one knows where they are.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,439
- Do we know why Zeuthen is with them?
- He wanted to cooperate.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,679
About the call from Jens Lebech.
I have informed Special Branch.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,919
They're taking it seriously,
but it's not illegal to call the PM.

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,079
Hello?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,719
He's just provoking you.
In his eyes, you've taken his wife.

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,119
- He must have leaked...
- I don't give a damn about his motive.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,519
I've defended the Justice Minister.
If his story checks out, I want to know.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,079
- The Treasurer wants a meeting.
- Not now. Focus on the kidnapping.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,399
- She's in the department - talk to her.
- You just fired the Justice Minister.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,799
- If you like Mogens so much, join him.
- Come on, we're on your side!

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,439
- Everyone's trying to save your arse.
- It's a risky move, please reconsider.

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,679
The perpetrator was last seen
driving a black truck.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,519
Emilie is probably on board, but so far
there's no contact with the vehicle.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,599
Lund and Zeuthen
are on the E20 South.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,239
We're using
encrypted radio channels.

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,959
All escort cars
will keep a low profile.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,159
No lights, no helicopters -
understood?

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,559
- Have you found the truck?
- No, but we have people on the address.

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,599
I was just there.

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,039
Emilie's been there,
but nothing points to where they went.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,959
- Can we trace him?
- No, he's changed internet providers.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,559
Excuse me, Brix,
but you must be able to find a truck.

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,279
What do you think we're trying to do?
Lund and Zeuthen are well covered.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,919
- SWAT can be deployed in 20 seconds.
- I'm sure the perp's aware of that.

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,759
Borch.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,999
- Why doesn't he call?
- He will call.

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,599
What do you intend to do?

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,519
When we know the exchange location,
we'll pull you out and free her.

61
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,599
What if he finds out
that you're cheating?

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,039
As soon as we've tracked him down,
we won't be waiting for him.

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,999
- Don't worry about that.
- What if that's what he expects?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,239
- We have the necessary manpower.
- And you've tried this before?

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,519
Yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,679
- Is Robert Zeuthen there?
- Yes. Do you want to talk to him?

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,959
I'll get my chance.

68
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,039
- Where are you?
- By exit 37.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,679
- Where are we going?
- The invitation is only for two.

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,279
- There's only two of us.
- I don't believe you.

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,039
Don't do anything stupid,
if you want to see the girl again.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,559
- Just tell us what to do.
- Take exit 38.

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
If I sense that you're not alone,
this is the last you'll hear from me.

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,519
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,519
- Next exit. She's there in one minute.
- What's in that area?

76
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,039
It's a deserted country road.
There's nothing there.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,679
Shit, the perp's been able to spot
the escort cars from miles away!

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,439
- Then we'll increase the distance.
- We've no idea where he is, Brix.

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,359
- What will Lund do if anything happens?
- We're following her via the car's GPS.

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,719
And I refuse to ask the perpetrator
for permission to stay on the motorway.

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,039
There's news on the truck.

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,319
I think we've found him. A Volvo FH16.
The same model we saw at the building.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,519
- But is it that one?
- It's carrying a shipping container.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,039
- One tail light's smashed. It's him.
- What's he doing with a container?

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,919
- No idea, but it's him. Do we stop him?
- No, don't do anything.

86
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,839
- We could stop him for a faulty tyre.
- Just keep your distance and wait.

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,439
Where are you exactly?

88
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,039
I can still see the cars. Get them
out of here. I'm about to exit. Over.

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,719
Roger that. Asbjørn has a visual on
the perpetrator, a few miles behind you.

90
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,239
We'll send two cars forward.
The rest will follow Lund with GPS.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,759
No escort cars within viewing distance.

92
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,799
Birgit, it'll have to wait.
I don't want Mogens around right now.

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,399
You defended him in the press and on TV,
and then you go and sack him.

94
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,959
Because he's not in control.
His own officials say so.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,559
- Jens Lebech has his own reasons.
- I need to go back in.

96
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,319
There's no evidence Mogens put pressure
on the assistant public prosecutor.

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,879
Not even Special Branch believe
there's anything to it.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,399
If the kidnapping ends badly,
they will pin it on you.

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,839
They've traced the perpetrator's car
and are planning to free Emilie Zeuthen.

100
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,159
Keep me informed. Tell Stoffer
that we're meeting with Birgit.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,959
He went downstairs to pick up
a report from the Ministry of Justice.

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,999
You don't need to go to reception.
I'm the one who called you.

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,439
I've asked your brother to call, but his
arrogance is clouding his judgment.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,279
- What do you want?
- Your brother has ruined my life.

105
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,679
It doesn't take up much space
in his calendar,

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,279
but I want to give him a chance
to make up for it.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,399
You want him
to keep his hands off Rosa?

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,559
Yes. I have information that could ruin
everything you've fought for.

109
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,799
So, is that too much to ask?

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,399
If you want to help your brother,
then scamper off to get him.

111
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,999
The Prime Minister won't be blackmailed
by some disloyal official,

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,359
who can't hang onto his wife.
Does that answer your question?

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,959
Yes. Then you're asking for it.

114
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,919
You've just received an email.

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,759
- Yes, but what did he say?
- He didn't say any more.

116
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,719
I told him to get stuffed,
because he doesn't have anything.

117
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,159
We'll get Special Branch
to check the idiot out.

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,479
I'm going back to see what's happening.

119
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,199
Kristian, wait. We received some images
from an anonymous source.

120
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,879
It looks like something from a
surveillance camera at Christiansburg.

121
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,759
Isn't that the Justice Minister?

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,079
- And who is that?
- We didn't finish.

123
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,679
Get hold of Mogens right away.

124
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,679
- Lund speaking.
- I'm on my way. Everything OK?

125
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,759
Yes, I'm still on the main road.

126
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,199
The truck is approaching the exit.
They'll stage an accident and stop him.

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,119
SWAT are joined
by army sharpshooters...

128
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,119
I understand. I'll just continue
until further notice.

129
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,639
One more thing.

130
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,759
Maybe it wasn't Zeuthen or Zeeland
who were covering things up.

131
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,479
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,799
I've discovered that the prosecutor and
the investigator fiddled with the time.

133
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,799
In the report, she disappeared on Friday.
The foster family says it was Thursday.

134
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,839
Why is that important?

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,519
The Zeeland sailors weren't
in Danish waters on the Thursday.

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,439
Do you understand what I'm saying?

137
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,039
Yes. You'd better stop that car.

138
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,119
- They'll shoot him with Emilie there?
- They know what they're doing.

139
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,679
- Yes?
- Have you reached the woods?

140
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,039
No, there are only fields.

141
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,319
Then it's coming up. You'll find
a disused workshop. Wait there.

142
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,639
04-36, the workshop is disused.
The perpetrator is nowhere near it.

143
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,959
Pull over and wait.

144
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,639
Carl is at your mum's.
She's trying to get him to sleep.

145
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,359
We have visual contact with the truck
that Emilie is likely to be in.

146
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,359
- We're about to stop it.
- What if...?

147
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,559
I can't go into detail, but we're not
taking any chances. We're very careful.

148
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,719
- I'd like to be there.
- Yes, I'll provide a car for you.

149
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,919
But you'll have to wait
until the operation is over.

150
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,279
- He's speeding up. Will you make it?
- SWAT are in position.

151
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,959
Keep your distance. The accident site
is coming up in 1,200 metres.

152
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,919
Roger that.
He's slowing down now.

153
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,239
010-04, Brix, we have a problem.
The truck is indicating.

154
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,639
He's taking exit 35. I'm positive.
He's taking the exit now.

155
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,999
- It makes no sense. Lund exited later.
- 010-04, we'll follow him. Over.

156
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,319
What's happening?

157
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,599
Asbjørn has a visual.
We'll try again.

158
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,799
- What do we do?
- Stay where you are. He's far away.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,799
- What?
- They'll try again in a while.

160
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,479
What happened?

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,879
Did he spot them?

162
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,039
- Hello?
- You took your time finding the phone.

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,159
What do you have in mind now?

164
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,759
This is more private.
Get in the car.

165
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,559
No, stop.
Not that car, Lund.

166
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,759
Look up.

167
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,239
Leave your phones
where I can see them.

168
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,159
You don't have a choice.
Just do as I say.

169
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,959
Do you see the van?

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,839
It's for you.

171
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,759
We need to increase our distance.
There's no traffic. He'll spot us. Over.

172
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,199
SWAT are 300 metres behind you.

173
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,239
When the road splits, they'll overtake him,
and then cut him off. Over.

174
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,399
Yes, but they need to hurry.

175
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,599
022-12, what's happening?

176
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,319
The truck has stopped
in a viaduct. Over.

177
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,999
Is he stuck?

178
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,119
- 022-12, report back.
- Shit!

179
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,719
Brix, he's gone.

180
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,279
He left behind the container.

181
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,039
04-36, Lund, come in.
Brix here, we have a problem.

182
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,839
Lund, come in.

183
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,479
Lund?

184
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,119
The car's abandoned. Their phones
have been thrown on the ground.

185
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,239
- They've continued in another vehicle.
- We have the area surrounded.

186
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,799
- They can't just up and disappear.
- Just find that bloody truck, now!

187
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
No, wait.

188
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,479
Yes?

189
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,199
Send Zeuthen over,
then the girl walks.

190
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,159
We've traced you.
You have no chance of escape.

191
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,279
If anyone knew where I was,
don't you think they'd step in?

192
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,319
What's he saying?

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,639
Send Zeuthen over now.
Last chance.

194
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,279
- I'll go.
- No, you'll stay here.

195
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,559
He'd have no reason to let her go
once he's killed you.

196
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,439
They'll be here soon.

197
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,199
I'll go.
Stay here.

198
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,319
- Lund, what are you waiting for?
- I'm coming for Emilie now.

199
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,559
I want you
to send Zeuthen over first.

200
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,159
Zeuthen will come
when I have Emilie.

201
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,559
Why are you doing this? Why do you
risk your life for these people?

202
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,199
I know that Louise Hjelby
meant a great deal to you.

203
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,079
What happened back then was horrible,
but Robert Zeuthen is not to blame.

204
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,919
Zeeland had the case closed.
Zeuthen is responsible, and you know it.

205
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,359
Why risk it all
to protect the sailors?

206
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,159
You can ask Zeuthen that.

207
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,799
I don't have to, because I know
that they couldn't have done it.

208
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,399
The local investigator or the assistant
public prosecutor fiddled the case.

209
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,999
The date of the girl's disappearance
was changed to the following day.

210
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,439
That means, the sailors weren't even
in the country the day she went missing.

211
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,599
Just shut up and send Zeuthen
out onto the bridge.

212
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,279
All they did was to find the girl.

213
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,039
Someone must have stopped them from
saying that it didn't appear to be a suicide.

214
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,199
They never admitted
anything else to you, did they?

215
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,399
And what about
the assistant public prosecutor?

216
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,839
Did he say anything about Zeeland
or Zeuthen getting the case closed?

217
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,399
Did he?

218
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,359
I'll put down my gun
and come in unarmed.

219
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,639
We can talk more about that
when Emilie is safe.

220
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,239
OK?

221
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,199
You speak well for her, but it's too late.
Zeuthen deserves to suffer as I have.

222
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,199
Zeuthen has nothing to do with this.

223
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,799
Where is she?

224
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,319
- Dad!
- Emilie!

225
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,239
Emilie!

226
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,879
Dad!

227
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,439
- Dad!
- Emilie!

228
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,079
Dad!

229
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,079
Emilie!

230
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,799
You'll get whatever you want,
but you have to give us Emilie.

231
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,439
Emilie!

232
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,279
No!

233
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,199
Zeuthen!
No!

234
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,399
Emilie!

235
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,839
No!

236
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,279
Did you or did you not have a meeting
with that public prosecutor?

237
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,279
As I've always said,
the answer is no.

238
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,319
So, it isn't you with him here?

239
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,279
- What did you talk about?
- I don't know...

240
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,679
Will you recall if I tell you the photos
have been sent to several news editors?

241
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,119
I just wanted to make sure
that everything was done properly.

242
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,079
Zeeland were mentioned in the case.

243
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,319
You got him to put a lid on the case,
and Zeuthen's daughter is paying for it.

244
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,759
- I didn't. I would never break the law.
- You've shelved this case.

245
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,359
You've withheld information that could
have helped the police solve the case.

246
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

247
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,319
What the hell were you thinking?

248
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,479
They say that he shot her.

249
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,519
They say that she's been killed.

250
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,999
The helicopter won't be an eye in the sky
in the dark, but he can't have gone far.

251
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,639
- What about the girl?
- The tidal current is strong,

252
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,679
but we'll find her within a few hours.

253
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,319
Emilie!

254
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,719
Where is she?

255
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,239
Emilie?
Where is she?

256
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,759
It can't be.

257
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,039
No.

258
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,359
No! No!

259
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,639
Good morning.

260
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,879
I hope it's OK, I stayed another night.
I haven't slept that well for ages.

261
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,399
I've had a lot of problems
with my lower back.

262
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,079
When the baby turns and kicks.
Did you have that?

263
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,959
I took some sofa cushions,
and now it's all gone.

264
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,039
Did you get a chance to talk to him?

265
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,759
- Who?
- Mark.

266
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,639
- Oh, yes.
- What did he say?

267
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,559
We didn't quite finish.
I'll try to get hold of him again.

268
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,039
That's all right.
I'll figure it out myself.

269
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,959
He knows we're going for a scan today,
so, I'm expecting him to show up.

270
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,719
It's just a routine check.

271
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,679
But I'm a little nervous.
You hear so many stories, right?

272
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,079
There was a call for you from Bopa...

273
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,079
- OPA. Yes.
- There's no point.

274
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,439
That one, it's completely dead.
You can't bring it back to life.

275
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,599
If you lift it up
and have a look at the roots...

276
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,639
Look, they're all dried up.

277
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,839
It's a pity. It could be a really nice
garden, if you did a bit of planting.

278
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,239
Not right now but...

279
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,599
I used to work at a plant nursery.
That's how I know.

280
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,479
I'm going in to have my bath.

281
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,079
Don't forget to drink your tea
while it's hot.

282
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,639
We found the boat a few hours ago.
It was abandoned in Copenhagen harbour.

283
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,959
No one's seen the perpetrator,
but there were muster rolls,

284
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,039
departure times and a list of ships
that passed through Øresund last night.

285
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,479
He seems to have escaped on one,

286
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,519
so, we're checking
with the shipping companies.

287
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,999
- Great. Has Brix been informed?
- Yes. He's in a meeting with management.

288
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,159
The assistant commissioner called.

289
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,439
They want a word,
when you've seen the boat.

290
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,719
If the perpetrator has sailed on,
it doesn't make much difference.

291
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,479
- Are we just giving up?
- We did what we could.

292
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,839
It's out of our hands. Interpol
and Europol will take it from here.

293
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,319
- Why didn't you wait for us?
- I didn't have that option.

294
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,239
You did everything he asked of you.

295
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,839
You could have shot him.

296
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,839
You let her die in front of her father.

297
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,599
- Has the body been recovered?
- They're trying to get it free.

298
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,199
The concrete block pulled it in between
some old bridge elements on the bottom.

299
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,039
Great. Let the parents know that
we'll brief them when they're ready.

300
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,319
And inform Borch that Special Branch
will have to deal with Interpol.

301
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,199
Borch is here. He came back
when he'd been to see the boat.

302
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,959
He hasn't been home to sleep.

303
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,279
- They say he's gone abroad.
- Why don't you just go home?

304
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,519
The head of Special Branch
has called to ask...

305
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,999
I know, Kasper.

306
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,599
Why did he sail the boat all the way
to Copenhagen harbour? It's odd.

307
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,359
I've passed the case on to Interpol.
They're now collecting the material.

308
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,719
The perpetrator prepared this well.
He kidnaps Emilie Zeuthen,

309
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,319
kills people left and right,
and rejects a shitload of millions,

310
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,599
because apparently he's only out
to avenge a forgotten crime out west.

311
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,239
But when you tell him on the bridge,
there's a chance

312
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,159
he may be wrong about Zeuthen,

313
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,399
then he shoots the girl anyway.

314
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,279
- Yes.
- It doesn't make sense.

315
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,439
If he understood you, he can't just kill
the girl as if it doesn't matter.

316
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,679
- Just go home. Interpol will...
- I have been at home.

317
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,999
Well, I was sitting in the car watching
Marie making breakfast for the girls.

318
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,999
It looked nice. They were probably
chatting about oatmeal and swimming,

319
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,079
and the squirrels in the garden.

320
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,439
I just couldn't get things to add up.

321
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,639
We have to find this guy.
We must have overlooked something.

322
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,919
I feel as if I've forgotten
my phone or my keys.

323
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,279
The head of Special Branch
has just called again.

324
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,239
I've told you already!

325
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,479
I'll be right there, for fuck's sake!
You don't let up!

326
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,159
There you are.

327
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,719
DI Sarah Lund, this is Tage Steiner
from the Public Prosecutor's office.

328
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,759
The Commissioner has requested
an inquiry into the handling

329
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,079
of the Zeuthen kidnapping.

330
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,159
It's a bad situation, so we need
to account for what happened,

331
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,879
and place responsibility
for possible errors.

332
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,839
I'd really like to speak to you,
so, if you stay in the building,

333
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,759
I'll let you know when I'm ready.

334
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,959
Get this mess cleaned up.

335
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,239
Robert, I don't know how to express...

336
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,959
Please tell me if there's anything,
you want me to...

337
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,559
Everyone's... deeply touched,
and we've received many...

338
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,479
They've found her, and they're
expecting to bring her up soon.

339
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,919
Then she will be driven
to Forensics where...

340
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,119
The police have offered to give you
an update whenever you want,

341
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,559
but not until it suits you, of course.

342
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,479
- Would you handle the practicalities?
- Certainly.

343
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,839
Prepare the priest and tell him,
that it will be as Maja wants.

344
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,999
Yes, I will.

345
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,519
Carl is at his grandmother's.
He hasn't been told anything,

346
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,399
so, it's up to you and Maja
when you want to...

347
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,759
The new material raises doubts about
the Prime Minister's role in the case.

348
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,519
The government have apparently kept
vital information out of the investigation.

349
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,439
So far, Kristian Kamper hasn't reacted
to the tragic outcome of the kidnapping.

350
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,319
I told you to keep an eye on him.
It's essential we're there for him.

351
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,759
- He just wants a little time to himself.
- We help him make the right decisions.

352
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,319
He shouldn't be sitting in this old house,
when half of Denmark is asking about him.

353
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,399
We're here, so let's be constructive.
And nothing's happened.

354
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,439
Karen...

355
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

356
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,679
Would you please
bring in a couple of these?

357
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,639
I've decided to keep the house.

358
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,919
I came to see if they had
sorted out the water damage.

359
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,519
It dawned on me that the fireplace
hasn't been used for a long time.

360
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,399
But we have plenty of things to do,
so maybe we should get going.

361
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,999
Let's focus. Special Branch will take care
of the crazy ex-husband...

362
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,759
I have decided to resign
as Prime Minister,

363
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,559
and as party leader.

364
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,599
I should have listened to you.
I shouldn't have gotten involved.

365
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,319
- But I couldn't help it.
- What the hell are you on about?

366
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,199
- Is this a joke, or a piss-take?
- The Justice Minister is to blame.

367
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,479
- He'll have to swallow it.
- No, it was my responsibility.

368
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,119
Listen, he had a two-hour-long meeting
with the assistant public prosecutor.

369
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,119
Maybe so, but my role
will always be questioned.

370
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,599
And I won't discuss responsibility
over Emilie Zeuthen’s grave.

371
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,079
- You won't have to. It's down to Mogens.
- Set up a meeting with Birgit.

372
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,399
- I want to tell her before the group.
- No, I won't.

373
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,799
This is about personal involvement.
You've done what you could.

374
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,919
You've had your own personal misfortune.
People will understand.

375
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,759
It was no misfortune,
so, we're not going there at all.

376
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,919
Benjamin had been depressed
for quite a long time.

377
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,159
One morning he suddenly
disappeared from his room.

378
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,039
We thought he'd come back,
but he didn't.

379
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,959
And he didn't come the next day
or the one after that.

380
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,879
When the police finally found him,
I threw myself into my work,

381
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,679
and kept telling myself
that I'd done what I could.

382
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,719
But the truth is
that I should've been there for him.

383
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,799
I've known all along,

384
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,959
but it doesn't change a thing.

385
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,359
And it doesn't give you
the right to give up.

386
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,519
Karen, let's just get it
over and done with.

387
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,399
A minute's silence
will be held at noon.

388
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,519
Then I'd like to pay my condolences
to Zeuthen in person... when he's ready.

389
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,599
I'll get him to reconsider
for the meeting with Birgit.

390
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,959
Everything possible is of course
being done to find the perpetrator.

391
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,359
We have a suspicion
that he may have escaped abroad.

392
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,159
And we're not sure of his identity yet,
but we're working on the assumption

393
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,999
that he could be
a former Zeeland employee.

394
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,679
We can offer you
psychological counseling.

395
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,919
Where is she now?

396
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,159
She'll be brought up soon. It's something
technical to do with salvage operations.

397
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,959
I don't know the details,
but it shouldn't be long.

398
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,559
What was she wearing?

399
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,279
You saw her.

400
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,879
- It was very dark.
- She was wearing black rain clothes.

401
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,999
Was she afraid?

402
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,999
She didn't see anything.

403
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,159
I don't think she understood
what was happening.

404
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,479
She didn't feel the water.

405
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:15,119
I would like to see her.

406
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,599
Yes. I'll pass that on.

407
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,759
- If there's anything else...
- Maja?

408
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,999
I'm really sorry.

409
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,599
The public prosecutor
will see you now.

410
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,039
Carl will stay at his mum's.
We'll come for a few things later.

411
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,999
You've been involved since they found
the first dead sailor at the scrap yard.

412
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,199
There have been three exchange attempts,
all with a fatal outcome.

413
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,159
It was never the perpetrator's plan
for those exchanges to succeed.

414
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,079
You refrained from passing on an amount
equivalent to 100 million kroner.

415
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,239
- Who gave that order?
- It was my decision. It didn't matter.

416
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,879
- The perpetrator accepted the amount.
- Yes, but it was all about the old case.

417
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,839
Which allegedly is the reason why
a colleague committed suicide in custody.

418
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,439
It was partly his responsibility that
the killing of Louise was never solved.

419
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,439
If it was a killing.

420
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,559
The coroner changed the autopsy report
under pressure from the public prosecutor.

421
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,919
Someone must have
put pressure on him.

422
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,519
There's never been any evidence,
and all the witnesses were killed.

423
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,759
There's the original autopsy report.

424
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,759
Regarding Emilie Zeuthen's death
and what happened last night,

425
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,999
did you feel properly covered?

426
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,919
Managerially - the decision
to bring Zeuthen along in the car.

427
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,399
I helped make that decision.

428
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,999
You didn't have managerial
responsibility for that operation.

429
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,719
We need to place responsibility.

430
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,879
- Don't we owe that to the girl?
- You want rid of Brix.

431
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,319
I didn't say anything about that.

432
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,039
But I understand that you're transferring
to OPA, so you can speak freely.

433
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,319
- Is there anything else?
- Only what's on your mind.

434
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,839
- Hi, it's Mark, leave a message.
- Borch called, give him a call.

435
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,319
Thanks. I'm afraid I'll have to go
to the hospital with my son's girlfriend.

436
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,239
Numerous sailors were signed onto ships
from Copenhagen harbour last night.

437
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,399
If the perpetrator boarded one
that passed through Øresund...

438
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,599
Anyway, the clues lead abroad,
so he's gone.

439
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,999
I'm sorry that it had to end like this.

440
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,079
I hope that you...

441
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,999
- Time to place the blame.
- That's not what this is about.

442
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,559
- The public prosecutor is ready for you.
- What's it about then?

443
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,399
Isn't it obvious? Robert Zeuthen
and Zeeland aren't just anybody,

444
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,399
and the government stands to fall
on this, so it must be investigated.

445
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,279
Ruth, I took the responsibility that none
of the other jerks in management wanted.

446
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,519
And I'm being punished for that?

447
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,919
- I just do as I'm told.
- Yes, but what's your opinion?

448
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,759
- Back me up, damn it.
- This is the last thing I want.

449
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,359
But because you and I...

450
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,439
...share a past together, I can't risk
anyone getting the wrong idea.

451
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:21,239
Let's go all the way. We'll put a new
candidate forward before the election.

452
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,359
We'll show initiative and perhaps
limit the extent of the defeat.

453
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,039
No prime minister has ever stepped down
in the middle of an election campaign.

454
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,759
If Kristian doesn't step down, we risk
this case haunting us for a long time.

455
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,919
This is utter madness.

456
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,239
- The group will never support it.
- I've made enquiries.

457
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,119
Everyone's in agreement.
Kristian's hurting the party.

458
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,119
He will always be the prime minister
who lost Emilie Zeuthen,

459
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,719
and it has damaged the government's
relationship with Zeeland.

460
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,799
- But he's not to blame for that.
- I didn't want all this to happen.

461
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,639
- If you disagree, then let us know.
- I don't disagree.

462
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,279
Get hold of Karen and ask her
to set up a press conference.

463
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,439
I'm sorry the case is hurting Kamper,
but don't forget about me.

464
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,439
It's also my future. I haven't slept.
Journalists are hounding me with calls.

465
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,999
Come on. Admit that you put pressure
on the assistant public prosecutor.

466
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,599
- But I didn't put pressure on him.
- Then you account for the whole affair.

467
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,679
It has to be clear that at no point
was the prime minister aware,

468
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,999
that you had withheld information.

469
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,879
My meeting with the public prosecutor
was merely an enquiry.

470
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,039
I need to go upstairs and lie down.
I feel bloody awful.

471
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,199
Were there any others present?

472
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,559
Can anyone confirm what you're saying?

473
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,199
No, it was unofficial.

474
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,719
We were the only two at Snapstinget
for the half hour the meeting lasted.

475
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,679
- What?
- I should have told you about it.

476
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,159
- I just wanted to keep things quiet.
- You said half an hour.

477
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,439
Yes. 20 minutes. I don't know.
I was running late.

478
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,999
The assistant public prosecutor
was in a meeting for two hours.

479
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,919
I got the times from the guard.
He arrived at 13.54 and left at 16.10.

480
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,559
That's more than two hours later.

481
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,359
I'm not remembering wrong.

482
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,319
Not this time anyway.

483
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,319
Let's find some good images
of the little one.

484
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,439
It's not really with it today.

485
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,759
It's OK to sit down.

486
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,279
I'm really happy that you're here.

487
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,599
Maybe it's more for Mark's sake,
but I'm really happy that you're here.

488
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,079
It's turned around nicely,
so it won't be long now.

489
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,479
Here you can see
the two ventricles and atriums.

490
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,359
And nice little fingers.

491
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,959
Mark should have seen this.

492
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,879
Look the other way,
if you don't want to know the sex.

493
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,959
- Now it's started moving about.
- Yes, I can feel it.

494
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,679
How does it look, Sarah?
Can you see what sex it is?

495
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,359
Yes, you can.
It looks great.

496
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,959
There are no problems.
Everything's in order.

497
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,039
It looks like it's going
to be a lively little one.

498
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,639
I'll wait outside.

499
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,119
- Excuse me, Brix said you were here.
- I can't talk.

500
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,959
On the bridge last night you tried to
explain to the perp that he was wrong.

501
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,559
Later we find his boat. He's eager
to show us that he's going abroad.

502
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,399
I don't have the time now, Borch.

503
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,359
Then this morning there's a break-in
at the Maritime Authority's archives.

504
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,719
These are copies
of the stolen papers.

505
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,239
Routes, port calls
for the Zeeland ship.

506
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,199
- Sarah, listen!
- I don't care.

507
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,399
What's your problem?
Don't you understand that it's over -

508
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,999
that she's dead?

509
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,559
The perpetrator listened to you.

510
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,919
You made him think twice.

511
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,679
He probably planned to go abroad,
but he changed his mind.

512
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,279
You made him stop and think
about what he was doing.

513
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,079
I saw him shoot her.

514
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,879
Did you?

515
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,279
I didn't find Karen, but we're ready
and I have to let the journalists in.

516
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,879
I've put in a good word to Birgit.
You and Karen will continue in the party.

517
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,239
Am I supposed to be grateful or what?

518
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,679
- Kamper, I just wanted to dip the flag.
- That's nice of you.

519
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,559
I'm genuinely sorry after all
that it had to end this way.

520
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,279
- But you've made the right decision.
- Thanks. I have a press conference so...

521
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,439
I'm sure that you've done your best.

522
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,999
You've tried to make a difference. You've
been at the head of the table so long,

523
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,639
that the skeletons come crashing out
of the cupboard, which is rarely pretty.

524
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,239
- Let's hope you can do better then.
- We have to win the election first.

525
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:45,319
Rosa and the Centre Party have said yes
to a meeting, so we may put things right.

526
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,399
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

527
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,839
Good luck in the future.

528
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,799
Rosa is a bit of a turncoat, huh?

529
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,199
Shall we get started?
There you are, Karen.

530
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,439
I was beginning to worry.

531
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,359
There's something you need to see.

532
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,679
- I have a press conference.
- You need to see this first. You too.

533
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,039
I borrowed this footage
from one of the guards.

534
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,839
Mogens' meeting with the prosecutor
lasts 17 minutes.

535
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,799
Mogens rushes off to another meeting.
The prosecutor goes to the toilets.

536
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,759
- I don't have time.
- Just look at this.

537
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,519
- He comes back out but doesn't leave.
- It doesn't matter, let's go.

538
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,439
If Karen thinks this is important...

539
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,559
It's pathetic
that you continue with this.

540
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,719
I've made sure
that you both have jobs, so drop this.

541
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,599
Do you think we're helping you
for our own sakes?

542
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,279
- It's not for my sake or the nation's.
- All right.

543
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,879
- You can bury yourself in peace.
- Stoffer, wait a minute.

544
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,239
- It doesn't matter. Let's go in.
- No, don't be so damn self-righteous.

545
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,479
You're watching this to the bloody end.
You can go home and give up afterwards.

546
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,759
This is the entrance by the show grounds.
The prosecutor met with someone else.

547
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,679
It's Reinhardt.
I'm afraid it's still dragging on.

548
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,279
The police are hoping
to salvage her soon.

549
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,999
I'll call when there's more news.

550
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,959
I can't find Carl's bedtime book.
The one about...

551
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,599
I can't find it.

552
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,559
I don't know where it is.
Perhaps it's upstairs in his room.

553
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,319
I've already looked there.

554
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,439
The rain clothes weren't black.

555
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,319
They were dark blue.

556
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,119
Her hair was loose,
and it was ruffled.

557
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,239
Maybe she'd been wearing a woolly hat.

558
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,439
She looked lovely.

559
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,399
She called out to me,
and I replied but...

560
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,999
At first I couldn't see her,
but she was looking up at me...

561
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,159
...and I could see that she was afraid.

562
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,759
But she was too far away for me to...

563
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,919
There wasn't enough time.

564
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,159
If you think it's my fault,
then say it.

565
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,359
Just say that it's my fault.

566
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,959
You think I should have done something.
You think I should have...

567
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,319
They're pulling her up now.

568
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,039
The sack has come loose.
It probably drifted off with the current.

569
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,799
We'll start dragging the spot
in a few minutes.

570
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,679
What's their progress?

571
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,199
The boat has just arrived.

572
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,439
The technicians were about to begin,
but then Borch came to do something.

573
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,879
- Why?
- Come.

574
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,599
You took your time.

575
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,999
So we're assuming it was the perpetrator
who stole the papers this morning.

576
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,119
Do you remember,
if this one was open?

577
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,079
- It wasn't. He didn't stand there.
- What are you talking about?

578
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,239
Doubt sets in. He finds out that
he isn't done, and he's in a hurry.

579
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,839
What about this one, Sarah?

580
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,759
It happened so fast.

581
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,759
The boat was only out of sight
for a few seconds.

582
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,879
You saw her die.
He threw her overboard.

583
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,439
Let's try to rewind here.

584
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,599
Where was she standing in the end,
and where was he?

585
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,439
What the hell are we looking for?

586
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,559
Move away from there.
