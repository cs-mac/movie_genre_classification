1
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,400
All right now gentleman, 
bring me up to speed on your meeting

2
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,170
With hallswell's people this morning.

3
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,640
Senator, we're going to have to 
move fast to gather the support we need.

5
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,070
Senator hallswell is determined
to reign all those regions in the mideast.

6
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,740
If we've learned anything in the
past 50 years, it is that every

8
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,910
Gun, locket and tank we sell
will eventually be used against us.

10
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,520
Screw Hallswell.

11
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,880
We have enough support to get by
him and the vice president has--

12
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,050
been making calls.

13
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,250
That is what I'm afraid of.

14
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,530
Son, you forgot my glass.

15
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,460
Excuse me.

16
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
Listen richard, you can think
whatever you want of this guy.

17
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,600
But just remember he's got
a lot of friends in this town.

18
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,270
Yeah, and most of them democrats.

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,870
That's funny.

20
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,950
Did you hear they're making a movie 
about Dan Quail's military career?

22
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,780
It's called full dinner jacket.

23
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,270
Senator?

24
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,570
Just a hot flash.

25
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,710
Are you okay?

26
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,340
Senator!

27
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,380
Jesus he is having a seizure.

28
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,650
Call the paramedics!

29
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
I know CPR.

30
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,350
Amazing, it is exactly what we need.

31
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,080
And you shall have it alright.

32
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,820
You shall have it.

33
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,330
Well, for the dog days,
it's another beautiful day--

34
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,530
-- in the capital city.

35
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,160
It's hot.

36
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,200
And we've just been informed
that police have completely shut

37
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,470
Down all lanes on the Whitehurst
Freeway between Pennsylvania and--

38
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,040
-- the 3rd street exit.

39
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,170
We are told that it is
some sort of bomb scare.

40
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,910
Emergency vehicles are on the
scene and as you may imagine,

41
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,810
Traffic is already backed
up all the way to Virginia.

42
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,420
This is WNLC and  
I'm Terry in the morning.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,980
We'll keep you posted for
any further developments.

44
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,650
Am I going to?

45
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Die?

46
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,520
Yes.

47
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,130
I mean today.

48
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,760
We've got one eccentric husband.

49
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,570
Do you believe this?

50
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,170
Have one little affair..

51
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,370
And this is what he does.

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,470
How does it look?

53
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,550
Your husband certainly
knows what he's doing.

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,180
Which color do you prefer?

55
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,950
Red or green?

56
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,250
What?

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,860
Red or green?

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,090
Green.

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
No, wait, wait, wait.

60
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,330
Red.

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,470
Too late it's green.

62
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,970
Oh god...

63
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
Gimme your gum quick.

64
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,180
Your gum!

65
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,860
I got an idea.

66
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,820
You're cheating on your husband.

67
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,630
Put on some underwear.

69
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,440
Nice job, Eddie.

70
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,280
Way to do Dan.

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,820
What you thought my becoming
a Fed would change anything?

72
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,720
I was hoping..

73
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,060
What's that?

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,760
You ever seen this?

75
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,460
What's this your lucky charm?

76
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,860
No...

77
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,500
I just like taping pictures to my chest.

78
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,930
Are you Danny O'Neil?

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,470
That's right, why?

80
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,170
Does this have something to
do with the edwards mcmahon

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,140
Sweepstakes or something?

82
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,780
It's a restraining order to
keep you away from your wife.

83
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,880
Have a nice day.

84
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,290
This is a secured area.

85
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,350
No one!

86
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,720
No one is allowed in here.

87
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,030
Sorry about this Dan.

88
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
There was a detonation at
a restaurant on Delaware.

89
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,470
They sent in a copter for you.

90
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,640
Oh man, love mondays.

91
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,610
Mobile captain 61 this is chopper 14.

92
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,110
We're bringing your man in.

93
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,280
You gut a place for us
to land over there, over?

94
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,480
Roger, this is 61.
We're at 5th and Delaware.

95
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,290
Land in front of the tracks, over.

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,690
I copy that over.

97
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,130
You got about 5 people with...

98
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,430
What's this wrapping ceraming.

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,960
Bone.

100
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,600
Have fun in there, Danny.

101
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,940
Fidelity Insurance strikes again.

102
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,210
Well, Danny O'Neill.

103
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,880
You guys are going to be
paying out big time on this one.

104
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,880
Tell me about it.

105
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,790
4 deaths and 15 injuries.

106
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,620
Maybe is was a gas leak?

107
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,190
Well if it was a gas leak,
somebody has serious gas

108
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,660
Problems.

109
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,460
Did you really try and throw
Traveres off the balcony at your house.

111
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,370
I couldn't get his fat ass over the rail.

112
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,010
I just want you to know how
sorry I am about you and your wife.

114
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,010
How come everybody knows about this?

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,110
I mean was this on CNN or something?

116
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,350
I know everything that goes on
in this town danny, you know that.

118
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,380
Really?

119
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,780
What about senator Wilkins?

120
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,550
The pink panties in the desk.

121
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,650
See ya.

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,490
You're bad.

123
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,330
Shane!

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,170
Will you get this horny
can of tuna away from me?

125
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,200
What can I say, Dan?

126
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,040
Madonna wants you.

127
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,940
Go!

128
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm not doing it dan, I swear.

129
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,140
I don't know why she
reacts to you that way?

130
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,110
Well you must not be
treating her right.

131
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,020
Pick yourself up a can of
Wd40 and go to town with it.

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,490
James is looking for you.

133
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,450
Where is he?

134
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,250
Right behind you.

135
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,550
James, James.

136
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,060
Terrorist attack it looks like, huh?

137
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,330
Where's the device?

138
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,330
Can't find it.

139
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,860
Excuse me?

140
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,200
They say that senator Victor
had a seizure and then boom.

141
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,770
Boom?

142
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,530
You mean he spontaneously combusted?

143
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,470
You tell me.

144
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,040
Okay what do you know guys?

145
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,640
Nothing.

146
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,240
No metal, plastic or chemical residue.

147
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,250
C'mon what is this guys your
first day on the job, keep digging.

149
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,750
People don't just explode.

150
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,980
I mean if they did, I would have
heard about it a long time ago.

151
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,950
What do we got here?

152
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,090
Jesus.

153
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,230
Shane, look at this.

154
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,200
Looks like the fingers
have been blown right off.

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,500
Either that or he should fire is manicurist.

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,180
Terry, what I'm saying is that I support you.

157
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,420
I just want you to be happy.

158
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,520
And with dan, until recently
you were so unhappy.

159
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,620
This isn't about me.

160
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,460
I know.

161
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,630
I think senator Traveres is good for you.

162
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,400
You just seem happier with him.

163
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,830
Mom...

164
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,570
Frank and I are friends.

165
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,370
Hi honey, I'm home.

166
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,210
- Terry, I'll call the police if you want.
- No, mom

167
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,650
Hi mom.

168
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,920
Good to see you.

169
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,450
Listen, you're still my wife
and this is still my house.

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,260
Court orders, hmm?

171
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,090
And this is still my garbage pail.

172
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,100
Danny, I've been though this too
many times before and I'm sick--

173
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,600
-- of getting hurt.

174
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,470
I'm always the one who gets hurt.

175
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,870
Listen, how about the one
that is seeing other people?

176
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,610
Frank Traveres is not the problem with us.

177
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:13:03,980
I think most people in
Washington DC would disagree with that.

179
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,050
Mom, could you do something?

180
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,320
Thanks mom.

181
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,590
Frank and I work together.

182
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,290
We got to be friends.

183
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,990
I can't live with you anymore.

184
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Not since...

185
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,200
C'mon say it for god's sake.

186
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,540
It was an accident.

187
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh god..

188
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,210
Mandy?

189
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,850
Daddy, when are you going to be up?

190
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,010
In a minute, sweet pea.

191
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,350
Please, okay.

192
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,020
C'mon daddy, can we play?

193
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,290
Amanda, please just go to
your room, okay darling.

194
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,490
- Go to your room and I'll be there.
- Okay

195
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,530
Oh jesus christ no!

196
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Don't' please breathe, please breathe.

197
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,750
How's the temperature?

198
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,120
76 degrees, perfect.

199
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,620
Dr. Bernard?

200
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,790
Oh Mikail.

201
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,400
How do you like your new job?

202
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,440
It's fine.

203
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,570
Good.

204
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,240
Mikail just heard it on the news.

205
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,410
Now you have the proof you
wanted so when do I get paid?

206
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,810
I've given you the formula
now I what about my money?

207
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,910
What money?

208
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,780
What do you mean?

209
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,150
Just kidding.

210
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,420
Patience Dr. Bernard, patience.

211
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,130
Yes, but you are not patient
when you wanted the formula.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You know you're absolutely right.

213
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,570
I'll tell you what, 
I'll give you a check right now.

214
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Do you have a pen?

215
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,280
Yes, of course, thank you.

216
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,410
I'll be out of your way soon.

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,250
Yes!

218
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,390
That fool was right, it is
completely undetectable.

219
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,790
With the power this formula can
give us, nothing will stand in--

220
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,860
-- our way, nothing.

221
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,170
Sometimes I wonder.

222
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,840
What is it all for?

223
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,940
Really?

224
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,790
No...

226
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,530
And we'll set the press conference 
for first thing tomorrow morning.

228
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,760
Yeah, I want something prepared.

229
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,570
Something um, something emotional.

230
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,100
Senator victor was a friend.

231
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,800
I can't believe this happened.

232
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,740
Remember emotion, feeling.

233
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,580
Yeah.

234
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,950
I think we both know
just how serious I am now.

235
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,590
Uh, senator Victor's wife, 
just let me take this in private.

236
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,460
You got balls calling me here.

237
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,100
And you displayed yours when
you cut me out of $10 million.

239
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,700
Well let me refresh your memory.

241
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,740
The arms sale.

242
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,580
I don't have your money.

243
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,810
Do you know that's what Victor said.

244
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,820
And look what happened to him.

245
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,650
Victor was responsible for
cutting you out of the deal.

246
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,190
You got you're retribution.

247
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,960
Yes, but you can't buy
italian villas with retribution.

248
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,030
I don't have your money.

249
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,360
Do you know what is
stopping me going public?

250
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,830
Manners.

251
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,340
I can make sure that
you never get to me.

252
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,440
Nobody will believe
anything that you say anyway.

253
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,840
I can see that you hang for killing Victor.

254
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,310
No damn it, I'm warning you.

255
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,450
No matter who you put around you, 
or how many precautions--

256
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,790
-- you take, you're a dead man.

257
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,770
I could get to you
wherever and whenever I want.

258
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,570
And I shall enjoy doing it.

259
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,020
Okay, now.

260
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,720
What does R2D2 think?

261
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
Stone rat.

262
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,800
Dishes.

263
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,440
Great, okay so how did they do it?

264
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
I been doing this for 10 years Dan.

265
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,840
I've always found something but
we cannot find anything man,

266
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,480
I don't know, what the hell.

267
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,910
Victor was here,  
had a seizure fell this way.

268
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,720
Then whatever it was exploded
under him or around him.

269
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,650
It doesn't make any sense.

270
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,990
It does if he had a
pacemaker made of plastique.

271
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,560
Gentleman, what you got?

272
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,790
Well uh, madonna and I have
analyzed three quarters of this

273
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,160
Material and there is absolutely
no trace of any kind of--

274
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,900
-- explosive or fragments from a
detonating device, nothing.

275
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,770
We're making a lot of headway.

276
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,570
Danny, I want to talk with you
outside just for a minute please.

278
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,040
You're not supposed to be
diffusing explosives for--

279
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,640
-- Metro anymore, 
you know that, don't you?

280
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,210
Keeps me in practice.

281
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,350
Some people play golf,
some people play tennis.

282
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,950
I diffuse high explosives.

283
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
You're working for me now Danny
and we don't do the dirty work

284
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,550
We leave that for Metro.

285
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,260
I'm not an after the fact kind of guy.

286
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,790
C'mon, you've paid your dues.

287
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,930
FBI is a promotion.

288
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,560
It may not feel like it but it is one.

289
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:21:16,700
So I don't think you ought to 
take anymore unnecessary chances.

291
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,200
I can handle myself.

292
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,770
I know that.

293
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,410
But I'm a bit worried about
you Dan with Mandy and now with Terry.

295
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
Jesus...

296
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,580
You know it's really too bad
more people don't know about my--

297
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,820
-- marital problems.

298
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,620
This is me talking to you.

299
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,220
It's coming from me.

300
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,990
I'm fine.

301
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,560
In every way I'm fine.

302
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,230
I'm not losing it.

303
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,470
Just let metro do their work.

305
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,500
Hold it right here sir, please.

306
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,470
Okay.

307
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,540
Sign in, sir.

308
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,880
Double on security today?

309
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,680
We've been on blue alert
since senator Victor's death.

310
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,920
Speaking of which I have an
appointment in his office.

311
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,450
4th floor to your right, 407.

312
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,360
Thank you.

313
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,560
Wife.

314
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Excuse me, ma'am.

315
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,010
So next time you go
spreading rumors about my wife.

316
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,210
Check the facts with me first.

317
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes sir.

318
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,680
Mira, thank you.

319
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,150
Way to go Stu.

320
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,400
Man's not dead a day and they're
already moving someone else into his office.

322
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,200
That's not true.

323
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,370
He was dead a day.

324
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,640
They should use the vulture.

325
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,840
Hi James.

326
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,580
Terry.

327
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,880
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,750
I uh, we have business.

329
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,490
Listen...

330
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,900
I'm sorry about the other day, 
I didn't think.

332
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,270
I'm sorry.

333
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,840
You look great.

334
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,340
You want to go and have some lunch, 
maybe something like that?

336
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,980
Uh, i can't i've got meetings.

337
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,820
I got a meeting too.

338
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,090
I gotta go.

339
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,590
Okay.

340
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,380
Sorry I'm late, sorry.

341
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,620
I hope it is because Madonna has
come up with something new.

342
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,990
No, no, she's recharging.

343
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,390
We're still picking up 
pieces of the senator.

344
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,690
The guys have never
seen anything like this.

345
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,530
We're talking pieces, pieces this small.

346
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,500
I mean we're talking
about his you know what.

347
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,000
Gentleman, we're ready for you.

348
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,480
 He had not had time to file that...

349
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,380
Fine, why don't you just
read just his schedule.

350
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,250
Traveres...

351
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,810
Mr. O'neill.

352
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,680
Did you know about this?

353
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,050
I found out this morning but
I didn't think you would come.

354
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,620
I would have come with a blowtorch.

355
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,500
Senator Traveres is
heading up this investigation.

356
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,460
That's right.

357
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,170
Now i don't have to tell you
there is a lot of concern up on

358
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,170
The hill about this.

359
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,100
A lot of people are scared.

360
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,400
There are lots of rumors.

361
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,140
Yeah, there are a lot of rumors.

362
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,810
Have you read the report, senator?

363
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,210
Yes, I have read the report except 
I don't know what the hell it means.

365
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,010
I mean what does it mean
that there is no trace of a--

366
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,480
-- detonating device.

367
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,420
Well...

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,690
No, no, let me field this one.

369
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,000
Look Mr. O'neill, I know you
have a personal problem with me.

370
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,430
You and my wife?

371
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,330
That's not a personal problem.

372
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
Everybody in the 
goddamn city knows about it.

373
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,400
It's a very public problem.

374
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,670
Look, I'm responsible for
delivering answers to congress.

375
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,870
Until I have them, I am going to
be watching every step of this--

376
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,010
-- investigation very carefully.

377
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,150
Well then watch very carefully
as I step out the door.

378
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,550
O'Neill, this is business.

379
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,460
Now you better learn to separate
it from the other problems in your life.

381
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,700
You touch my wife again, I'll separate 
you from the rest of your life.

383
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,570
You understand?

384
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,180
If Mr. O'Neill is the best
explosive expert we have,

385
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,140
The FBI is in pretty sad shape.

386
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,480
Dan is the best.

387
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,710
And Shane is a top material analyst.

388
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,590
And I'm not married so I've
got nothing to worry about, sir.

389
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,650
We're going to go over that site
again and we'll keep on going

390
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,090
Over it until we figure this out.

391
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,060
I'll have something for you very soon.

392
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Is everything all right?

393
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,920
I think taking vacation
is exactly what you need.

394
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,350
You're right.

395
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,920
Getting away would be good.

396
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,560
Who's driving?

397
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,690
Salvatore, sir.

398
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,990
Salvatore?

399
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,530
Who the hell is Salvatore?

400
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,900
He has been driving for us for 
the last 3 weeks sir, it's okay really.

402
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,500
He's losing it.

403
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,080
Good afternoon, sir.

404
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,930
I want these filed by the time 
I leave for vacation this afternoon.

406
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,840
Yes, I'm calling to confirm senator 
Thyme's reservation this afternoon.

408
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,070
Great, thank you.

409
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,170
You're all set, sir.

410
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,180
Oh Eddie.

411
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,280
Once the funeral is over, I want you 
to arrange a quick meeting with Traveres.

413
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,520
But your plane boards at 4,
I'm afraid there is no time.

414
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,290
Just make the time.

415
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,520
Yes, sir.

416
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,000
Why the hell is it so damn hot in here!

417
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,800
The air conditioner seems to be broken.

418
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,770
I will take care of it tomorrow.

419
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,040
Damn thing.

420
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,010
Salvatore, what the hell is
wrong with the refrigerator.

421
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,480
I don't know sir, the limo is
scheduled for maintenance,

422
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,380
But they're backed up.

423
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,410
Are you telling me that
nothing is working in here?

424
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,490
Water, sir?

425
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,090
No, I don't want any water.

426
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Gimme some power on these windows.

427
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,700
Yes, sir.

428
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,480
Oh and don't mention my trip to Traveres.

429
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,250
Oh!

430
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,550
God!

431
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,990
My eyes.

432
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,920
Oh my god!?

433
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,730
Eddie?

434
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,730
Salvatore, call the paramedics.

435
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,730
Call an ambulance.

436
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,900
Eddie!

437
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,200
Hey!

438
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,130
Get me out of here.

439
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,070
Hey what are you doing?

440
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,940
Oh my god!

441
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,640
The senator is having a seizure.

442
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,780
Quick!

443
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,150
Please!

444
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,450
Eddie!

445
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,390
Eddie!

446
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,370
Mobile 6, mobile 6 this is dispatch.
Do you read, do you read?

448
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,140
Mobile 6, come in.

449
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
What's going on there?

450
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,710
Mobile 6.

451
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,440
He works for you and he was caught.

452
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,140
You don't know my men.

453
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,410
They have a code of silence.

454
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
They're absolutely loyal.

455
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,280
Oh that's touching.

456
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,320
Really!

457
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,320
I know savio, I can assure...

458
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,590
Enough.

459
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,760
Kill him.

460
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,150
Let me guess, 
you couldn't find a device.

461
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,960
This is getting pretty hairy.

462
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,000
You are here for the arraignment
the alleged bomber who killed--

463
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,360
-- one of your closest friends, 
what are you feeling?

464
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,530
What am I feeling?

465
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,870
I feel relief that justice will be served.

466
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,340
Are you still planning on opening the--

467
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,840
-- DC Kids center on saturday?

468
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,010
Absolutely, that is very important to me.

469
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,140
There are there are hundreds of
kids from all over the country,

470
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,580
We've raised thousands of dollars.

471
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,980
I wouldn't disappoint them.

472
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,710
Aren't you scared?

473
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,710
No, I don't have time to be scared.

474
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,330
O'Neill.

475
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,460
What do you have for me?

476
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,260
You?

477
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,800
Now get away from me, I don't want 
any terrorists mistaking us for friends.

479
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,800
The driver is still not talking.

480
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,300
I know all about it frank.

481
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,440
That still doesn't tell us what
he used or who is behind it.

482
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,710
Look, I know you guys like
conspiracy theories but it is--

483
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,480
-- possible he acted Alone isn't it?

484
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,850
Unlikely.

485
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,010
Especially if he's not talking.

486
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,780
That means he's scared.

487
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,320
So what are you thinking?

488
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,990
I'm thinking I Gotta take a piss.

489
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,650
You want to help me out?

490
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,890
No.

491
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,820
That's good.

492
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,900
Okay, thank you very much.

493
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,700
Morning.

494
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm with senator Traveres with two FBI agents.

495
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,810
Morning, senator.

496
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,840
How are you doing?

497
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,340
Morning senator.

498
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,250
Morning senator.

499
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,230
All rise.

500
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,440
Superior coirt district of
Columbia is now in session.

501
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,110
The honorable Vera Blair presiding.

502
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,680
Please be seated, come to order.

503
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,820
Good morning.

504
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,160
Any outburst or talking in the
court room and I will stop the proceedings.

506
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,830
Having said that, this is case 7487-4.

507
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:38,800
The people of the district of
Columbia against Salvio Capelli.

508
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Since the defendant does not
Have a lawyer, the court has--

509
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,980
-- appointed Mr. Lewis.

510
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,380
Mr. Lewis, are you ready to
enter a plea on the charges of...

511
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,520
Mr. Lewis.

512
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,990
Are you ready to enter a
plea on the charges of...

513
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,760
No!

514
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,030
A plea on the...

515
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,900
No!

516
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,600
Get the senator out of here right now.

517
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,170
Right now, move.

518
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,700
Move out of the courtroom.

519
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,380
Gimme out, gimme out of here.

520
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,810
Move out!

521
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,050
Officer, move!

522
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,420
Don't go there.
Don't, she's gonna blow!

523
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,750
I've never seen anything like it.

524
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,950
There was nothing.

525
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,580
No device.

526
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,980
She was the device.

527
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,360
She took a drink of water, 
started to speak.

528
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,590
Stood up and then started convulsing.

529
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,060
That's it?

530
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,660
No.

531
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,260
I left out the part where
she swallowed a grenade.

532
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:21,740
She drank the water, sweat,
shook then boom, here come the

533
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,040
Judge.

534
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,310
There was nothing.

535
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,880
Nothing but...

536
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,050
What?

537
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,680
Do you think it could be the water?

538
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,620
Whoa!

539
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,390
Or it wasn't the water at all.

540
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,860
You okay?

541
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,260
Mike, get your guys out of here,
this is the explosive.

542
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,370
Best back off Dan, 
whatever this is, it isn't water.

543
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,700
Aren't you scared?

544
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,470
No, I don't have time to be scared, Suzy.

545
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,170
Will you excuse me.

546
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,340
Well after the bombing this afternoon 
senator traveres may be scared.

548
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,710
These terrorist attacks against
the members of the senate come--

549
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,480
-- just a week before the
revote on the Anti-Arms bill.

550
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,650
The secret service will
keep extra security around the--

551
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,660
President until they find out
who is actually behind these bombings.

553
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,130
Suzy Bryant, Channel 7 News.

554
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,260
And it's a beauty.

555
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,960
And I put the wings and go whong.

556
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,770
We're here at the Federal Court 
house where a mysterious--

557
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,970
-- explosion has left 3 people 
dead and 10 wounded.

558
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,070
Who is it?

559
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,280
It's me.

560
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,220
You realize of course you're
defying your own court order.

561
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,990
I heard what happened, are you okay?

562
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,630
I just wanted to make sure.

563
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,240
You want to come in?

564
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,170
I promise I won't turn you in.

565
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,650
Some of the senators have
hired their own body guards.

566
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
The national guard is on alert.

567
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,890
Opinion polls are running 3:1
in favor of the terrorists.

568
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
It's true, it's true.

569
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,000
There is a chart in USA today.

570
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,500
You want a drink?

571
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,270
No, thanks.

572
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,480
Nice place, huh?

573
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,990
There is a chair somewhere over here.

574
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,020
I'm sorry it's a mess.

575
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,460
It's the maid's year off.

576
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,100
I should have called first.

577
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh god, she looked like you.

578
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,550
Tess, it's good to see you.

579
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,820
It's really good to see you.

580
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,560
Tess, you're my wife.

581
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,100
I need you--

582
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,500
I need to hold you.

583
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,570
I ache for you.

584
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,940
Why did you come?

585
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,910
What is it?

586
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,470
I know what you are feeling?

587
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,370
We both have to deal with the same pain.

588
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,640
Look at yourself.

589
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,280
Terry...

590
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm not as good at this as you are.

591
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,760
Well you can sit here, 
get drunk and feel sorry for yourself,

592
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,660
That's fine.

593
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,300
No one but you is blaming you.

594
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,180
Game!

595
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,650
Rematch next week?

596
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,000
Good game frank.

598
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,300
How the hell did you get in here?

599
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,570
I walked.

600
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,570
Now there is a matter of my $10 million.

601
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,480
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

602
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,380
What money?

603
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,150
Must this boring game go on?

604
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,250
First, Victor, then Thyme, and now you.

605
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,690
They say death always comes in threes.

606
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,830
Are you familiar, Frank,
with the road to hell.

607
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,870
And please don't think about
going public because you'll have--

608
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,500
-- a slight difficulty explaining
A $50 million profit--

609
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,370
-- stemming from and Anti-arms deal that 
you and the others pushed through Congress.

611
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,010
I don't think you'd give up your seat 
in the senate for 40 years in prison.

613
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

614
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,380
I signed on because it
was a high profile bill.

615
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,590
I didn't intend to get
involved with any of this stuff.

616
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,430
Someone has got my money, Frank, 
and you'd better find it.

617
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,730
Otherwise, I'm going to blow you wide open.

618
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,870
Quite literally.

619
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,820
Thanks.

620
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,850
Excuse me.

621
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,130
Good afternoon, gentleman.

622
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,160
What's the good word?

623
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,000
Well, I should have test
results by the end of the day.

624
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,540
You know if it is some kind of
facsimile of water then they-- 

625
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,910
-- can put it anywhere.

626
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,940
What did you get from your...

627
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,980
Shane please, 
will you turn off your robot.

628
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,420
I feel like I'm In lost in space.

629
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,190
What did you get from your briefing.

630
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,160
Well it's really very
interesting both senator Thyme--

631
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,690
-- and senator Victor sponsored the
Mideast antiarms bill which is--

632
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,130
-- coming up for a revote.

633
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,030
What?

634
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,400
Trying to scare the senate into a veto?

635
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,630
Maybe.

636
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,440
But here I think is the interesting part.

637
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,740
There is one senator left who
sponsored that bill with them.

638
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,610
Who's that?

639
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,860
Goddammit!

640
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,190
Dan...

641
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,490
Dan...

642
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,090
Don't do anything stupid.

643
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,030
Look it they're pissed because
we haven't come up with any

644
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,000
Answers.

645
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,460
He is your answer.

646
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,130
Tell Traveres to stay away from my wife.

647
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,460
So what about saturday?

648
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,500
You going to come?

649
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,600
You said you would.

650
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,400
I'd like you to.

651
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,240
I don't know if I should.

652
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,340
Why, what are you thinking?

653
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,980
I don't know what I'm feeling here.

654
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,510
Nice security pal.

655
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,020
It's all right, it's okay.

656
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,420
No, no, no it's not okay.

657
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,020
You're a target.

658
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,430
Listen you prick.

659
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,330
Listen to me, anyone with half a
brain and a gun could walk right

660
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,130
Stop it.

661
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,430
Come home with me.

662
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,140
I don't need you telling
me who i am safe with.

663
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,110
Terry, please, come home with me.

664
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,980
Terry!

665
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,710
O'Neill you are already in
This deep enough, c'mon.

666
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,050
Gentleman, 
why don't you escort Mr. O'Neill out.

667
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,620
I dug as much as I could, if I
Hadn't been so busy, I would--

668
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,590
-- have gotten this to you sooner.

669
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,290
Frank Traveres is a regular boy scout.

670
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,490
His tax returns are in order.

671
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,730
He owes favors to a few
people, but that is not unusual.

672
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,830
You sure there is nothing in here.

673
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,170
Nothing that I could find.

674
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,640
Where is a corrupt politician
when you need one, huh?

675
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,980
Feel free to peruse the goods.

676
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,320
It says he is only claiming 122,000 a year.

677
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,190
Well that's all he makes on
salary plus a few speaking fees.

678
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,690
The man has a campaign
he is still paying off.

679
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,860
How's he paying for that house.

680
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,130
He didn't pay that much for it, 
it was in bad shape.

681
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,660
He got a good deal.

682
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,900
What about the inside.

683
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,230
I mean there is a lot
of froo-froo there.

684
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,670
Well there were some repair work.

685
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,070
No, no i'm talking about
marble columns, hardwood floors.

686
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,940
He's still paying a few things off.

687
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,810
Marion.

688
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,580
Any guy who makes $130,000 
a year doesn't live like this.

689
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,610
What you think this guy is
stupid enough to flaunt his

690
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,720
Money?

691
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,720
He is from Miami.

692
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,290
You're right, look, I gotta go.

693
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,520
Big date?

694
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,060
Big I don't know yet, I just
Figured I couldn't wait around--

695
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,960
-- for your forever.

696
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,500
You're crushing me,
You're crushing me.

697
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,870
You're the best.

698
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,540
I know.

699
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,840
All right, thank you.

700
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,010
Good luck, Sherlock.

702
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,630
Hi...

703
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,230
Wha...

704
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,710
Shane, where are you?

705
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,070
At the lab?

706
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,510
All right, all right,
I'll come down, okay.

707
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,220
Just clear me with um, with
security okay so i don't get

708
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,350
Hassled.

709
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,780
Thanks, bye.

710
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,670
Watch this.

711
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,680
All right.

712
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,790
C'mon, c'mon it only takes 30 seconds.

713
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,020
So what the hell is it?

714
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,550
It's uh, a weird hybrid combo of
liquid explosives that have been--

715
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,790
-- put through a process 
I have never seen before.

716
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:29,230
Activated, it's like a
combination of nitro, napalm, hydrogen.

718
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,430
It's complicated.

719
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,330
It is...

720
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

721
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,440
What do you mean activated, how?

722
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,510
When you drink it, 
it's live right what the hell.

723
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,950
But in the stomach it becomes a device.

724
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,350
Then it hit me.

725
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,480
It's acid.

726
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,050
Stomach acid.

727
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,250
Yeah, I thought maybe it was
stomach acid but I didn't have

728
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,850
Any.

729
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,460
So what you got in there?

730
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,130
Orange juice.

731
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,630
Can you believe that.

732
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,730
And it works with boric acid as well.

733
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,930
Well how do we diffuse this?

734
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,800
Rolaids?

735
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,770
That's not that far from right.

736
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:09,000
A crater of antacids,
alka-seltzer, anything alkaline

737
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,370
Will neutralize the acid.

738
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,080
No one is safe.

739
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,350
Traveres, 
he is opening the kids center today.

740
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,450
I saw terry get in his limo.

741
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,250
 Hi, welcome to the
opening of the dc kid's center.

742
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,480
The DC kid's center is a
Nonprofit Organization.

743
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,150
It was founded to assist in
the health and well being...

744
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,920
Hi.

745
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,920
Hello.

746
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,560
 We are very proud of our
center and we're very glad to

747
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,000
Welcome you here today...

748
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,000
 We were established in
1983 to help ease the plight of--

749
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,170
-- underprivileged children
throughout the country.

750
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,910
We are funded solely through the
generous support of individuals

751
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,110
Are you enjoying yourself?

752
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,580
Such as senator traveres.

753
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:24,380
Yes, but you shouldn't be
introducing me to people like

754
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,950
We're a couple.

755
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,950
Wishful thinking.

756
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,520
Look frank, I..

757
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,350
What?

758
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,990
What's the matter?

759
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,620
We just need to talk.

760
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,830
Okay let's talk, I love to talk.

761
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,360
That's why I got into politics.

762
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,030
Excuse me senator, we're ready for you.

763
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,060
Oh, okay, back in a moment.

764
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
And now I'd like to introduce
You to the man who made this all

765
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,800
Possible, senator Frank Traveres.

766
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,340
I thank you, thank you
all for being here today.

767
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,010
Get on your radio fficer, 
we have a bomb threat.

768
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,280
We're going to have to clear the area.

769
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,280
It's dangerous, gimme your ID.

770
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,190
Step away from the cooler, it's okay.

771
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,430
Do not let anybody
drink from these coolers.

772
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,230
He says there is a bomb.

773
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,130
A bomb?

774
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,600
Oh my god!

775
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,770
We have a little problem Senator, 
we got to get you out--

776
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,440
-- of here.

777
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,880
Ladies and gentleman,
there is no reason to panic.

778
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,140
We are having a security problem.

779
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,310
You are in absolutely no danger.

780
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:37,120
Please remain calm and evacuate
the premises in an orderly fashion.

782
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,090
Ladies and gentleman,
there is no reason to panic.

783
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,190
I repeat there is no reason to panic.

784
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,830
There is no reason to panic.

785
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,700
Terry, terry!

786
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,430
Don't drink the water!

787
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,900
Don't drink that!

788
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,470
Did you drink that?

789
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,640
No, why.

790
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,340
The explosives were in the water.

791
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,780
We found out this morning.

792
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,480
What the hell are you doing?

793
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,920
Danny no.

794
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,580
We analyzed it.

795
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,150
It's just water.

796
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,120
You mean to tell me you caused
this whole god damn thing and

797
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,990
There is nothing wrong here.

798
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,060
Mikail!

799
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,960
It's too late.

800
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,530
No, we cannot wait any longer.

801
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,200
He'll get the message.

802
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,470
I'll kill them all..

803
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,420
You bastard. 
I will show you, you bastard.

804
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,290
- Get back!
- You will see. You are dead.

805
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,800
Shane it's in the fountain, 
this guy is going to blow!

806
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,830
I got you dan, I'm coming.

807
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
We've got 10 seconds.

808
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,310
What!

809
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,010
We've got to get him out of here!

810
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:58,320
Let me ask you this
before I cut your balls off.

811
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,560
Why did this happen?

812
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,960
Hey, it wasn't my fault.

813
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:06,460
I didn't say it was your fault.

814
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,000
It's interesting though you
should even bring that up.

815
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,170
Look, I did everything
I was supposed to do.

816
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,440
I got you the VIP pass.

817
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,810
I got Alred that job.

818
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:22,210
I can't help it that O'Neill showed up.

819
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,550
You should have been less
worried about your own life.

820
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,890
I know I'm less worried about your life.

821
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,700
Look...

822
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,270
I'm only here because
of what you offered me.

823
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,270
I am not here to die.

824
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,860
This is not a good day.

825
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,860
Oh jesus!

826
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,710
I was there to tell frank I
wouldn't see him anymore.

827
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,410
Why?

828
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,850
Because I'm you're wife, 
why do you think?

829
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,570
Terry, why don't you go wait outside.

830
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,700
I'll be down in 10 minutes.

831
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,740
Just let us know if you need anything.

832
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,080
Guess who.

833
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,590
Look, I've alerted my security.

834
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,450
I also have a man in the house.

835
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,460
Your sexual preferences don't interest me.

836
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,230
You know you could have killed
hundreds of innocent people today.

837
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,560
Well only because they matter to you.

838
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,630
Now, I'm not in the mood to wait any longer.

839
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,800
I have a life you know.

840
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,570
You know if you kill me,
You won't get anything.

841
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,670
Not true.

842
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,970
I get to kill you.

843
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,310
You won't get your 10 million.

844
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:59,590
I'm sorry the senator can't talk
right now, he's got a gun to his head

846
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,230
Well you should know whoever you are 
that the senator means nothing to me.

848
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,300
Hmm, I'm not surprised.

849
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,900
I saw what happened at the children's center.

850
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,210
Danny O'Neill.

851
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:20,580
And speaking of your wife, 
she should be there any minute now.

852
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,520
She wouldn't take any of Frank's
calls, so I did him a favor.

853
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,820
Isn't it ironic?

854
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,220
I only did it because I like him.

855
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,830
I'm that kind of guy.

856
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:45,940
Now.

857
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,170
Anymore guns in the house?

858
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,810
Do you have another gun?

859
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,950
Hello Terry, Gwen. 
Gwen put terry on.

860
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,190
Go on captain, go play.

861
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,290
Gwen put Terry on god damn it.

862
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,100
Who was that?

863
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:15,130
Just someone taking a poll.

864
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:23,240
They work fast, their line is dead.

865
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,350
Do you know anything about terry?

866
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:26,510
You've got security outside right?

867
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,250
Yes, i do.

868
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,180
Okay.

869
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,180
I was just getting...

870
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,020
So what makes you think
things will be any different?

871
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,860
Mom, it wasn't just him.

872
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,130
Now you blame yourself.

873
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,570
Don't let him do that to you.

874
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,340
You never give up do you?

875
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,780
Good evening.

876
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,410
Ben, what are you doing here?

877
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,510
Mr. Traveres asked me
to come and get you.

878
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,120
He really needs to see you.

879
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,680
I don't think so, tell..

880
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,450
If he wants to see you, 
you should go.

881
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,720
Lights.

882
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:55,230
Jesus christ, they've had you staked.

883
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,470
You'll never live through this.

884
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,800
Your such a pessimist.

885
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,510
It's my upbringing.

886
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,640
Look, I'm sorry you had to drive
All the way up here but just

887
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:02,780
Tell him...

888
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,910
I'm not asking Terry.

889
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,850
Let go of my daughter!

890
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,620
Don't scream or I use it.

891
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,170
What the hell are you doing?

892
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,270
Just looking through your stuff.

893
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:07,770
Who paid you to push
the arms deal through?

894
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,310
The money came from an arms
sales to the countries we cut--

895
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,680
-- off with the bill.

896
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,710
It's not uncommon you know.

897
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,650
It's an american tradition.

898
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,380
Victor and Thymes set it up.

899
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,690
I just signed on as a co-sponsor
Because I thought it would raise

900
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,360
My visibility in the senate that's all.

901
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,630
Yeah, sure and you paid for
this entire house with cash.

902
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,200
No receipts.

903
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,570
I suppose that is an american
tradition too, huh Frank?

904
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,070
You're not doing what i
Think you're doing are you?

905
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,210
You're insured, right?

906
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,480
No, I'm not.

907
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,010
C'mon.

908
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,690
 The capital city's only all night talk show.

909
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,160
It's 4:45 am people.

910
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,870
The sun will be up in about 20
minutes so if you're not asleep

911
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,300
Yet, you might as well just stay awake.

912
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,200
Let's go back to the phones.

913
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,440
Go ahead caller, you're on the air.

914
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,540
Hello David.

915
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,940
Go ahead caller.

916
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,840
Yeah, this is Jim from Arley, 
I just wanted to...

917
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,310
After you lover boy.

918
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,050
You sure it is safe out there?

919
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,950
Damn safer than here.

920
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,520
Oh hi, uh, this is Yvette...

921
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,700
You're dead!

922
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,380
So this is where it all happens, huh Frank?

923
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,390
Any congressional page boys under the bed?

924
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,760
Vaseline.

925
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,830
Okay, move.

926
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,400
Move, move c'mon.

927
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:21,370
Where?

928
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:21,970
Over there.

929
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,840
Down here?

930
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,440
Hey, hey, hey...

931
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,140
C'mon where you going?

932
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,680
Get back in here.

933
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,450
Go.

934
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,150
I was going to go outside and
have a cigarette, that's all.

935
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,630
You know this house, I don't.

936
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,430
I can't be too helpful being handcuffed here.

937
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,880
Planning a party?

938
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,010
What the hell is going on here?

939
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,550
Oh...

940
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,920
Look.

941
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,100
The object of everyone's affection.

942
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,960
Go upstairs and help alred's men.

943
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,670
No way.

944
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,770
You paid me to keep an eye on Traveres.

945
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,280
This is your fight.

946
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:50,020
Yes, you're right, I'm sorry.

947
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,180
Thank you.

948
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,050
I'll kill you right here!

949
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:35,290
Let's go find the two
men in your life, huh?

950
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,860
Too bad you're not insured.

951
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,830
Let's get out of here,
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

952
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,040
No!

953
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,710
Wait, wait, wait.
Where does this lead to?

954
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,280
The attic.

955
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,190
Slow down.

956
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,530
You want to jump?

957
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,100
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

958
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,680
All right.

959
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,010
C'mon.

960
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,220
You certainly did put all your
money into this house didn't you

961
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,720
Huh?

962
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,660
Looks like you've got over 
10 million in insulation right here.

964
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,730
C'mon, come over here.

965
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:51,470
What are you a boy scout or what?

966
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,210
Yeah, i'm about to earn another merit badge.

967
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,050
Calvary, c'mon.

968
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,900
Hey, hey up here.

969
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,500
All right seal off the west side.

970
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,110
Mr. O'Neill.

971
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,920
No...

972
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,250
Stay right here.

973
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,720
Just let her go, okay?

974
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:20,930
There is nothing you can do right now.

975
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,660
The police are downstairs.

976
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:24,860
There is no way out.

977
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,400
Diffuse this one Mr. O'Neill.

978
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:36,610
No!

979
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,790
Come here, go.

980
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,710
Danny!

981
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,790
Danny!

982
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,690
Easy watch yourself.

983
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,390
Get that latter over here quick.

984
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:33,170
Set it up there.

985
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,970
Danny!

986
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:42,140
Danny...

987
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:53,720
I'm here, I'm here.

988
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,470
We'll take care of everything Danny, 
you just got to get better.

990
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,830
Anything you want?

991
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,900
I want a raise.

992
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,940
Forget it.

993
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,610
Where were you when I needed you? 

994
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,150
Honestly, programming Madonna
to ask james for a raise.

995
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,920
Oh great.

996
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,350
Guys, my wife.

997
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,710
Why did you guys call me huh?

998
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:50,010
I mean you know I
don't do this anymore.

999
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,910
She asked for you personally Dan.

1000
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,430
Hi...

1001
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:14,500
I thought I told you to
go back to your husband.

1002
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,800
I did.

1003
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,140
My boyfriend did this.

1004
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,180
What are you betting on today, 
red or green?

1005
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,080
God..

1006
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,150
Not this again.

1007
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:37,790
Green.

1008
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,490
No more guessing.

1009
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,930
I only bet on sure things.

1010
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:45,260
Fred, I'm cutting the wire.

1011
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,530
Have your guys ready with the barrel.

1012
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,670
Cut quick Dan, we just had a call.

1013
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,940
Your wife's water broke.

1014
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,570
Hey, pal, you're going to have a baby.

1015
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,510
Your luck has changed.

1016
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,380
I'm out of here.

1017
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:08,690
Thank you.

1018
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,220
And by the way, I like the underwear 
by the way don't ever change.

1019
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,290
Take care guys see you.
