00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,081
You looking
for something, my man?

2
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,703
I'm looking for lightning.

3
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:15,209
Got ups, got downs,
got smiles, got frowns.

4
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,834
Got smoke, got blow.

5
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,300
Take you anywhere you wanna go.

6
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,264
I only have big bills.

7
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,726
That's cool.

8
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,186
Got plenty change.

9
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,399
Could you turn off that box?

10
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,528
I really hate rap music.

11
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,449
Sure, my man.

12
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,577
Thank you, man.

13
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,669
Call 54.

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,014
1091 Central Park West, 53rd K.

15
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,881
Car 54 K.

16
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,244
Cuff him, cuff him!

17
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,001
Where the fuck are you going?

18
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,293
I'm gonna help that young man over there!

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,541
Fuck him, take care of this one first!

20
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,009
This one's dead!

21
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,380
Would you get the fucking
handcuffs off him?

22
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,973
Hey fuck your goddamn!

23
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,592
Take it easy, man.

24
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,429
Get him to the hospital!

25
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,476
Police
officer Patrick O'Leary

26
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,728
was shot late last night in Central Park.

27
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,527
The Mayor and the Police
Commissioner express their outrage

28
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,446
at a press conference at
the Widow's house in Queens.

29
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,820
O'Leary was the fourth
police officer slain

30
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,116
in the line of...

31
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,959
Hi.

32
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,087
Baby, baby, baby.

33
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,087
Congratulations.

34
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,088
Girl, you're beamed me up.

35
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,216
You beamed me up in the
middle of my ecstasy.

36
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,684
Don't you think it's a
little early in the morning

37
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,722
for heavy metal?

38
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,221
Gail, Gail, honey, sweety.

39
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,519
I love you, I wanna marry you

40
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,269
but you're making me feel very old.

41
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,769
This is not heavy metal.

42
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,487
This is Hendrix.

43
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,609
Genius, maybe, but this is
definitely not heavy metal.

44
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,823
Okay.

45
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,196
Why don't you open your present?

46
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,572
Present, right.

47
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,324
What's the occasion?

48
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,121
Huh, congratulations, for what?

49
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,292
On your last week with legal aid.

50
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,336
Hey, groovy, beautiful.

51
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,794
Why don't you wear one of the new suits

52
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,466
daddy's guy made for you?

53
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,931
Just try it.

54
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,924
I don't know Gail.

55
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,676
I don't think the Wall
Street garb will swing

56
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,350
with the Riker's Island crowd, you know?

57
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,938
They'll take me for a pimp.

58
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,557
What does that make me?

59
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,230
The best.

60
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,568
What are you drinking?

61
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,982
Orange Julius, homemade.

62
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,979
Want some?

63
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,231
No, no thanks.

64
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,615
Oh, I've got to run.

65
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,076
I've got to be at Bumble
and Bumble in 45 minutes.

66
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,162
So try your new suit.

67
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,451
Remember to call about the apartment.

68
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,244
You bet.

69
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,544
And Roland, about that tie.

70
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,001
Yeah, what about it?

71
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,794
Egh.

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,177
I like this tie.

73
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,967
Well Don, you're
finally gonna bag it

74
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,058
at Legal Aid, huh pal?

75
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,892
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

76
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,057
What about the fight
for the underprivileged,

77
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,725
the homeless and the destitute?

78
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,473
You know what I'm talking
about, the good fight, pal.

79
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,815
Pap and drivel, blood.

80
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,607
Just liberal pap for the multitudes.

81
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,650
Okay, let's do it.

82
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,737
Okay.

83
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,152
These I got to prosecute.

84
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,775
These I'm willing to let cop a plea.

85
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,902
You take the whole package, I let these go

86
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,994
for time served.

87
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,113
It's beautiful.

88
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,239
Yeah man.

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,287
All right.

90
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,578
Groovy.

91
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,127
This is not a
going away party, Dalton.

92
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,169
I can't live with that.

93
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,883
Come on Home.

94
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,549
It's my last week in the
jungle then I'm finito.

95
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,842
Buy the next six lunches too?

96
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,135
No guts, no glory.

97
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,758
Oh baby.

98
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,635
Dalton I never figured
you for this upwardly

99
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,012
mobile bullshit, man.

100
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,012
It is a sellout.

101
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,013
Hey, blood.

102
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,811
The substance in a lot of America lies

103
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,024
in keeping the money in this country

104
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,268
out of the hands of the widows and orphans

105
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,270
and in the hands of the
major insurance companies

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,488
Who know best how to manage it.

107
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,732
Hey, Susan.

108
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,653
Hi, Shawn.

109
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,939
Hi.

110
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,865
From the looks of you I'd say

111
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,412
you found your insurance company.

112
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,957
Yeah, Wall Street, next week.

113
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,881
You don't exactly look like
chopped liver yourself.

114
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,673
Thanks.

115
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,059
Well once again I see that
justice is being served.

116
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,428
For lunch.

117
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,805
Here, you forgot this one.

118
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,352
Just your average crack
dealing cop killer.

119
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,190
No big deal.

120
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,024
Yeah but I have to interview the man.

121
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,858
Could be innocent.

122
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,102
Bloody likely.

123
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,400
Still I'm impressed you still
care about minor details

124
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,443
such as that.

125
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,908
I'll meet you over at the pier.

126
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,652
Yeah, you got it.

127
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,620
I'll see you in court.

128
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,369
A little history there, pal?

129
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,250
Yeah, the whole world, man.

130
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,262
What'd she mean see you in court?

131
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,301
Probably talking about that cop killer

132
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,718
you got in your hand, pal.

133
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,557
What are you saying?

134
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,471
She's a public defender in Brooklyn.

135
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,513
No she's not.

136
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,136
No?

137
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,356
She's the new Assistant D.A.

138
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,771
Come on, is that straight?

139
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,064
Tag 'em and bag 'em man.

140
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,360
You're dead.

141
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,027
I don't know, what's the habs, babe?

142
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,621
Okay, wiseguy, through the detector.

143
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,455
I don't know why are
you torturing yourself?

144
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,159
Empty your pockets.

145
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,661
It's the watch, it's the watch.

146
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,879
It's always the watch.

147
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,668
Watch.

148
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,087
See?

149
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,465
You love me, you know it.

150
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,719
Crack, crack, crack.

151
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,438
This got it here.

152
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,648
Hey, Bowlski!

153
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,435
My name isn't Bowlski.

154
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,189
You want a condom with you lunch?

155
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,280
Condom?

156
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,114
Yeah.

157
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,404
The Mayor says we got
to offer every convict

158
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,451
a condom a day along with
counseling on safe sex.

159
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,415
I don't want a condom.

160
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,126
I want a condom.

161
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,294
Thank you very much.

162
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,762
Michael Jones, Roland Dalton.

163
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,881
I'm over here from Legal Aid.

164
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,553
I've been appointed to represent you.

165
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,972
You've been charged
with first degree murder

166
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,186
of an undercover narcotic police officer.

167
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,476
You don't look too bad
for a guy who's been shot.

168
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,475
Shit, I mean the guy used a 38, man.

169
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,351
38 couldn't kill a cockroach.

170
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,603
That's why I use a nine mil.

171
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,275
You get somebody with a
nine, he don't get up.

172
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,318
Oh yeah, you used a nine mil on this cop?

173
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,111
Yeah.

174
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,484
Well what's the pitch, Micheal?

175
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,986
You're not gonna tell me you didn't do it?

176
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,112
Of course I did it.

177
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,035
I'm on the park selling drugs.

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,078
White dude come up to me, pull out a gun,

179
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,121
say give me your money.

180
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,711
Pshh, so I shot him, self defense.

181
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,705
Micheal you want a lawyer,
or you want your mother?

182
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,126
'Cause she's the only
fool that's gonna buy

183
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,215
that bag of shit.

184
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,004
Hey man.

185
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,592
I done a lot of bad
things but I'm not stupid.

186
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,839
I don't lie to my lawyer.

187
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,840
Here we go.

188
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,218
Dude was a blue jean cop, man.

189
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,218
Blue jean cop?

190
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,221
Yeah, blue jean cop.

191
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,392
What are you saying, you shot him

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,515
'cause you didn't like his pants?

193
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,686
Dude don't even show me no badge.

194
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,901
I didn't know he was a cop
till they booked my ass.

195
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,394
I thought he was a vigilante.

196
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,692
Had to defend myself.

197
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,110
Well that little mistake may very well

198
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,449
get your ass cooked.

199
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,316
Shit man.

200
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,907
I work for somebody who pays his bills.

201
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,404
Crack, you dig?

202
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,405
I dig.

203
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,952
This cop must have been
trying to cut himself

204
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,416
a piece of my man's action.

205
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,126
Shit, all he had to do was say so.

206
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,461
I would have handed him my grade,

207
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,045
let him and my man work it out.

208
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,541
I'm still no dust between NC and Pitch.

209
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,417
Who's NC?

210
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,173
Oh man.

211
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,348
I didn't say that.

212
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,311
Morning, Richie.

213
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,684
Morning, Billy.

214
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,462
Hey babe, I'm white and I can't fight.

215
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,344
Well, coming up in the world, huh?

216
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,139
What's the mortgage on this condo?

217
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,434
What are you doing here?

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,976
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

219
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,646
I work for my apartment chief.

220
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,188
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

221
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,238
Your old lady, she told me to tell you

222
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,654
if you don't get your ass
home and do the right thing,

223
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,617
she's gonna pack up all your shit

224
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,657
and ship it back to Rope and Ride

225
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,872
or Bump and Grind or
whatever the hell it is

226
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,834
the name of that hip town
in Texas you come from.

227
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,829
What else did she say?

228
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,956
She said pick up the laundry.

229
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,752
Right.

230
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,718
See what you got to look
forward to, counselor.

231
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,383
How's your fiancee?

232
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,722
Eh, she doesn't like Jimi Hendrix.

233
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,511
Who?

234
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,640
Come on, let's get some chow, my treat.

235
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,228
Do I smell another shakedown?

236
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,018
As for that, gringo.

237
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,527
Nice tie.

238
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,495
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

239
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,749
Look at this box.

240
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,543
I don't believe all this glass, man.

241
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,006
What is this shit?

242
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,545
Empty crack containers, counselor.

243
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,668
Popcorn.

244
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,590
You wanna know what the
latest drug craze is,

245
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,886
you should go check out
Uncle Billy's trash can.

246
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,599
Junkies come and go, but Billy's trash can

247
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,218
is always there.

248
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,515
Right now it's full of that shit.

249
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,104
Speaking of that shit, tell me something.

250
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,190
What's a blue jean cop?

251
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,434
Where'd you hear that?

252
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,151
From a client.

253
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,361
Well I'm strictly bargain based.

254
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,572
Wranglers and Levis.

255
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,531
You lost me.

256
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,027
As I bust on the other
hand wear Sergio Valentes.

257
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,950
Richie, you wanna run
this by me in English?

258
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,912
All right.

259
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,333
Take some cop, some average guy

260
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,079
who never had a shot at
the big bucks all his life.

261
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,629
Just going along, grinding
out his 27 five a year.

262
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,752
All of a sudden he ends up in a mod squad.

263
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,094
One mustard.

264
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,338
One afternoon he busts some scumbag

265
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,965
carrying a bag full of chemicals.

266
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,807
The bag full of chemical's is worth more

267
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,849
than the cop's gonna make in 10 years.

268
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,845
Next day is out shopping

269
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,392
for designer jeans.

270
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,146
The lure of easy money,
very hard to refuse.

271
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,113
What about this cop that
got whacked at Central Park.

272
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,200
O'Leary, was that the deal with him?

273
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,285
I knew you were gonna have
such a sweat about this.

274
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,244
Word is you're out of
the game in another week.

275
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,956
Call me a creature of habit. O'Leary?

276
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,951
What about him?

277
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,293
Oh great, thanks.

278
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,207
Come on Dalton, even if I
knew the answer to that,

279
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,921
why am I gonna tell you?

280
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,916
Oh fuck man, I gotta find
out what's going down here.

281
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,007
So look around.

282
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,922
Oh look around, great,
what look, who what?

283
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,921
I'm gonna tell you something, Dalton.

284
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,548
Cops don't know shit about hiding money.

285
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,391
Check out his house.

286
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,555
His house?

287
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,348
Okay.

288
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,848
Killed you to tell me that, didn't it?

289
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,896
Hell, the last of the big
fucking spenders, man, great.

290
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,232
I have another, Richie, straight up.

291
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,111
How come no designer jeans for you?

292
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,996
I just figured they were meant for girls

293
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,788
with cute little asses
and guys with no balls.

294
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,328
Besides, I'm independently wealthy.

295
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,328
Oh right.

296
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,923
I love what you did with the condo.

297
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,464
This ain't high school, Dalton.

298
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,712
These guys got guns and money

299
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,714
and not a fucking thing to lose.

300
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,181
I appreciate the advice.

301
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,300
P.S, who's NC?

302
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,771
You just don't fucking get it, do you?

303
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,016
You just don't get it.

304
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,895
Don't fuck with these people.

305
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,646
Richie, I don't want to fuck with them.

306
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,192
I just wanna dance.

307
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,041
The devil gives it to you soft.

308
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:47,163
The devil will give it to
you any way you want it.

309
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,447
Uh, Mrs. O'Leary, I am
involved with the people

310
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,817
prosecuting the man who
killed your husband.

311
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,114
I know this may not be
the most appropriate time

312
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,331
but I'd like to ask you
a few questions if I may.

313
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,120
Come in.

314
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,914
I was just making some tea.

315
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,587
Would you like some?

316
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,176
Or something stronger?

317
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,343
I wanna have whatever you're having.

318
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,135
Okay.

319
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,816
Where the hell is Marks?

320
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,908
Why isn't he with us?

321
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,743
He's downtown, he's
picking up the warrants.

322
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,614
He's gonna take the
subway here and meet us.

323
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,081
It's cool, don't worry.

324
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,916
I would never take a subway
to this part of town.

325
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,330
Why, what you talking about, he's a cop.

326
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,669
He's got a gun.

327
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,585
Patrick O'Leary was a cop, he had a gun.

328
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,925
This place is worse than Beirut.

329
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,917
Hey what do you want?

330
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,918
If you guys wouldn't mind,

331
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,795
could I get out of this
car before we get there?

332
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,172
I mean you're supposed to be undercover

333
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,094
but even a blind man can tell you're cops.

334
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,639
If someone sees me with
you, I'm dead meat.

335
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,261
Hey listen, dipshit!

336
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,389
If somebody sees you with
us, you are dead meat.

337
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,890
You know, they're gonna kill you maybe,

338
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,017
cut your balls off, gouge your eyes out.

339
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,361
But it's gonna be over soon enough.

340
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,446
But if the information
you've given us turns out

341
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,816
to be bullshit, we're
gonna put you in a cell

342
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,033
with Big Leroy.

343
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,202
A 350 bull nigga faggot.

344
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,114
Now you get out in five years maybe,

345
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,868
you'll be able to look up
your asshole and see the sky.

346
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,335
Don't fuck with me.

347
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,546
It's TV, TV.

348
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,084
Let me have a cigarette, will you?

349
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,081
Buy your own.

350
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,254
What the fuck's wrong with you?

351
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,547
I really appreciate this.

352
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,638
Why, you're quite welcome.

353
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,848
Where are your cans?

354
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,931
Are they in the garage?

355
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,050
Yeah, no.

356
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,427
Well the garage is locked.

357
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,726
Just put it at the bottom of the stairs.

358
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,643
Okay?

359
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,270
Yeah, thank you.

360
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,112
Nice meeting you.

361
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,856
Nice meeting you, bye.

362
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,574
Bye.

363
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,544
Thanks.

364
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,013
Ladies.

365
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,097
Put your bags on the conveyor.

366
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,975
And gentlemen, let's see your green

367
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,435
Good.

368
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,155
Now one at a time, walk
through the detector.

369
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,070
Welcome to Wonderland.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,207
Welcome.

371
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,623
Wow, listen, you think that was real?

372
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,995
Did you hear those screams?

373
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,246
You can't fake that.

374
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,714
I think they really cut them off.

375
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,696
You gotta let me have
some more, you got to.

376
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,697
You know the rules.

377
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,415
No credit, cash only.

378
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,253
I don't have any more on me.

379
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,624
I'll pay you back, I promise.

380
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,045
Mr. Carr signs things like that.

381
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,169
But I wouldn't advise you.

382
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,300
Please?

383
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,190
Tell the man your story.

384
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:21,983
Uh.

385
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,321
I gave them all my money.

386
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,951
But I need more.

387
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,953
For most, there's no other way but pay.

388
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,718
But for you maybe there's another.

389
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,606
Here's Marks, let's go.

390
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,066
Dipshit, take off.

391
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,031
All right, ready to rock and roll?

392
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,452
Yeah, I'm ready.

393
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,870
Good.

394
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,994
Got them fucking warrants?

395
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,084
Shit.

396
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,383
All right, here's the deal.

397
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,003
These watches here are synchronized.

398
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,847
At exactly 11:11, you blow up the back,

399
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,807
we'll blow in the front.

400
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,391
You see anything you like?

401
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,233
Let's do it.

402
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,884
Everybody freeze!

403
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,360
Move over to the wall, come on!

404
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,697
Let's go, go.

405
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,486
Go, fuck!

406
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,577
Hey yo, it's not the women, we maze man.

407
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,445
Over to the park.

408
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,492
Get it, move!

409
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,913
Get on the fucking wall.

410
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,630
Get up!

411
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,148
Why don't you take Mr. Nicky downtown?

412
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,868
We'll stay here, clean
up, book the evidence.

413
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,497
Give me his toy.

414
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,966
Let's see how you dance, Scale.

415
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,335
Because of the quantity of drugs seized

416
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,457
and the defendant's prior record,

417
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,676
I'm going to set cash bail
at one million dollars.

418
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,634
Objection!

419
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,966
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

420
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,681
You are the prosecutor
and you are objecting

421
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,848
to one million dollars cash bail?

422
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,268
Yes, your honor, it's not enough.

423
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,641
Miss Cantrell, it's
11:55 on a Friday night.

424
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,393
That's a lot of cash to come up with

425
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,019
at this hour.

426
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,521
Nicky Carr can pull that amount

427
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,445
out of his small change purse.

428
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,570
It's not enough to ensure
that he'll appear for trial.

429
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,990
Objection overruled.

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,959
Mr. Rosen, do you have anything to say?

431
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,328
Yes your honor.

432
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,835
My client will make bail.

433
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,638
Fuck.

434
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,289
Evidence room.

435
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,286
Hello, Larry?

436
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,413
This is Margaret O'Leary.

437
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,040
Someone broke into the garage last night.

438
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,588
I think they saw Patrick's car.

439
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,259
Uh, thanks, I'll get back to you on that.

440
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,473
Larry, I'm worried.

441
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,966
Can you talk now?

442
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,061
No, but I'll call you later.

443
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,140
Just checking to see if
the Nicky Carr evidence

444
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,358
got booked in all right.

445
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,977
Yeah, yeah, it's there.

446
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,195
Good.

447
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,609
A lot of cash, wasn't it.

448
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,573
Oh it was a lot of cash.

449
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,863
But it wasn't a lot of cash.

450
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,241
Yeah.

451
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,512
Give me two of whatever he's having.

452
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,935
You want a quadruple boilermaker?

453
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,558
Yeah, and a Pepsi.

454
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,899
You're not planning on driving home.

455
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,193
I got no plans, Richie.

456
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,317
But speaking of driving,

457
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,320
there's a brand new bright
red Porsche Cabriolet

458
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,118
Turbo stuck under a tarp in the back

459
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,081
of Dan O'Leary's garage.

460
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,497
I'm sorry to hear that.

461
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,123
Yup, I don't know,

462
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,252
I just don't know, Richie.

463
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:30,725
Once upon a time all I planned
to do was play the tenor sax.

464
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,309
Forever.

465
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,098
That's it.

466
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,976
Bills bill, man.

467
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,730
But my dad, everybody said I was a sap.

468
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,568
No money in it.

469
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,358
So I go to law school.

470
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,241
And I am here now.

471
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,452
Gone from that other place.

472
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,701
Where I could play the tenor
sax all day and all night.

473
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,294
Everything was possible.

474
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,209
And I was very certain that at any minute

475
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,504
I was going to meet the love of my life.

476
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,219
The love of your life?

477
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:07,962
Yeah.

478
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,388
I met the love of my life.

479
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:17,514
Only I killed her dog before
I had a chance to tell her.

480
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,270
Then she was everything I ever wanted.

481
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,486
We met at Shakespeare in the park.

482
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,278
Told her I was a lawyer.

483
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,996
That line seemed to work for you.

484
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,538
Rained like hell in a day.

485
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,834
Had an umbrella.

486
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,918
We went back to her apartment.

487
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,638
She went to the bathroom,
I sat on the couch.

488
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,801
She had this great big damn dog.

489
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,304
The dog had a ball.

490
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,180
I threw it.

491
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,687
The dog brought it back.

492
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,651
I threw it again harder.

493
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,399
I'll never forget the
sound of that dog's paws

494
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,527
on the newly waxed floors.

495
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,366
How was I supposed to know
she left the window open?

496
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,412
Her dog fell 13 stories, landed on top

497
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,663
of a parked car.

498
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,667
I went over, leaned out the window,

499
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,215
looked down, threw up and left.

500
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,050
Left.

501
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:38,011
Without ever telling her she was the one.

502
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,186
Happy is the fleeting hope of youth.

503
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,656
Who said that?

504
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,241
Me.

505
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,952
I'm gonna take this case, Richie.

506
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,203
Good for you, counselor.

507
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,996
Me too.

508
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,685
Hi.

509
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,535
Looking for a runner.

510
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,708
Go up this high.

511
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,884
White, 135 pounds, brown
hair, wears a little ponytail.

512
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,554
He's wearing a pair of gray pants

513
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,423
and a flashy kind of gray sweater

514
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:43,553
and a pair of Felony flyers
the night of the bust.

515
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,475
Hey cop.

516
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,231
What's your problem?

517
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,192
This place is legal now.

518
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,275
You looking for a cut, you
got to talk to your boys

519
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,897
down at the station.

520
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,322
Yeah.

521
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:01,950
Get up.

522
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,164
I said get up.

523
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,536
Hey cop.

524
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,504
Stop harassing me before I call my lawyer.

525
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,684
You know what this is?

526
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,168
It's a gun.

527
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,681
And you're a fucking genius.

528
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,308
Now listen to this.

529
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,902
This gun is clean, no serial numbers.

530
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,521
So I could blow out
what's left of your brain

531
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,946
and chuck it in the East
river and case is closed.

532
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,945
People downtown are
gonna file it under DSAF.

533
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,572
Did Society a Favor, you got it?

534
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,869
I understand, I understand.

535
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,335
Now where is he?

536
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,206
He's August.

537
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,506
On the twos over at New Amsterdam.

538
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,220
Yeah, yeah?

539
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,438
You said you wanted
to go along for the ride.

540
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,852
Yeah, man.

541
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,475
The bus is leaving, amigo.

542
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,192
Okay, where?

543
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,779
New Amsterdam theater on
42nd street, 30 minutes.

544
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,398
I'm down.

545
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,781
25 cents?

546
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:29,701
For 25 cents that guy can go
give himself some head, shit.

547
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,254
To online,
the downstairs room.

548
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,001
It's a man to a half, crazy.

549
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,628
Two girls can't get enough of each other.

550
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,676
Enough there, for only one dollar

551
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,139
you can do off to a naked girl.

552
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,725
Legally naked woman all low.

553
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,970
Ira!

554
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,437
Nice to see you.

555
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,351
Whoah, wait a minute, Stevie.

556
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,565
Yeah, this one looks real.

557
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,939
You bet your ass it's real.

558
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,610
Hey Bob, I want you to change the sheets

559
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,486
in the honeymoon suite.

560
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,013
This is what I got.

561
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,142
And this is what I want.

562
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,235
Stevie, which room is he in?

563
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,071
Now this, Chief, I don't think he wants

564
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,315
to be disturbed right now.

565
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,749
The honeymoon suite, he's
in the honeymoon suite.

566
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,268
Shit.

567
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,538
Real live girls,
gentlemen, real live girls.

568
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,408
Look at Bobbie in booth
three, Melanie in booth four

569
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,455
and Tamara in booth five.

570
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,666
These are real live women, live flesh.

571
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,130
Step into a booth.

572
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,292
Richie, Richie, look.

573
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,261
I don't know what kind of party
we're crashing up here, man.

574
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,426
You don't happen to have a
little something for me, do you?

575
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,640
Like a bazooka?

576
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,221
You know how
to use one of these?

577
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,597
Fucking A, papa.

578
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,100
I'm from New York City.

579
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,397
Don't shoot me in the ass.

580
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,427
Holy shit.

581
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,306
Oh yeah.

582
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,904
Police officer, freeze!

583
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,407
Hands up, get your goddamn hands up.

584
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,123
Anything you say, officer.

585
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:01,795
Dammit!

586
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,721
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch!

587
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,008
Hey!

588
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,849
You drive, I'll shoot!

589
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,314
Stay back, motherfucker!

590
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,417
My house, stupid!

591
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,146
Get out!

592
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,741
How's it going, Max?

593
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,259
Too bad about dipshit, huh?

594
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,387
Gave us a lot of good tips.

595
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,096
Yeah, I bet he did.

596
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,804
What kind of shit you carrying?

597
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,303
That ain't regulation.

598
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,522
It's a gun of my own to
exercise my own constitutional

599
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,436
right to bear arms.

600
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,730
Hey ain't you something.

601
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,603
Big John Wayne fan huh?

602
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,530
45 Magnum.

603
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,245
Plan on taking down an army?

604
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:12,913
A lawyer.

605
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,676
Right.

606
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,027
Sweetheart, I'm going to bed.

607
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,316
Okay, good night.

608
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,366
Did you call about the apartment?

609
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,827
I'm sorry, sweetie, I forgot.

610
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,866
I forgot all about it.

611
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,113
Listen I've had all this work to do.

612
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,831
My ass still aches from the motorcycle.

613
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,700
Roland, you promised.

614
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,502
We don't call, we lose the apartment.

615
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,666
I know Gail, I know.

616
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:54,959
I'll call about the apartment tomorrow.

617
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,753
I just can't believe you're
spending all this time

618
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,170
trying to get this guy set free

619
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,543
and you can't find five minutes

620
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,297
to do something that's
really important for us.

621
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,674
This guy's a crack dealer, he's a rapist.

622
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,472
People like him belong in jail.

623
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,094
I can't believe you want him out.

624
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,892
Gail, honey, I don't
necessarily want him out.

625
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,106
I just don't want him in
for something he didn't do.

626
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,441
Who cares if he did it?

627
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,901
If he didn't do this, he
damn sure did something else.

628
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,315
Who gives a fuck if he's innocent?

629
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,314
Well I do, I give a fuck.

630
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,782
For Christ's sake, this man
sells death to schoolkids!

631
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,448
Gail, hey, hey, sweetie.

632
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,116
What's going on here, huh?

633
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:27,909
Come here.

634
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,246
Now what's all this about, huh?

635
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,710
Is this some kind of
panic that I'm gonna take

636
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,126
a left turn on your dad's
offer about his law firm?

637
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,499
I don't know, maybe.

638
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,503
I just don't understand your
fascination with all this.

639
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,880
Hey, it's all in your mind.

640
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,967
I'll call about the apartment, I promise.

641
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,469
I'll call tomorrow, all right?

642
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,469
Okay.

643
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,597
And you love me, right?

644
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,270
I love you.

645
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,928
A lot.

646
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,731
Okay.

647
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,900
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

648
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,779
one thing I promise not
to do in this courtroom

649
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,326
is to pretend to you that I
am representing Snow White

650
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,369
for a client.

651
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,539
Simple fact of the matter is
that all the seven dwarves

652
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,665
couldn't match his record on
a weekend pass in Singapore.

653
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,462
I'm not going to conceal
this fact from you

654
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,132
and I apologize to my humble colleague

655
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,597
the District Attorney for
snatching that ham bone

656
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,807
from her plate.

657
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:33,562
However I do promise to use
every means of persuasion

658
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,057
I can muster to prove to you
that my client Michael Jones

659
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,902
did not commit the crime
of first degree murder.

660
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,896
But that he in fact shot
officer Patrick O'Leary

661
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,192
in self defense.

662
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,151
Humorous yet restrained,
rhetorical yet substitative.

663
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,448
You managed to cover everything
except the will of God.

664
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,946
Saving that for my closing.

665
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,073
I thought so.

666
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,073
You cleared for miracles?

667
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,666
Seems to be the new one proud.

668
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,286
I'm glad I have a front row seat.

669
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,503
Okay, so what's the deal?

670
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,247
No deals today buddy,
you missed that boat.

671
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,465
I'm taking your boy to the max.

672
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,583
I'm not taking about that deal.

673
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,583
I'm talking about this deal.

674
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,710
What gives here, what do you want from me?

675
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,836
Do I look like I want something?

676
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,212
Look, why don't you take your mind games

677
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,089
and run them by those doors at the ACLU

678
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,966
'cause I don't have
time for this bullshit.

679
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,639
Oh yeah, I forgot, your star is rising

680
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,635
in the financial arena.

681
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,636
Correct.

682
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,183
Complete with Miss Right, I hear too.

683
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,647
Hey, look Susan.

684
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,315
I loved you better than
anybody's ever gonna love you

685
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:26,235
in your lifetime and you
left me holding the bag.

686
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,450
You took a hike, remember?

687
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,536
Now I can't figure it, but
I pulled myself together,

688
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,747
I moved on and boom, you show up here?

689
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,412
Well look, I didn't ask for
it and I didn't want it.

690
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,536
So why don't we just sort
of swing on through this

691
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,833
with a minimum of bloodshed?

692
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,382
And in case you didn't grasp that,

693
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,172
I was crazy about you.

694
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,678
Isn't that your waking state?

695
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,648
Look, do me a favor will you?

696
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,688
Will you just tell me so I can
quit bugging myself about it?

697
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,027
Just tell me why.

698
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,024
You were turning cynical and judgemental

699
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,822
and berating and mean.

700
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,030
And concocted some
bullshit story about how

701
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,124
credit cards were gonna save your life.

702
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,458
Well why didn't you tell me that then?

703
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,247
I did.

704
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,331
In my own way, you just didn't hear it.

705
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,128
Oh.

706
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,473
I miss you, Roland.

707
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,806
Oh yeah?

708
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,188
Well what are we gonna do now?

709
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,283
Uh huh, uh huh, yeah.

710
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,088
Gentlemen, I got 10,000 dollars

711
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,801
that says the Harlem Shuffle
gonna kick the cracker's ass.

712
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,887
Anybody want a piece?

713
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,098
See the man, right?

714
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,137
Come on babe.

715
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,805
Yo, yo yo!

716
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,728
What we gonna do?

717
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,770
Win!

718
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,813
Go on your ride.

719
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,152
Yeah, yeah.

720
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,611
We're gonna win.

721
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,400
Oh shit.

722
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,899
Hold this for me.

723
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,993
Rydel, you know you could
fuck up on wet jeans?

724
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,706
Come on, we gotta talk.

725
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,201
Listen, this is my play time.

726
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,828
Can I at least watch the race?

727
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,829
Sure.

728
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,459
I ain't here to give out parking tickets.

729
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,675
Let's get it on!

730
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,446
Shit.

731
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,037
Tough luck, cracker.

732
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,496
Hey, get my money.

733
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,930
Now what can I do for you?

734
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,968
Richie Marks.

735
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,341
What about him?

736
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:42,890
I see.

737
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,431
What's in it for me?

738
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,228
Evidence against you

739
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,647
in the police department's
safe disappears.

740
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:57,071
147,000 dollars and
seven pounds of cocaine

741
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,616
just disappears in the
police evidence safe?

742
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,740
Won't be the first time.

743
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,459
I got your message.

744
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,088
You're the new boy at the precinct.

745
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,835
But you'll find out I always pay my bills.

746
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,306
But the people I work for
are just a little pissed off.

747
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,016
What the fuck happened in Central Park?

748
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,386
One time small time mistake.

749
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,809
Ain't gonna happen again.

750
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,104
50K a month, and midtown north is yours.

751
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,611
Don't be worrying about no Michael Jones.

752
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,778
I'm gonna clean up that mess personally.

753
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:40,903
But you are gonna have to
take care of Richie Marks.

754
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,115
It's a deal.

755
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,702
You do your thing.

756
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,250
I'll take care of Marks pronto.

757
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,426
I forgot how much I love this room.

758
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,557
My treehouse.

759
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,346
I forgot how much I love listening to you.

760
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,600
I forgot how much I love having you here.

761
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,478
You like the line, that chitchat then.

762
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,322
Except you do most of the talking.

763
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,360
Yeah, I do.

764
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,901
I gotta go.

765
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,827
I won't be your mistress, Dalton.

766
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,202
Well I just can't not show up.

767
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,330
Make it easy for both of us.

768
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,174
This time it was what it was.

769
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,886
If there's a next time, you
have to stay the whole night.

770
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,379
So I just put a bow on that baggage

771
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,757
and present it to my fiancee?

772
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,760
It's up to you, my dear.

773
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,463
I said, does the
defense have any questions?

774
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,681
Oh I'm sorry.

775
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,808
Yes your honor.

776
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,349
We have some questions.

777
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,642
Officer Varelli,

778
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,895
when you came up on the scene,

779
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,861
you recognized the deceased
to be a police officer, right?

780
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:38,899
Yes I did.

781
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,647
In fact you knew him to be
an undercover police officer

782
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,742
investigating narcotics
in your area, correct?

783
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,609
That's correct.

784
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,738
When you approached officer O'Leary,

785
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,994
he was lying on the ground unconscious.

786
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,117
Objection, conclusion.

787
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,914
Sustained.

788
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,914
Okay, officer Varelli,
his eyes were closed?

789
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:57,914
Yes.

790
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:58,915
He was not moving?

791
00:52:58,926 --> 00:52:59,916
No he wasn't.

792
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,509
It was clear
to you that there was not

793
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:02,673
any semblance of mind.

794
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,921
Objection, conclusion.

795
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,887
Sustained.

796
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,804
Officer Varelli, when you
arrived upon the scene,

797
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,427
were there any other police officers

798
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,429
in the proximity except for your partner?

799
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,101
No.

800
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,770
Well to the best of your knowledge,

801
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,359
isn't it correct police
procedure when an officer's going

802
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,069
to make a narcotics arrest on the street,

803
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,859
to have some sort of backup person,

804
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,859
some sort of assistant, some
sort of support or protection?

805
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,201
Usually that's the case.

806
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,991
Well Officer Varelli, in your experience,

807
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,659
don't you find it highly unusual

808
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,534
if an officer's gonna be engaged
in a dangerous circumstance

809
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,537
of a narcotics arrest
to be proceeding alone?

810
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,708
Objection.

811
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,502
Your honor, this is conjecture.

812
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,342
What is usual for Officer
Varelli may not be usual

813
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,960
for someone else.

814
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,179
Patrick O'Leary was an
undercover policeman.

815
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,969
What his particular procedure
was, we do not know.

816
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,592
Sustained.

817
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,811
In any event, Officer Varelli,

818
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,976
Officer O'Leary's partner never arrived,

819
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,521
nor did anyone else
resembling a human being

820
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,190
who claimed to have any
work with him, true?

821
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,687
That's true.

822
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,406
So what you saw was, you saw
a man lying on the ground

823
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,445
who was shot.

824
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,402
But you did not actually see anyone

825
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,995
do the shooting, did you?

826
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,910
Of course not, I already
said I wasn't there

827
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,203
but it's obvious what happened.

828
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,500
Now I submit to you that it
is not obvious what happened.

829
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,496
It is not obvious.

830
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,544
But it is fair to say that
you assumed what happened

831
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,259
because you were not
there, Officer Varelli.

832
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,844
And you did not see what happened.

833
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,429
Right, I already said that, right.

834
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,095
And your assumption was
that Patrick O'Leary

835
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,888
in the middle of a narcotics arrest

836
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,308
was shot by Michael Jones.

837
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,931
But since you were not there,
you could assume anything.

838
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,352
You could assume as a matter of fact,

839
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,692
it might be Patrick O'Leary shot himself.

840
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,903
Or maybe you could assume
because you were not there

841
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,398
that Patrick O'Leary
did not identify himself

842
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,321
as a police officer because
his badge was not out

843
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,570
and you could assume, Officer Varelli,

844
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,118
that Patrick O'Leary
pulled his gun out first

845
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,990
and shot Micheal Jones,

846
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,991
Objection!

847
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,618
Planning to kill him and
steal his money and his drugs!

848
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,619
Objection!

849
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,620
Could you assume that, officer Varelli?

850
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:01,712
Bullshit!

851
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:06,005
Mr. Dalton, you will
please approach the bench.

852
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,303
Nice moves.

853
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,346
Dazzling, aren't I?

854
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,469
But what do you got after that, though?

855
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,515
Hang on tight, partner.

856
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,730
Oh I see, the ride gets rougher than this.

857
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,722
You betcha.

858
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,849
It's just the way I like it.

859
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,270
You better watch out.

860
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,610
I can roll with anything
you put out, buddy.

861
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,570
Yeah, you're a regular
bronc buster, you are.

862
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,906
That's what's called a discreet
turn of the phrase, right?

863
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,990
You got it, cowboy.

864
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,030
I'm gonna brand you this time, horsey,

865
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,154
so everybody know's you're mine.

866
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,200
How does that grab you?

867
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,197
Oh yeah?

868
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,665
Where's your iron?

869
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:42,870
Tell her.

870
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,466
Can you handle this or
is this too real for you?

871
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,257
Yeah I can handle it, just
do me a favor, will you?

872
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,675
Professional or personal?

873
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,763
Personal.

874
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,973
Done.

875
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,514
Whisper yippeayeoh in my ear.

876
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,733
Roland!

877
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,271
Hi!

878
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,395
Oh hi, Gail.

879
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,029
How are you?

880
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,988
Mr. Feinberg.

881
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:10,823
Roland.

882
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:11,942
Can you believe it?

883
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,238
I told daddy that we were
having lunch together

884
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,703
and he said he was free and he'd join us.

885
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,698
Can you imagine daddy
being free for lunch?

886
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,494
I can't.

887
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,269
Let's do it.

888
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,606
Attempted murder of a police officer.

889
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,575
It's gonna get your friend
here three years in the joint.

890
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,739
What are you gonna do?

891
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,829
Gonna go along with him or
you wanna assume the position

892
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,992
and let me bust you for loitering

893
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,457
or some other bullshit charge?

894
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,628
I know what you're thinking.

895
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,089
You're young and fast.

896
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,458
I'm old and slow.

897
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,800
What are you gonna do, asshole?

898
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,056
Dumb fucking question.

899
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,822
Police officer!

900
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,991
Everybody down!

901
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,735
I got a gun!

902
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,629
Get out of here!

903
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,360
Let me through, get back, get back!

904
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,349
Get back, get back!

905
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,426
Fuck you, blood!

906
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,315
No actually asshole, it's

907
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:14,730
fuck you.

908
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,566
Oh Jesus, better get a shovel.

909
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,277
Ah, good morning.

910
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:46,905
Yeah.

911
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,117
You all right?

912
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:54,997
Yeah.

913
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,378
Are you sure?

914
01:01:58,965 --> 01:01:59,830
I'm fine.

915
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,674
You want something to eat?

916
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,514
Hmm, yes I want something to eat.

917
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,934
God, I love you.

918
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,577
I didn't tell her.

919
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:41,206
I lied to her, told her
I was going to Boston.

920
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,082
And she believed you?

921
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,590
Yeah, why wouldn't she, sure?

922
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,923
Don't be so sure, Dalton.

923
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,970
Women aren't stupid.

924
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,684
I wanted to tell her.

925
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,724
I wanted to but then her
dad showed up for lunch.

926
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,971
Oh, so your guts dried up in the face

927
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,314
of Daddy Warbucks.

928
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,148
Now is this gonna be some kind of

929
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,768
female territorial doo wop?

930
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,237
You know, you really piss me off.

931
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,230
Here we go.

932
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,482
This isn't about me.

933
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,903
This is about you.

934
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,994
Yeah, I'm a woman and
I'm jealous, so what?

935
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:15,331
This is about you and who you are

936
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,620
and who you really wanna be.

937
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,083
You know, you really
lose the best of yourself

938
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,455
when you're around the gold.

939
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,706
And now here we are one year ago

940
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,334
back in the hi jive, self realization bit.

941
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,085
So you're gonna take 14 years of legal aid

942
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,383
and chuck it out the window?

943
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,717
You just don't get it, do you?

944
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,015
I mean you got me in
some kind of retrograde

945
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,230
Clarence Derryl or something I mean,

946
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,849
but you just don't get it.

947
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,772
You keep thinking I'm leaving legal aid

948
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,566
because I wanna be somewhere else?

949
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,033
I'm out of here babe,
because it's kicking the life

950
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,243
out of me, see?

951
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,580
Day in and day fucking
out with the scumbags

952
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,166
and the jerkoffs and the sex creeps

953
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,583
and the freaks and the killers, goddammit.

954
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,133
I can't live in it anymore.

955
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,380
And god forbid I get one, somebody,

956
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,221
just one somebody who's
innocent and I can't prove it

957
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:20,346
so instead of risking a loss,
I got to plea bargain his ass.

958
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,187
So he doesn't do eight years of hard time.

959
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,857
He ends up only doing one
in Attica with the rest

960
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,855
of the human puke but that
doesn't matter anyway.

961
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,026
Because after one year in that nightmare,

962
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,399
his life is over.

963
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,033
And so what if I want things, Susan?

964
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,905
People want shit, you know?

965
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,373
I want things.

966
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,584
I know, life's a bitch, huh, Roland.

967
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,953
Why do you think it's so
goddamn manifest destiny

968
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,704
for me to be picking
shit with the chickens

969
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,751
the rest of my life?

970
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:47,794
Because you love it.

971
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,042
You love it to death.

972
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:53,137
And of everything you do
it's the thing you do best.

973
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,678
Now Mr. Mistrangelo, you
stated that you owned

974
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,806
and operated a reputable, honest, exotic

975
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,604
automobile business, right?

976
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,566
Yes I did.

977
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,523
The Casadoro Custom Car Emporium, correct?

978
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,523
That's right.

979
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,526
Sounds like a brothel in Tangeres.

980
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,697
Objection.

981
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,659
Sustained.

982
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,913
You also stated that
officer O'Leary purchased

983
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,580
a customized Turbo Porsche Cabriolet.

984
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,952
Right.

985
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:28,673
And that he paid 87,300 dollars for it?

986
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,291
Right.

987
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,291
How did he pay for it?

988
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,588
Cash.

989
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,006
He paid cash.

990
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,050
And did you give him a warranty?

991
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,049
No.

992
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,516
Did you give him a receipt?

993
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,101
No.

994
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,222
So in fact, there is no record
of this actual transaction.

995
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:45,723
Well we have some records.

996
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,895
But we recently moved locations

997
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,610
and they got lost in the shuffle.

998
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,318
So you would just have this court

999
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,657
take your word for it that
this actually occurred?

1000
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,071
Well it's the truth.

1001
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,034
Oh and you would tell the truth

1002
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,699
because you're an honest
and reputable man.

1003
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,913
Objection, your honor.

1004
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,201
The District Attorney
is obviously badgering

1005
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,540
and ridiculing this witness.

1006
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:04,499
Overruled.

1007
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,746
Isn't it a fact that
on February 10th, 1984,

1008
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,167
you were convicted of trafficking

1009
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,292
interstate stolen automobiles?

1010
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,463
Objection, your honor.

1011
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,881
Sustained.

1012
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,004
Miss Cantrell.

1013
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,256
No more questions.

1014
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,815
Your honor, at this time,
I would like to call

1015
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,687
as my last witness the
defendant Michael Jones.

1016
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:38,242
Will the defendant please rise?

1017
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,281
Approach the witness box.

1018
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,203
Swear him in.

1019
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,750
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth

1020
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,669
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

1021
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,086
I do.

1022
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,210
For the record, state your
full name, your occupation,

1023
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,757
and where you live.

1024
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,515
Michael Ezekiel Jones.

1025
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,635
I'm a drug dealer.

1026
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,262
I live in Riker's Island prison.

1027
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,937
The witness may take the stand.

1028
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,230
Michael Jones.

1029
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,650
Michael Ezekiel Jones.

1030
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,493
Now Michael, would you
tell us in your own words

1031
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,622
exactly what happened
to you on Friday night

1032
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,288
October the ninth, approximately 10 p.m.

1033
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,287
in Central Park near the West Side

1034
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,755
61st street pedestrian tunnel?

1035
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,963
I was selling drugs.

1036
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,672
White guy came up to me.

1037
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,221
Asked to buy lightning.

1038
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,264
The stuff you call crack.

1039
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,388
I told him I have some.

1040
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,983
He said he only had big bills.

1041
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,898
Said I had plenty change.

1042
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,198
He reached into his jacket.

1043
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,951
And instead of pulling out his wallet,

1044
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,570
he pulled out a gun!

1045
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:09,617
He looked at me in my eye
and said, goodbye nigga.

1046
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,046
I thought he was gonna kill me.

1047
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,339
I didn't know he was no cop.

1048
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,431
I went for my gun.

1049
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,185
He fired, I fired.

1050
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,806
I remember getting hit.

1051
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,727
But I don't remember no more.

1052
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,906
I uh,

1053
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,581
I was one of the first two cops

1054
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,122
to come upon the Dan O'Leary death scene.

1055
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,166
I'm the one that booked the evidence.

1056
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,758
The black kid's ghetto
blaster, when I found it

1057
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,969
was in the record position.

1058
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,636
You listen to the tape?

1059
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,223
No.

1060
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,643
I've heard rumors.

1061
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,142
I don't even wanna know if they're true.

1062
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,270
Why you telling me this now?

1063
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,272
One of the cops that got
killed in Times Square

1064
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,569
by that skell you finally got,

1065
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,783
was my brother.

1066
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,001
You have any idea what's gonna happen

1067
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,122
if I give this information
to the defense attorney?

1068
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,001
A lot of brother officers
are gonna go down

1069
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,220
in the investigation this thing causes.

1070
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,460
Yeah, this is police officer Marks.

1071
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:21,548
I got an emergency call for
defense attorney Roland Dalton.

1072
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:24,967
Mr. Jones.

1073
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,841
Have you ever been arrested
for selling crack before?

1074
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,388
Yeah.

1075
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,931
And when you were
arrested, was the officer

1076
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,897
wearing a uniform or street clothes?

1077
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,357
Street clothes.

1078
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,601
And also when you were arrested,

1079
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,978
did he pull out his badge and say hello,

1080
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,356
I'm a police officer?

1081
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,449
Or did he try to buy some
drugs and make a deal?

1082
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,442
Your honor, excuse me,

1083
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,069
I request a personal emergency recess.

1084
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,492
Your honor, I object to
this transparent ploy.

1085
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,490
Excuse me, your honor, I know it seems

1086
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,241
hideously contrived except I request

1087
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,834
an emergency personal recess.

1088
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:01,126
Well, it's ten minutes to four.

1089
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,375
This court recess until nine
o'clock tomorrow morning.

1090
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:09,880
Oh wait!

1091
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,722
Gail!

1092
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,091
What, Gail, hi.

1093
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,558
Richie Marks is waiting for me.

1094
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,472
He's got some things.

1095
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:15,595
I got to talk to you about something.

1096
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,595
I got to talk to you.

1097
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:17,687
There's something very
important I have to tell you.

1098
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,680
Wait.

1099
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,727
I'm pregnant.

1100
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:21,938
Isn't that great?

1101
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,230
Really?

1102
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,444
Yeah.

1103
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,233
Oh wow.

1104
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,199
Gail, this is great.

1105
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,363
I threw up this morning.

1106
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,359
You did?

1107
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,078
Richie Marks is waiting
for me with the thing.

1108
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,788
No, sweetie, tonight.

1109
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,038
Bye.

1110
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,289
Get your hands off me!

1111
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,087
I'm just gonna get some band aids.

1112
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,841
Sergeant, my name is Roland Dalton,

1113
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,838
I'm from legal aid.

1114
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:52,839
I got a court order here giving me access

1115
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,637
to your evidence room.

1116
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,511
Did you hear me?

1117
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,890
Well can you read, this is a court order.

1118
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,986
Up the fucking stairs!

1119
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:09,861
Thanks.

1120
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,462
Evidence room.

1121
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,300
Dalton's coming up.

1122
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,919
All right, thanks.

1123
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,109
Yo, I got a court order
here that grants me access

1124
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,483
to certain evidence in
the Jones-O'Leary case.

1125
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,483
This is a court order.

1126
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,156
Christ, it's a shame.

1127
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,779
My key just broke off on the lock.

1128
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:58,951
It did?

1129
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,621
Well I don't suppose between
you and the putz downstairs,

1130
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,493
you got a pair of bolt cutters.

1131
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:07,965
Well maintenance does but
they knock off at five.

1132
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,253
You have to come back in the morning.

1133
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,046
In the morning, huh?

1134
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:10,838
Yeah.

1135
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:12,757
Thanks.

1136
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,218
You know, you cops,

1137
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,595
you're the best that money can buy.

1138
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,973
Thank you, have a nice day.

1139
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,355
So what were you looking for?

1140
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,980
True love, isn't that what
we're all looking for?

1141
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,281
That's cute.

1142
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,492
That's very cute.

1143
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,077
You're a tough guy, huh?

1144
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,787
What were you looking for?

1145
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,203
I think I wish to speak to my lawyer.

1146
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,168
I'll file with the legal aid.

1147
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,083
Why don't you speak to my asshole, huh?

1148
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,468
What were you looking for?

1149
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,604
The fuck are you doing?

1150
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,144
Shut the fuck up!

1151
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,355
Let's play again.

1152
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,319
Got lucky last time.

1153
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,376
The tape.

1154
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,994
Okay, the tape, the tape.

1155
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,086
What tape?

1156
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,628
The tape, Michael Jones
recorded everything

1157
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,000
on the tape recorder.

1158
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,718
The tape's in the ghetto blaster.

1159
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,596
Play the fucking tape.

1160
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,274
The fuck is that?

1161
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,642
Thank you, man.

1162
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,777
Goodbye, nigger.

1163
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,701
Larry, don't get nervous.

1164
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,664
We're going downstairs
at the fire alarm box.

1165
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,459
When the bell goes off, shoot him.

1166
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,716
I shoot him?

1167
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,051
Yeah.

1168
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,590
His fingerprints are
all over the bolt cutter

1169
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:25,964
and the evidence room locker.

1170
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,057
I haven't got a clean gun.

1171
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,393
The fuck you talking about?

1172
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,854
There are 245,000 of those police specials

1173
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,974
floating around New York City.

1174
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,475
By the time they figure this shit out

1175
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,021
it'll be long gone.

1176
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,358
This your evidence?

1177
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,992
Here's your evidence.

1178
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,365
Well hurry up and go
pull the goddamn thing!

1179
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,412
Just do it.

1180
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,433
Where's Dalton?

1181
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,601
Third floor interrogation.

1182
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,894
He's waiting for his lawyer.

1183
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:29,281
Hello baby, Daddy's coming home real soon.

1184
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,791
Goddamn oh, goddamn, oh fuck!

1185
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,635
Richie, get the tape, the tape, the tape!

1186
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:46,674
Goddamit man.

1187
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,844
How you doing?

1188
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,349
They had the gun, they had the gun

1189
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:56,563
in my head.

1190
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,774
Record this, I got to get this.

1191
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,735
Okay, I got court.

1192
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,773
Goddamit.

1193
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,322
Oh world, what a fucking world.

1194
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,045
Do I know you?

1195
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,756
Hey, I recognize you from TV.

1196
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,625
You're the guy defending the cop killer.

1197
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,093
Alleged cop killer, alleged.

1198
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,212
What, you mean he didn't do it?

1199
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,509
Yeah man, he did it but
he did it in self defense.

1200
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,264
Really?

1201
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,475
Yeah, really.

1202
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,178
Hey, they coming after you?

1203
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,306
Yup, yup, they're coming after me.

1204
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,306
Why?

1205
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,775
Well, because the bad cop lied to him

1206
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,770
and I know the truth and if
they know I know the truth,

1207
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,271
a lot of bad cops are
in deep fucking trouble

1208
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,648
so let's go to court.

1209
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:48,648
Hey, I studied the Constitution.

1210
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,571
I passed my citizenship test.

1211
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:51,818
You got a right to be in the court.

1212
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,036
I'll get you to court.

1213
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,449
You hold on.

1214
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,088
Ah, fuck you!

1215
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,309
Boys, break it up!

1216
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,107
Bring it up!

1217
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,087
Woohoo!!

1218
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,839
Mr. Dalton!

1219
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,838
What in hell is going on here?

1220
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,760
Your honor, I got a court order

1221
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,633
of the evidence.

1222
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,351
This tape is police officers.

1223
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,813
It's vital you hear.

1224
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,807
Bailiff, bring Mr. Dalton to my chambers.

1225
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,228
Your honor, I have to arrest him.

1226
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:07,443
On the streets you are the law.

1227
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:11,565
But on the steps of this
courthouse, I am the law.

1228
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,318
If this police officer
does not lower his gun,

1229
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,197
arrest him for obstructing justice.

1230
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,199
Go ahead, whitebread.

1231
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:23,751
Make my day.

1232
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,378
Judge Maynor, there's
evidence on this tape.

1233
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,217
Mr. Dalton.

1234
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,213
The legal ramifications
that would allow you

1235
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,715
to testify about what you
heard or maybe didn't hear

1236
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,012
on this tape, or even
if this tape is in fact

1237
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,386
the tape that was in Michael Jones's radio

1238
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,605
at the time of the alleged incident.

1239
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,348
I mean it boggles the mind.

1240
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,228
I cannot allow it to be
introduced as evidence.

1241
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:55,234
Now, Miss Cantrell will
complete her cross examination

1242
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,662
and then both of you will
give your closing arguments.

1243
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,032
And then I will give
this case to the jury.

1244
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,752
And Mr. Dalton, if the jury
should rule against you,

1245
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:09,418
you can exercise your right of appeal.

1246
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,125
And that is that.

1247
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,182
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1248
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:28,149
I'd like to give you a few
words from the book of Matthew.

1249
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:31,270
If I may, chapter 10 verses 26 and 27.

1250
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:38,193
There is nothing covered up
that shall not be uncovered.

1251
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:41,742
There is nothing hidden
that shall not be known.

1252
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,081
Whatever I say to you in the dark,

1253
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,201
you must repeat in the daylight.

1254
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:50,330
And whatever is whispered, you
must shout from the rooftops.

1255
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,416
Now the truth.

1256
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:58,630
The truth ain't always pleasant.

1257
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,099
But the truth however is always the truth.

1258
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,391
Now the prosecution will have you believe

1259
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:13,862
that this is just some
simple straightforward case.

1260
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:17,824
A bad man shoots down a
decorated police officer

1261
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,696
in the line of duty to avoid one more

1262
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,665
in a long series of endless arrests.

1263
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:31,000
However, I say that
Officer Patrick O'Leary

1264
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,507
was not working in the line of duty

1265
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,547
Friday night October the ninth.

1266
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:40,888
And I say that officer Patrick
O'Leary made a lot of money

1267
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,723
stealing from drug dealers.

1268
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,844
And I also say that Patrick
O'Leary on Friday night

1269
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,848
October the ninth didn't even
bother to identify himself

1270
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,599
to my client Micheal Jones.

1271
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,148
If he had, he'd be alive today.

1272
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,940
You already heard Michael
Jones acknowledge to you,

1273
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,533
admit, confess, time and time again

1274
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,903
under cross examination
by the district attorney

1275
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,826
that he considered it
standard operating procedure

1276
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:09,246
simply the cost of doing
business to pay off cops.

1277
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:13,748
But, Officer Patrick
O'Leary pulled out his gun

1278
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,295
before he pulled out his badge.

1279
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,302
And my client Michael Jones thought he was

1280
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,670
some kind of nut.

1281
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,715
Hey, so would I.

1282
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,761
Wouldn't you?

1283
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:29,641
And after being shot once point blank

1284
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,441
by Patrick O'Leary, my client,

1285
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,811
drug dealer or no, pulled out his own gun

1286
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,940
and fired in self-defense.

1287
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,778
Now the prosecution's
case rests on two points.

1288
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,053
Gotta cut them loose.

1289
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:06,845
What?

1290
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,229
Yeah I can't do the time.

1291
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,771
I won't make it.

1292
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,771
So I just go around, can't do the time.

1293
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,738
You can't do the time.

1294
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:25,819
You can't do the time, Michael?

1295
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,616
But you can take money
from these 10 year old kids

1296
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:28,830
and blow holes in their lives

1297
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:31,449
with the poison you push?

1298
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,496
Now you wanna cry on my shoulder

1299
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,243
'cause you can't do the time?

1300
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:35,040
Stand up.

1301
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,541
Hey man, chill out.

1302
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,840
Stand up! I'm standing, you stand too!

1303
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,680
The jury's back.

1304
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,603
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1305
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,975
Yes, your honor.

1306
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:01,104
Will the defendant please
rise and face the jury?

1307
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,693
Will the foreman read the verdict?

1308
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:10,947
The jury finds
the defendant not guilty.

1309
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,493
That's great, Mike.

1310
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,787
See you in jail.

1311
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,133
I dig these lovenotes in class, Richie,

1312
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,175
what the heck?

1313
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,014
Carr and Rydel are
heading for the airport.

1314
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,725
You wanna drive, you wanna shoot?

1315
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,813
I drive, you shoot.

1316
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:51,620
Hey, baby.

1317
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,082
It's not forever.

1318
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,121
I'll be back.

1319
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,923
Besides, Costa Rica's
just a puddle hop away.

1320
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,095
Richie, this
is O'Leary's wheels.

1321
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:18,143
You copped O'Leary's car.

1322
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:22,064
I didn't think he'd give a shit.

1323
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,167
Come on, keep going!

1324
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,463
So long, sucker.

1325
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:10,755
Jesus Christ,
that was in hydraulics.

1326
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,845
Hey, landing gear won't retract.

1327
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,680
White Tower, this is 750 Alpha Charlie.

1328
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:19,969
Flame out.

1329
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:20,970
Flame out port engine.

1330
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:21,971
Shut it down!

1331
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:23,223
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

1332
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:25,600
White Tower, we have to land.

1333
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,861
750 Alpha
Charlie, clear to land.

1334
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,322
Richie, I love you pal.

1335
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,659
But you are definitely new to the planet.

1336
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,146
Roland.

1337
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,316
I have a confession to make.

1338
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,233
The rabbit, it never died.

1339
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:00,741
I'm sorry.

1340
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,158
I just didn't wanna lose you.

1341
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:13,792
Everyone, there's something
I need to tell you.

1342
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:16,673
I lost the baby.

1343
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:20,928
I'm not pregnant anymore.

1344
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:21,924
Oh Gail.

1345
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:23,051
It's okay.

1346
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,974
I really don't even wanna talk about it.

1347
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:29,600
Besides, we have loads
of time for children.

1348
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:33,728
And now I'm not gonna have to
buy that larger wedding dress.

1349
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,399
Uh, Roland.

1350
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:40,367
Speaking of the wedding, your mother and I

1351
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,362
must get together.

1352
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:44,409
The plaza only seats 600.

1353
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,916
And I'm afraid that
with all of our friends

1354
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,410
that only some of the relatives

1355
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:51,629
will be able to come.

1356
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,918
The relatives, well.

1357
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,176
Excuse me.

1358
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:02,924
Uh Gail, Mr. Feinberger, Mrs. Feinberger.

1359
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,692
I know this is real bad timing, but.

1360
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,821
Yo, Dalton, I thought
you went to Wall Street.

1361
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:21,692
Crack, crack, crack.

1362
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:24,946
Homeboy, that's a
serious sigh you got on.

1363
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,868
Okay, bowlski!
