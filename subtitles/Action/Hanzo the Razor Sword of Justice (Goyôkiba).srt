1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,266
<i>You're born,
you live, and you die.</i>

2
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:11,170
<i>There are no do-overs.</i>

3
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:13,004
<i>No second chances
to make things right</i>

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,578
<i>if you frak them up
the first time.</i>

5
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:17,837
<i>Not in this life, anyway.</i>

6
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:25,412
<i>This is the Battlestar Pegasus</i>

7
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,354
<i>to the ship claiming
to be the Galactica.</i>

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,482
<i>Please respond.</i>

9
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:32,551
<i>Pegasus. How could that be?
The entire fleet
was destroyed.</i>

10
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:36,531
<i>Admiral Cain, we had
no idea there were
other survivors.</i>

11
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:40,028
<i>On behalf of the
officers and the crew
of the Pegasus,</i>

12
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:43,000
welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.

13
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:46,242
<i>What they did
to you was wrong, evil.</i>

14
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:49,577
What you need is justice.

15
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:55,480
<i>Frak you.</i>

16
00:00:56,554 --> 00:01:00,217
<i>And she died knowing
that her ship and
her crew were safe,</i>

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,359
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

18
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,658
Nothing was more important
to her than her ship,
her crew and her mission.

19
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>And as I take
command of Pegasus,</i>

20
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,261
<i>I pledge to
uphold those values</i>

21
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:19,067
<i>that made her such an
effective and heroic leader.</i>

22
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:23,411
<i>Word of Fisk's murder
has spread out
through the entire fleet.</i>

23
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:25,573
Crew can fall apart
when their
commander is killed.

24
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,947
<i>Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.</i>

25
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:30,145
<i>I'm putting
Garner in command.</i>

26
00:01:30,354 --> 00:01:32,822
Commander Garner,
two Base Ships
just jumped in.

27
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:35,153
<i>Nukes inbound.
We're under attack.</i>

28
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,824
<i>We need those FTLs
fixed soon, or we're dead.</i>

29
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,897
I need you to go down here.

30
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,326
<i>Sir, we've lost Garner.</i>

31
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:51,140
<i>He sacrificed himself
to save the Pegasus.</i>

32
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,606
<i>Garner was my decision.
His failures,
my responsibility.</i>

33
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:01,381
<i>Congratulations, Commander.
The Pegasus is your command.</i>

34
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:09,021
<i>Like I said,
you make your choices
and you live with them.</i>

35
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:12,454
<i>And in the end,
you are those choices.</i>

36
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:08,374
<i>I swear,
you're like a kid
on his first day of school.</i>

37
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,783
<i>You're gonna make me
regret having you along,
aren't you?</i>

38
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:12,856
And so I am very proud...

39
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,185
Every chance I get.

40
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,521
<i>to officially
welcome the new
commander of the Pegasus,</i>

41
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,527
Commander Lee Adama.

42
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:28,528
Thank you,
Madam President,
Admiral Adama.

43
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:33,169
Eight months ago,
the world changed.
Our lives changed forever.

44
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:35,946
<i>We found ourselves
shouldering responsibilities</i>

45
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,276
<i>we never thought we'd have.</i>

46
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:40,215
<i>Duty.</i>

47
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,714
<i>Honor.</i>

48
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,315
<i>Service.</i>

49
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:46,422
<i>They're more than words.</i>

50
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:49,651
Those are the
guiding principles for those
who serve in the military.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,491
And recently,
all have been in
short supply on this ship.

52
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,856
<i>That's gonna change
beginning today.</i>

53
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:02,035
<i>We can't always choose
our circumstances, but we can
choose how we handle them.</i>

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,900
I intend to give you my all.
I expect nothing
less in return.

55
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,373
<i>I've already
appointed Kara Thrace
as my acting CAG.</i>

56
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,950
<i>I'll be making other
officer and duty assignments</i>

57
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,645
<i>in the coming days,
as I review your...</i>

58
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:28,631
The more things
change, the more they stay
the same, huh, Gus?

59
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:29,824
Yeah.

60
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:43,372
Come in.

61
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:50,142
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw,
reporting as ordered, sir.

62
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,013
At ease, Lieutenant.
Have a seat.

63
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,848
<i>No, thank you.
Frankly, I'm used to
standing in this room.</i>

64
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:01,516
<i>Yeah, Admiral Cain
apparently wasn't
big on chairs.</i>

65
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:04,757
Even dead,
that woman
casts a shadow.

66
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:07,886
<i>But I'm sure
I don't have to
tell you that.</i>

67
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:09,363
Sir?

68
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:13,900
<i>I've been reviewing
the fitreps for
the ship's officers,</i>

69
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:17,462
<i>and frankly
you're a puzzle.</i>

70
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,674
Top ratings from Cain,
who clearly thought
the world of you,

71
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,038
but then a whole series
of increasingly
negative reports

72
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,515
from Fisk, then Garner,
who demoted you
to kitchen duty

73
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,142
<i>for "persistent
insubordinate behavior."</i>

74
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:36,383
So the question is,
who are you?

75
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,946
Come in.

76
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,465
<i>That's your idea of
vacation reading?</i>

77
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,626
What is that?
Your idea of a hobby?

78
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,327
Yeah, it is.

79
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:50,567
<i>So have you figured out
how you're going to spend
your shore leave?</i>

80
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,241
I was thinking about maybe
going home to Tauron
to visit some friends,

81
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,576
<i>but I haven't made
any definite plans yet, no.</i>

82
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:00,947
Well, in that case,
how about spending some time
with us on Gemenon?

83
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:04,146
I know Rika
and the girls would
love to see you.

84
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,321
Come on, Helena,
you deserve a break.

85
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,950
<i>You've been going
full tilt for over
a year now.</i>

86
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:11,961
<i>Look, I've got
a repair list
as long as my arm.</i>

87
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,758
<i>Plus, our network's
gonna be down
for the retrofit,</i>

88
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,525
<i>and you know
I don't like leaving
Pegasus at the mercy</i>

89
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,294
of a bunch of
civilian contractors. So...

90
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,801
All right,
listen to your XO.
Once in a while,

91
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,565
<i>it's okay
to get off
the treadmill.</i>

92
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:29,803
I will think
about it.
Think about it.

93
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:31,772
Okay.

94
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,914
Excuse me,
could you please
point me towards...

95
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:24,177
Excuse me,
could you please show me...

96
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,281
Looking for the CIC?

97
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,784
Yes, how did you know?

98
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:32,823
<i>You've got that
"new officer needing to report
to her CO" look down cold.</i>

99
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:37,059
One of the benefits
of being a
network administrator.

100
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:41,698
This is us.
This is where you
need to be.

101
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:46,931
<i>You're a lifesaver.
Kendra Shaw.
Gina Inviere.</i>

102
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,838
<i>Inviere.
That's Old Germanese for
"resurrection," isn't it?</i>

103
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:54,301
One of the benefits
of being a lapsed
Classics major.

104
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,437
Guess you never know
when something like that
might come in handy.

105
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:58,948
<i>Welcome to Pegasus,
Lieutenant.</i>

106
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,984
Thank you.

107
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,799
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw
reporting for duty, sir.

108
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:26,004
Did you enjoy
your coffee, Lieutenant.
My coffee?

109
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,613
<i>Just say yes
so we don't get off
on the wrong foot.</i>

110
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,409
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,176
Good.

112
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:37,084
You see, because
I figured that you either
got lost on your way to CIC,

113
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,255
or you stopped
for a cup of coffee.

114
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,484
<i>And frankly,
I'd rather think it was
that cup of coffee</i>

115
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:44,187
<i>than realize my new aide
can't find her way
around a Battlestar.</i>

116
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,456
<i>Sir, I've just arrived...
I'm not finished speaking.</i>

117
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,233
<i>I know why you're here.</i>

118
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,806
<i>You're here because
you think this job
is a stepping stone</i>

119
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,400
to a still better one.

120
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:03,447
So let me guess,
you had your mother
pull some strings, and she...

121
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,880
<i>My mother's dead, sir.
She died of cancer.</i>

122
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,417
Yes, I know.
I read the papers.

123
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,451
<i>And while
I'm very sorry
for your loss,</i>

124
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,217
<i>you'd be well advised
to make that the last</i>

125
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:16,589
time you attempt
to play on
my sympathies.

126
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:20,221
<i>Between you and me,
I'm feeling a hell of a lot
sorrier for myself.</i>

127
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,794
Mr. Hoshi.
Sir?

128
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,600
Can you please direct
this lieutenant
to her quarters?

129
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:28,638
<i>HOSHl: Yes, sir.
You're dismissed.</i>

130
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,637
Lieutenant.

131
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,419
A little
midmorning snack.
Yeah.

132
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,684
<i>I'm gonna be
in my quarters.
Yes, sir.</i>

133
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:54,093
The beauty of
a network system is that
with the right pass codes,

134
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,895
you can control
just about any part
of the ship from any other.

135
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,992
<i>Of course,
the system's down right now
for the retrofit,</i>

136
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,367
<i>but in an emergency,
it's like having
unlimited backups.</i>

137
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:04,566
<i>Assuming no one hits
the wrong button.
Yeah, not on Cain's ship.</i>

138
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:05,902
Puts the fear of the Gods
into everyone,
does she?

139
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,327
Are you okay?

140
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,842
Come on, soldier, get up.
On your feet.

141
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:13,966
Hoshi! Hoshi!

142
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,481
Okay. Follow me to CIC.
Come on.

143
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,076
As soon as your men are out,
seal the hatches and
vent the compartments!

144
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:41,246
What in the hell
hit us?

145
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:42,414
From the
radiological readings,

146
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,355
looks like a
nuclear detonation,
multiple hits.

147
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,393
<i>It's the Cylons.
It has to be.</i>

148
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:49,188
<i>They've broken the armistice,
and this is part
of an all-out attack.</i>

149
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,696
But at least we
still have our power.

150
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,267
<i>Yeah, but that's about it.
Dradis is erratic,
weapons are offline,</i>

151
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:57,429
<i>same with all our computers.
We'll have to do
everything manually.</i>

152
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:19,052
I want all hatches sealed.
Docking connections severed.

153
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,803
Lieutenant,
spin up our
FTL drive.

154
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:35,239
Yes, sir.

155
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:37,839
<i>We're preparing
for an emergency jump,
everyone.</i>

156
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,739
Insert jump key.

157
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:50,154
Sir, two more nukes
heading straight for us.
Estimate 20 seconds to impact.

158
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,316
<i>FTL's spooling, sir,
but without the computer,</i>

159
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,825
<i>we can't calculate
a safe jump.</i>

160
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,952
<i>Don't bother calculating.
Just do it.</i>

161
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,499
You want to do a blind jump,
sir? We might end up
inside a sun.

162
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:02,992
Missiles closing.

163
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,593
<i>It doesn't matter
where we jump,</i>

164
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,639
just frakking do it,
Lieutenant.

165
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,075
<i>FTL's online.
Five seconds.</i>

166
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,583
Lieutenant, now!

167
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:30,126
<i>Who am I?
I'm a soldier,
as were Fisk and Garner.</i>

168
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,889
<i>Neither of those men
deserved my respect,
so they didn't get it.</i>

169
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,965
Can you be more specific?

170
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,302
Fisk was a black-market
sellout, a piece of garbage
unworthy of the uniform.

171
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,336
Garner was a
martinet who tried to
micro-manage this ship

172
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,947
like it was some
balky piece of machinery.

173
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,547
Hard to dispute
either assessment.
And what about me?

174
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,084
<i>Don't hold back
just because
I've got a pulse.</i>

175
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,090
<i>You're a step up,</i>

176
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,158
<i>but that doesn't change
the fact that you're
an outsider</i>

177
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,789
who was brought in
to clean up our mess.

178
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,599
Or the impression
that your daddy
just gave you a Battlestar

179
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,898
like he was tossing
you the keys
to a new car.

180
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,671
<i>You certainly don't
disappoint, Lieutenant.</i>

181
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,753
So how would you
like to be my new XO?

182
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,491
Sir?

183
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,654
<i>One thing I learned
from my father, before
he "tossed me the keys,"</i>

184
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,198
is that a commander needs
a strong right arm.

185
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,268
I also need to
send a message to this crew

186
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,861
<i>that I respect Cain's legacy,
even if the truth is
that I don't.</i>

187
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,706
<i>I'm no Cain,</i>

188
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,005
but I intend to give
this crew their pride back,

189
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,478
<i>so I'll let you
carry her torch.</i>

190
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,040
Deal?

191
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,224
<i>In that case, Major,
you're out of uniform.</i>

192
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,128
Dismissed.

193
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:41,291
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

194
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,026
six, five, four,

195
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:51,532
<i>three, two, one,
you're done.</i>

196
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,367
<i>Do you think
that weapon's ready
to fire, soldier?</i>

197
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:57,701
Yes, sir!

198
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,172
<i>You're ready
to bet your life
on that, soldier?</i>

199
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,574
The lives of
all your buddies?

200
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:04,545
Sir... Yes, sir.

201
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,646
Then fire your weapon.

202
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:14,319
Are you deaf, soldier?
I said fire your
frakking weapon.

203
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,002
Again.

204
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:43,049
<i>Didn't think it
possible that you could find
an XO meaner than Saul Tigh.</i>

205
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:46,953
<i>Yeah, she's tough,
but I think
we need it tough.</i>

206
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,388
Any ruffled feathers?

207
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,754
<i>Well, she and Kara
don't exactly get along.</i>

208
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:56,154
Like to sell tickets
to that dance.

209
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:01,066
<i>Just remember
that an XO's
not a blunt instrument.</i>

210
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:06,038
The two of you have to
make up a team.
That takes trust.

211
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:08,803
Oh, we trust
each other to do
our jobs.

212
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,443
<i>Guess that's a start.</i>

213
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:17,411
Now that your house
is in order,
I have a mission for you.

214
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:23,483
Against my better judgment,
I let a science team take
a Raptor from us

215
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:28,231
<i>to go out to study
a supernova remnant.
They're overdue.</i>

216
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,258
I want you to
track their course,
see what you turn up.

217
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,870
There are three civilians,
two pilots.

218
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,936
And if we
run into the Cylons?

219
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,276
<i>It's a search
and rescue mission.</i>

220
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,980
<i>Don't get into a battle
that you don't want to fight.</i>

221
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:51,077
That being said,
use your own judgment.
This is your command.

222
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:07,927
<i>Nothing to the right of me,
nothing to the left of me.</i>

223
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,406
<i>Feel like I'm drowning
in nothing out here.</i>

224
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:13,442
<i>Come on, Showboat, sing out.
Let me know I got company.</i>

225
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:18,606
<i>Sing out, Cap? What?
You mean like a song?</i>

226
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:21,206
<i>How about 99
Bottles of Ambrosia?</i>

227
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:26,017
<i>Damn, Showboat,
you're taking me back.
Road trips.</i>

228
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,527
Thank you.

229
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:42,461
Pass me
the circuit board.
Here you go.

230
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,441
The sickbay just
lost another two.

231
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,709
That brings
our casualty to what?

232
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,114
Seven hundred
and twenty-three.

233
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,911
<i>That's more than
a quarter of our crew.</i>

234
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:01,918
<i>What's our fighter status?</i>

235
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:04,526
Twelve Vipers destroyed,
along with two Raptors.

236
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:09,287
Another 17 ships
too badly damaged
to be repaired.

237
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,725
What else?

238
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,839
<i>Sir, we've tried to keep a lid
on what we learned
from com traffic</i>

239
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,306
before it stopped,

240
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,273
but rumors
keep leaking out.

241
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:24,179
We need facts,
not supposition.

242
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,272
<i>I agree.
We're four,
maybe five</i>

243
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,214
plotted jumps
back to the colonies.

244
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:32,452
<i>Don't imagine you want
to risk the whole ship
for a recon run.</i>

245
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:35,023
Send two Raptors.
Tell them not to
engage the enemy.

246
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,820
I want information only.

247
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:38,394
Yes, sir.

248
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:43,159
Ready to reboot nav and
defense computer systems.
Stand by.

249
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,704
Lieutenant.
Admiral.

250
00:21:57,414 --> 00:22:00,315
The helms, weapons
and FTL computers
are all back online.

251
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,612
And I think I know how
the Cylons took down
our defense grid.

252
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,519
<i>These lines of code in
the new navigation program
we're about to upload,</i>

253
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:09,248
<i>they've been designed
to create a back door
that could enable an enemy</i>

254
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,327
to wirelessly
access the program.

255
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:13,692
And that could introduce
a virus that could infect
the entire network.

256
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,091
<i>Is that what
you're saying?
Yeah.</i>

257
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,063
Luckily, ours
was already down,

258
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,032
but I suggest that
we keep it that way,

259
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:21,103
<i>even after we've
purged the program.</i>

260
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:26,204
<i>All right, Lieutenant.
It's your ball, run with it.</i>

261
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,802
<i>Maybe you're not
quite as useless
as I thought.</i>

262
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,513
How long have you
been at your station?

263
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,139
<i>I don't know, sir.
I guess I just never left.</i>

264
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:37,010
Well, you might want to
consider getting
some rack time.

265
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,281
<i>It's been two days
since the attack.</i>

266
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:41,984
Sir...

267
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:45,957
<i>Sir, I'm sorry.</i>

268
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,655
<i>I'm sorry about the way
I behaved when
the nukes hit.</i>

269
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:50,756
I was scared.

270
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,492
Actually,
I was terrified
and I froze.

271
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:57,172
<i>You're not afraid anymore,
are you, Lieutenant?</i>

272
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:58,865
No, sir.
Good.

273
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:03,137
You hold onto that anger
and you keep that close.

274
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,649
<i>It'll stop you being afraid
the next time, and it'll
tell you what you have to do.</i>

275
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,950
Lieutenant, button up.

276
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,381
This is your admiral.

277
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:29,529
I know there have been
a lot of rumors going around

278
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:34,496
<i>about the destruction
that's been visited on
our home worlds by the Cylons.</i>

279
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:39,170
<i>I would like to tell you
that they're exaggerations,</i>

280
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:44,736
<i>but, in fact,
they don't even come close
to conveying the horror</i>

281
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:47,544
<i>that has just been
unleashed upon us.</i>

282
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,751
The facts are

283
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,285
that our colonies
have been destroyed,

284
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,684
our cities have been nuked,

285
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:00,658
<i>and our fleet's gone, too.</i>

286
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:06,327
<i>So far, there are
no indications of
any other survivors.</i>

287
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:13,540
<i>I imagine
you're all asking yourselves
the same question I am.</i>

288
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,172
What do we do now?

289
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:21,850
Do we run?

290
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:25,645
Do we hide?

291
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,050
I think those are
the easy choices.

292
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,167
You know,
a philosopher once said,

293
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,935
<i>"When faced with
untenable alternatives,</i>

294
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:43,733
<i>"you should consider
your imperative."</i>

295
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:48,470
Look around you.

296
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:53,847
Our imperative
is right here,

297
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:59,444
in our bulkheads,
in our planes,
in our guns,

298
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:03,191
and in ourselves.

299
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,554
War is our imperative,

300
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:10,332
and if right now
victory seems like
an impossibility,

301
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,901
then there is something else
to reach for.

302
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,398
Revenge.

303
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:19,202
Payback.

304
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,513
So we will fight,

305
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:29,814
<i>because in the end
it's the only alternative
our enemies have left us.</i>

306
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,580
<i>I say let's make
these murdering things</i>

307
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,124
understand that
as long as this crew

308
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:40,629
and this ship survive,
that this war that they
started will not be over.

309
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:46,899
Thank you.

310
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:53,569
So say we all.

311
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,071
So say we all.
So say we all!

312
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,782
So say we all!

313
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:02,851
So say we all!

314
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,847
So say we all!

315
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:06,683
So say we all!

316
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:08,584
So say we all!

317
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:10,352
So say we all!

318
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,187
So say we all!

319
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,129
<i>So say we all!</i>

320
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:16,459
So say we all!

321
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,763
So say we all!

322
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,165
So say we all!

323
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,464
So say we all!

324
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:25,335
So say we all!

325
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,168
So say we all!

326
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:29,141
So say we all!

327
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:30,973
So say we all!

328
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,809
So say we all!

329
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,882
So say we all!

330
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,863
A com relay? That looks
more like some kind of
frakked-up can opener.

331
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,336
<i>From what we can tell,
it's guarded by about
a half dozen Raiders.</i>

332
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,373
<i>That's all? Well, they're not
expecting anyone</i>

333
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:51,411
<i>to attack it.
Gentlemen, you're looking
at our first target.</i>

334
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,170
Nice work finding it,
Lieutenant.

335
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:54,940
Thanks. I had help.

336
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,617
Speak of the devil.

337
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,415
Hello, Gina. Welcome.
Hello.

338
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet
Miss Gina Inviere.</i>

339
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:10,686
Miss Inviere and
Lieutenant Shaw have been
working very closely

340
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:14,596
upgrading our systems.
And before that, she was
supervising our retrofit.

341
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,601
<i>And I must say,
she's proven herself
invaluable in both capacities.</i>

342
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:20,763
Thank you.
Well, you certainly
set a beautiful table.

343
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,306
Thank you.

344
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,706
Everyone, please have
a seat. Please.

345
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,004
<i>I actually think
it's quite important</i>

346
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,740
<i>for our ship's officers
to get together</i>

347
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:30,372
every once in a while.

348
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:34,146
Share some food, some wine,
some good conversation.
Helps morale.

349
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:36,551
<i>And not to mention,
it's the only time
we get to park our butts</i>

350
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:38,350
in a chair around here.

351
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:42,951
<i>Now that you're all here,
I would like to take a
moment to say a few words.</i>

352
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:52,632
In all seriousness,
I said some things before
in the heat of emotion,

353
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,804
things that I felt
this crew needed to hear.

354
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,105
<i>But I don't want
any of you,
for one moment,</i>

355
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:03,181
to think that
I would ever risk
lives or resources

356
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,448
in some mad quest for revenge.

357
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:16,258
My plan is to wage an all-out
classic guerilla war campaign.

358
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:19,660
I want to find
their weak links and
I want to hit them hard.

359
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,524
As they say,
the best defense
is a good offense.

360
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:28,131
<i>Well, then,
here's to a good offense.</i>

361
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,307
And to kicking some
Cylon ass.

362
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,706
Hear, hear.

363
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,524
Almost done here.

364
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,791
<i>I don't know how
we're going to firewall
all these systems</i>

365
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,491
by tomorrow unless
we split up.

366
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:59,571
<i>And you're the only one
with the access codes.</i>

367
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:04,141
Well, we could speak
to the Admiral about raising
your security clearance.

368
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:08,880
Here I thought
we were being so discreet.

369
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:14,617
<i>Guess that's hard when
you truly care for someone.
Program's uploaded.</i>

370
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,813
You need to input your code.

371
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,259
Alpha-one-niner-six-Gamma-one.

372
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:27,762
To satisfy your curiosity,

373
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:31,530
we met a few months ago
when I presented the plans
for the retrofit.

374
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:35,534
We spent
a lot of time together
working out the details,

375
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:38,132
and I guess
one thing led to the other.

376
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:41,477
You seem so surprised.

377
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:44,808
<i>It's just that Cain
seems so self-sufficient.</i>

378
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,511
She has needs,
just like the rest of us.

379
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:51,789
No one can survive
entirely on their own.
Trust me, Lieutenant.

380
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:54,290
<i>In the end,
we're all just human.</i>

381
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,290
<i>How about
99 bottles of Ambrosia?</i>

382
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:07,065
<i>Damn, Showboat,
you're taking me back.</i>

383
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:08,366
<i>Does she ever shut up?
Road trips.</i>

384
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:09,972
Chatter like that
breeds sloppiness.

385
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,906
<i>She's gonna set
a bad example
for the other pilots.</i>

386
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:14,343
Well, as long as
she sets a good example
with her flying,

387
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:15,936
<i>we'll come out ahead.</i>

388
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:21,347
<i>HOSHl: Sir, multiple
dradis contacts.
Bearing 399, carom 620.</i>

389
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,988
Fighter size,
unknown configuration, sir.

390
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:26,624
Raiders.
Has to be.

391
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,022
We got company.

392
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:31,221
<i>Pegasus, Starbuck,
where the hell did
these guys come from?</i>

393
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,595
Starbuck, Actual.
You and Showboat
double-time back to the nest.

394
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,358
<i>On our way, Pegasus.
I don't like these odds.</i>

395
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:38,959
<i>Showboat, stay with me.</i>

396
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,197
All right,
defensive batteries,

397
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,831
selective fire only.
Watch out for our people.

398
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:45,440
Prep for jump
as soon as we recover
our birds.

399
00:31:45,544 --> 00:31:47,034
HOSHl: Aye, sir.

400
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:58,117
These ships. I...
I can almost see them.

401
00:31:58,224 --> 00:31:59,782
<i>There's something
weird about them.</i>

402
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,058
<i>Sir, shouldn't we launch
alert Vipers and engage?</i>

403
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,226
<i>That's not
why we're here, Major.</i>

404
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:11,733
Sir, we...

405
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:16,838
<i>If we spot our
missing ship,
we'll go after her.</i>

406
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:20,207
<i>Otherwise,
we jump out of here,
we report back to Galactica.</i>

407
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,876
<i>Pegasus, Starbuck,
we got ourselves
a problem out here.</i>

408
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,542
<i>Our new friends
don't wanna say goodbye.</i>

409
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:29,781
Sir, FTL crew reports
power failure in the
main navigational computer.

410
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:32,186
No, you got to be kidding.

411
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,760
<i>Let's go to emergency backup.
We need those
jump coordinates.</i>

412
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,929
<i>They're all over us.
We can't break free.</i>

413
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:48,063
Ensign, direct all batteries
to commence full auto-fire,
close range.

414
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,904
Now, Ensign.

415
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,947
<i>What the frak?
We're inside
their firing solution!</i>

416
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:02,987
<i>No frakking kidding.
All right, open up
with all you've got.</i>

417
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:04,453
<i>We're gonna
shoot ourselves a hole.</i>

418
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:05,580
<i>Is that gonna work?</i>

419
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:08,159
No, but it will
make you feel better.

420
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,828
Frak.

421
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,542
Son of a bitch.

422
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:43,188
<i>For frak's sakes,
it's like she was trying
to get us killed.</i>

423
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,559
Look, Major Shaw
has the authority
to take any actions

424
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:47,723
she feels necessary
to protect this ship.

425
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,802
<i>She's a loose cannon.
And she's also the XO.</i>

426
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:54,636
And frankly,
ordering that barrage
probably saved your skin.

427
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:56,798
<i>Forgive me
if I don't say thanks.</i>

428
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,844
<i>Oh, come on, Kara. Just...
Don't.</i>

429
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,479
You wanna tell me
what the hell
you were thinking?

430
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:07,715
That was a nice bit
of flying up there,
Captain,

431
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,254
<i>but I'd think twice
about questioning
my tactical orders.</i>

432
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:11,516
<i>"Tactical orders"?</i>

433
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:14,558
<i>That's what you call
blowing the crap
out of your own pilots?</i>

434
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:18,854
Questioning orders
is a bad idea
on this ship, Captain.

435
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:24,693
How many Raiders, Lieutenant?

436
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:26,361
<i>I'm reading 12
signatures, sir.</i>

437
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:28,565
<i>It's more than we anticipated,</i>

438
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:32,576
but one squadron should be
able to handle them
and destroy the target.

439
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,478
Launch Blue Squadron.

440
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,450
Sir, new contacts.

441
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:44,681
What the hell?

442
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,087
<i>There's a lot of jamming
going on out there,</i>

443
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:48,523
<i>but I'm reading
15 full squadrons
of Raiders, sir.</i>

444
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:52,393
They must have
jumped in right after
we launched our fighters.

445
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:55,593
<i>This isn't a com relay.
This is a staging ground.</i>

446
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:58,397
Recall the Vipers,
sir? Sir?

447
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,606
Two minutes to contact.

448
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,874
Admiral, the Cylons
knew we were coming.

449
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,915
We have to recover the Vipers
and jump out of here
while we still can.

450
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:13,883
No.
Scramble the reserves.

451
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:16,721
Order them to provide cover
while Blue attacks the target.

452
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:18,119
<i>They'll be outnumbered
four to one!</i>

453
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,851
Sir, a squadron of Raiders
is breaking off
and are now inbound.

454
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,052
Activate defensive batteries.

455
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:27,357
<i>They aren't responding, sir.
The network's locked us out
of our weapons grid.</i>

456
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,661
Then have gun crews
assume manual control.

457
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,793
<i>Admiral,
we're hugely outnumbered,</i>

458
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:33,963
<i>and now our own weapons
grid won't respond.</i>

459
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:36,434
What more proof do we need
that this is a trap?

460
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,375
<i>All the more reason
to launch everything
we've got.</i>

461
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:49,220
<i>Helena, this is exactly
what you said we wouldn't do.</i>

462
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:50,717
Even if we succeed,

463
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:53,792
is this relay
really worth the lives
and planes it will cost?

464
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:58,025
Mr. Belzen, are you refusing
to carry out my orders?

465
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,293
Sir, I cannot
in good conscience obey them.

466
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:10,766
Mr. Belzen,
give me your sidearm.

467
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:11,466
Sir?

468
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,169
I said give me
your sidearm. Now!

469
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:37,198
Gods.

470
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:44,700
Colonel Fisk. Colonel Fisk!

471
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,112
You are now my XO.

472
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,352
My order still stands.
Will you execute it?

473
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:05,388
This is the XO.

474
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:07,759
Launch all
remaining squadrons.

475
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:09,563
Clear the tube.
Stand by for launch.

476
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:28,078
Sir, the controls on
portside airlocks four, 10
and 12 have gone active.

477
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:30,209
<i>We're being boarded
by the Cylons.</i>

478
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,653
Colonel, fire up
the fast response teams.

479
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:34,951
All hands, repel boarders...

480
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,583
Lieutenant,
get to secondary
damage control.

481
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:39,025
<i>They're gonna try
and vent our air and kill us</i>

482
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:40,153
before we have
a chance to fight back.

483
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,924
Yes, sir.

484
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:08,890
Go.

485
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:19,996
<i>They were coming this way,
killing everyone. It's...</i>

486
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,263
<i>Go to CIC.
You'll be safe.</i>

487
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,130
What the frak?

488
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,886
You! Step away
from the Admiral.

489
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:20,018
Lieutenant.

490
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:23,030
I said step away
from the Admiral. Now.

491
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,365
You two take her
into custody.

492
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,492
Belay that.
Lieutenant, what
the hell is going on?

493
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,127
She was just
helping us get control
of our weapons grid.

494
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:32,264
<i>No, she wasn't, sir.
She's a Cylon spy.
They look like us.</i>

495
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:34,239
<i>Oh, for Gods' sake.</i>

496
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:40,341
Mr. Hoshi, can you
please show us the security
feed from airlock four?

497
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:44,074
<i>This is crazy.
I don't know what
she thought she saw...</i>

498
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,256
My Gods.

499
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:54,954
Get that thing
off my bridge.

500
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,258
Yes, sir.

501
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:16,684
Hey! Hey!
Act like officers,
Gods damn it.

502
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:19,015
You got everybody
watching you
on this deck.

503
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,328
Where the hell
did they come from?

504
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,902
<i>Been a long time
since I've seen
one of these outside a museum.</i>

505
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,408
And you say
the entire fleet
jumped you?

506
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,531
They came out of nowhere.

507
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,890
Why would the Cylons
resurrect a machine

508
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,862
that, by their standards,
is hopelessly obsolete?

509
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:08,197
<i>Maybe they
didn't resurrect it.</i>

510
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,837
Maybe they were
out here all along.

511
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,873
You have something
you want to tell us?

512
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:21,447
There are references in our
databases to a force of
Centurions called Guardians.

513
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:24,149
Early models like this
that somehow escaped
being scrapped.

514
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,547
What did these
Guardians guard?

515
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,313
A hybrid.

516
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,245
An entity that represents
the first step
in our evolution

517
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:33,348
from pure machines
to organic beings.

518
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,827
From them to us.
A Cylon missing link?

519
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,493
No, more like an
evolutionary dead end.

520
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,895
There were other
hybrids created
to control our base ships

521
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:48,201
before the experiment
was abandoned,
but this one was the first.

522
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:52,271
<i>And some think
it's still alive,</i>

523
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:55,609
protected by these Guardians.

524
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:59,212
<i>And that it's still
somehow seeking
its own way to evolve.</i>

525
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,382
The last operation
of the war,

526
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:09,751
<i>Galactica was part
of a task force that
destroyed a Cylon base.</i>

527
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:16,464
I was on that mission.
The Cylons were supposedly
building a super weapon.

528
00:43:55,517 --> 00:44:00,386
<i>All this has happened
before and it will
happen again.</i>

529
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,546
Someone in there?

530
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:38,382
Help. Help us.
They left us here.

531
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,485
<i>Don't leave us here, please.</i>

532
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,756
<i>I'm gonna get you
out of there.</i>

533
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:46,561
<i>We're civilians.</i>

534
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,603
The traders from...
From Gemenon, who...

535
00:44:51,104 --> 00:44:55,165
They jumped our convoy,
they destroyed our escort,
they took us all prisoner.

536
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,711
<i>There were 50 of us,
but they've been taking us
away, one by one.</i>

537
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,809
<i>We'd hear
the others screaming.</i>

538
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,378
<i>We didn't know what
was happening to them.</i>

539
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:06,645
<i>Please, you've got to
get us out of here.</i>

540
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:11,554
<i>I'm trying.
The door must be welded shut.</i>

541
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:18,796
Feels like a quake.

542
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,233
The place is starting
to come apart.

543
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,697
<i>I can't.</i>

544
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,570
I got it.

545
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:38,674
<i>It's still stuck.
I can't open it any wider.</i>

546
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:48,093
You got to go. You got to go.
You got to go get help.

547
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:49,719
<i>I'll stay here.
I'll stay here with you.</i>

548
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,958
<i>No, you can't do it
by yourself. Just go!
Tell them what happened to us.</i>

549
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:57,503
<i>Our ship was
the Diana from Gemenon.
All right, just tell them.</i>

550
00:45:57,604 --> 00:46:01,631
<i>If you stay here,
you'll be trapped like us. Go!</i>

551
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:03,242
<i>Don't...</i>

552
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:13,252
Go, go! Save yourself. Go!

553
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,573
<i>Galactica, Husker.</i>

554
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,342
<i>Galactica,
this is Husker.
Do you copy?</i>

555
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,919
<i>Husker, roger that.
Report status.</i>

556
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,956
I crashed on the surface.
They were making
something down here.

557
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,891
Experimenting
on people to do it.

558
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:55,985
<i>And now they're getting away
with whatever they built.</i>

559
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:59,691
<i>Husker. Husker,
the war is over.</i>

560
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:01,926
What?

561
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,303
<i>Galactica, repeat.</i>

562
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,567
<i>The war is over.
An armistice was just signed.</i>

563
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:11,041
<i>Activate your beacon
and we'll send you
the SAR bird.</i>

564
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,771
<i>Husker, respond.</i>

565
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:18,712
They escaped with it,
right before
they signed the Armistice.

566
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:24,486
<i>If this hybrid still exists,
and it's captured
some of our people...</i>

567
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,288
<i>I don't want to
think about it.</i>

568
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:31,298
<i>Baltar and Tyrol
were able to pull
the Raiders' computer</i>

569
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:36,734
<i>Baltar and Tyrol
were able to pull
the Raiders' computer</i>

570
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:38,769
<i>and download
the ship's navigational data</i>

571
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,202
and extrapolate
a possible location

572
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:44,275
<i>for a base,
but it's more likely
a base ship.</i>

573
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,343
<i>That's where we'll find
our Raptor crew.</i>

574
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:49,174
<i>It's two, maybe three jumps
from where you were attacked.</i>

575
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,804
I was just telling
the Commander

576
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,406
<i>that we can't afford
to commit both Battlestars.</i>

577
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:57,454
<i>Which is why I'm temporarily
transferring my flag
to Pegasus.</i>

578
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:01,024
<i>You're going along?
You're still in command.</i>

579
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:04,584
<i>Let's just say
I have a personal stake
in this mission.</i>

580
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:08,722
A mission based
on a Cylon legend.

581
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,858
<i>It's not a legend, Son.</i>

582
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:16,040
I was in the place
where they made that thing.

583
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:19,206
I saw what
they did to make it.

584
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:24,775
<i>We're not going to
let this happen again,
not to our own people.</i>

585
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,150
<i>Well, I'll... I'll have my XO
start preparing
an attack plan.</i>

586
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:37,417
<i>I'm afraid that brings up
another matter, Commander.</i>

587
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:48,234
<i>Misdirection is the key.
Pegasus jumps right into
the hornet's nest.</i>

588
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:52,639
<i>They swarm us with their
Raiders, we let them think
they've taken out our FTL,</i>

589
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:56,236
before moving off
at sub-light speed,
drawing them away.

590
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:59,506
<i>That's when my
strike team jumps in.</i>

591
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:06,886
<i>It's a hell of a risky plan,
but I guess you know that.</i>

592
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:08,549
<i>Just remember
it's search and rescue.</i>

593
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,323
Get aboard, find our people,
set your nuke, then get back
in one piece.

594
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,499
<i>Who's piloting the Raptor?
Captain Thrace.</i>

595
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:19,432
No other pilot
I can trust
to pull this off.

596
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:23,297
Well, then I guess
the question is
whether I can trust you.

597
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,376
The President believes
that under Admiral Cain

598
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,034
you were involved
In an incident

599
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:30,205
aboard a civilian transport
called Scylla.

600
00:49:30,548 --> 00:49:33,949
An incident in which 10 people
were executed. Is it true?

601
00:49:47,098 --> 00:49:48,588
I said is it true?

602
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,101
<i>I was there.
I'm guessing
that's enough to indict me.</i>

603
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:56,369
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

604
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:59,568
<i>You said you wanted
to send a message
to this ship's crew</i>

605
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:03,612
<i>about respecting
Cain's legacy. I am
Cain's legacy.</i>

606
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:07,249
<i>I'm alive because
of the choices she made,</i>

607
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,650
and so is everyone else
on this ship.

608
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:11,520
<i>I'll tell you something else,</i>

609
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:14,251
<i>Cain wouldn't have
blinked twice at this plan.</i>

610
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,190
<i>'Cause she knew
that you don't win battles,</i>

611
00:50:16,294 --> 00:50:18,660
never mind wars,
without risking lives.

612
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:21,324
Are you finished?

613
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:25,125
<i>Yes, sir.
If you'd like my resignation,
you can have it.</i>

614
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:28,497
<i>It'd be easier,
wouldn't it?</i>

615
00:50:29,607 --> 00:50:32,508
Then you could go back
to peeling potatoes
and wallowing in self-pity

616
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,544
<i>'cause poor Kendra Shaw's
the only officer in the Fleet</i>

617
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:37,046
who ever had to
make a hard call.

618
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:40,940
<i>Well, it's not gonna fly,
Major. Not while
I'm in command.</i>

619
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:45,445
<i>Plan's risky, but right now
you're the only game in town.</i>

620
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:49,291
So complete
your mission, Major.

621
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:51,659
<i>Your plan's approved.</i>

622
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,849
<i>got
another load of solid waste
stinking up our cargo hold.</i>

623
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:12,781
<i>got
another load of solid waste
stinking up our cargo hold.</i>

624
00:51:12,884 --> 00:51:15,478
<i>Demetrius, this is Adriatic...</i>

625
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,949
<i>... and we're back with
Gaius Baltar.</i>

626
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:21,787
<i>Doctor, a lot of people
once thought of Pegasus
as the answer to prayer.</i>

627
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,190
<i>Were they wrong?</i>

628
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,169
Final casualty
report lists 816 dead,
121 injured.

629
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:41,609
Thirty-two Vipers destroyed,
61 badly damaged.

630
00:51:41,713 --> 00:51:45,649
<i>The acting chief says
we don't have enough parts
to repair them all.</i>

631
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,083
<i>It's a rather high price
for a tactically
insignificant victory.</i>

632
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:53,453
<i>I wouldn't say it's
insignificant, sir. I'd say
we put the enemy on notice.</i>

633
00:51:53,558 --> 00:51:55,856
The price
we paid is my fault.

634
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:58,051
How do you figure that,
Lieutenant?

635
00:51:58,196 --> 00:52:00,687
Well, I gave her...
It my access codes.

636
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:04,157
<i>It must've used them
to override our
security lockouts.</i>

637
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:07,499
You gave it something
far more important than that.

638
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,307
You gave it your trust,
as did I.

639
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:15,573
But this thing
really knows how to
manipulate human emotion.

640
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:17,947
Preys on them.

641
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:24,748
Lieutenant Thorne.

642
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:32,321
I want you to interrogate
our Cylon prisoner. Find out
everything it knows.

643
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:38,299
<i>And since it's so adept
at mimicking human feeling,</i>

644
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:42,537
<i>I'm assuming that
its software is vulnerable
to them as well.</i>

645
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:46,067
So, pain. Yes, of course.

646
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:54,416
Degradation,
fear, shame.

647
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:58,086
I want you to really
test its limits.

648
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:01,486
Be as creative
as you feel you need to be.

649
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,617
Yes, sir.

650
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:07,196
<i>Lieutenant Thorne.
Access granted.</i>

651
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,433
<i>Admiral Cain to CIC.
Admiral Cain to CIC.</i>

652
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:24,714
Lieutenant, come with me.

653
00:53:34,592 --> 00:53:35,786
Colonel, sitrep.

654
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:40,330
We just detected a fleet
of ships broadcasting
Colonial IFF signatures.

655
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:44,461
<i>Sir, they're civilians.</i>

656
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:47,231
A civilian fleet?

657
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,069
Fifteen ships, sir.
The Cap has
gone ahead to intercept.

658
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:01,074
<i>Lieutenant,
I want you to contact
those ships' captains.</i>

659
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:03,346
Ask them to
forward their crew
and passenger manifests,

660
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:05,354
<i>along with the
ships' schematics</i>

661
00:54:05,456 --> 00:54:07,185
and inventories
of any weapons
and spare parts.

662
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,553
Yes, sir.

663
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:14,062
Colonel, I want you
to assemble teams
of engineers and Marines,

664
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:16,861
and have them board
each of those ships.

665
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:20,000
Sir, are we...

666
00:54:20,104 --> 00:54:23,437
<i>We're gonna take
everything we need
from those ships.</i>

667
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:26,006
<i>Once they realize our intent,
there's bound
to be resistance.</i>

668
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,908
So we need to act
quickly and decisively.

669
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:36,116
Colonel, if you have a problem
with any of this,
I need to hear it now.

670
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:40,580
No.
Get to work.

671
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:13,752
Permission to come aboard.

672
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:16,088
Permission granted.
Welcome.

673
00:55:16,394 --> 00:55:17,952
<i>We've prayed for
this miracle.</i>

674
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:20,428
The last time
the Cylons found us,
we lost four ships.

675
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:22,294
<i>But now,
thank the Gods,
you've found us.</i>

676
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,892
Mr. Laird,
Admiral Cain ordered me
to give you this.

677
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:31,339
<i>What is it?
It's a list of materials
and passengers</i>

678
00:55:31,442 --> 00:55:34,639
<i>that we need
transferred to the Pegasus,
effective immediately.</i>

679
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:36,736
Your name
is on the list.

680
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:40,278
My name?

681
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:45,454
<i>Wait, you want to take
our FTL drives?
We'll be helpless.</i>

682
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:49,749
<i>As I said, we're adding
some of your people
to our crew.</i>

683
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:55,755
<i>So you're going to
decide just like that
who lives and who dies?</i>

684
00:55:55,866 --> 00:56:00,166
<i>We'll make whatever
accommodations we can,
but you have to understand.</i>

685
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,332
We are at war.
Military needs
must take priority.

686
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,541
<i>No. I don't
understand. They're...</i>

687
00:56:10,214 --> 00:56:14,617
<i>They're going to take
what they want and leave us
to fend for ourselves.</i>

688
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:19,152
<i>You can't do that.
Can't do it.</i>

689
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:20,550
No!

690
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:22,819
Listen, all of you!

691
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:29,597
We have orders to transfer
the crewmen and the equipment

692
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,759
<i>on that list to Pegasus.</i>

693
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,362
We have no wish
to harm anyone,

694
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:37,566
but we will use
force if necessary.

695
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:39,943
No.

696
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,068
Leave us here.

697
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:42,543
Go back
where you came from.

698
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:43,705
No.

699
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:51,211
<i>Keep them back.
You're here to help us.</i>

700
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:53,450
<i>You can't do that.</i>

701
00:57:14,845 --> 00:57:16,836
<i>Ship-to-ship call
from Colonel Fisk.</i>

702
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:20,110
<i>What's going on,
Colonel? You're already
behind schedule.</i>

703
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:23,345
<i>Sir, they're denying us access
to the rest of the ship.</i>

704
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:27,652
<i>We're not dealing with
just individuals, sir.
We have whole families here.</i>

705
00:57:32,396 --> 00:57:37,095
<i>Then tell them you will shoot
the families of any selectee
who doesn't comply.</i>

706
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:42,999
<i>Sir, did I hear you correctly?
You don't seriously mean...</i>

707
00:57:43,107 --> 00:57:45,098
Just get it done, Colonel.

708
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:51,811
Corporal.
Sir.

709
00:57:53,117 --> 00:57:55,745
Get these people on the deck
and get them lined up.

710
00:57:55,853 --> 00:57:56,842
Yes, sir.

711
00:57:59,857 --> 00:58:02,223
My boy! No, not my boy!

712
00:58:02,326 --> 00:58:05,853
We have orders
to shoot the families

713
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:09,899
of any selectee who refuses
to return with us.

714
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,969
We will carry out this order

715
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,801
unless those individuals
are brought forward now!

716
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,436
<i>You're supposed to protect us!</i>

717
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:25,004
I repeat. We will
carry out this order.
We will shoot these people.

718
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:30,286
What are we doing, sir? Sir?

719
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:43,660
<i>Colonel Fisk to Pegasus.</i>

720
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:47,261
<i>Colonel Fisk to Pegasus.</i>

721
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,934
My son!

722
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,377
<i>It's over.</i>

723
00:58:59,183 --> 00:59:02,277
The whole fleet has word
of what happened here.

724
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:06,256
<i>There won't be
any more resistance.</i>

725
00:59:20,534 --> 00:59:22,729
Ruin innocent people...

726
00:59:57,504 --> 01:00:00,962
<i>Rodeo 1
to Raptor three-five-niner.
Clear for docking approach.</i>

727
01:00:01,574 --> 01:00:05,408
<i>Rodeo 1 to
Raptor three-five-niner.
Clear for docking approach.</i>

728
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:08,737
<i>Galactica
to Green Leaf shuttle,</i>

729
01:00:08,848 --> 01:00:10,873
<i>you are cleared for landing.
Checkers red...</i>

730
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:33,434
<i>So the XO's
human after all.</i>

731
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,939
I used to do that myself.
Scrub through
the wireless bands.

732
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,608
<i>Reminds you
you're not alone
out here.</i>

733
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,377
Got any more?

734
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:53,990
More of what?

735
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:57,527
<i>Whatever you're about to
stick in your neck.</i>

736
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:00,890
<i>You don't miss much,
do you?</i>

737
01:01:05,236 --> 01:01:07,636
Whatever floats
your boat, right?

738
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:12,371
I came down here looking
for a loose bottle,
you came down here for...

739
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:17,240
<i>Guess we're both
just trying to take
the edge off, right?</i>

740
01:01:17,649 --> 01:01:18,877
Guess so.

741
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,450
<i>That's good,</i>

742
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,954
<i>'cause I'd hate to think
that Lee's new XO
can't handle the pressure.</i>

743
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,854
Maybe wants
to get busted back
to peeling potatoes.

744
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:31,861
<i>I'd hate to think that Lee's
favorite pilot wants to find
herself scrubbing floors</i>

745
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:33,954
for pilfering
ship stores.

746
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:41,594
<i>You keep my secret,
sir, I'll keep yours.</i>

747
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,721
<i>A confirmed report
continued</i>

748
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:16,995
<i>to attribute
President Roslin's recent
miraculous recovery from...</i>

749
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:20,453
<i>to attribute
President Roslin's recent
miraculous recovery from...</i>

750
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:23,932
<i>I've seen
officers happier
about a promotion.</i>

751
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:26,169
I am happy,
sir. I am.

752
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:29,672
<i>I guess I just don't know
what I've done
to deserve it.</i>

753
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:34,802
<i>Don't, Captain.
Don't do it.
Don't look back.</i>

754
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:43,554
Sometimes we have to
leave people behind
so that we can go on,

755
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,722
so that we can
continue to fight.

756
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:52,580
Sometimes we
have to do things

757
01:02:56,253 --> 01:02:59,051
that we never thought
we were capable of,

758
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:04,193
if only to show
the enemy our will.

759
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:08,060
Yesterday, you showed me

760
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:13,496
that you were capable
of setting aside
your fears,

761
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:15,867
setting aside
your hesitation,

762
01:03:17,374 --> 01:03:19,342
and even your revulsion.

763
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:23,371
Every natural inhibition
that, during battle,

764
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,281
can mean the difference
between life and death.

765
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:26,542
can mean the difference
between life and death.

766
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,258
When you can be this

767
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,097
for as long as you have to be,

768
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:52,402
<i>then you're a razor.</i>

769
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:11,689
This war
is forcing us all
to become razors,

770
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:14,819
<i>because if we don't,
we don't survive.</i>

771
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:22,032
<i>And then we don't
have the luxury of
becoming simply human again.</i>

772
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:24,000
Do you understand me?

773
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:31,478
Good.

774
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:38,112
Well done.
Congratulations,
Captain.

775
01:04:47,995 --> 01:04:50,225
<i>President Roslin's
recent executive order</i>

776
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:52,666
<i>outlawing abortion
led to a demonstration...</i>

777
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:52,893
<i>outlawing abortion
led to a demonstration...</i>

778
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,402
Portside hull breaches.
Deck 4, frames 12 through 14.

779
01:05:06,504 --> 01:05:09,496
Damage control crews
are sealing them off now.

780
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:13,234
<i>I'd say that's enough of that.
Get the FTL offline.</i>

781
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:16,776
Bring her around, heading
one-six-one-carom-zero.

782
01:05:16,881 --> 01:05:17,848
Sir.

783
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:25,887
<i>They're pursuing, sir.</i>

784
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,719
<i>Let's hope they keep it up.</i>

785
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:34,922
<i>Looks like
they bought it. Now let's go
get our Raptor crew.</i>

786
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:39,966
Maybe this will be easier
than we thought.

787
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:44,537
Guess again.
Two bandits inbound.
Showtime, people.

788
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:50,204
<i>Ready?</i>

789
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:16,471
Go, go, go!

790
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,111
Go, go, go!

791
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,387
<i>Enemy target destroyed.</i>

792
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:35,585
<i>All wings regroup and
continue pursuit of
Battlestar Pegasus.</i>

793
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:37,658
<i>By your command.</i>

794
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,690
<i>Gunny, report.</i>

795
01:06:50,403 --> 01:06:52,337
<i>Red Squad all accounted for.</i>

796
01:06:52,439 --> 01:06:55,806
<i>Speak for yourself, Sarge.
I'm still counting fingers
and toes.</i>

797
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:58,935
<i>Knock it off, Hudson.
Red Squad, form up on me.</i>

798
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:02,243
<i>Ain't it grand when
a plan comes together?</i>

799
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:06,211
<i>Red Squad, on my mark.
Fire thrusters.</i>

800
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,627
<i>Red One, Pegasus.</i>

801
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:25,205
<i>Red One, this is
Pegasus Actual. Report
mission and team status.</i>

802
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:28,674
<i>We're in. We were able
to access an airlock on
one of the radial arms.</i>

803
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:31,803
<i>Proceeding towards the core.
No contact, no casualties.</i>

804
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,381
<i>Stay frosty, kiddies.</i>

805
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,474
<i>No telling how many
of those old toasters
they left watching the house.</i>

806
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,986
<i>Shut your yap, Hudson,
maybe we won't
have to find out.</i>

807
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,920
<i>DaSilva,
what're you reading
on thermals?</i>

808
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:46,222
<i>One heat source,
could be biological,
near the core, but that's all.</i>

809
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,326
<i>Wait. I'm picking up
three more signatures.</i>

810
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:53,993
<i>Two of them are pretty weak,
but they're coming from
about 30 meters ahead.</i>

811
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,765
<i>Could be our people.
Gunny, take point.</i>

812
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Holy frak!

813
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:24,462
Get'em out of there!
Go, go, go!

814
01:08:29,535 --> 01:08:30,729
Help us.

815
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:34,732
Get him out of there! Come on!

816
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,967
Help us.

817
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:31,102
Cylons!

818
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:42,773
Everybody out! Get out!

819
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:44,810
<i>This way. Let's go.</i>

820
01:08:52,124 --> 01:08:53,751
Come on. Go!
Come on.

821
01:08:57,796 --> 01:08:58,763
Come on!

822
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:04,360
<i>Man down!
They got DaSilva!
They got DaSilva!</i>

823
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:25,681
No!

824
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:46,102
<i>Pegasus, Red Two.
Come in Pegasus.</i>

825
01:09:47,011 --> 01:09:48,911
Copy, Red Two,
but your signal is weak.

826
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:53,848
<i>We've recovered two civilians.
One dead, two wounded,
including the XO.</i>

827
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:58,350
<i>We're pinned down,
taking heavy fire.
Mission outcome doubtful.</i>

828
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:05,261
<i>Pegasus, Red Two.
Report, Pegasus.
Pegasus.</i>

829
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:07,086
Frak!

830
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,996
Captain, sitrep!

831
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:14,128
We just lost communications.
The Cylons must be jamming.

832
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:15,933
What about the nuke?

833
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,634
<i>How's that detonator
coming, Mathias?</i>

834
01:10:19,544 --> 01:10:22,342
<i>The detonator's fried.
Get it working.</i>

835
01:10:31,589 --> 01:10:33,819
You want to tell me
what the hell
that was with DaSilva?

836
01:10:33,925 --> 01:10:36,758
<i>Can't let them take
any more prisoners,
Captain.</i>

837
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:38,756
You saw what they
were doing in there.

838
01:10:38,863 --> 01:10:40,262
Yeah, I saw.

839
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:43,496
Keep trying to
resume communications
with Red Two.

840
01:10:43,601 --> 01:10:44,898
Yes, sir.

841
01:10:46,504 --> 01:10:47,801
Mr. Hoshi,

842
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:54,209
order nuclear
ship-to-ship missile
into launch tube 3.

843
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:55,643
Aye, sir.

844
01:10:55,747 --> 01:10:57,374
This is a
nuclear mission order.

845
01:10:57,482 --> 01:10:59,973
Load ship-to-ship missile
into launch tube 3.

846
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:01,776
<i>What're you doing?</i>

847
01:11:01,886 --> 01:11:04,320
<i>They've been
compromised. We can't
regain communications.</i>

848
01:11:04,422 --> 01:11:06,447
<i>We have to assume
that the team's been lost.</i>

849
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:08,718
We have to
give them a chance.

850
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:16,191
HOSHl: Commander Adama.
Open launch tube doors.

851
01:11:16,768 --> 01:11:18,099
Open launch tube doors.

852
01:11:20,538 --> 01:11:22,802
Major? Major?

853
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:25,034
Watch those corridors, Hudson.

854
01:11:25,143 --> 01:11:27,077
<i>Pegasus, Red Two, come in.</i>

855
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:35,877
Destroying that ship
with people on board
is the last resort.

856
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:38,512
Like it or not, Admiral,
this is no longer
a rescue mission.

857
01:11:38,623 --> 01:11:41,854
<i>Gods only know what will
happen to our people
if they're captured.</i>

858
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,656
I know what
will happen.
I was there.

859
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:47,688
HOSHl: Missile loaded,
Commander.

860
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,967
Release of nuclear weapons
is authorized.

861
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:54,732
Disable launch and
warhead safeties.

862
01:11:54,839 --> 01:11:58,468
Mr. Hoshi,
take your launch key,
put it in the firing lock.

863
01:11:58,576 --> 01:12:00,441
Aye, sir.
Belay that order.

864
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:04,172
<i>I'm not prepared
to sacrifice any lives.
Not yet.</i>

865
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:05,416
<i>If you're wrong?</i>

866
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,881
<i>Then I'll have to
live with it.</i>

867
01:12:14,592 --> 01:12:18,688
You said it yourself,
Admiral. That thing
may be headed toward Earth.

868
01:12:18,796 --> 01:12:22,596
If it jumps away,
then we lose our only hope
of taking it out.

869
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:28,365
<i>HOSHl: Sir, jamming's
clearing. I'm receiving a
transmission from Red Two.</i>

870
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:29,872
Put it through on speakers.

871
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:30,998
Aye, sir.

872
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:32,474
Launch evac Raptor.

873
01:12:32,577 --> 01:12:34,943
<i>Pegasus,
this is Red Two. Come in.</i>

874
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,507
<i>Pegasus, this is Red Two.
Come in.</i>

875
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:44,247
<i>Yes. Red Two,
this is Pegasus Actual.
Starbuck, report.</i>

876
01:12:44,355 --> 01:12:47,791
<i>Still pinned down,
but holding on. Tell me
there's a ride waiting for us.</i>

877
01:12:48,526 --> 01:12:50,323
On their way, Red Two.

878
01:12:51,262 --> 01:12:52,889
And the Raiders have
broken off their attack.

879
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:54,931
<i>They'll be headed towards
your coordinates
any second now.</i>

880
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:57,968
<i>Roger that.
Means we're
running out of time.</i>

881
01:13:02,974 --> 01:13:04,100
<i>Evac Raptor's on its way.</i>

882
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:05,971
They want us to set the nuke
and get the hell out.

883
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:09,205
<i>That's gonna be a problem.
Remote detonator's
definitely shot.</i>

884
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:11,239
Can you rig a manual trigger?

885
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:13,249
Probably.
Then do it.

886
01:13:13,618 --> 01:13:16,382
Do it? What the hell
are you talking about?

887
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:19,820
We are completing
this mission.
Am I clear, soldier?

888
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:23,254
Yes, sir.

889
01:13:23,995 --> 01:13:27,089
<i>Red Team, Pegasus.
Evac ETA two minutes.</i>

890
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,098
This is Red Two.
Give me Actual.

891
01:13:32,737 --> 01:13:35,171
<i>Red Two, this is Actual.
What's taking you so long?</i>

892
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:36,968
<i>Starbuck,
they're gonna be
on you any second now.</i>

893
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:39,043
<i>Our nuke's
remote detonator
is still fried.</i>

894
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:41,338
<i>We're gonna have to
cook it off by hand.</i>

895
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:44,643
<i>Red One is still down
for the count, which
doesn't give us many options.</i>

896
01:13:45,516 --> 01:13:47,507
What are your orders, sir?

897
01:13:49,487 --> 01:13:51,955
We still got a missile
in the tube.

898
01:13:52,056 --> 01:13:55,958
That evac bird gets them off
that ship, we can still fire
this thing off. Mr. Hoshi...

899
01:13:56,294 --> 01:13:59,559
The Raiders are
in their air
defense position.

900
01:13:59,664 --> 01:14:02,724
<i>We launch anything,
they're gonna intercept it.</i>

901
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:07,503
Then we have to leave
someone behind,
arm the warhead manually.

902
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:09,439
<i>That's right.</i>

903
01:14:14,112 --> 01:14:18,014
This is your team, Son.
You make the call.

904
01:14:29,227 --> 01:14:30,990
<i>Red Two,
this is Pegasus Actual.</i>

905
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:34,496
Get the XO,
get your men and get
to the evac coordinates.

906
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:39,093
<i>Secure your men,
then detonate the warhead
using the manual trigger.</i>

907
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:42,171
Complete your
mission, Captain.

908
01:14:44,575 --> 01:14:47,806
Understood.
Sergeant, get ready
to move out.

909
01:14:47,912 --> 01:14:49,379
Sir.
Toasters are bugged out.

910
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,074
<i>I'm gonna get you
on your feet. I'm gonna
get you out of here.</i>

911
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:59,355
<i>Come on, everybody,
move inside! Let's go!</i>

912
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:01,186
Get your suits on.

913
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,260
Come on! Go, go, go!

914
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:12,096
<i>You, too, Major.
Let's get...</i>

915
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:17,530
<i>You, too, Captain.
Leave the nuke
if you don't mind.</i>

916
01:15:18,342 --> 01:15:20,401
What the frak are you doing?

917
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:22,813
Completing the mission.

918
01:15:23,915 --> 01:15:27,112
<i>Take it. I don't
need it anymore.</i>

919
01:15:27,385 --> 01:15:28,682
Major...

920
01:15:29,287 --> 01:15:31,619
I just gave you
an order, soldier.

921
01:15:31,722 --> 01:15:35,920
Unless you wanna die,
I suggest you obey. Go.

922
01:15:49,707 --> 01:15:52,608
Why?
You know damn well why.

923
01:15:54,445 --> 01:15:57,608
<i>Put on your suit,
you're about to
run out of air.</i>

924
01:16:11,028 --> 01:16:13,189
<i>It's been an honor,
Captain.</i>

925
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:47,404
All this has happened before,
and will happen again.

926
01:16:54,404 --> 01:16:58,306
<i>Come in, Major.
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.</i>

927
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:10,212
<i>You're what all this is about,
aren't you? What are you?</i>

928
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:13,046
What am I? A man?

929
01:17:14,124 --> 01:17:15,751
Or am I a machine?

930
01:17:19,496 --> 01:17:22,431
My children believe
I am a God.

931
01:17:24,401 --> 01:17:27,063
Are you a God?

932
01:17:27,337 --> 01:17:32,604
I have seen things.
Your life, Kendra Shaw.

933
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:36,975
The things you have done.
Things you felt you had to do.

934
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,810
All leading to this moment.

935
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,410
Do you wish
to be forgiven,
my child?

936
01:17:45,889 --> 01:17:52,556
I repeat. We will
carry out this order.
We will shoot these people.

937
01:17:55,098 --> 01:17:57,623
What are we doing, sir? Sir?

938
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:50,343
<i>Do you wish to be forgiven?</i>

939
01:18:55,825 --> 01:18:56,883
Yes.

940
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:01,060
<i>Then come closer.
There's something
I have to tell you.</i>

941
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:05,025
Come.

942
01:19:22,552 --> 01:19:26,488
Kara Thrace will lead
the human race to its end.

943
01:19:28,258 --> 01:19:29,247
What?

944
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:34,023
She is the
herald of the Apocalypse,
the harbinger of death.

945
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,564
They must not follow her.

946
01:19:42,872 --> 01:19:46,501
<i>Pegasus, evac Raptor
inbound. Extraction complete.
Clear base ship.</i>

947
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,839
<i>Raptor's on its way back, sir.</i>

948
01:19:49,379 --> 01:19:52,678
They have Starbuck aboard.
Major Shaw stayed behind.

949
01:19:56,386 --> 01:19:57,683
Starbuck?

950
01:19:58,021 --> 01:20:03,118
<i>Actual, this is Red One.
Come in.</i>

951
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,490
<i>Red One,
this is Pegasus Actual.
Report.</i>

952
01:20:06,596 --> 01:20:10,760
<i>Commander, I gotta warn you.
It's Captain Thrace.</i>

953
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:14,894
Red One, report!

954
01:20:15,004 --> 01:20:16,369
<i>HOSHl:
They're jamming us
again, sir.</i>

955
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:19,442
Red One, this is Actual.
Come in.
HOSHl: We lost her.

956
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:30,613
Actual, come in.

957
01:20:31,888 --> 01:20:33,048
Actual.

958
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:38,992
As my own existence
comes to a close,

959
01:20:39,996 --> 01:20:43,693
only to begin anew
in ways uncertain.

960
01:20:48,872 --> 01:20:51,500
<i>You're scared,
aren't you, motherfrakker?</i>

961
01:20:55,178 --> 01:20:56,645
You should be.

962
01:20:57,113 --> 01:21:01,277
All this has happened before
and will happen again.

963
01:21:02,318 --> 01:21:04,718
Again. Again.

964
01:21:05,688 --> 01:21:07,883
Again. Again.

965
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:12,522
Again. Again. Again.

966
01:21:13,363 --> 01:21:16,059
Again. Again.

967
01:22:04,176 --> 01:22:06,542
You wanted to see me, Admiral?

968
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:09,076
Thank you for coming in.

969
01:22:10,348 --> 01:22:12,816
Starbuck was here
a little earlier.

970
01:22:15,087 --> 01:22:18,955
<i>She's recommended
Major Shaw for
a posthumous commendation.</i>

971
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:23,252
<i>She wasn't looking for medals.
No, she wasn't.</i>

972
01:22:25,063 --> 01:22:27,827
<i>But I've been
going through Cain's logs,</i>

973
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:29,628
and from a
tactical perspective,

974
01:22:29,735 --> 01:22:32,602
<i>it's hard to find fault
in anything that she did</i>

975
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:34,769
or that Kendra did.

976
01:22:34,873 --> 01:22:37,535
They butchered
innocent civilians, Dad.

977
01:22:40,812 --> 01:22:43,610
Come on. How can you
ignore that?

978
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:48,547
<i>I know that I didn't
have to face any of the
situations that she did.</i>

979
01:22:48,653 --> 01:22:53,386
I had the President in my face
arguing for the survival
of the civilian fleet.

980
01:22:54,426 --> 01:22:57,987
I have Colonel Tigh
keeping me honest

981
01:22:58,096 --> 01:23:01,588
and balancing my morality
and my tactics,
and I had you.

982
01:23:02,968 --> 01:23:07,962
<i>Now, you don't have
any children, so you might
not understand this,</i>

983
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,975
but you see yourself
reflected in their eyes.

984
01:23:12,844 --> 01:23:16,803
And there are some things
that I thought of doing
with this fleet,

985
01:23:18,683 --> 01:23:23,382
<i>but I stopped myself because
I knew that I'd have to face
you the following day.</i>

986
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:32,156
<i>If you hadn't been in CIC,</i>

987
01:23:34,032 --> 01:23:36,432
<i>I would've
ordered that strike.</i>

988
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:39,800
Kara would be dead,
so would the rest of the team.

989
01:23:39,905 --> 01:23:42,772
You did nothing wrong,
neither did I.

990
01:23:44,743 --> 01:23:48,736
We both made decisions
that we had to,
to accomplish our missions.

991
01:23:49,014 --> 01:23:50,072
Yeah.

992
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:55,045
Cain, Kendra.

993
01:23:57,489 --> 01:23:59,047
Were they wrong?

994
01:24:00,192 --> 01:24:04,720
<i>Well, if I believed
in the Gods, I'd say they'd be
judged by a higher power.</i>

995
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:07,990
<i>But since you don't believe?</i>

996
01:24:09,668 --> 01:24:12,694
Then history will have to
make its judgments.

997
01:24:16,641 --> 01:24:20,441
<i>And since history's
first draft will be written
in our logs...</i>

998
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:27,275
<i>Well, then I guess
I've got some writing to do.</i>

999
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:32,450
Think about that commendation.

1000
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,627
Yeah, I will.

1001
01:25:04,923 --> 01:25:07,323
Not a lot to show
for a life, huh?

1002
01:25:08,393 --> 01:25:09,860
I guess not.

1003
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:13,963
You have any idea
why she did it?

1004
01:25:17,002 --> 01:25:19,971
Maybe she thought
she had a lot to answer for.

1005
01:25:20,772 --> 01:25:22,797
Maybe she had it coming.

1006
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:27,144
<i>We've all got it coming.</i>

1007
01:25:31,716 --> 01:25:34,241
You might as well
hear this from me.

1008
01:25:35,553 --> 01:25:38,317
<i>I've asked to be
reassigned to Galactica.</i>

1009
01:25:39,624 --> 01:25:40,955
Any reason?

1010
01:25:41,559 --> 01:25:45,256
You might say
that I have a beef with
my commanding officer.

1011
01:25:46,097 --> 01:25:47,655
<i>And what's that?</i>

1012
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,794
The motherfrakker
keeps trying to
get me killed.

1013
01:25:54,072 --> 01:25:56,870
Well, you ever think
you might deserve it?

1014
01:25:56,975 --> 01:26:00,433
Speak for yourself, Lee.
I have a destiny.

1015
01:26:01,513 --> 01:26:04,004
I had my palm read
by a Cylon, remember?

1016
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:05,776
A destiny. Right.

1017
01:26:05,884 --> 01:26:10,583
You better believe it.
So I guess you are stuck
with me till the end.

1018
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,690


1019
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:15,148
I gotta go break in
your new CAG, sir.
