Whiskey.

Let's get the fuck outta here.

You're not gonna do anything.

Welcome to Los Angeles, rabbi.

24
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,162
Enjoy your stay.

25
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:11,674
Shalom. Shalom.

26
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,305
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

27
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,418
Welcome to L.A.

28
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,634
Keep the truck runnin', Hardy.

29
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,130
Bring me some beer.

30
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,842
Get some beers.

31
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:09,226
Don't you go starin' at me,
you goddamn slope!

32
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,578
We should've nuked your
asses when we had the chance.

33
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:15,018
- If I'd have been there, we would have.
- Leave him alone!

34
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:18,586
Ready for that beer, Pete!

35
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,809
Push "no sale", and put
the fuckin' cash on the counter!

36
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,450
Get this shit out to the truck.

37
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,370
Are we gonna take her with us?

38
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:49,433
Darlin', we gonna have us
a good time tonight.

39
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,673
Gonna teach me how to party?

40
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:54,697
She's gonna teach me how to party!

41
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,937
You're gonna teach me
how to party, baby!

42
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:00,153
But I gotta kill this old man first.

43
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,634
What the hell are you do...

44
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,810
How you want it, slope?

45
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,433
Fast or slow? Motherfucker?

46
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,353
Charlie?

47
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,561
My fuckin' head!

48
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:15,338
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!

49
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,617
Charlie.

50
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:21,385
Hold your breath.

51
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,369
Drop the gun.

52
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:31,001
Charlie, you smell.

53
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,690
You broke my fuckin' arm, man!

54
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:48,618
Keep the change.

55
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:51,481
Thank you. Walk!

56
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,426
Detective Quintz, please.

57
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,393
Nick Randall.

58
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,026
Danny?

59
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,002
Meet me outside.
I've got a present for you.

60
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,520
An F.B.I. wanted.

61
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:21,210
A cop killer.

62
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:24,009
His name is Charles Higgins.

63
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:27,817
Pull his file and give me
a booking number.

64
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,777
No, no, I'm not coming inside.

65
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,250
I don't like cops,
and they don't like me.

66
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,657
Yeah.

67
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,929
So, where's my present?

68
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,969
- Why the hell is he in the trunk?
- Take a whiff.

69
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,993
You son of a bitch!

70
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:16,233
You broke my fuckin' arm, man!

71
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:19,449
Locked me in his trunk.
Didn't read me no rights.

72
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:23,610
Hey, I'm a free man.
Judge'll send you up, and I'll walk.

73
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,185
Ever heard of the Miranda Act, sucker?

74
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,121
Charlie, you haven't been arrested yet.

75
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:35,017
- What?
- I'm not a cop.

76
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:39,145
Are you a fuckin' bounty hunter?

77
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,945
A sleaze-bag bounty hunter.

78
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,826
Take care of this piece of shit,
will you?

79
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,809
Yes, sir.

80
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,065
What do you wanna do
about the paperwork?

81
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,800
Let's do it at my office?

82
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,114
Good idea.
I'll see you in five minutes.

83
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,586
I'll get you, cocksucker!
Goddamn it! Shit!

84
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:08,986
Hey, Nickels, good to see you.

85
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:14,793
<i>- ...A great deal...
- ...Vamos a escuchar...
- The life of the flesh is death.</i>

86
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,545
I wired the satellite solenoids
to the detonators.

87
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,016
Beautiful.

88
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,497
Has a range of two miles.

89
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,697
If it's that far away, I can't watch.

90
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:23,017
$25.000.

91
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,625
Not bad for a night's work, Nickels.

92
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,520
It's 40. Read the small print.

93
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:32,217
There's a $15.000 bonus
if he can still talk.

94
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,601
How do you put up
with this shit, Danny?

95
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,017
Every time I touch
one of those scumbags, I...

96
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:49,129
I take a lot of showers

97
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:52,793
and Louise scrubs my... back.

98
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,681
How is she?

99
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,985
That's what you need: a lady.

100
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:01,577
A nice lady for a change,
instead of these bimbos you go out with.

101
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:05,593
Let me tell you something.
I found one.

102
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:11,576
First name is Terry.
She's a stewardess.

103
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,497
Another stewardess.

104
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,736
She's getting her doctorate
in anthropology.

105
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:18,276
We've been goin' out
for three months now.

106
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:20,326
Three months?
Three fucking months?

107
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,330
Jesus, that's a goddamn
silver anniversary for you.

108
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,153
Come on, tell me some more.

109
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:30,405
Louise is gonna ask me
a million questions

110
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,482
when she finds out
you got a girlfriend.

111
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:36,218
Did you tell Louise
you bought a motorcycle?

112
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,506
No, I didn't tell her
I bought a motorcycle.

113
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,585
So why should you tell her
I got a girlfriend? Piss off.

114
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,248
Sign this.

115
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,785
She know what you do?

116
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,433
No.

117
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,513
I told her what I did.

118
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:03,737
She thinks
I'm in the security business.

119
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,657
I hate this shit.

120
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,472
What? Paperwork?

121
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:10,456
Fuck you.

122
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,425
Listen, buddy.

123
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,920
You burnt your bridges, not them.

124
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:24,217
You wanna build 'em up again,
you build 'em.

125
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,585
Yeah, sure.

126
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,993
Listen. Once you've quit
the company, you've quit.

127
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:34,873
Don't they teach you cops
how to clean these?

128
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,857
Up yours.

129
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,337
Now...

130
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:45,352
I figure I'll bring in a few more bad guys,
put the money in my boat

131
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,336
and see a bit of the world.

132
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:49,577
You've seen it.

133
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,168
But this time without a bull's-eye
painted on my forehead.

134
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,601
You can't fool me, man.

135
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,873
That's exactly what you miss

136
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:01,353
that bull's-eye.

137
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,697
Thank you.

138
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,537
You might wanna wait.
This is the last ten minutes.

139
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,496
I've seen it four times.
This is my favorite part.

140
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,937
All right.

141
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,649
Morrison, city desk.
How can I help you?

142
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:16,856
This is Malak al Rahim.

143
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,160
Let me save you a little confusion,
Mr. Morrison.

144
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:26,056
Tonight you'll be receiving phone calls
from a number of people

145
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,240
claiming responsibility
for what I am about to do.

146
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:33,209
Malak al Rahim is supposed
to be in South Yemen.

147
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:37,912
- How do I know it's actually you?
- You'll know it was me.

148
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,393
I'm outside the Fox Cinema.

149
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,169
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hey, Nick.

150
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:19,336
What a wonderful surprise.

151
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,521
Bonnie owed me a favor.

152
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,978
Took the Denver run,
and I've got four days off.

153
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,368
I guess I owe Bonnie a favor.

154
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,665
You smell so good.

155
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:00,697
I'm getting stabbed in the back.

156
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,089
"The effect of changing..."

157
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:09,304
"...climatic conditions..."

158
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,952
"...on the nomadic tribes
of Maure-Tan-Ya."

159
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:15,816
Mauretania.

160
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,217
Listen, it was a lot more
painful reading it

161
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:21,113
than it was lying on it,
believe me.

162
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:24,168
Are you trying to tell
me you want to study?

163
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:26,136
I really should.

164
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:29,624
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

165
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:34,857
But there is a great
bottle of wine in the fridge.

166
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:41,032
Okay.

167
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,800
To Bonnie.

168
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:25,656
Where'd you get that?
It's not mine.

169
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,641
No.

170
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:32,745
It belonged to Jedidiah Larkin.

171
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,153
Wagon train scout,
mountain man, trailblazer.

172
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:40,472
Even tried his hand
at being a lawman.

173
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,936
And this was his only
constant companion.

174
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:51,128
He was the strong,
silent type - a loner.

175
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:56,008
He loved adventure,
danger, new frontiers.

176
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:59,976
- Did he ride a motorcycle?
- No, he didn't ride a motorcycle.

177
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,333
Just after the civil war,
he got fed up with

178
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,437
what the rail roads and the bureaucrats

179
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:08,000
and everybody else
was turning the frontier into

180
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,952
so he sold everything he owned
and he disappeared.

181
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,873
And nobody knows where he went.

182
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:16,344
He went to San Francisco.

183
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:19,864
He caught a freighter to South America

184
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:24,409
and... got lost in the arms
of the Amazon...

185
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,328
lady.

186
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:28,296
You are full of shit.

187
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:35,097
My grandfather used
to tell me stories.

188
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:38,216
He would get drunk first,
then he would sit on the bed

189
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,921
and tell stories about the old west.

190
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:44,553
About his father, Joshua Randall.

191
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:49,497
About all the other Josh Randalls,
Jed Larkins.

192
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,009
Nicky, that sounds terrible.

193
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,800
Thanks.

194
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,848
You're welcome.

195
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,448
Bacon? Sausages?

196
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,848
- Neither.
- You get both.

197
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,128
So do I.

198
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:01,832
Buttered toast?

199
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:05,304
- Yeah. Why not?
- All right. This is how I do it.

200
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,608
<i>- This is a news break.</i>
- It's nice, Nicky.

201
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,024
<i>- A terrorist bombing rocked Los Angeles.</i>
- I think so.

202
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,392
Here. Last night about 10:00...

203
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:14,312
Oh, my God, Nicky. Look at this.

204
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:17,675
<i>A series of bombs went off
at a Los Angeles movie theater</i>

205
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,818
<i>killing 138 people.</i>

206
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,905
That's terrible.

207
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,672
Yeah. Have some coffee.

208
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:27,497
<i>...received a telephone call from
a man claiming to be Malak al Rahim</i>

209
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,136
<i>one of the world's most
notorious terrorists.</i>

210
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:32,312
<i>The man claimed
responsibility for the attack</i>

211
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:34,680
<i>and told the newspaper
exactly when and where...</i>

212
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:37,960
Hi, Bill. I forgot all about
you coming here this morning.

213
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,000
Bill, this is Terry.
Terry, this is Bill Stanford.

214
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:46,664
- One of my best-paying clients.
- My pleasure.

215
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:49,528
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm sorry for being rude...

216
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,584
but I'm running late, and we have
to go over some business.

217
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,536
Perhaps you could excuse us.

218
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,456
Why don't we take a walk?

219
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,695
We'll be back in a couple of minutes.

220
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:01,000
Bill, did you see this?

221
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:04,456
<i>But I would like to say that the police
force and our intelligence agencies</i>

222
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,360
<i>are workin' overtime on this problem.</i>

223
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,944
Yeah. Terrible, isn't it?

224
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,840
<i>Hundreds more were injured,
with several listed as critical.</i>

225
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:15,149
<i>Many more are feared missing,
and rescue crews</i>

226
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:17,416
<i>are searching through
the rubble at this hour.</i>

227
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,016
<i>Authorities say positive identification
of some of the bodies may be impossible.</i>

228
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,560
Bill Stanford?

229
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,640
I like that.

230
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:28,265
What the hell are you doing here?

231
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,848
Now that's a nice way
to talk to an old friend

232
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:32,593
you haven't seen in three years.

233
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,681
Phil, friends are people who show up

234
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,792
in a bathing suit with a six-pack

235
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:39,976
not dressed up
like one of the Brooks brothers.

236
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,288
This is company business.
Cut to the chase.

237
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:46,695
Okay. Malak al Rahim.

238
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:50,697
That's a lot better.

239
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,488
Yeah.

240
00:27:56,553 --> 00:28:00,584
He left us his handprint
on a telephone booth.

241
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:05,480
- We need you.
- Give me a break.

242
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:08,344
Between the C.I.A.,
the F.B.I., the L.A.P.D.

243
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,984
you've got 4.000 men on the street.

244
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:14,905
- Why would you need me?
- This is a flash point situation, Nick.

245
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,320
We need the best.

246
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,305
Bullshit "the best".

247
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,224
That was three years ago.
I'm working my own scams now.

248
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:27,912
Who's bullshittin' who?

249
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,632
You and I both know
you hate collecting garbage.

250
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:32,888
At least I know who my enemies are.

251
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:35,544
I hate getting stabbed in the back.

252
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:38,439
Well, that hasn't changed.

253
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,968
But at least we pay well for the risk.

254
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,928
Two hundred in a rearview mirror.

255
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:49,720
Okay. If it's any consolation

256
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:52,409
it'll be me watching your back.

257
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:58,776
$250.000, Nick
if you can get it done in a week.

258
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:04,600
Who'd know I'm in?

259
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:08,984
Danny at F.B.I. and... us.

260
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:13,576
- Lipton?
- That's who I work for.

261
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:17,113
No surveillance on me?

262
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:20,072
No interference?

263
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:22,376
And immunity from prosecution.

264
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,615
What are you bustin' my balls for?

265
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,103
You know goddamn well we
can't promise immunity!

266
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,608
What's the bonus
if I bring him in alive?

267
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,911
Another 50.000.

268
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,713
Okay.

269
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,109
Just wanna know
how much I'm gonna lose

270
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,897
when I blow this scumbag away.

271
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,015
Come on, let's take a ride.

272
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,064
I'm gonna tell Terry first.

273
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:48,664
Don't bother. She's leaving
you a note right now.

274
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,384
It seems, her friend Bonnie
came down with the flu

275
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,504
so they're gonna need Terry
on the Denver flight.

276
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,321
You tricky bastards.

277
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:05,880
Sue me. Get in the car.

278
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,608
They figure there were two bombs.

279
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,816
One on the gas main
and one here in the theater.

280
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,872
What do you got?

281
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:22,984
Bad news, Phil.
We found the detonator.

282
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:25,240
It was triggered by
a state-of-the-art remote solenoid.

283
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:27,896
- Very high-tech.
- Satellite quality.

284
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,336
Gives us a place to start.

285
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:09,352
Wanna go get a beer?

286
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:12,009
At this hour?
You'll ruin my image.

287
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,295
- Did you get a good shot?
- Yeah, real clean.

288
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:31,224
- Get it in the pipeline, quick.
- Okay.

289
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,296
We got him.

290
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:41,400
Randall really doesn't have
much use for you, does he?

291
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:45,256
Ha! Would you do
what we're doing to a pal?

292
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,344
Your sources are right.

293
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:16,391
This is the guy. A little bonus.

294
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,160
I've been waiting to kill him
for a long time.

295
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,976
A long time.

296
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,080
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Phil.

297
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:50,951
Yeah?

298
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:52,872
And who else?

299
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:54,398
No, we're on a clean line.

300
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:57,120
I got a voltage meter
right here on the phone.

301
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,175
Bullshit.

302
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,816
I know you're tapping my phone.

303
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,968
You're watching me.

304
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,560
If somebody's watching you,
Randall, it's not us.

305
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,479
I see.

306
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:15,640
Must be Santa Claus.
What else is new?

307
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:19,176
That, switch was NASA stuff.

308
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:21,752
There's only one distributor
out here in California.

309
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,928
Weber Electronics.

310
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:32,104
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:35,304
And they've accounted
for every one of them except eight.

312
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,704
Seems they had a burglary.
In fact, two.

313
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,944
One in December and one last month.

314
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,872
L.A.P.D.'s got reports on both of them.
We're waiting for them.

315
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:46,119
I'll get it myself.

316
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:56,423
♪<i>You are my sunshine♪
♪my only sunshine</i>♪

317
00:34:56,488 --> 00:35:02,231
♪<i>you make me happy♪
♪when I feel blue</i>♪

318
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,567
Jesus!

319
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,759
Why the tail?

320
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:55,832
You're under protective surveillance.

321
00:35:57,497 --> 00:36:00,152
Tell Lipton you lost me.

322
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:26,839
Danny! Get over here!

323
00:36:41,752 --> 00:36:44,904
The M.O. on both burglaries
is very similar.

324
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,895
Yeah, but we got that guy
in the December burglary.

325
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,384
Dumb schmuck thought Weber
Electronics was a stereo warehouse.

326
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,264
Nailed him in a week.
He's been sittin' in county ever since.

327
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,544
- I wanna talk to him.
- That's hard, Nickel.

328
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,615
Today.

329
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,976
That's harder.

330
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,768
What kind of case you workin' on?

331
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:12,951
It'll pay enough
to get the boat finished.

332
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:15,783
Make the call.

333
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,023
You son of a bitch.

334
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:20,504
That bull's-eye is back.

335
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:28,519
You remember the number?

336
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:33,304
Look, I told you.

337
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,775
I don't know nothin'
about no second burglary.

338
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:43,079
All I know is you got me
locked up in this fuckin' cage.

339
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,999
We're wasting time.

340
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:47,575
Quieres un cafe?

341
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,016
- Crema y azucar.
- You heard him.

342
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:53,943
Cream and sugar, and black for me.

343
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:57,096
I'm not leavin' you
alone with him, Randall.

344
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,080
He's my responsibility.

345
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:07,367
Make sure it's fresh...
And real hot.

346
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,752
Sorry, Luis.

347
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,671
- Hiya, Danny.
- Hi.

348
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,688
I like the cigar.

349
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,719
- Let me fuckin' go!
- Who did you sell your M.O. to?

350
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:45,352
- A name. A name.
- F...Farnsworth, asshole!

351
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:48,039
Farnsworth!

352
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,215
Spell it.

353
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,936
Honey, horse-shit wrestling's on.

354
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,855
You want your dinner, or what?

355
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,287
The way you cook, who gives a shit?

356
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:01,368
<i>The bell will ring any minute now</i>

357
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,768
<i>for this exhibition match
between the Lone Strangler</i>

358
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:07,015
<i>and the Argentine gaucho,
Guillermo Martelli.</i>

359
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,312
- What is that, mystery meat?
- I'll give you mystery meat.

360
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:12,839
Get that.

361
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:15,768
This is my favorite show.
You get that.

362
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,879
Shit.

363
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:20,119
<i>What do you think of
the Strangler's chances?</i>

364
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:22,039
<i>Jack, I think the Strangler's got...</i>

365
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:25,383
Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'.
Who is it?

366
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:27,783
I'm looking for Farnsworth.

367
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,984
- Who wants him?
- A friend of Luis Sanchez.

368
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,983
You buyin' or sellin'?

369
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:40,376
Collecting.

370
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:42,424
What the fuck?

371
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:46,967
What the fuck are you doin', man?

372
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:50,024
Hey, this is my house.
Get the fuck outta my house!

373
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:54,183
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goldilocks!
- You don't pay your bills.

374
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:58,146
What the fuck does that... put the...
where you goin' with my golf.

375
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:59,824
You play? Get outta there.
Play what?

376
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,376
- Luis says you ripped him off.
- Yeah?

377
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,071
The son of a bitch is a liar.
I paid him the thousand dollars.

378
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:08,120
I sent the goddamn Cuban cigars.

379
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:10,536
I even tried to get
his prison sentence shortened.

380
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:14,136
I couldn't get to anybody.
What the fuck does he want?

381
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,119
More.

382
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:19,688
He's getting out tomorrow.

383
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:25,544
Man needs an uzi.

384
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:28,343
Five hundred bucks
and he's got an uzi.

385
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:34,967
I'd like to know
the name of the rag head

386
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,335
you sold the detonators to.

387
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,062
You said you didn't sell
nothin' dangerous to those Arabs!

388
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:40,752
Shut up!

389
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:44,263
- You shut up!
- Everything's in the garage!

390
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,439
Everything!
The guns, the records!

391
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:49,175
I want all that stuff out!
I didn't want him to do any of this!

392
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,159
Relax.

393
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:12,791
You made it out of Nam alive,
didn't you?

394
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,024
Yeah.

395
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:19,816
That's too bad.

396
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:23,256
A lot of good guys didn't.

397
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:38,712
Yeah, Phil, I got a name.

398
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:42,664
Abdul Renza. R-E-N-Z-A.

399
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,815
Student at U.C.L.A.

400
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:50,471
I need an address, license plate...
Anything you can get.

401
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:54,215
And tell Lipton to pull
the surveillance on my boat.

402
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,264
Don't give me that bullshit.

403
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:02,631
I not only made the bastard,
I marked him for you.

404
00:42:03,993 --> 00:42:05,848
Yeah.

405
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:11,016
The sequence of events
is very important.

406
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,062
First we have to create enough heat.

407
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:16,632
These four tanks
all contain flammable liquids.

408
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:19,431
They have to be ruptured
with an incendiary device.

409
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:21,864
Then this tank here containing oxygen

410
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:24,919
and this one containing hydrogen
have to be blown in that order.

411
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:27,591
That will increase the heat
and create water vapor.

412
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,767
The next thing is to blow
the refrigeration system

413
00:42:29,832 --> 00:42:32,759
and the methyl isocyanate tank.

414
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:37,927
When that tank blows

415
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:40,456
the M.I.C. will become aerosol.

416
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,263
The prevailing winds will do
the rest of your job for you.

417
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,575
Conservative estimate:
30.000 dead.

418
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,519
This will make Bhopal, India
look like a minor traffic accident.

419
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:16,952
Yeah. Hi, Phil.
How you doing?

420
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:19,815
I'm at a drive-in having dinner.

421
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:23,687
Did you get me the address?

422
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:26,535
Yeah.

423
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,671
I know where that is.

424
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:34,343
Yeah. I got it.

425
00:43:34,408 --> 00:43:39,079
And a black Mercedes 450SL.

426
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,887
Isn't it nice to have money?

427
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:47,175
Yeah. Talk to you later.

428
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:01,767
Yeah.

429
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:04,039
This is 1436.

430
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:07,319
Run a sweep on my line, will you?
I'll hold.

431
00:44:22,168 --> 00:44:25,191
All clear? Thank you.

432
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,503
Randall sure is fast.

433
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:58,231
Faster than I gave him credit for.

434
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,911
We're gonna have to haul ass to,
make this thing happen.

435
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:04,855
- Where is he now?
- Somewhere downtown. He's in his car.

436
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,255
Your Arab contact is what...

437
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,655
six, seven layers away from Malak?

438
00:45:11,688 --> 00:45:12,629
Randall's downtown.

439
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:15,280
If I knew that, we wouldn't have
to set up Randall. Would we?

440
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:17,590
What's your leak-time, Henderson?

441
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:23,112
It usually takes a couple of hours
for stuff to run the grapevine.

442
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:25,815
We have to slow down Randall.

443
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:29,127
Then I'll take care of that too.

444
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:31,655
- Slow down Nick.
- Come in, Walker.

445
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,623
All right.

446
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,864
Philmore Walker,
this is Dave Henderson.

447
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:40,439
- He's in from Denver.
- Phil's the name.

448
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,968
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

449
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,015
You should get yourself an electric.

450
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,559
Think of the money
you will save in band-aids.

451
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:50,838
That's very good.

452
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:53,559
I...I think I'll take your advice.

453
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,927
- How's your boy doin'?
- Good.

454
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:06,342
He's zeroed in on the suspect
that bought the solenoids.

455
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,487
Terrific. Do we give him backup?

456
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:11,639
You wanna get some guys killed?

457
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:14,390
I don't understand.

458
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:16,524
He already beat the shit
out of one poor bastard

459
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:18,615
this morning he thought
we had following him.

460
00:46:18,696 --> 00:46:21,575
Every law enforcement agency
in this country is on this case.

461
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,534
It's possible that someone
is following him.

462
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:30,423
- But not from this office?
- Not from this office.

463
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:50,567
You got the address, right?

464
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:56,166
Alteransa.
Wilshire and Arden. Okay.

465
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:00,775
Amir.

466
00:47:25,448 --> 00:47:27,398
Here he comes.

467
00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:33,463
- Yeah?
- Watch your back.

468
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,151
Target's been delayed.

469
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:02,151
Malak.

470
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:19,208
<i>Unit 23.</i>

471
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,127
Unit 23.

472
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:25,319
<i>We have Renza's building
under surveillance. Suspend delay.</i>

473
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:27,303
Ten-four.

474
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:37,927
Hey, Pat, the fed's signalling you.

475
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:48,919
Okay, just sign this, sir,
and you're free to go.

476
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:53,047
By the way, Mr. Randall

477
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:57,207
I suggest in the future you exercise
just a little bit more caution

478
00:48:57,272 --> 00:48:59,191
in your driving.

479
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:02,534
Good night.

480
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:11,846
Malak wants them both dead.
Here's the address.

481
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:17,815
Aziz sent this... just in case.

482
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,919
I see him. He's driving
into Renza's garage now.

483
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:43,191
Renza's black Mercedes
just pulled into the driveway.

484
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:19,159
They were using him as bait.

485
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,743
They thought I'd be stupid enough
to risk myself to kill just one man.

486
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:31,734
Okay, Renza,
who sent you to Farnsworth?

487
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,958
Who sent you?

488
00:50:56,216 --> 00:50:58,711
Who wanted those detonators?

489
00:50:58,776 --> 00:51:00,471
- I don't know.
- A name!

490
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:16,711
- Come on!
- Aziz!

491
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,695
Aziz! Robert Aziz!

492
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,238
Robert Aziz!

493
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:24,326
Robert Aziz!

494
00:51:30,776 --> 00:51:32,376
Shit!

495
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:03,735
- We want him alive!
- He's got a bomb!

496
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:11,959
You killed those men!
I could've stopped him.

497
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:15,238
The object of the mission was
to take at least one of them alive.

498
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:17,990
Weren't you briefed?

499
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:21,351
- Nick...
- You stay out of this.

500
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:30,055
You son of a bitch!

501
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:43,351
Get that out of my face...
Or you're a dead man.

502
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:50,295
Who the hell do you think you are
you can use me as bait?

503
00:52:51,832 --> 00:52:55,270
You're a fisherman, Randall.
Live bait works best.

504
00:52:55,335 --> 00:52:57,846
I know this is out
of character for you, Lipton

505
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,278
but I want the truth.

506
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,198
Why me?

507
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:06,071
Beirut. February, 1978.
Remember?

508
00:53:06,136 --> 00:53:09,095
Come on, Randall.

509
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,214
You were given an assignment
to terminate five enemy operatives.

510
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,615
Four are dead.

511
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,894
The one you missed wants your ass.

512
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:25,367
Malak al Rahim...
as he now calls himself.

513
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:28,358
He should really thank you,
because you made him number one.

514
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:31,415
But the other four were his friends.

515
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:34,694
There's no way

516
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,103
he could have known that it was me

517
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:40,646
- ...without your help.
- Sure.

518
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:43,767
But, we'd already
moved you to South America

519
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,102
saving you up for a rainy day.

520
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:52,118
Check your hook, asshole.

521
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:54,583
You're losing your bait.

522
00:53:57,544 --> 00:54:00,918
You're better off with us
than without us, Randall.

523
00:54:00,984 --> 00:54:04,038
We got a lot of men on you.
There's no way you can slip us.

524
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,022
Don't bet on it!

525
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:18,775
You better go placate your desert dwellers
before they find out you set 'em up.

526
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,743
Right.

527
00:54:22,023 --> 00:54:24,358
What the hell's the point
in sending him out there?

528
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:27,511
It's over. We blew it!
We scared him off.

529
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:29,431
You don't understand, Pat.

530
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:31,831
We're not dealing with one
of your home-grown scumbags.

531
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:35,575
Malak's an animal.
He doesn't get scared. He gets even.

532
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:40,438
Next time you decide
to fuck me, Lipton

533
00:54:40,504 --> 00:54:42,423
kiss me first!

534
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:16,454
Unit 7, he's headin' towards you.

535
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:42,157
As-salamu alaykum.

536
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:44,758
Armand, garbage.

537
00:55:47,575 --> 00:55:50,406
I swear, Allah al-Hazim

538
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,078
I had no idea there was that
much surveillance out there.

539
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:55,895
That's all right, Henderson.
Don't worry.

540
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:21,767
This is Unit 42. I'm on him.

541
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:30,903
I'm behind him,
heading north on Figueroa.

542
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:50,790
Hey!

543
00:58:15,144 --> 00:58:17,063
Lock it up. He's on foot.

544
00:59:13,352 --> 00:59:15,271
Mr. Lipton.

545
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:17,191
Randall gave us the slip.

546
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:19,436
How many goddamn men do you
need to cover one man?

547
00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:21,638
- You...
- Get outta the way!

548
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:25,414
Wait a minute. No.

549
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:28,262
Lipton, it's for you.

550
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,246
Lipton.

551
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:35,446
You've got four men.
Follow anybody that leaves there.

552
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:39,286
But don't blow Henderson's cover.

553
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,718
Yeah.

554
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,686
- You got anything?
- Yeah.

555
01:00:47,383 --> 01:00:50,167
A headache.

556
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:53,158
Henderson went in,
but he didn't come out.

557
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:55,238
We lost Randall.
You lost Henderson.

558
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,073
We're still no closer to Malak.

559
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,552
We're doin' just fuckin' great,
ain't we?

560
01:00:59,591 --> 01:01:04,054
Randall will surface, and Henderson
can take care of himself.

561
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:06,934
What's that?

562
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,181
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
sent us a list of everything

563
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:14,118
that Farnsworth admitted
selling to Renza.

564
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:19,094
Christ. They're loaded for bear.

565
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:23,623
I tell you something, John.
He is planning something real big.

566
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:28,197
I thought he was here on vacation.

567
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:35,574
- A boat.
- Where? Where?

568
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:37,750
- Where? Where?
-  A boat, a boat...

569
01:01:37,815 --> 01:01:42,263
- Where? Where?
- San... Pedro...

570
01:01:43,207 --> 01:01:46,534
- Where?
- San Pedro Boat Works.

571
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,038
Good.

572
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:55,814
How do we know he's telling the truth?

573
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:59,238
Look at him. Look at him!

574
01:02:01,015 --> 01:02:04,822
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Agent Henderson?

575
01:02:14,311 --> 01:02:16,006
Would you?

576
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:23,638
Kill him?

577
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:33,174
Nicky?

578
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,366
You came to see me.
I wasn't here.

579
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,166
You're leaving right now.
You gotta leave. You understand?

580
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:44,502
- No!
- You gotta leave!

581
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:46,486
Nicky, what the hell is going on?

582
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:52,214
It's not as bad as it looks.

583
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:54,902
It's a game.
These guys are following me.

584
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:58,934
- I'm trying to give them the slip.
- Are you in trouble?

585
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:03,030
It's business, old business.

586
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:05,654
Are you in danger?

587
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:11,829
- I just gotta disappear.
- For how long?

588
01:03:11,895 --> 01:03:14,694
A week. Maybe less.

589
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,254
What can I do to help?

590
01:03:21,223 --> 01:03:23,575
Just be here when I get back.

591
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,463
Sure.

592
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,366
Terry...

593
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:38,422
I love you.

594
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:46,871
I love you.

595
01:03:58,183 --> 01:04:03,221
As soon as I leave, turn on the light.

596
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:05,526
Pretend I wasn't here.

597
01:04:06,535 --> 01:04:08,966
And don't watch me go.

598
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:13,462
Okay?

599
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:15,862
All right?

600
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:18,566
- Not okay?
- No.

601
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,758
Nicky.

602
01:04:32,823 --> 01:04:34,742
You forgot something.

603
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,334
Yeah.

604
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:20,629
- Hi, Phil.
- Hey.

605
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,574
- Who's on board?
- Just his girlfriend.

606
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,654
We searched the boat earlier.
It was empty.

607
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,149
She just showed up a little while ago.

608
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:06,821
Quintz here.

609
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:09,910
You wanna have some fun?

610
01:06:12,855 --> 01:06:15,942
I'm trying to lose a tail.

611
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:20,757
My raincoat is waiting for you
in a garbage can on Fourth and Flower.

612
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:23,686
Put it on. Drive down to my boat.

613
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,182
Park the car, leave the keys

614
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:28,982
and take the boat out
for a couple of hours.

615
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:31,349
Yes, sir.

616
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,008
If they think I'm on the boat

617
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:35,799
they'll stop watching the loft
and I need to get in there.

618
01:06:38,502 --> 01:06:40,266
And Danny, if you fuck up

619
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:43,343
I'm gonna tell Louise
about the motorcycle.

620
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,557
Just as soon as I can, lieutenant.

621
01:07:15,815 --> 01:07:18,022
Another special assignment?

622
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:20,790
Yeah, darling.

623
01:07:20,856 --> 01:07:23,349
Very special.

624
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,133
- Be careful.
- I always am.

625
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:41,301
Good morning, Randall.

626
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,377
Don't approach him, Phil.
He's under surveillance.

627
01:08:05,403 --> 01:08:06,451
Nick!

628
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:24,326
- Nicky?
- Hi, Terry. I'm Danny.

629
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,205
If we don't get our asses out of here quick,
they're gonna know I ain't Nick.

630
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,942
Grab that line, will you, sweetheart?

631
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:37,141
Nick!

632
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,532
- Phil, are you nuts?
- Let me go!

633
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:54,879
Goddamn it, there are
people in there!

634
01:08:54,918 --> 01:08:57,606
They're charred bone fragments
by now, baby.

635
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:59,483
Look at that,
it's a goddamn incinerator.

636
01:08:59,509 --> 01:09:01,265
Take your fuckin' hands off of me!

637
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,363
Nick!

638
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:05,614
Nick!

639
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:10,389
Goddamn it!
Lock up the fuckin' harbor!

640
01:09:10,455 --> 01:09:13,669
Lock it up. Lock it up!

641
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:41,669
This is Walker.
Patch me through to... Lipton.

642
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:47,590
<i>Lipton.</i>

643
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:50,965
- Randall's dead.
<i>- Malak?</i>

644
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:57,142
- Blew up his boat.
<i>- Pull all surveillance on Randall.</i>

645
01:09:57,207 --> 01:10:00,453
<i>Come on in... for reassignment,
Walker.</i>

646
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:07,381
Don't you move, you fuck.
Don't turn around.

647
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,566
Just get me outta here.

648
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:19,605
Start the car.

649
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,230
- Don't...
- What the fuck is this?

650
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:43,214
I saw you get on that boat.

651
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:48,261
- That wasn't me. That was Danny.
- Who's Danny?

652
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,373
You think I knew
they were using you as bait?

653
01:10:50,438 --> 01:10:53,333
Yeah, I did.

654
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:55,702
Why the fuck would I do
some shit like that?

655
01:10:59,703 --> 01:11:03,766
God. I don't know...

656
01:11:06,502 --> 01:11:11,478
It hurts.
I just lost my best friends.

657
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:16,678
Fifteen years, Nick.
Fifteen goddamn years!

658
01:11:23,926 --> 01:11:25,829
I want Malak.

659
01:11:27,494 --> 01:11:29,350
Help me.

660
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:31,397
Whatever you need.

661
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:36,917
I need an address. Robert Aziz.

662
01:11:48,615 --> 01:11:52,821
<i>We have reason to believe that
Malak al Rahim is here in Los Angeles</i>

663
01:11:52,886 --> 01:11:54,805
<i>and was responsible for the bombing</i>

664
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:58,277
<i>despite what federal
intelligence agencies are saying.</i>

665
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:00,197
<i>And I want people to know</i>

666
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:03,158
<i>that the Los Angeles Police Department
is doing everything in its power</i>

667
01:12:03,223 --> 01:12:06,694
<i>to protect them and bring
those responsible to justice.</i>

668
01:12:06,759 --> 01:12:09,301
<i>For one thing, we've learned
that the registered</i>

669
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,837
<i>owner of the boat, who was killed
in this morning's explosion</i>

670
01:12:12,902 --> 01:12:16,550
<i>was a former Federal Agent,
once linked to antiterrorist activities</i>

671
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:18,661
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

672
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:22,326
<i>It's clear to us that the two
bombing incidents are related.</i>

673
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,901
<i>That of course was chief
of police Donald Gatler.</i>

674
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,150
<i>If chief Gatler is right,
the two people killed on the boat</i>

675
01:12:28,214 --> 01:12:32,277
<i>bring the death toll to
173 people in just 36 hours.</i>

676
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:34,261
<i>That number is likely to climb.</i>

677
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:38,022
<i>Officials say many more victims
are in critical condition in L.A. hospitals.</i>

678
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:41,173
<i>Meanwhile, the man thought
to be responsible for the killings</i>

679
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:44,661
<i>Malak al Rahim, may be at large
somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

680
01:12:44,726 --> 01:12:46,710
<i>Rahim is believed to have killed
thousands of people</i>

681
01:12:46,775 --> 01:12:49,470
<i>in terrorist bombings in Europe
and the Middle East</i>

682
01:12:49,496 --> 01:12:50,766
<i>over the last ten years.</i>

683
01:12:50,807 --> 01:12:54,054
<i>But despite his notoriety,
he is a mysterious figure</i>

684
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:56,742
<i>known only to a handful
of disciplined followers.</i>

685
01:12:56,823 --> 01:12:59,798
<i>Here is a photograph of the man
police are looking for.</i>

686
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:37,557
- Yeah.
- Aziz's address: 734 East Bedford.

687
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:35,541
Remember, 6:00.

688
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:38,821
Somebody just delivered
an audio tape to ABC News.

689
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:43,301
A guy claiming to be Rahim says there's
50 car bombs planted all over the city.

690
01:14:43,335 --> 01:14:46,294
L.A.P.D. is begging for more men.

691
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:48,757
We're stretched to the limit now.

692
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:52,037
Malak's just waiting for us
to thin out our surveillance.

693
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:54,117
Hey, that's our job,
protecting the public.

694
01:14:54,182 --> 01:14:57,637
My job is to get that maniac.

695
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,834
Your fuckin' friend
couldn't work with us.

696
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,694
No. He had to go get
himself killed.

697
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:04,261
I'm sure he's more upset
about that than you are.

698
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:32,373
Malak.

699
01:19:36,055 --> 01:19:39,173
Let me out of here, please.

700
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:41,510
Let me out of here! Please.

701
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:45,925
I want Malak al Rahim.
I don't know Malak al Rahim!

702
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:49,732
Please. I don't know.
Let me out!

703
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,693
- An address.
- Please! I..

704
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:02,934
An address! Come on.

705
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:06,341
- Can't you hear me?
- No, no! Please!

706
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,941
In oil drum factory!

707
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,765
They're in the oil drum factory!

708
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:15,892
One-Zero-Six Imperial Avenue!

709
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,293
<i>The recap. Seven car bomb explosions</i>

710
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:29,636
<i>have rocked the greater Los Angeles
area in the past half hour.</i>

711
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,125
This just came in.

712
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:32,654
<i>The death toll...</i>

713
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:35,156
Nine now.

714
01:20:35,222 --> 01:20:37,237
Random bombings.

715
01:20:37,302 --> 01:20:40,822
He's creating chaos.
It's a diversion.

716
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:44,229
He's doing one hell of a job.

717
01:20:44,294 --> 01:20:48,053
He's got L.A.P.D. and everybody
else spread paper thin.

718
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:51,445
The bastard's playing with us.

719
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:54,589
The I.A.P.D. just acted
on a gunshot complaint.

720
01:20:54,653 --> 01:20:56,809
House full of explosives
and an Arab named Aziz.

721
01:20:56,874 --> 01:21:00,085
They're holding him for us.
Let's go!

722
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:03,077
Come on. Let's go!

723
01:21:03,142 --> 01:21:06,853
<i>A bomb destroyed a school bus
with at least 25 children inside.</i>

724
01:21:23,526 --> 01:21:25,428
Allah be with you.

725
01:21:34,966 --> 01:21:38,501
Stay in the drum until you hear
Malak sound the horn.

726
01:22:02,742 --> 01:22:04,661
Remember, wait for the signal.

727
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,645
C.I.A., who's in charge here?

728
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,492
- Sergeant Nelson.
- Where's the suspect?

729
01:22:43,574 --> 01:22:46,724
Somebody sent him down those
stairs in that cabinet over there

730
01:22:46,789 --> 01:22:49,813
but we've got him back upstairs now.

731
01:22:59,846 --> 01:23:03,845
Out. We're gonna question him.

732
01:23:05,302 --> 01:23:08,916
Walker, close that door.

733
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:35,332
Yeah?

734
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:38,389
Mr. Lipton, we just
found something downstairs.

735
01:23:40,469 --> 01:23:44,309
1-3-0-9 Quarterdeck.

736
01:23:44,374 --> 01:23:46,549
Well, let's see if that means anything.

737
01:23:46,613 --> 01:23:48,533
Gimme that.

738
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:57,382
I guess it means something.

739
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:32,005
- What've you got?
- Empty drums.

740
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:35,093
Open up the gate.

741
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:37,076
Go ahead on.

742
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:57,748
- Any activity?
- There are people inside.

743
01:24:57,814 --> 01:25:01,189
But nobody's come out.
We're moving our people into position.

744
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:05,220
<i>We're in position.</i>

745
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,437
Hit it.

746
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,836
F.B.I.!

747
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:21,044
Freeze it! Search the house.

748
01:25:52,598 --> 01:25:54,548
Look at this.

749
01:25:54,614 --> 01:25:56,533
The theater.

750
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:05,252
Bingo.

751
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:12,069
Yeah, that's what killed
those people in Bhopal.

752
01:26:16,549 --> 01:26:20,229
Hey. Come here.
Where is that plant?

753
01:26:21,398 --> 01:26:23,861
Where is that plant?

754
01:26:26,374 --> 01:26:28,293
Find that plant.

755
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:38,629
Can you sign it?

756
01:27:19,285 --> 01:27:23,108
Come on, come on, man. How many
plants can there be storing that stuff?

757
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:27,860
Look at this. They rented
an armored car this morning.

758
01:27:27,925 --> 01:27:31,860
Lipton! Sendrax Chemicals.
El Segundo.

759
01:27:46,614 --> 01:27:48,469
Hey, who the hell are you?

760
01:27:48,534 --> 01:27:50,212
Hey, man...

761
01:27:53,237 --> 01:27:55,748
Shit, man.

762
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:10,660
That looked like Randall.
That son of a bitch. Drive!

763
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:26,420
That is him.

764
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:38,212
Kill the truck driver!

765
01:28:53,973 --> 01:28:56,580
We got the right place.
It's already started.

766
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:59,332
Do we have men in the area?
Good.

767
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:02,004
Let's secure the area around
the methyl isocyanate tank.

768
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,996
- Keep 'em away from there.
- Come on. Get us out of this mess.

769
01:29:26,837 --> 01:29:29,173
The horn. Now!

770
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:45,397
Secure this area!
Take your positions!

771
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:57,973
The horn!

772
01:30:18,886 --> 01:30:21,268
- Hit it.
- No.

773
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,141
- We'll do it ourselves.
- Jamilla, hit it!

774
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:25,027
- No!
- Turn!
- No!

775
01:30:25,093 --> 01:30:26,916
Turn!

776
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,044
Here he comes!

777
01:31:33,253 --> 01:31:35,173
Hey. Did we get Malak?

778
01:31:35,237 --> 01:31:38,932
Some guy was chasing him in a semi.
We still don't know where they are.

779
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:11,444
Malak.

780
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:19,445
Get up!

781
01:34:26,821 --> 01:34:28,868
- That's good.
- Kill me, Randall!

782
01:34:34,036 --> 01:34:36,436
- Kill me!
- No.

783
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:38,645
Kill me, or I'll kill you!

784
01:34:39,813 --> 01:34:43,236
Kill me.

785
01:34:44,565 --> 01:34:47,204
Kill me.

786
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:50,676
Kill me, Randall.

787
01:34:50,741 --> 01:34:55,092
- No. No.
- Come on.

788
01:34:55,157 --> 01:34:59,156
- No.
- You son of a bitch.

789
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:26,516
Kill me.

790
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:32,244
I am not a criminal.
I'm a soldier.

791
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:36,435
And I deserve to die like a soldier!

792
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:43,844
You're no soldier.

793
01:35:51,685 --> 01:35:54,692
You're a fly on a pile of shit.

794
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:05,284
Look over there!

795
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:21,540
- You have some explaining to do.
- We all have some explaining to do.

796
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:37,924
Like I told you, whatever you need.

797
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:50,340
It's less than a week,
and he's still alive.

798
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:53,364
You owe me some money.

799
01:36:53,429 --> 01:36:55,332
Where shall I send the check?

800
01:36:57,781 --> 01:37:02,100
Send the $250.000 to the widow...

801
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:12,052
of detective sergeant
Danny Quintz.

802
01:37:16,757 --> 01:37:18,676
I'll pick up the bonus myself.

803
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:43,412
Fuck the bonus!

804
01:37:43,477 --> 01:37:45,716
Grenade!

805
01:37:48,676 --> 01:37:52,052
Randall!

806
01:37:53,717 --> 01:37:56,532
- Randall, you son of a bitch!
- Leave him alone!

807
01:37:56,597 --> 01:37:58,612
Leave him the fuck alone!
