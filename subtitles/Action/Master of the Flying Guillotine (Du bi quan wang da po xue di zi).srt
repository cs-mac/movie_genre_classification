Criminal caught red-handed. Ah Fei, turn on the siren. After him!

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,080
Guy on the bike, stop!

30
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,370
Police!

31
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,630
Get closer to him!

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,370
Wang Qiangda, stop!

33
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,850
I know you can hear me!

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
Police! You're still biking?

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,670
Stop! Wait!

36
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,260
He's terrible.

37
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,290
Why are you looking at me? Keep driving!

38
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,650
Where's that weird guy?

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,890
Over there! In front! After him!

40

Stop!

42
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,020

43
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,070
This is the worst!

Everyone, freeze! Police! Men to the left, women to the right!

45

The one writing on the board, get against the wall!

46
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,220
What are you doing?

47
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,130
I've been practicing that for a long time. Can't you just let me say it?

48
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,480
You can go inspect around the clubs. It'll be faster.

49
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,820
What's so urgent?

50
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,590
Turning on the siren... Using a public utility for personal reasons.

51
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,770
It wasn't for personal reasons. There's an urgent matter this time.

52
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,360
We picked up a conversation by the drug trafficking syndicate, but they spoke in code.

53
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,250
All we know is the deal's going down today. The time and location is unconfirmed.

54
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,740
Did you track their cellphones?

55
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,630
They're too cunning to use cellphones!

56
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,970
Right, so why are you asking me about it?

57
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,860
I want you to listen to part of the recording.

58
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,800
Maybe we can figure out the relative position.

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,170
And I heard that the seller is someone named Black Ghost.

60
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,040
From my investigation, he's related to the case from that year.

61
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,360
<i>Daddy, what's wrong? Hurry, wake up!</i>

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,270
<i>Daddy!</i>

63
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,740
It's the sound of a car accelerating.

64
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,430
There's a traffic signal nearby.

65
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,600
7-Eleven's door chime. And FamilyMart's as well.

66
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,080
<i>A siren sounds suddenly.</i>

67
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,070
There's a fire station nearby. When the vehicles leave, their siren turns on.

68
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,630
The codes that comes up most frequently are "hen" and "eggs."

69
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,160
They must be the money and the drugs.

70
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,730
Finish before the brats arrives.

71
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,450
The signal is an upside-down cup.

72
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,190
There's a high school nearby.

73
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,670
Time is between 4:30 and 5. Location, a coffee shop.

74
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,230
Awesome. Thank you, Master Qiang.

75
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,380
Thank you so much.

76
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,560
Hey, Ah Fei, you need to find

77
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,730
a coffee shop by a street that has both a 7-Eleven and a FamilyMart,

78
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,960
and check if there's a fire station and high school nearby.

79
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Hurry.

80
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,060
So, how do you know this Black Ghost is involved with that year's case?

81
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,650
I can't reveal the details.

82
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,900
But I can tell you that Black Ghost was involved with Zhan Dingxuan before.

83
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,040
You're resigning?

84
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,470
Because of that joke I played online?

85
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,800
It's not that serious.

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,770
Listen, I can help you clear your name.

87
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,150
- I'll say that I posted it.
- I've already decided.

88
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,280
Hello? Yes.

89
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,580
Yeah. Okay, I got it.

90
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,970
We've narrowed it down to three possible locations. We'll split up to check.

91
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,940
- Hey...
- I'm going, too.

92
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
Let's leave catching the criminals to the professionals, okay?

93
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,320
Just wait here for my news.

94
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,230
Don't act impulsively. Just wait. Be good.

95
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,410
Yes. Okay, pick me up first.

96
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,350
I won't wait.

97
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,050
Did you get the shot yet?

98
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,980
Which one is Black Ghost?

99
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,960
You're sure this is the place? You verified the other two spots?

100
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,280
One has a restaurant without a business, and the coffee shop at the other...

101
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,690
Okay, okay. Photograph all the customers here and then send them to my tablet.

102
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,270
Okay.

103
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,550
Qiangda, what are you doing here?

104
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,500
How's the situation?

105
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,970
I told you to leave this to the professionals--

106
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,300
The prosecutor and I are determining who Black Ghost is.

107
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,000
A man, around 40 years old.

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,240
He should be by himself, and he'll only order one cup of coffee.

109
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,000
Miss Sun.

110
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,640
Miss Sun, this jade cicada is authentic.

111
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,950
It feels gentle in your hand, and the color looks natural.

112
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,240
If you meet a true collector, I'm sure you'll get at least 10,000 USD for it.

113
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,090
You're truly an exceptional antiques appraiser.

114
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,940
Let me show you something even more amazing.

115
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,290
This...

116
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,010
The old devil said he spent 1,35 million TWD (45,000 USD) to buy it.

117
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,990
Here, take a look at it.

118
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,580
Wow... Okay.

119
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,100
What is it? Is there a problem?

120
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,680
Miss Sun, I have to be honest.

121
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,620
There's a problem with the quality of this jade bracelet.

122
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,560
It's not very high grade.

123
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,800
That can't be.

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,460
Take another look. You must be mistaken.

125
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,250
Take another look.

126
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,560
Okay, then let me look at it again more carefully.

Your manners are too lacking.

You won't be able to pay if you break anything on this table.

That's right!

150
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,230
Miss, if I hadn't saved you, you'd be on your way to the hospital right now.

151
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,140
You should be thanking me, not making me a scapegoat.

152
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,290
Hey! If you hadn't saved me, I would have caught the bracelet, and it wouldn't have broken.

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,250
So you have to take on half of the responsibility!

Are you part of some kind of fraud group?

There's nothing to discuss here. I need to leave now.

157
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,460
- You—
- You can't leave! How are you going to repay me?!

158
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,410
How are you going to repay me?

159
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,750
All right, let's not tug at each other. It doesn't look good.

160
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,630
- Let's talk at the police station.
- Who are you?

161
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,730
Public Prosecutor Tie Bufan.

162
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,800
- I want to sue her for damages!
- I want to sue him for damages!

163
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,840
Let's deal with it at the station. Let's go.

164
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,620
Are you going to talk or not?

165
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,800
Officer, I've already told you everything I know.

166
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,600
I really don't know anyone named Black Ghost or White Ghost.

167
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,560
I lost a lot in this, too. Can I apply for state reimbursement?

168
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,770
Forget reimbursement!

169
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,230
Miss Sun, I didn't say I wouldn't pay.

170
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,510
But shouldn't this man also take part of the responsibility?

171
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,870
Moreover, though your bracelet may be A-grade,

172
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,890
considering its quality, it isn't worth 1,35 million TWD.

173
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,300
What are you saying?

174
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,960
Prosecutor, help us resolve this.

175
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,930
She broke my bracelet, and now she's mocking me like this.

176
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,690
Do you think that makes sense?

177
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,460
Miss Sun, I'm not mocking you. I'm telling you the truth.

178
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,770
The quality of this bracelet is very problematic.

179
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,520
Quit pretending to be handsome.

180
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,890
Okay, we can take care of this matter. This bracelet...

181
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,710
I think what you said makes sense.

182
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,360
This man should take some responsibility. Let's talk.

183
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,160
Mister...

184
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,170
Miss Sun, you can have the bracelet appraised by a third party.

185
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,520
There's no reason to turn this into a big issue.

186
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,160
You two are a pair of thieves, aren't you? I won't be scared off.

187
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,520
I want to turn this into a big issue!

188
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay, then I'll say it directly.

189
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,220
With the exception of your thumbs, your remaining eight fingers have different ring marks.

190
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,490
This shows that you often change your rings, because you wear different rings with different companions.

191
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,640
Today, you're carrying a name-brand purse, which costs upwards of a few hundred thousand,

192
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,920
but you're wearing a pair of very ordinary shoes, and they look pretty old.

193
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,280
That's because your only appointment today was with Miss Wang,

194
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,270
so you only picked out an expensive-looking bag, without much care to the rest.

195
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,810
What's your point?

196
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,510
In your house, you have a lot of expensive brands, but you also have a lot of inexpensive items.

197
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,880
That's because you need to adjust your outfits when you ask men for money.

198
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,920
And the fact that you're having this 1,35 million dollar gift appraised

199
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,370
means that you receive money, not feelings.

200
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,670
- Prosecutor!
- Yes?

201
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,200
How long do I have to listen to his crap?

202
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Miss Sun, I suggest that you not make this a bigger ordeal.

203
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,510
There are actually a lot of reporters in the police station.

204
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,560
If this news gets out, it won't be good for you.

205
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,730
I...

206
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,400
- I just want justice.
- Great.

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,930
The appraiser you invited is here with us.

208
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,260
Please evaluate how much this bracelet is worth.

209
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,160
It's true that this is natural Myanmar jade, but it has defects.

210
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,380
It's only worth 200,000 TWD (66,000 USD).

211
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,560
- What?
- And that's before it was broken.

212
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,270
200,000 it is then. Miss Sun, do you have any problems with that?

213
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,500
What kind of joke are you playing?

214
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,370
If we can't come to a consensus on the compensation, I suggest we send the bracelet to a third part for appraisal.

215
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,050
But with all the news online recently, I don't think it's a good idea.

216
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,730
You're really bullying someone here.

217
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,290
Fine. Then 500,000.

218
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,830
- 200,000.
- 400,000.

219
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,820
- 190,000.
- 200,000.

220
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,140
- 180,000.
- 200,000.

221
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,760
If it's not 200,000, I'm going to die right here!

222
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,160
- 200,000 it is then.
- Great!

223
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,500
Everyone's satisfied! Let's write down a contract.

224
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,310
Amiability brings fortune. No need to get angry.

225
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,940
All right, sign here.

226
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,660
Ah Fei, make some tea!

227
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,170
Okay, you're Party A, and you're Party B.

228
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,760
Here. Sign your names.

229
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,250
Consider it my bad luck!

230
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,610
You're leaving? You don't want your tea?

231
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,410
Ah Fei, forget the tea!

232
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,260
What rotten luck.

233
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,070
Prosecutor, you need to uphold justice for me! This man needs to take on half the responsibility!

234
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,780
The bracelet breaking was a matter of probability. Why do I need to be responsible?

235
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,360
- You!
- Enough!

236
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,820
Miss Wang, leave this to me.

237
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,210
Mr. Wang, I think that...

238
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,940
What is it, Xiao Tie?
(Xiao is an affectionate prefix, usually for someone younger)

239
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,850
Call me "Prosecutor."

240
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,500
By saving Miss Wang, the bracelet ended up breaking.

241
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,110
So Miss Wang has every right to request that you take some responsibility.

242
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,390
The right to request I take responsibility?

243
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,640
From my calculations, even if I hadn't saved you, the chance of you catching the bracelet was less than 10%.

244
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,750
If you're so good at calculating, why don't you go calculate fate (fortune telling)?

245
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,630
You should at least take responsibility for 10%.

246
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,410
She's a young lady. You should have some compassion for women.

247
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,980
I just brought the compensation of the bracelet down from 1,35 million to 200,000.

248
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,630
That's an 86% savings, much greater than this 10%.

249
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,600
Really? Let me calculate it.

250
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,780
You need to calculate that?

251
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,980
You know that I haven't even calculated about that nonsense you posted online.

252
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,740
<i>Qiangda! Where is he?</i>

253
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>Professor Wang, this question's really hard. Please help!</i>

254
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,350
<i>Even my cram school teacher didn't know how to solve it. Isn't this too extreme?</i>

255
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,500
<i>If a cram school can solve this,</i>

256
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,300
<i>then I'll go to class there.</i>

257
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,400
When you have news about Black Ghost, find me.

258
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,350
Hey! We're not done here yet! Where are you going?!

259
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,080
Prosecutor, how can this person not take responsibility?

260
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,890
Since Mr. Wang isn't directly involved in this case, we can't keep him here.

261
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,290
But you can't just let him go either! This is about 200,000 dollars!

262
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,420
Actually, the two of us are old classmates, good friends, and roommates.

263
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,080
I'll convince him.

264
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,500
Okay. Then I'll ask for your help, Prosecutor.

265
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,420
Call me Tie Bufan, or brother Xiao Tie if you'd like.

266
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,230
After midnight, just call me Tie.

267
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,990
Niuniu, come here.

268
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,570
- How did you injure your foot?
- Ah, just a small car accident. It's fine.

269
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,220
Take a look.

270
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,870
Professor Wang, this video proves

271
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,230
that one of our students at Changtai solved this.

272
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,100
Once we posted the video, the entire cram school industry shared it like crazy.

273
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,120
Everyone was congratulating me for finding such a famous teacher. I mean, a master.

274
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,370
The phone was off the hook all day.

275
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,210
Who is this student?

276
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,320
The student? I don't know who he is.

277
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
He purposefully kept his face from showing.

278
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,540
But if you come to class, Professor Wang, you should be able to find him.

279
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,060
- I'm very interested in this student.
- Is that so?

280
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,460
Don't worry. I'll fulfill the promise I made online.

281
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,540
This is great! You can teach the specialized advanced class.

282
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,210
But I'll only teach for one semester.

283
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,310
Professor Wang, don't worry.

284
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,930
I won't be stingy with the pay. Don't kill the words off so soon (to be firm).

285
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,920
The words we speak are neither dead nor alive.

286
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,670
Words simply express things we can and cannot do.

287
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,590
Yes, yes, Professor Wang, you're right.

288
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,110
Things are either "yes" or "no."

289
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,410
This isn't a university, and I'm not here for a lecture, so please don't address me as "Professor."

290
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,680
Teacher Wang.

291
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,770
- Niuniu, bring that over. You know what I mean?
- Of course.

292
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,810
Teacher Wang, printing it like this is amazing.  Isn't that so?

293
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,600
Yes.

Isn't this that guy?

Open enrollment for the top math teacher.

"Taiwan Fields Medal recipient."

"University math professor."

"Declined position as research fellow at Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics."

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,460
So he's a teacher at a cram school.

305
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,710
He brought himself to this point.

306
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,550
And he's an irresponsible miser.

307
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,160
You're done for.

308
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,310
Master Qiang, come out for a late-night snack.

309
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,000
I brought you a late-night snack, Master Qiang.

310
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,730
Hey!

311
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,820
The food goblin's come out, huh?

312
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,440
You're really amazing. You can eat from the same place every day.

313
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,080
Can you be more accurate with your words? Liking it and having to eat it every day are different.

314
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,100
If you have to be accurate and precise with everything, it gets tiring!

315
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,310
Accuracy decreases the rate of failure.

316
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,750
And it saves you time and energy.

317
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,450
Speaking of. Do you have any news about Black Ghost?

318
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,350
Unfortunately, no.

319
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,390
The person we arrested really doesn't know Black Ghost.

320
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,020
It was just a simple transaction.

321
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,970
This trail was a dead end.

322
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,640
All right, enough with that face.

323
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,270
Know when to let things go. Don't get tied up in that case.

324
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,320
I'll get you something to drink.

325
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,740
The only thing I pick up and won't let go of are chopsticks.

326
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,570
Hey, food goblin, drink some juice to quench the fire.

327
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,480
Oh, the food goblin's already finished his late-night snack.

328
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,660
Prosecutor, I'll leave the investigating to you.

329
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,580
He doesn't even wait to eat with you.

330
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,770
I don't wait.

331
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,880
Find some clues.

332
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,270
"Find some clues."

333
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,890
<i>[Top-Quality Teachers: Changtai Tutorial Classes]
[Strongest lineup in all subjects]</i>

334
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,300
Excuse me, I'm looking for Wang Qiangda.

335
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,710
The line is downstairs for a sit-in.

336
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,580
I'm not a high school student.

337
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,060
Of course, I know that, but it's the same for parents.

338
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,100
Line up to register. The sit-in lecture is this evening.

339
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,770
The sit-in lecture isn't until this evening?!

340
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,050
But the line downstairs already goes out the door.

341
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,720
Of course. Wang Qiangda is the highest-salaried math teacher here.

342
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,200
Ordinary people might not know, but he's very famous in math circles.

343
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,580
Oh, I see.

344
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,440
<i>Now what? I have to wait until this evening.</i>

345
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,890
<i>Should I just ask the prosecutor?</i>

346
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,210
<i>But that prosecutor was kind of weird.</i>

347
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,210
<i>I should just go find Wang Qiangda later.</i>

348
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,460
Niuniu, prepare more registration forms. There will be a lot of people later.

349
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,290
Okay. Boss, be careful with your foot like that.

350
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,500
What? I just injured my foot. Everything else is in perfect working order!

351
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,060
Doesn't this painting have such character?

352
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,100
Yes.

353
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,960
When I first saw this painting,

354
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,310
I just felt so touched by it, like you feel now.

355
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,690
I decided right then, that no matter the cost, I would buy it!

356
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,430
And look. This is an authentic piece.

357
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,600
It was worth the price, worth the investment.

358
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,950
This is copy.

359
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,010
A copy?

360
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,120
But it's not a forgery.

361
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,380
The copy artist kept their own charm and grace.

362
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,480
You can see this in various brush strokes.

363
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,710
B-But...

364
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,400
Are you sure it's a copy?

365
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,540
<i>Daddy, what are you painting?</i>

366
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,350
<i>Xiao Wei, I'm trying to analyze the original painter's emotions.</i>

367
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,440
<i>Then I paint those out with my brush.</i>

368
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,780
<i>This way, our souls can communicate with people from long ago.</i>

369
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,510
<i>Understand?</i>

370
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,300
That's why, at first glance, it looks authentic.

371
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,930
But the copy artist maintained their own style in the details.

372
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,220
If you have someone appraise it, they'll be able to tell you.

373
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,870
I...

374
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,630
I bought a fake?

375
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,080
A-And I even hung it at the entrance?

376
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,450
It's not a fake!

377
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,640
It can speak to you.

378
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,900
You can communicate with it and feel touched.

379
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,410
All of that is real.

380
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,010
That's what's important!

381
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,510
<i>The way this crazy girl talks about it, she seems to really like the painting.</i>

382
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,670
<i>Maybe I can re-sell it to her for a high price.</i>

383
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,760
Boss, the history teacher who was supposed to report in today isn't coming.

384
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,090
Not coming? Why?!

385
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,610
She was poached by World Tutorial Classes.

386
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,750
What?!

387
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,190
Wang Qiangda is joining today!

388
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,970
Mandarin, English, math, natural sciences, and social sciences!

389
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,780
All the subjects are set! How can we be missing one now?!

390
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,380
Everything's ruined now!

391
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,860
That vile, wicked, shameless Li Dashi!

392
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,180
No need.

393
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,680
Is someone badmouthing me?

394
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,230
What should we do?

395
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,500
L-Let me think. L-Let me think, won't you?

396
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,420
<i>Goodness, is this the job God arranged for me?</i>

397
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,180
<i>My boss is soulmates with my dad,</i>

398
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,420
<i>and I'll be near Wang Qiangda to settle our account.</i>

399
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,020
<i>If he doesn't cooperate, I'll just ask the boss to deduct it from his salary.</i>

400
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,040
Boss, sorry to interrupt, but I haven't introduced myself yet.

401
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,460
My name is Wang Qiangwei,

402
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,200
and as chance has it, I'm originally a high school history teacher.

403
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,410
Of course, I can also teach geography.

404
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,670
When I taught, I was earnest and enthusiastic.

405
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,520
Teachers and students alike, all had praises.

406
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,650
<i>The students especially. They were just too adorable.</i>

407
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,630
<i>During class, they were very eager.</i>

408
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,380
<i>When I marked their homework, I was very happy.</i>

409
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,720
<i>After class, they would surround me to ask questions.</i>

410
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,170
<i>Their exam scores were, of course, very ideal.</i>

411
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,230
<i>That environment was just too comfortable.</i>

412
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,620
<i>I hoped to prove myself in the competitive arena of cram courses.</i>

413
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,330
It's such a coincidence that you're looking for a geography teacher.

414
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,590
If you find me suitable, I'd very much like to take this chance.

415
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,780
<i>Goodness, is this my chance to recover my losses?</i>

416
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,940
<i>She can fill in the position, and I can sell her that fake painting.</i>

417
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,830
<i>If she doesn't have the money, I can just deduct it from her salary.</i>

418
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,840
You! You're in!

419
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,500
- Really?!
- Yes!

420
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,460
Welcome! Get ready for tonight's sit-in lecture.

421
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,160
Niuniu, get her picture on the poster!

422
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,560
Understood! Teacher Wang, please provide a photo.

423
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,930
Thank you, Boss!

424
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,560
Good luck!

425
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,080
Are you sure Wang Qiangda will pass by this way?

426
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,340
My source is very reliable.

427
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,580
He's coming.

428
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,110
This side!

429
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,020
Would you like to join World Tutorial Classes?

430
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,180
Do you know what you're doing?

431
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,210
Let me show you!

432
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,570
Hello! I'm from World Tutorial Classes!

433
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,730
Get in front, block his way. Okay?

434
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,230
Great. I have to do my best with this chance.

435
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,050
- Sorry, I'm in a rush.
- No problem.

436
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,900
Looks like the guy who had a deal with Black Ghost really doesn't know about his whereabouts.

437
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,550
I figured as much.

438
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,330
Someone as careful and cunning as Black Ghost won't be easy to catch.

439
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,950
But there is someone who's rather suspicious.

440
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,310
Should I surveil them?

441
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,550
Hey, don't you only know how to act cool?

442
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,530
You finally want to set yourself straight?

443
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,150
You're even taking the initiative to catch a suspect?

444
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,620
Looks like I didn't waste my time teaching you after all.

445
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,730
Who is it?

446
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,970
The clues are in there.

447
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,470
These...

448
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,210
After looking through the photos, I thought about it.

449
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,090
Miss Qiangwei and Black Ghost sat at adjacent tables.

450
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:58,980
And of all the tables, Black Ghost knocked into hers.

451
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,740
I think that Miss Qiangwei surely knows something.

452
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,240
Hearing Miss Qiangwei's name coming out of your face makes me uncomfortable.

453
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,370
Are you going to monitor someone or pick up a girl?

454
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,360
- What's that mean?
- What's that mean?

455
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,740
And you're missing a photo.

456
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,280
A close-up. She's pouting and super cute.

457
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,640
What's that mean?

458
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,960
You took it. Hand it over.

459
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,860
- Boss, I don't have it.
- Don't have it?

460
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,750
If I find it, you're dead.

461
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,200
Boss, I'm going.

462
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,160
- Do you have it or not?
- Remember that I developed the photos.

463
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,500
If you want one...

464
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,670
- If I find it, you're dead!
- ...you should develop your own copy.

465
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,520
You could have just developed an extra copy for me!

Yes, my kid's really excited for Teacher Wang's class.

480
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,500
He's really amazing.

481
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,480
Yeah, I heard the lines were really long.

482
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,620
Teacher Wang, this way.

483
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,090
Wow, the classroom's really big.

484
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,530
Wang Qiangwei!

Boss Yan really helped me.

486
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,020
I have to work hard!

487
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,730
This is too excessive.

488
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,660
Look at this.

489
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,200
Is there a need to treat the new guy this well?

490
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,880
Is he treating us like we're air?

491
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,910
We're air, nothing. Is that it?

492
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,130
Teacher Side, what do you think?

493
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,820
Teacher Side?

494
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,270
What are you scared of? If you're capable, just be competitors.

495
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,080
Finally, you're making sense.

496
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,490
Sometimes, I feel that Old Yan—

497
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,530
Hurry, hurry. Teacher Wang Qiangda will arrive soon.

498
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,070
Let's all welcome our new colleague, okay? Teacher Side--

499
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,070
Old Yan, considering our friendship—

500
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,230
We can only create the right atmosphere if we have a lot of people.

501
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,050
Hey, where's Old Gu? Go find him.

502
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,800
Old Yan, I actually think the new guy—

503
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,490
Hello? Yes.

504
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,630
Yes.

505
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,880
A hundred. A hundred apple pies. Right.

506
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,490
The students and parents are all here. Hurry.

507

And don't forget to bring the drinks.

508
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,930
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this sit-in lecture.

509
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,390
Let me introduce myself.

510
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,660
My name is Wang Qiangwei.

511
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,590
Wang, like a dog goes "wang wang" ("woof woof").

512
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,770
Qiangwei, like the very beautiful rose.

513
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,120
Goodness, what's going on?

514
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,150
Hurry, get down.

515
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,150
♫ <i>If I don't love you, who would I love?</i> ♫
♫ <i>What do I mean to you?</i> ♫

516
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:52,630
♫ <i>I'm not retreating, I won't retreat</i> ♫

517
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,590
Goodness, what's going on?

518
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,760
Hurry, get down.

519
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,580
Get down?

520
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,980
Be careful! Don't get that dirty! The red carpet!

521
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,670
The carpet.

522
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,930
What's on the board? Southern Song? Northern Song? Niuniu!

523
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,030
Hurry and clean the board! You got it wrong!

524
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,060
Teacher Wang isn't in this room. How could you mess it up?

525
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,900
Boss, what's going on?

526
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,860
Sorry, but the history lecture doesn't have that many people.

527
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,000
So you won't be using this classroom.

528
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,500
- But, I—
- It's fine. Niuniu!

529
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,910
I'll clean the board. Take Teacher Wang to the room next door.

530
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,520
Got it! Teacher Wang, this way.

531
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,990
Just wait a moment. I'll clean the board.

532
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,030
Teacher, can you do this quickly?

533
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,910
I want to check out if the math class still has any spots left.

534
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,850
Math?

535
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,710
Me too. Because the math class is pretty full.

536
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,790
Okay!

537
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,860
This classroom is small, so I'll just speak without the microphone.

538
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,830
Things are a little awkward, aren't they?

539
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,050
That's okay. I'll tell a joke for all of you.

540
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,060
Taiwan has black bears, Sichuan has pandas.

541
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,220
Then, what kind of bears does a hospital have?

542
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,840
I'll tell you then.

543
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,550
The answer is psychiatric patients.
(The words all end with "xiong")

544
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,690
Don't you guys think it's funny?

545
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,770
Wang Qiangwei, this is just the first day.

546
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,090
It will get better after this!

547
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,030
Or you can just use a different joke.

548
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,030
I can do this!

549
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,480
The teacher's here!

550
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,700
Everyone, Teacher Wang Qiangda!

551
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,740
<i>[Wang Qiangda]</i>

552
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,400
I'm Wang Qiangda. Are you all ready?

553
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,840
Wow, is this Wang Qiangda really that amazing?

554
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,390
Excuse me.

555
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,290
Excuse me. Sorry.

556
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,560
Excuse me.

557
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,240
Teacher Wang Qiangwei.

558
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,630
Teacher Wang, take a look around.

559
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,110
All the students are taking notes.

560
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,300
Why? Because they know

561
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,750
how rare it is for someone of Wang Qiangda—no, Professor Wang's caliber

562
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,490
to come to our cram school to give a lesson.

563
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,940
The rarer something is, the greater its value.

564
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,780
Look at them all. They're so devoted to their studies.

565
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,000
This is what separates the elite from the ordinary.

566
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,060
Of course.

567
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,420
Of course, students who seek to learn and those who are force-fed learning materials are different.

568
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,590
I'm going to open an elite's class

569
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,300
with increased prices!

570
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,270
Quiet. Focus, focus.

571
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,210
What would this be?

572
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,240
We set an end point here.

573
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,620
Now what is this?

574
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,290
From birth until death,

575
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,550
all the points in time and all the things that happened

576
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,780
accumulate together...

577
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,870
and they form your life.

578
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,050
Everyone has different outlooks on life and different values.

579
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,730
At this point in time, what is the most important thing to you?

580
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,530
Some believe it's money.

581
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,060
Some believe it's accomplishments.

582
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,820
What do you think?

583
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:33,850
I personally believe that the outcomes that I reach

584
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,730
at each point in time

585
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,110
are added together to form my life.

586
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,480
All right, let's start the class.

587
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,110
Does anyone have a question?

588
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,950
- I have a question.
- Go ahead.

589
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,540
But it's not the problem on the board.

590
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,660
Can I go up to write it?

591
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,180
Come up.

592
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:34,920

593
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,460
This student's here to stir up trouble.

594
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,790
I've solved the problem he wrote before. It's very tricky.

595
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,630
Even if I were to solve it, it would take some time.

596
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,150
He probably didn't come with pure intentions.

597
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,820
It's okay. What kind of person is Wang Qiangda?

598
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,640
He's Academia Sinica level!

599
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,050
I can't solve this.

600
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,230
Brilliant.

601
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,350
Ah Xin,

602
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,820
you did a good job this time.

603
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,220
Of course. I was meticulous with hiring this guy.

604
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:38,120
Yan Changtai, you think you can dominate the market just because you got Wang Qiangda?

605
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,610
With me, Li Dashi, around, don't even think about it.

606
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,780
Teacher Wang, you really can't solve it?

607
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,510
The pamphlet said that you're the best on Earth.

608
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,370
I really can't.

Stop streaming!

610
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,680
Because the question is wrong.

611
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,460
You folded the paper a few times.

612
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,960
And you happened to fold it on the subtraction sign, so it wasn't clear.

613
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,880
I knew it!

614
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,920
I trusted Teacher Wang.

00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,480
So? You should teach irrespective of a student's background.

617
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,890
You could have just pointed out where I was wrong.

618
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,020
But you're not a student.

619
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,190
Ordinarily, bakeries wouldn't have their student workers operate the ovens.

620
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,090
But you have burn marks on your arm from the baking trays, old and new.

621
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,520
And your hand is very tender

622
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,780
because you knead bread and your hands are often in contact with yeast.

623
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,560
To put it simply, you've already graduated, and you're working as an apprentice at a bakery, right?

624
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,060
No.

625
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,980
I'm still studying. I want to go to college.

626
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,380
First work, and then go back to school? That's not impossible.

627
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,380
If you take your phone out,

628
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,280
and there's a record of your contacting a nearby cram school,

629
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,600
then your words will be more convincing.

630
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,040
For geographic reasons, a faraway cram school wouldn't need to go to such means.

631
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,130
That means this was set up by a nearby rival.

632
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,660
Huh?

633
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,690
Li Dashi!

634
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,030
You're playing this game again?

635
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,640
Whenever you say you can't solve a problem, I know you're up to no good.

636
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,800
Talk!

637
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,320
Did World Tutorial Classes send you here?!

638
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,970
Take your phone out!

639
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,150
Just let him go.

640
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,420
It's hard work being an apprentice at a bakery.

641
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,090
If he's taking on other jobs, I suspect he has other troubles he can't share.

642
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,120
I'm sorry.

643
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,000
Settle down. Let's continue with the class.

644
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,030
That was amazing!

645
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,480
He's been laughing for five minutes. Is he okay?

646
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,920
It's fine. His record for losing his senses is eight and a half minutes.

647
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,570
What a success!

648
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,230
Teacher Wang, that was so great! I'm so happy!

649
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,660
Oh, let me introduce you.

650
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,540
Our teachers are also your future colleagues.

651
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:48,050
First, I'll introduce our physics and chemistry teacher, Teacher Guo!

652
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,290
He's cleaning.

653
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:54,080
His name's actually Old Honest Guo, but Teacher Guo sounds better.

654
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,040
Next is our top math—

655
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Former top math teacher,

656
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,110
Teacher Zeng Renyi.

657
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,810
If you have any problems at the school, feel free to ask me.

658
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,660
Next is our beautiful and refined English teacher,

659
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,470
Lian Side.

660
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,430
Hello.

661
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:27,630
If a woman extends her arm, a gentleman should shake her hand.

662
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,650
Manners make the man. Haven't you watched Kingsmen?

663
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,320
Sorry, I don't have this custom.

664
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,250
Okay.

665
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,730
You'll have to get accustomed, because we'll be colleagues.

666
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,710
How conceited.

667
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,650
And finally, our history teacher, Teacher Wang Qiangwei.

668
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,140
No need for introductions. We've already met.

669
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,170
♫ <i>If I don't love you, who would I love?</i> ♫
♫ <i>What do I mean to you?</i> ♫

670
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,000
♫ <i>I'm not retreating, I won't retreat</i> ♫

671
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,790
And finally, our history teacher, Teacher Wang Qiangwei.

672
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,350
No need for introductions. We've already met.

673
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,140
Yes. I didn't expect you to also be a teacher.

674
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,020
Yeah. I hadn't expected

675
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,710
that the world's best teacher and a math professor

676
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,150
would cause an accident and then run away without taking any responsibility.

677
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,330
You don't live up to your fame.

678
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,890
Teacher Wang, I'll tell you for the sixth time.

679
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:42,060
The chance was only 10%.

680
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,750
The two of you...

681
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,470
A one-night stand?

682
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,960
No, no! You've misunderstood!

683
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,330
Teacher Wang, I know your math is very good,

684
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,440
but calculating "safe days" isn't really safe.

685
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,360
If you really want to be safe, you have to use a con—

686
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,870
Guarantees have nothing to do with this situation.

687
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,530
Wang Qiangda, aren't you going to say anything?

688
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,780
Take care of your own problems.

689
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,220
You...

690
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,980
Let the past stay in the past. Take hold of the present.

691
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,490
Today's sit-in lecture was very successful.

692
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,810
A bunch of students have already enrolled and paid.

693
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,550
To celebrate this great success, I'll treat everyone to a late meal!

694
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,130
Boss, I haven't cleared things up yet. The two of us really aren't—

695
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,470
Excuse me, I have other matters, so I'll take my leave.

696
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,250
Teacher Wang!

697
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,520
The new guy seems to have a great personality, huh?

698
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,350
He seems skilled.

699
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,590
People with true skills have this kind of temper.

700
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:42,580
It's called pride.

701
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:49,420
Right. He has this lofty aura, like a hero looking down at you.

702
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,220
Proud and aloof, standing above the crowd.

703
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,480
Just like a...

704
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,510
A lion?

705
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,260
A lion. Yes.

706
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,760
The lion, Wang Qiangda.

707
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,520
No, no. The lion king, Qiangda.

708
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,460
Not bad! We can use that on the advertisements.

709
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,650
I'm just a small, little plant here. I'll take my leave.

710
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,970
Teacher Wang, we haven't discussed your salary yet.

711
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,800
And we haven't discussed your sit-in lecture yet.

712
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,010
But I really have another appointment. I only have an hour.

713
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,770
One hour is enough.

714
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,350
I don't treat often. Let's go eat.

715
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,070
True, you never treat.

716
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,540
- Yeah.
- It'll be a long time before it happens again.

717
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,480
Teacher Guo, you clean up.

718
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,510
We won't disturb you. Bye.

719
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,400
Let's go.

720
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,310
Here, here. Cheers!

721
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,360
Xiao Wei.

722
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,710
Cheers, boss.

723
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,460
I'd like to ask if I've been accepted or not.

724
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,520
Yes.

725
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Yes, there's a plan.

726
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,630
The plan is, if you enroll in Wang Qiangda's Math Essentials course,

727
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,120
you also get to take Wang Qiangwei's Comprehensive History course.

728
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,860
It's a package?!

729
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,830
Or you can have a Yo-kai watch.
(manga character)

730
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,690
Yo-kai watch?

731
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,000
Most of the students picked the watch.

732
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,340
But don't be discouraged. Some students still picked your class.

733
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,410
Right, right. So, what about my salary?

734
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,500
Come on, don't ask that kind of question here.

735
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,630
It's so awkward.

736
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:31,090
Old Yan, she just got into the cram school business, so you should be more generous.

737
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,550
Since when were you so considerate?

738
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,790
You pay her salary then.

739
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:39,130
All right, the rest of you, don't look.

740
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,090
This much.

741
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,110
<i>[2,600 TWD (86 USD)/Hour]</i>

742
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,720
<i>[3,000 TWD (100 USD)/Hour]</i>

743
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,240
This much.

744
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,400
<i>[2,700 TWD (90 USD)/Hour]</i>

745
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,340
That's my final offer. No more negotiating.

746
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,120
But I can give you a proposal.

747
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,130
For each additional student who enlists in your class, I'll add 500 TWD (16 USD) to your monthly salary.

748
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:14,700
But first, you have to subtract the students who first enrolled in Wang Qiangda's math class.

749
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,950
You can do the calculation, right?

750
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,770
So, M is the total number of students.

751
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,000
And N is that lion's students?!

752
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,640
Hey, your math's not bad.

753
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,070
I'm the one whose math isn't bad.

754
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,800
Of course, your math's not bad.

755
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,430
It's just not strong (qiangda) enough.

756
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,960
Qiangwei, he's always like that in the beginning.

757
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,830
As long as you're capable though, you don't have to worry about increasing your pay later.

758
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,430
I'll work hard.

759
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,820
Let me toast everyone.

760
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,630
Please take care of me in the future.

761
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,680
Good luck to you all.

762
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:15,910
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
Proud Lions Team @Viki.com</i>

763
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:41,580
I heard from Xiao Qing that you had a lecture at the cram school today.

764
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,500
How was it?

765
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,660
It was fine. I'm still teaching, like before.

766
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,500
Is that so?

767
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,660
There's quite a big difference between a university and a cram school, isn't there?

768
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,220
He's pretty much still just as cool.

769
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,220
He also caught someone trying to stir up trouble.

770
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,360
Why are you coming back so late?

771
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,550
The kids found out that I know Qiangda and kept asking me questions.

772
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,790
We got something to drink before I came back.

773
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,260
Finish eating and head upstairs.

774
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,780
Okay.

775
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,120
Qiangda, please take care of Xiao Qing.

776
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,770
I can only cook. I don't know about anything else.

777
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,490
As long as she wants to learn, of course, I'm willing to teach her.

778
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,690
But what's important is what she finds interesting.

779
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,690
What do kids know about their interests? They just need to study.

780
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,090
Eat slowly. If a girl saw you eating like that, she'd be scared off.

781
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,380
He's a food goblin! And he met...

782
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,320
- Uncle Xun!
- Hello.

783
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,890
- I want the same. Chef's Special.
- Have a seat.

784
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,270
Brother Xiao Tie!

785
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,300
- Hey, there.
- What were you about to say?

786
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,620
I was just about to say that this food goblin met the queen of darkness.

787
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,300
- You've said too much.
- Queen of darkness?

788
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,160
Is she part of a crime syndicate?

789
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,570
Or Qiangda's girlfriend?

790
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,930
Or a video game? Hurry and spill!

791
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,020
Well...

792
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,530
I'll cook you something delicious.

793
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,970
Okay, then I'll tell you!

794
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:24,950
My old classmate and current roommate is a bit eccentric, and he doesn't like crowds.

795
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,910
But he does enjoy eating delicious food.

796
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,670
There's a restaurant where you dine in the dark, and some of their food's pretty good.

797
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,420
This food goblin went to try it out.

798
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,770
But who knew that, while he was trying it out, he would meet this so-called queen of darkness.

799
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,020
<i>That place is pitch black.</i>

800
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,730
<i>You can't even see your fingers on an outstretched hand. Like you're blind.</i>

801
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,630
<i>You have to leave any device that can emit light in the restaurant's care.</i>

802
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,220
<i>The server will guide you to your table with a night-vision device.</i>

803
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,190
<i>If you go to eat alone, there's a chance you'll end up sharing a table.</i>

804
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:01,630
<i>You might not even know who's sitting right across from you.</i>

805
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,240
<i>But maybe because you can't see each other, there's no pressure.</i>

806
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,190
<i>You loosen up.</i>

807
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:20,160
<i>And so, this food goblin very naturally ended up eating with a woman.</i>

808
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,860
<i>In the end, he even got a bit drunk.</i>

809
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:29,440
<i>In a woman's world, "If you love me, you should come find me."</i>

810
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,270
So then what happened?

811
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:45,460
All I know is that that night, this food goblin was both rational

812
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,940
and yet sensitive and romantic.

813
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,790
He had a very pleasant chat with his queen of darkness.

814
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,870
They spoke from the bottom of their hearts and felt like they were floating in the air.

815
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,400
In the end...

816
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,640
What happened?

817
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,160
♫ <i>If I don't love you, who would I love?</i> ♫
♫ <i>What do I mean to you?</i> ♫

818
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,050
♫ <i>I'm not retreating, I won't retreat</i> ♫

819
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,760
He had a very pleasant chat with his queen of darkness.

820
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,000
They spoke from the bottom of their hearts and felt like they were floating in the air.

821
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,430
In the end...

822
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,320
What happened?

823
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,790
I don't know either.

824
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:28,130
<i>Meeting the right person at the wrong time truly is just a fairytale.</i>

825
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,590
<i>I rarely have the chance to talk this much with a stranger.</i>

826
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:39,110
<i>You seem to have filled in the missing piece in my life.</i>

827
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,730
<i>Really?</i>

828
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:47,390
<i>Are you shy...?</i>

829
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,460
<i>Or afraid?</i>

830
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,730
<i>Strangers are too variable. They're not good for calculations.</i>

831
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,110
<i>What does that mean?</i>

832
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,470
<i>Life's very short, and it can't sustain that much unpredictability.</i>

833
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:08,130
<i>But there's a certain beauty to accidents.</i>

834
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:13,230
<i>Many beautiful things happen by chance.</i>

835
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:19,200
<i>In a woman's world, "If you love me, you should come find me."</i>

836
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,070
<i>In a man's world, "If you love me, you won't leave."</i>

837
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,390
<i>So I won't turn back.</i>

838
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,050
<i>So I won't try to make someone stay.</i>

839
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,950
Thank you, Uncle Xun.

840
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,290
So basically, you don't know anything.

841
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,810
No matter how much I asked him, he wouldn't talk.

842
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:51,430
But from all my years of experience, any time he says there's nothing, he's hiding something.

843
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,020
You're crazy. What could happen between two strangers who didn't even see each other?

844
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,920
Really? If that's true, why do you stop by that restaurant every now and then?

845
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,820
Because the food is good.

846
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,820
Is it as good as Uncle Xun's food?

847
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,980
I'm heading up. Goodnight, everyone.

848
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,410
Goodnight.

849
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,160
<i>The time is 11:00 p.m. on the dot.</i>

850
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,670
<i>You're listening to Sophie's Night Sky.</i>

851
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,320
<i>None of us are perfect, but we're all working hard. I'm Sophie.</i>

852
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,410
Hey, don't you think RDR's are the worst?
(Read, Didn't Reply)

853
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,330
Which woman is it this time?

854
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,840
"Which woman?" This is a goddess.

855
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:32,570
By the way, on the topic of the broken jade bracelet...

856
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,690
In the end, "You didn't kill Boren, but Boren died because of you." Shouldn't you do something?

857
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:42,460
The woman who didn't reply to you isn't possibly Wang Qiaowei, is she?

858
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,800
You think she's a goddess, too.  Don't you?

859
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,510
I approve of her not replying to you.

860
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,920
It's better to not get involved with a strange woman like her.

861
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,220
On that subject, it's true the police are partly responsible for the bracelet breaking.

862
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,430
If I were her, I would request for state reimbursement.

863
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,490
Yeah.

864
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,750
This all happened because the police charged into the coffee shop.

865
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,220
She was just an innocent casualty.

866
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,800
Qiangda, why are you getting involved in police cases again?

867
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,090
What happens if you get hurt?

868
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:30,270
Actually, Uncle Xun, I was the one who asked for his help.

869
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:35,770
Qiangda, I still have to tell you that you shouldn't keep getting stuck inside it.

870
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:42,470
Uncle Xun, this involves my dad's reputation and my mom's final wish before she died.

871
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,600
I can't just ignore it, so I have to keep chasing after it.

872
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:55,770
<i>Hello, everyone! Sorry, I'm late! There was a traffic jam.</i>

873
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,380
As if there would be a traffic jam this late at night.

874
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,600
What are you laughing about?

875
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,550
She's making a joke.

876
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:10,210
She's mocking the fact that traffic jams are always the excuse for being late.

877
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,720
Oh... Is that so?

878
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,840
Get off.

879
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,850
I just want to know where your low-level humor lies.

880
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,770
- Stop touching me.
- Ah, is it on your lower half?

881
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:25,180
Good evening, listeners. I'm Dorothy.

882
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,530
Dorothy, you know, everyone was really worried about you.

883
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,440
One after another, they asked "Dorothy, where have you gone?!"

884
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,410
Of course, I was still in Taipei.

885
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:39,990
Did you think I was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, stuck and lost in the Land of Oz?

886
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,870
Yeah.

887
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:45,420
I want to ask our listeners a question.

888
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:50,500
Do you know who likes going to the Land of Oz the most?

889
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,550
Who?

890
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,230
The answer is baseball players!

891
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,970
Why?

892
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:59,920
Because they always slide into the base.

893
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,000
And then the umpire calls "Out!"

894
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:13,070
♫ <i>If I don't love you, who would I love?</i> ♫
♫ <i>What do I mean to you?</i> ♫

895
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:18,280
♫ <i>I'm not retreating, I won't retreat</i> ♫

896
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,870
Baseball players! Because they always slide into the base.

897
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:24,170
And then the umpire calls "Out!"

898
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,650
<i>I hope everyone's not put off by this joke,</i>

899
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,870
<i>and please don't tune out from our station!</i>

900
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:32,650
<i>All right, let's listen to a good song.</i>

901
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:36,100
He can laugh like that from such a rotten joke?

902
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,410
He really likes Dorothy, for whatever reason.

903
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,370
He's some kind of weirdo.

904
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,810
I really don't get it.

905
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,860
Why is this Dorothy person always guesting on the show?

906
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,540
Because her sincerity is so interesting.

907
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,500
Uncle Xun, turn that off or I'm going to break it.

908
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,030
Forget it.

909
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,930
What?

910
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,510
You got a new job?

911
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:12,040
I did.

912
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,940
But I also have a big debt now.

913
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,560
This Dorothy isn't a simple person.

914
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,430
She's a cheerful and optimistic girl.

915
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,800
I see.

916
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,650
She said she was caught in a fire when she was young.

917
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:31,460
Her back and chest are covered in burn scars.

918
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,900
When the Furmosa Fun Coast explosion happened, she shared a lot of her rehabilitation experiences.

919
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,310
It touched a lot of people.

920
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:45,960
Who would have thought that our cold Master Qiang had such a sentimental side?

921
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,120
You sure talk a lot of crap. If you're done, go home.

922
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,750
Be happy!

923
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,910
Being happy's the most important; otherwise, you start spewing crap.

924
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:59,250
Thank you for the delicious meal, Uncle Xun.

925
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,330
I'll take my leave.

926
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,500
Let's go home.

927
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,580
- Let's go.
- You go first.

928
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,780
Bye, Uncle Xun.

929
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,910
<i>When I'm in a bad mood, or I feel upset about something,</i>

930
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:25,310
<i>I find a place where I can see the nightscape but there aren't too many people.</i>

931
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:29,080
There are a lot of options around Taipei.

932
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,830
Jiannan Mountain and Elephant Mountain are both pretty nice.

933
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:38,810
<i>Then shout into the distance, releasing everything you're holding inside.</i>

934

<i>You'll feel a lot better.</i>

935
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,210
<i>Maybe some people will find this a bit silly,</i>

936
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:49,220
<i>but that's because you're really concerned about what others think of you.</i>

937
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,080
<i>These are all invisible forces of stress.</i>

938
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,440
<i>There's a certain beauty to accidents.</i>

939
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,800
<i>Many beautiful things happen by chance.</i>

940
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,070
<i>Let me ask you this. Did you choose your parents?</i>

941
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,320
<i>You didn't, right?</i>

942
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:16,490
<i>So your birth and life up to this day is the most beautiful chance happening.</i>

943
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,140
<i>Why are you pulling it?</i>

944
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,860
<i>Daddy!</i>

945
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,080
<i>But the chance happenings that belong to me aren't beautiful.</i>

946
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,720
<i>They're cruel and repulsive.</i>

947
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:32,400
Wang Qiangda, as a man, you should take responsibility for your actions!

948
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,730
Don't think that you're so high and mighty!
