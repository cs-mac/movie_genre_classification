1
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>Inside of a minute left to
play. The Knights need a big stop here.</i>

2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,695
Motion! Motion!

3
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,325
The

4
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>There's the snap and off goes Devore.
Tries to go off-tackle. Big hit by Jake Tyler.</i>

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,411
Forty-four is killing us.
Get in there and stop him.

6
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,495
You want some of this, bitch?

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,997
Good one, Jake!

8
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,123
It's all good.

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,207
Call it out!

10
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>That is Tyler's 13th
tackle tonight. He is totally in the zone.</i>

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,591
Coming through! Coming through! I got it!

12
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,135
<i>Third down and 10.
Look for the quarterback on...</i>

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,262
- Blue, 32.
- Hut!

14
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,471
<i>There's the snap.</i>

15
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>Pitch is wide to Moore.</i>

16
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,062
<i>And Jake Tyler makes
a big stop at the backfield.</i>

17
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,981
<i>Loss of three yards on the play.</i>

18
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,775
Keep it up, baby!
It ain't gonna change the score.

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,819
<i>Now Tyler and Moore are at
each other's faces.</i>

20
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,488
<i>They have been going at it all night long.</i>

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,909
<i>Lowe deep in the pocket.</i>

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,452
Outside! Outside!

23
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,372
<i>Now slings it out wide to Moore.
Ball's a little high.</i>

24
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,545
<i>Tyler hit Moore on the dead run,
and right down!</i>

25
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,298
<i>This could be it for the Hornets, folks.</i>

26
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,926
You know, it's too bad about your old man.

27
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,641
The sauce. That shit will kill you.

28
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,354
What'd you say? What'd you say?

29
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,526
<i>Tyler and Moore are going at it.</i>

30
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:52,623
Hey, don't sweat it, Jake.
Good luck down there.

31
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,093
- Later, man.
- Dude.

32
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,088
Way to go out with a bang.

33
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,141
- Yeah.
- How's the hand?

34
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,267
I'll be all right.

35
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,103
Hey, come on, everyone's going over
to Harland's.

36
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,425
No, man. I can't.
I still got some packing to do.

37
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,178
I can't believe you're moving
to Disney World.

38
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:15,763
Orlando.

39
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:18,891
Yeah, well, I'd come visit you,
but I'm not eight years old.

40
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,103
Could have fooled me.

41
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:27,775
Maybe I'll meet you out in Daytona
for spring break.

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,319
Yeah. Sure.

43
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:38,035
- Who's gonna keep you out of trouble?
- Who's gonna get you into it?

44
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,123
Later, bud.

45
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,189
- What up?
- Evening feed.

46
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:11,736
It's a contact sport, Mom.

47
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,489
Your coach called.
He told me that you'd been fighting again.

48
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:16,616
You wanna know what the other guy said?

49
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,784
I'm not doing this when we go to Florida,
all right?

50
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,662
Then don't do it,
'cause I'm not gonna play, okay?

51
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:24,707
I'm late. I need you to help Charlie pack.

52
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,001
You guys start on the garage
first thing in the morning, all right?

53
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,252
Damn it, where are my keys?

54
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,004
Everything has to be ready for the movers
the day after...

55
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,007
- Mom, I can do my own packing.
- You see? He can do his own packing.

56
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,802
- Damn, where are my keys?
- I think I saw them over here!

57
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:42,516
Thank you. Bye. Just do it, Jake.

58
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:56,239
Seventy-two. By flying in a V-formation

59
00:04:57,073 --> 00:05:02,995
a flock of geese adds 72% more
flying range than if each bird flew alone.

60
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:05,581
Something about uplift.

61
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,626
1,392.

62
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,463
The number of useless facts in your head.

63
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,715
Miles from here to Orlando.

64
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,804
Do you hate me?

65
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,351
- Because of the move?
- No.

66
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,604
Famous Stampard Tennis Academy
in Orlando?

67
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,815
You better make it to Wimbledon.

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,276
Make it? I'll win it.

69
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,152
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

70
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,404
- No, I got it.
- No, here.

71
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,095
Guess Mom forgot to bring
that one to Goodwill.

72
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,638
I'll get rid of it.

73
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,188
You know, we could just close it,
get behind the wheel.

74
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,398
Nothing but open road
between here and Iowa.

75
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,984
- What about Mom?
- She wouldn't miss us.

76
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,755
- She'd miss me.
- Yeah, that's real funny.

77
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,847
- I got him!
- Here, get him!

78
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,478
You got him.

79
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:02,066
- Get him.
- Hey! Hey! Stop, man!

80
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:09,115
- Hey, I got this. I got this, man. I got this.
- Shit!

81
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:18,041
- Seriously, dude, I think he's got this.
- Damn right!

82
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,255
- Get lost, man!
- Yeah, vacate. You don't want none.

83
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,091
- You all right, bro? Are you ready?
- Yeah!

84
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,801
- Fight!
- Fight!

85
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,512
Get your hands up.

86
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,525
You still with us,
Mr. Tyler? Yeah? Good.

87
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,279
<i>The argument can certainly be made
that The Iliad celebrates war, obviously,</i>

88
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:53,701
but not all the symbols in this poem
support that interpretation.

89
00:08:54,452 --> 00:09:00,875
What symbol or symbols might suggest a
less vainglorious attitude toward warfare?

90
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,919
Anybody?

91
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:09,100
Anybody? Anybody? Ms. Miller?

92
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:18,777
I'm sorry. You lost me at "vainglorious."

93
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:24,199
Come on. You have read the poem, I take it.
Seen the movie, perhaps?

94
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:29,371
That's the Shield of Achilles.

95
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,088
The scenes of normal life depicted

96
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,466
on Achilles' shield suggest
an alternative to war.

97
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,887
Friends or family or what is at stake.

98
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:50,600
Wow! Not bad for your first day, Mr. Tyler.

99
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:55,689
We might all strive to emulate
this kind of preparation and intelligence.

100
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:08,326
Hey, Shield of Achilles, nicely done.
Thanks for the save.

101
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:12,414
- I owe you one.
- No problem.

102
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,959
- I'm Baja.
- Like Mexico?

103
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:19,045
Like my parents smoked too much weed.

104
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:22,882
- I'm Jake.
- So, why the mid-year move?

105
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,012
My brother's a tennis star.
He got a scholarship.

106
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:33,018
Not bad. What about you?
You got any talents?

107
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:36,646
I mean, other than sucking up
in English class.

108
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:40,650
Probably not the smoothest move
on the first day, right?

109
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,694
Probably not.

110
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:47,657
Hey, can you help me find the 3-wing?

111
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,002
- It doesn't exist. Let me see?
- No, it's right there.

112
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,839
Oh, it's the B-wing.

113
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,929
<i>Your handwriting's harder to read
than The Iliad.</i>

114
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,181
Looks like you didn't have
any problem reading it.

115
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:04,724
A book that beat up has got to
be flipped through

116
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,184
at least a couple of times.

117
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:10,522
- Maybe I bought it used.
- Maybe, but I doubt it.

118
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,566
- There you are!
- Hey.

119
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,694
Nice shirt, Kurt Cobain.

120
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:19,865
You are aware it's hotter than Satan's
balls out right now, right? And they're hot.

121
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,491
Guys, give it a rest.

122
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,954
- Let's go, B, the lumberjack bores me.
- Not me.

123
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,343
J, guess what they clocked
my serve at today?

124
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,053
I don't know, 1,000?

125
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,098
- There's food right here, honey.
- I'm sick of eating takeout.

126
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:48,351
- Eighty-five miles per hour.
- That's great, Charlie!

127
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:50,729
- Isn't that great, Jake?
- Yeah.

128
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,816
How's the new school? You like it?

129
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,651
It's great.

130
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,863
Okay, brainiac. Give me the speed
ketchup leaves the bottle.

131
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,498
Not right now, Charlie.

132
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,875
How are the teachers?

133
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,713
- They're great.
- Classes? Other kids?

134
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:11,967
It's great. Everything's great.

135
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:17,180
Living out of boxes.
We're even eating out of boxes.

136
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:20,058
I'd just say everything's just great.

137
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:21,977
You wanna run numbers, Charlie?

138
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:25,188
Four. The number of times that
your brother has had to have stitches.

139
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:28,942
And two. The number of times that he has
been kicked out of school.

140
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:32,988
Six. The number of times I've had to
pick him up from the police station.

141
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,283
Tired of living out of boxes, Jake?
Why don't you try unpacking?

142
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:02,017
Dude! What's up?
You're carb loading. That's pretty smart.

143
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,770
Yo, I'm Max Cooperman.

144
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,482
Crack it.

145
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,653
- Jake Tyler.
- I know.

146
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,822
I also know that there's
a 225-pound football player in Iowa

147
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:17,824
that's happy as hell you moved.

148
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,577
- How'd you know about that?
- Internet, dude.

149
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:23,538
One guy shoots it, the whole world sees it.

150
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,833
Come on.
Tell me you haven't Googled yourself.

151
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:28,969
Look, when you hit my boy out
with that right hook, man,

152
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,013
we did some homework.

153
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:34,641
And your clip, it's starting to
make the rounds, bro.

154
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:38,645
Look, people... People are talking.

155
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:42,232
See, we got it going on here, man.
This is something you must check out.

156
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:45,486
All right, the other day,
when you saw me fighting,

157
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:48,072
that was completely organized.

158
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:52,242
- A totally sanctioned brawl.
- That looked like an ass-kicking to me, bro.

159
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:54,828
I'm getting my chi together.

160
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,706
I'm learning the moves
from one of the masters.

161
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,876
Jean Roqua. Dude trained with the Gracies
back in the day.

162
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,089
Dude was a finalist in the Vale Tudo, right?

163
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,842
Look, check this out.

164
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:13,931
<i>Wait for the right moment.
Position before submission.</i>

165
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:26,026
Look, I appreciate it and all.
I'm not interested.

166
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:31,448
What? Hey, but, dude. I mean, you're...
You could enter the pantheon of greats.

167
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:33,617
We're talking significant social profile here.

168
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,828
I mean, you are a natural born brawler.

169
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:38,622
I'm just not into it, man.

170
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:17,703
- Want a ride?
- No, I'm cool.

171
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:22,925
You sure? We can crank up the AC.
You can wear that flannel.

172
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,681
So, what? Is your car in the shop?

173
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,519
Yeah, yeah. If by shop you mean
showroom, then, yes. It's a new 335.

174
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:35,229
Feel free to go pick it up for me
any time you want.

175
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,231
It's the silver one I cannot afford.

176
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,900
Oh, my God. You are poor!

177
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:44,864
So, there's this party tonight
if you wanna go.

178
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:48,158
- You gonna be there?
- No, no, she's not.

179
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:50,244
She's inviting you to a party
she's not gonna go to.

180
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,037
Does that make sense?

181
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:57,042
Sorry. Here's the address if you wanna go.

182
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,091
See you there?

183
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,510
Yeah. Thanks.

184
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:23,736
The kid was nine. He beat me, 6-3.

185
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,487
So he's younger than you.
You're just getting settled in.

186
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:27,239
You just have to give it time.

187
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:57,603
<i>My compañero!</i>

188
00:16:58,562 --> 00:16:59,897
- Man!
- What?

189
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,983
Whose house is this?

190
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:07,196
That is a good question.
Do you want a beer?

191
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,998
- No, I'm cool.
- No?

192
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:17,949
Drink, bitches!

193
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,353
That's disgusting!

194
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,232
Number one clip on YouTube.

195
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:46,653
- Max!
- I can feel my hit counter rising.

196
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:49,030
I'm gonna shove that camera up your ass.

197
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:50,908
- I'm not here.
- Show's over.

198
00:17:57,046 --> 00:18:00,049
On the dock.
I swear. It was hilarious.

199
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,261
- Yo, Ryan, what up, man?
- My man, Max.

200
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,804
You know I just came to party.

201
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:07,890
- How's it going? Good.
- Right on.

202
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,892
Hey, this is Jake.

203
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,853
- Ryan McCarthy.
- Jake Tyler.

204
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,107
- It's nice to meet you, man.
- Yeah. You, too.

205
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:19,694
You're from Ohio, right?

206
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,363
Due west. It's Iowa.

207
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:27,785
Iowa... Dan Gable,
greatest Olympic wrestler ever.

208
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:31,580
Yeah. The '72 games.
He never surrendered a point.

209
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,332
Exactly, man! Water.

210
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:35,334
Nice catch. Excuse me.

211
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,320
So, what do you make of Orlando?

212
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:40,490
Not really sure, man.

213
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:44,369
I hear you.
You know, I've lived here my whole life,

214
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,996
still don't know how I feel.

215
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:50,834
Bro, chicks wearing bikinis year round.
What's not to know?

216
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:54,379
Little man's got a point.
It can't get much better than this.

217
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:14,733
- Unbelievable!
- Yeah, but this ain't it.

218
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,651
<i>- This ain't what?
- All this American Pie bullshit.</i>

219
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:18,737
<i>- This ain't what?
- All this American Pie bullshit.</i>

220
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,282
No. The real action is lakeside.

221
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,577
Force times mass equals acceleration.

222
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,870
Fight night!

223
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,300
Anyone who wants to fight gets a shot.
Girl on girl.

224
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,059
A little black on brown.

225
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:53,980
And my personal favorite,
battle of the exes.

226
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:56,983
Yo, crazy bitch.

227
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,735
So, what do you think?

228
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,198
This is insane.

229
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,912
- Got anything like this back at home?
- Not even close. Who's in charge?

230
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,374
We are.

231
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:35,796
So? You ready?

232
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,631
Ready for what?

233
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,302
The main event.

234
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:45,598
That would be me and you.

235
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,810
Get the hell out of here, man.
I'm not fighting.

236
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,307
I kind of think you are.

237
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,101
Hey, this is it, fight fans!

238
00:20:57,184 --> 00:21:01,522
Ryan "The Terror" McCarthy
versus Jake "The Gridiron" Tyler.

239
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:02,606
Yeah!

240
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:10,155
- Hold on, man.
- Hey, look, if you wanna be the best,

241
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,324
you gotta take out the best.

242
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,995
I don't wanna be the best.

243
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:21,500
We all saw that video, right?

244
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

245
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,671
That stuff was tight, man.

246
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:29,149
Sincerely, okay? One right hook

247
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,653
and the dude was stone.

248
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:35,322
Hey, Ry, I don't think Iowa's into it.

249
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:41,703
Well, we gotta give the people
what they want.

250
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:46,792
You guys ready to see something?
Yeah!

251
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,460
- You?
- Yeah!

252
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:53,090
I don't want to fight you, man.
I don't want to fight anyone.

253
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:58,595
You don't wanna fight?
Then what the hell are you doing here?

254
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,265
Then what are you doing here?

255
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,766
He's getting cold feet.

256
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:08,822
Oh?

257
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,007
This is awkward.

258
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:33,847
You two have a good night.

259
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:37,601
Ryan, he's...

260
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,104
Where the hell are you going?

261
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,022
Hold up! Hold up, hold up.

262
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,363
I saw the clip, and you can bang, dude.

263
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:51,699
You know what they say about the Internet.

264
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,033
Yes, we do.

265
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,286
So none of that stuff is true, then?

266
00:22:57,663 --> 00:23:00,666
Not even that part about your dad

267
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,678
wrapping his drunk ass around that tree?

268
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,349
You know, I can't figure out, though,

269
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:13,103
is what... What were you doing
in the passenger seat?

270
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,940
Why didn't you just drive?

271
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:20,569
Wow, talk about dropping the ball there.

272
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:29,578
Get off of me!

273
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:32,540
Guess some of that stuff
on the Web is true.

274
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,796
It's okay. You want some gloves, huh?

275
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,090
Yeah. Get the gloves.

276
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:42,508
Yeah!

277
00:23:43,884 --> 00:23:45,177
Come on, baby!

278
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:52,017
Go to war! Play to win.

279
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:56,355
All right, calm down, calm down.
Bring it down, bring it down.

280
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,524
Fight ends with a knockout or a tap out.

281
00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:59,692
You ready?

282
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,694
You ready?

283
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:03,696
Get some, baby!

284
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,206
Nice right.

285
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:31,474
Cheap shot, man.

286
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,937
Iowa, that was a cheap one.

287
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:39,265
But you are good, okay,

288
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,434
and you have a good center of gravity.

289
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,520
But that old-school boxing shit, it just...

290
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,524
I don't know, it doesn't fly around here.
You gotta mix it up...

291
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,904
Stings, right? Bet it does.

292
00:24:56,908 --> 00:25:00,536
Your leg's all jacked up.
Can't put any weight on it, maybe.

293
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:05,917
Now for the bad news.

294
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:10,004
It's gotta end with you looking like a bitch

295
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:12,965
in front of everybody.

296
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:28,731
My boy's rocking!

297
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:34,259
- Get up, get up!
- Get up, farmer!

298
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:41,642
- Knockout! It's a knockout!
- Damn!

299
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:59,117
Damn, you're insane. He's getting up.
He's getting up. He's getting up!

300
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:19,179
You sent him to bed.

301
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:26,728
Dude, stay down. Fight another day, man.

302
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:27,479
Dude, stay down. Fight another day, man.

303
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,612
Hey, Ryan!

304
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,287
You ain't got shit.

305
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,740
Don't worry, man. You're gonna be okay.

306
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,249
There's some roaches here.

307
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,481
You want breakfast?

308
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:37,691
Whoa.

309
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,339
- What about the other guy?
- What about him?

310
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:47,343
- He look worse than you?
- Yeah, maybe before the fight.

311
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:52,515
Hey, try not to say anything to Mom
about this.

312
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:53,933
Like I need to.

313
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,357
- Can you find your way to the bus?
- The big yellow thing?

314
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:03,943
Good man.

315
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,239
Good man.

316
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:13,244
Oh, my God, that new kid
got his ass handed to him.

317
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,748
The flannel kid, Ryan wrecked the dude.
He kicked his ass.

318
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:25,965
What's wrong with her?

319
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:35,368
- What do you want, Charlie?
- It's Max Cooperman

320
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,955
and Baja Miller.

321
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,667
Too easy.

322
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:51,884
- Way to commit to the move.
- What do you want, Max?

323
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,805
Well, you blew off school, man.

324
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:58,975
Trying to get an early jump
on the weekend.

325
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:05,148
Look, there wasn't a lot you could do, man.
I mean, Ryan, he's got crazy skills.

326
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:09,193
His dad's a psychopath.
He had him in karate before he could crawl.

327
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:14,157
But you, dude. You had heart.
It's inspiring even.

328
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,870
What's that?

329
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:22,582
This is just some of the best
mixed martial arts you'll ever see.

330
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,942
I told you I'm not into that UFC stuff.

331
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:26,695
Yeah, I got that impression last night.

332
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:31,449
Look, man, you gotta throw in some
Muay Thai, you know. Have a ground game.

333
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:35,662
Which is why I'm extending
this invitation to you again.

334
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,418
Dudes on that disk all train with the guy
I told you about.

335
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,628
My teacher, Jean Roqua.

336
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:48,800
All right, and with some technique,
bro, you can do what I can never do.

337
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:51,469
Achieve greatness.

338
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:55,056
Achieve an exit, please.

339
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:58,977
Dude, you're gonna tell me last night
didn't leave you twisted?

340
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,355
- Nope.
- Nobody can get their ass beat like that

341
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,025
- and not care.
- I can.

342
00:31:07,277 --> 00:31:10,113
- Well, then hide in here.
- Maybe I will.

343
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,115
I bet under the bed's pretty safe, bro.

344
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,576
- You know, I bet it is.
- Whatever, dude.

345
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,981
Cool, man! How'd you find the club?

346
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:50,695
- The address on the DVD. It was real subtle.
- Yeah, hey, check it out. That's Roqua.

347
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:54,074
In trouble? Change your position.
Now, see, you got me.

348
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:56,535
It's hurting me, hurting me.

349
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,208
Right? And squeeze.

350
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:07,879
Whoa, dude, dude, dude, the shoes!
Take your shoes off.

351
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,455
Mr. Roqua, Mr. Roqua,
I'd like you to meet Jake Tyler.

352
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:19,124
He's interested in taking classes here.

353
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:25,380
People who come here
for the wrong reasons, they never last.

354
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:30,802
- Walked into a door.
- Must have been a big door.

355
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:37,017
- So when can I start?
- Tomorrow, with Max. Beginner's class.

356
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,603
- It's just labels, dude.
- What about this class?

357
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:40,979
- It's just labels, dude.
- What about this class?

358
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,984
This is not for beginners.
This is an advanced class.

359
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:50,197
- You can observe, if you like. Max?
- But he's got mad skills, sir.

360
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:51,531
Please.

361
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:56,720
I'm a quick learner.

362
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:03,685
Everyone up! Circuit one! Let's go.

363
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,398
- What do I do?
- Learn quickly.

364
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:13,153
One-minute intervals. Begin!

365
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,243
Breathe!

366
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,167
Section two. Time! Switch! Let's go.

367
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:32,672
Grab the rings, bro!

368
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,678
Push yourself. Pick it up, buddy. Let's go.

369
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,100
Time. Rotation. Let's go!

370
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:49,981
Come on! Pick it up, people.

371
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,113
Come on!

372
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:02,702
Pick it up! Time! Switch! Let's go.

373
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:07,332
Breathe!

374
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:13,338
Keep going! Don't give up. Never give up.

375
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,758
Never back down. Come on, pick it up.

376
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:19,719
Push yourself!

377
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,769
Okay.

378
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,479
Time!

379
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,986
Don't compact your muscles now,
we're just getting warmed up.

380
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,367
That was a warm up?

381
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:47,038
Pair up. Go for the submission.
Three-minute rounds.

382
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:48,415
Miles.

383
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,544
Are you kidding me?

384
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:55,589
- I got 20 pounds on this guy.
- So take it easy on him.

385
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:13,648
Tap out.

386
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:21,406
Shoot the legs. Take his back!

387
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,497
Good use of your chin to block his knees.

388
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:35,412
Rear naked choke!

389
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:40,000
- Tap out, dude!
- Tap out, tap out.

390
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:54,097
He's out. He's out, let him go.

391
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:56,725
You all right?

392
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:59,478
That wasn't so smart, buddy.

393
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:02,147
Couple of more seconds,
I would've had him.

394
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:04,233
You don't give up, do you?

395
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:07,486
Tomorrow at 6:00. Don't be late.

396
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:12,449
One rule, Jake.

397
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:14,826
No fighting outside the gym.

398
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:18,038
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter how big the door.

399
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,208
No fighting or you're out.
Can you handle that?

400
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,418
Yeah.

401
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:26,004
See you tomorrow.

402
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:29,007
That was amazing.

403
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:30,551
Oh, my God!

404
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:32,594
- It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

405
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,596
Are you kidding me?
The man put you on the rack!

406
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:38,100
He tested you and you passed
with flying colors, man!

407
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:42,604
Ass-kicking, skull-crushing,
mixed martial arts madness!

408
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:44,189
You're gonna bring it on!

409
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:52,114
- Dude, where you going?
- Bus.

410
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,533
Get in the car.

411
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,161
This is your car?

412
00:36:58,871 --> 00:36:59,997
No.

413
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:02,624
It's my baby.

414
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,009
I got it.

415
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:17,306
Wow.

416
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,924
Hey.

417
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:23,762
Hey, Jake.

418
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,598
Come on in.

419
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:34,523
Hey, could you give us a second?

420
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:39,236
- I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
- Whatever she did, accept.

421
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:42,072
Go away.

422
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,283
Well?

423
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:50,122
- You set me up.
- I get that. I do, but...

424
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:55,210
You set me up so that your boyfriend could
kick my ass in front of half the school.

425
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:57,838
I didn't know it would be like that.

426
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:00,966
I said I was sorry.

427
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,221
It was wrong.

428
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,682
Are you so different?

429
00:38:09,642 --> 00:38:11,644
You wanted that fight.

430
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:14,605
You just didn't want to lose it.

431
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,233
You know, you better watch out,

432
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,735
because you're starting
to sound real smart.

433
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,700
My old school.

434
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,498
I was barely there a month.
Third time we moved that year.

435
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:36,877
My dad got transferred here,
and then Ryan happened,

436
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,713
and everything just got so easy.

437
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:49,557
Does that mean I'm supposed to feel
sorry for you because you're popular?

438
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:00,859
Sounds like my cue.

439
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:21,171
Hey. First class isn't for an hour.

440
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:23,716
I could use the extra work, remember?

441
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:28,345
Okay.

442
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:42,067
This should be enough for two months.

443
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:45,154
- That's a lot of money.
- Yeah.

444
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,547
Sure it's worth it?

445
00:39:46,797 --> 00:39:48,591
Never been more sure.

446
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,020
So, do you live here?

447
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:04,398
I thought you came to work out.

448
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,790
Add a round kick.

449
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:24,335
No, that's cool.
I'm gonna do my own thing till class starts.

450
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,006
Three-punch combo, then a round kick.
This is mixed martial arts. Mix it up.

451
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:39,475
You beat yourself
if you don't control your breathing.

452
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:44,897
Your first day sparring with Miles,
you panicked, stopped breathing.

453
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:47,859
Here you are trying so hard to kill the bag,
but you forget to breathe,

454
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:49,986
so your kick has no power.

455
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,156
Breathe with each strike.

456
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:00,288
Breathe.

457
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:04,834
- Breathe.
- I am breathing!

458
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,878
If you can't keep control
when you're kicking a bag,

459
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:09,005
what happens against an
opponent who can fight back?

460
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,424
This bag weighs a frigging ton.

461
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,362
Each strike, you breathe.

462
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:40,203
- So is that it?
- Is that what?

463
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:46,125
Your "Grasshopper" speech.
All I get is four words about breathing?

464
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,047
Still sure it's worth it?

465
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,435
Not just you, Jake. Everyone has their fight.

466
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,220
Nice work.

467
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:56,314
- Jake?
- Hey.

468
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:01,444
- Charlie had a match today.
- Yeah? How'd he do?

469
00:44:02,112 --> 00:44:05,448
Level of competition here,
it's going to take some getting used to.

470
00:44:06,282 --> 00:44:07,951
You should come sometime.

471
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:12,997
That was Dad's thing.

472
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,335
Did you take $200
out of your bank account, Jake?

473
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,797
Hey, I asked you a question.

474
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:24,092
Did you take $200
out of your bank account?

475
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:29,222
- Yeah.
- For what?

476
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:33,435
It's my money.
What difference does it make?

477
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:35,186
What did you spend it on?

478
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,607
What's in the bag?

479
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,822
Open the bag, please.

480
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:03,673
- You've been fighting?
- I knew you wouldn't understand.

481
00:45:03,757 --> 00:45:05,216
You know, this is over.

482
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:06,843
Done.

483
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:10,054
Are we clear?

484
00:46:00,305 --> 00:46:03,517
Today we're gonna try something new.
A collective narrative.

485
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:06,978
I'm gonna break you up
into groups of three.

486
00:46:07,345 --> 00:46:09,806
Suzanne, Elise and Corey,
you're one group.

487
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,766
Lydia will be a group for me.

488
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:14,394
Ms. Miller, Mr. Tyler will be a group.

489
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,771
You three here.

490
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,443
So what do you guys want to write about?

491
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:23,403
How about pride?

492
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,240
Betrayal.

493
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:30,994
Exoneration.

494
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:32,537
Treachery.

495
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:34,539
Sequaciousness.

496
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:36,541
That's bullshit. That's not even a word.

497
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:40,795
Yeah, it is. It's go with the flow,
and it's used quite well, I might add.

498
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,231
Why do you have to be such a jerk?

499
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:47,903
- Yeah, this is my fault.
- It wasn't, but you're making it that way.

500
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:52,674
Unrequited?

501
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:03,034
What's up, Baja?

502
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:06,830
What's up, babe?

503
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,254
- We need to talk.
- So talk.

504
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:18,925
Are you sure you want to do this here?

505
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:22,220
Pretty sure.

506
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,933
Your fight with Jake Tyler was horrible.

507
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:28,226
Really?

508
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:30,479
I thought it was a pretty good party.

509
00:47:30,562 --> 00:47:31,605
You said you were just
gonna spar with him.

510
00:47:31,688 --> 00:47:33,982
And then we sparred,
and then I kicked his ass.

511
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:35,233
What is the deal?

512
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,902
It's over.

513
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:39,488
You can't be serious.

514
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:40,947
I'm sorry.

515
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:41,281
I'm sorry.

516
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:45,452
Because I gave
some random kid a beating?

517
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:48,371
And loved it.

518
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:52,292
The only time you're happy
is when you're hurting people.

519
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,418
Wow.

520
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:59,800
Are you so self-righteous
that you actually believe that?

521
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,545
You know, when you moved here,
you were nothing.

522
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:06,048
You'd walk the halls like a ghost.

523
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,009
Being with me made you.

524
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:12,554
Thank you for making this so much easier.

525
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:19,895
- Don't do this to me.
- Ryan. Ryan, you're hurting me!

526
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:21,396
So do I look happy?

527
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,942
Hey, hey!

528
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:29,321
- What are you going to do about it?
- Jake, no.

529
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:34,201
You're weak like your old man

530
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:35,911
was.

531
00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:38,664
Watch your back, man.

532
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,837
Half-speed, both of you. Switch partners.

533
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:54,012
Forget half-speed.
You need to put it in neutral.

534
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:56,890
- What? I eased off.
- Okay, let's see it.

535
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:07,151
Clear your head. Let it go.
Easy, nice and easy.

536
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:10,696
- Just giving it as good as I get it.
- Really?

537
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,906
Should I go half-speed, too?

538
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,117
Whatever.

539
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:28,922
You're so set on hurting people,
you just hurt yourself.

540
00:49:29,006 --> 00:49:30,799
- Easy, buddy.
- So this is my fault, huh?

541
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:34,219
Yes. It is your responsibility
to control the outcome.

542
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:36,889
- That is such bullshit.
- Bullshit?

543
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:39,433
Okay, show me your way.

544
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:51,653
Tap out. Calm down, buddy.

545
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,365
Go home and cool off.

546
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:58,243
Tomorrow is another day.

547
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:05,918
- At least I have a home.
- What did you say to me?

548
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:10,297
- I said, "At least I have a home."
- Then go to it. I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:18,088
- Maybe I should check on him?
- Yeah, you do that.

550
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:22,301
Hold up, dude! Slow down.
Where are you going?

551
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:23,177
Let's just go.

552
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:23,928
Let's just go.

553
00:50:38,526 --> 00:50:39,985
You okay, dude?

554
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,112
My responsibility.

555
00:50:43,906 --> 00:50:45,032
Jake?

556
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:00,297
Dude, relax.

557
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:11,851
- You got a problem, tough guy?
- Yeah, I do got a problem.

558
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,936
Jake, be cool.

559
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:17,690
Hey, get back in the car, faggot.

560
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:20,985
What are you gonna do about it?

561
00:51:54,226 --> 00:51:55,186
Let's go!

562
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,169
That's Jake Tyler.

563
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:29,178
Yo, Harry, check this out.
This is sick. Three dudes.

564
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:32,089
I heard one of them almost died. Look.

565
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:33,257
Get out of here, man. Whatever.

566
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:36,009
No, seriously, I heard Tyler hit the kid
so hard his heart stopped.

567
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:39,263
- That's in a Bruce Lee movie, you idiot.
- You're an idiot. Shut up.

568
00:52:39,346 --> 00:52:42,057
- You guys sound like a bunch of bitches.
- He's a bitch.

569
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:43,350
That was a good comeback, dude.

570
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:46,395
You know, it's funny. I just had a
conversation with your brother about that.

571
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:47,438
Ask him.

572
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,565
How well do you know Jake?

573
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:51,233
- We're tight.
- Really?

574
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:54,862
Yeah, but it's more of
a professional relationship, though.

575
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,698
- I'm his trainer.
- Cool. Awesome.

576
00:52:58,407 --> 00:52:59,450
Tell me more.

577
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:00,534
More?
Yeah.

578
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:04,329
Happy?

579
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:10,043
- What are you talking about?
- You're a rock star now.

580
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:15,591
Why would you care?

581
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:23,265
Good question.

582
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:29,354
Well, looks like hotshot found himself
a new groupie, huh?

583
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:52,836
How's it going, badass?

584
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,132
You think I'm impressed?

585
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,102
Couple of wannabes in a yellow Hummer?

586
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:11,188
I could wreck you here and now.

587
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:16,819
What fun would that be?
This is a spectator sport.

588
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:21,407
You think you can make it through
the Beatdown?

589
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:23,117
I have.

590
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:25,661
Won the whole tournament twice.

591
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:28,497
That's where we'll get it on.

592
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:31,500
That's where this ends.

593
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,592
Not impressed.

594
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,137
Not even a little.

595
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:45,681
Enjoy the floor.

596
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,124
- Dude, where you going?
- Home.

597
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,918
Did you forget I drove?

598
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:16,420
I'm walking.

599
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:18,255
Barely.

600
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:21,008
You okay?

601
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:23,844
What's the Beatdown?

602
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,848
Get in.

603
00:55:34,354 --> 00:55:36,940
Straight up elimination tournament, dude.

604
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:39,526
The freaking Super Bowl
of the Florida fight clubs.

605
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,613
Everybody who brawls,
they go to the Beatdown.

606
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:44,573
It's gladiator heaven.

607
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,505
When?

608
00:56:01,673 --> 00:56:02,841
Like, sometime next month, man.

609
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:04,843
The fighters get the time and place
by text message

610
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:06,261
at the last minute.

611
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:14,937
Dude, do all you guys live
in houses this big?

612
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,022
Bro, this is our guest house.

613
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:29,368
Push over.

614
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:43,257
What are you doing?

615
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:46,885
- Training.
- Take off your gloves.

616
00:56:47,803 --> 00:56:50,806
- I just...
- Take off your gloves.

617
00:56:51,598 --> 00:56:54,476
Fight outside the gym and you're done.
Go right now.

618
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:57,604
You don't train here anymore.
Out of my sight.

619
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:09,992
Out!

620
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:21,086
Want to tell me
who did this to you, Charlie?

621
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:23,630
- Not a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

622
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:25,466
It's not like you.

623
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:30,220
- What about the other guy?
- What about him?

624
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:36,060
You think this is funny, Jake?
This is all your fault.

625
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:38,103
- How is that?
- Well, all this business with fighting.

626
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,897
You're the one who's supposed to be
setting the example.

627
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,066
- I thought that was your job.
- Well, I am trying,

628
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,401
but all he wants is to be you.

629
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:46,904
You think you're the only one
who gets angry, Jake?

630
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,655
You think you're the only one
who wants to break stuff?

631
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:50,032
I'd like to break stuff, too!

632
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:57,831
- Want to try that, Charlie?
- You sure?

633
00:57:58,207 --> 00:58:00,042
Yeah, go on, break it.

634
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:05,631
- You feel better?
- Yeah.

635
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:09,009
How about you, Mom? Feel better?

636
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,511
Yeah, I do.

637
00:58:10,636 --> 00:58:12,763
But guess what, there's still a mess
that needs to be cleaned up,

638
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:15,224
and that is my job.

639
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:16,683
- I can help.
- No, it's all right.

640
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,310
Get out of here, both of you.

641
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:23,941
It wasn't a fight.

642
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:27,111
I got hit with a ball.

643
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:30,114
It was an overhead,
and I took my eye off of it.

644
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:32,032
I'm sorry I lied, Mom.

645
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:36,537
I thought it sounded cooler
if I got in a fight.

646
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,587
Still think you don't need to
set an example, Jake?

647
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,186
Isn't this a little stalker-ish?

648
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:47,983
Yes, but he's not going to let you
in the gym,

649
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:50,736
so we gotta go outside.

650
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:53,739
Outside?

651
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,911
Dude, it's called 365 Combat for a reason.
He never leaves.

652
00:59:58,994 --> 01:00:00,871
Well, he's gotta leave sometime.

653
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:03,415
Come on, dude. I mean,
we got to get you back in there, man.

654
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,833
We need to be training.

655
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:08,420
- We?
- I don't go back until you go back.

656
01:00:13,258 --> 01:00:14,218
Cool.

657
01:00:15,135 --> 01:00:16,428
Whoa, he's leaving.

658
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:18,013
Let's go, baby, let's go.

659
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:39,284
I lied, the first class.

660
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,622
I had every intention
of fighting outside the gym.

661
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:46,166
Is this your apology?

662
01:00:50,129 --> 01:00:53,465
Okay, I lied because I wanted
to pound on the guy

663
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,092
that was pounding on me.

664
01:00:56,677 --> 01:01:00,013
This guy, he's got the perfect life,

665
01:01:00,097 --> 01:01:02,599
the perfect car, the perfect girlfriend.

666
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:04,518
You know,

667
01:01:05,227 --> 01:01:06,979
I lied because I'm pissed off,

668
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:09,898
because I'm angry all the time.

669
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:13,077
I just...

670
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,373
I just had to say no, and I blew it.

671
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,834
That's all I needed to do, and I couldn't.

672
01:01:22,253 --> 01:01:23,212
My dad, he was...

673
01:01:24,296 --> 01:01:26,465
He was completely wasted, he was tanked.

674
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:29,510
He wanted to drive.

675
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,055
And I let him.

676
01:01:33,848 --> 01:01:37,434
He went off the road,

677
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:40,104
hit a tree.

678
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:44,049
I made it.

679
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,760
He didn't.

680
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:51,849
I've just been letting my mom down,
my brother down,

681
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,351
getting into fights.

682
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,562
I don't want to be angry anymore.

683
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,732
The only time I'm not is...

684
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:05,321
It's when I'm in the gym
and I'm training with you.

685
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:12,578
Be at the gym at 7:00.

686
01:02:14,872 --> 01:02:16,040
Thank you.

687
01:02:16,749 --> 01:02:18,542
You won't be thanking me tomorrow.

688
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:37,705
That was not cool.

689
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:28,255
Tap out.

690
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,883
That's what I'm talking about.

691
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:41,769
Yes!

692
01:04:59,537 --> 01:05:03,916
What's with the gym being open every day,
all year?

693
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,386
And why do you live there?

694
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:10,306
Where's your family?

695
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:14,602
Come on, I won the race.
You owe me something.

696
01:05:15,937 --> 01:05:17,021
Okay.

697
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:22,527
My father moved from Senegal to Brazil
when I was very little.

698
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:28,616
My father was proud to open
a little street corner restaurant,

699
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:32,328
but he was even more proud
of my little brother, Joseph.

700
01:05:32,537 --> 01:05:35,790
Right from the start, he was 10 times
the fighter I could ever dream of being.

701
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:40,879
I mean, we fought professionally,
but Joseph was truly great.

702
01:05:43,298 --> 01:05:45,800
We were at a local bar, Joseph and I,

703
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:48,386
and this guy

704
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:51,389
started mouthing off to Joseph,

705
01:05:51,473 --> 01:05:52,974
saying ugly things to him.

706
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:57,270
Wanted to prove his manhood, I guess,
by taking on a pro, you know?

707
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,980
So I wanted to stop him.

708
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:02,192
I wanted to put this loudmouth in his place
and end this ugly talk.

709
01:06:02,317 --> 01:06:04,235
But, of course, Joseph,

710
01:06:05,737 --> 01:06:07,113
he beat him.

711
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:13,161
This local tough guy was
so badly humiliated

712
01:06:14,662 --> 01:06:16,623
he left with his friends.

713
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,460
He then returned 10 minutes later

714
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:24,255
and shot Joseph in the head.

715
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,553
My father's favorite son.

716
01:06:33,765 --> 01:06:37,769
- I couldn't face him after that.
- So you haven't seen your father since.

717
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,317
Anyways,

718
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,319
you beat me once.

719
01:06:46,653 --> 01:06:48,696
Think you can do it again?

720
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:50,907
Well,

721
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:53,952
I don't want to hurt an old man.

722
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,747
Come on, old man!

723
01:07:06,297 --> 01:07:09,175
You have no way to win here.
Stop fighting back.

724
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:10,969
Change it up. Go for position.

725
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,470
Trap my arm.

726
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,639
My leg here.

727
01:07:15,557 --> 01:07:17,642
Now bridge and roll me over.

728
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:22,188
Now you have a chance to get in position.

729
01:07:27,902 --> 01:07:29,404
A small chance.

730
01:07:39,414 --> 01:07:43,168
Okay, okay, okay, okay, you win, you win.
You win.

731
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,586
I get it.

732
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:49,132
But you can't always change position.
I mean, sometimes you just get stuck.

733
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,426
In any fight, you can always
change your position.

734
01:07:51,593 --> 01:07:53,178
You just have to find a way.

735
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,224
- So it's on me?
- Always has been.

736
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,560
Always.

737
01:08:11,613 --> 01:08:12,572
<i>Deuce.</i>

738
01:08:17,368 --> 01:08:18,870
How's he doing?

739
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:22,499
He's down 3-2 in the first set.

740
01:08:23,216 --> 01:08:24,593
Hey, Charlie!

741
01:08:24,926 --> 01:08:26,803
I thought you wanted to go to Wimbledon!

742
01:08:26,928 --> 01:08:27,929
You got this!

743
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:28,972
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

744
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:34,728
That was subtle.

745
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:36,563
Yeah.

746
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,607
It's not our strong suit.

747
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:40,901
<i>Deuce.</i>

748
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:45,155
- I want to make things better, Jake.
- Don't worry.

749
01:08:45,864 --> 01:08:47,699
- Everything's fine.
- No, it's not.

750
01:08:48,575 --> 01:08:51,578
- We're significantly screwed up.
- No, we're

751
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:54,623
tremendously screwed up.

752
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,167
Yeah!

753
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,630
There you go.

754
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,715
I'm just grabbing a seat over there.

755
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:09,596
Hey.

756
01:09:10,555 --> 01:09:13,058
I was thinking about what you said.

757
01:09:14,226 --> 01:09:15,310
And?

758
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:18,688
I think that was total bullshit, what you did.

759
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:19,940
Wow.

760
01:09:20,774 --> 01:09:22,943
This is going better than I ever expected.

761
01:09:25,654 --> 01:09:26,613
But

762
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:32,994
I was the one who took the bait, okay?

763
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,088
I chose to fight.

764
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,593
You tried to apologize,
and I acted like an asshole.

765
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,429
You had nothing to do with that.

766
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,500
Thank you.

767
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,047
Apologies are good.

768
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,969
Yeah, they are.

769
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,183
Anything else you need to apologize for?

770
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,438
It's a long list.

771
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,249
Hello, can I help you?

772
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:54,751
My son Jake trains here.

773
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:57,170
- Jake Tyler.
- Yes, he does.

774
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,007
Your son is a very good fighter.

775
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:02,300
Something every mother longs to hear.

776
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,595
Jake is much more than just
a very good fighter.

777
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,182
Is that what you say about all
the angry young men that pay your bills?

778
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,978
They're a lot less angry
when they walk out of here

779
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,521
than when they walk in.

780
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:17,149
Okay.

781
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:19,401
That's fair.

782
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,279
When I first met Jake, I thought,

783
01:11:22,955 --> 01:11:26,750
"Here's another kid who has a hard time
dealing with his own emotions."

784
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:30,087
But now I see he's just afraid of them.

785
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:36,009
I know that Jake thinks
I somehow hold him responsible

786
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:37,928
for the death of his father.

787
01:11:38,512 --> 01:11:39,513
Do you?

788
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:52,526
This is for next month.

789
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,949
- Thank you.
- Just do me one favor.

790
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:01,285
Make sure he keeps all his teeth.

791
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:04,079
My dental plan doesn't kick in
for another six months.

792
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:09,501
Here, a mouth guard.

793
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:10,919
My dental plan.

794
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:13,839
Thank you.

795
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,469
Jake is a good kid.

796
01:12:19,386 --> 01:12:20,387
I know he is.

797
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:37,780
It's on, dude. Beatdown is tomorrow night.

798
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:41,366
I don't think I'm gonna do that, man.

799
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,369
Yeah, man. Right.

800
01:12:44,495 --> 01:12:47,873
No, really. I'm serious.

801
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:50,375
I'm not gonna fight at the Beatdown.

802
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:52,461
What?

803
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:55,631
- Why not?
- Because that's what Ryan wants.

804
01:12:56,215 --> 01:12:57,174
Not me.

805
01:12:58,133 --> 01:12:59,092
Dude.

806
01:13:00,552 --> 01:13:02,262
I'm sorry, man. Come on.

807
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:05,349
Let's just grab a seat with the girls.

808
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:09,728
I mean, Baja's friend has been
checking you out all afternoon.

809
01:13:10,562 --> 01:13:11,522
Babes.

810
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:14,691
The one thing better than brawling.

811
01:13:21,824 --> 01:13:24,868
So, you play Xbox a lot?

812
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:29,873
"Useless junk."

813
01:13:30,249 --> 01:13:32,209
You sure you don't need a bigger box?

814
01:13:38,757 --> 01:13:40,676
Tools of his trade.

815
01:13:44,104 --> 01:13:45,773
Those look kind of cute on you.

816
01:13:47,316 --> 01:13:48,776
They're still sweaty.

817
01:13:49,735 --> 01:13:51,779
- Sorry.
- No, I like it.

818
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,661
Get up.

819
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,038
I said, "Get up."

820
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,998
Okay, I'm up.

821
01:14:06,502 --> 01:14:07,962
Nice contact.

822
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,838
Two older brothers, one bathroom.

823
01:14:11,924 --> 01:14:13,008
Show me.

824
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,551
Show you what?

825
01:14:15,177 --> 01:14:16,136
What you got.

826
01:14:17,763 --> 01:14:18,764
Show me.

827
01:14:20,224 --> 01:14:22,309
You got good stance.

828
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:24,520
You love my stance.

829
01:14:26,397 --> 01:14:27,398
I do.

830
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,443
Can you take it to the ground?

831
01:14:36,865 --> 01:14:38,534
You see, it's about submission.

832
01:14:39,076 --> 01:14:41,453
You wanna be able to make
your opponent tap out.

833
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:43,163
Tap out?

834
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:47,710
You wanna make it so painful
that they wanna give up.

835
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:54,967
I don't tap out.

836
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:03,183
You wanna tap out?

837
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:12,151
Do you want to tap out?

838
01:15:25,706 --> 01:15:26,665
Okay.

839
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:29,209
Hey, Charlie.

840
01:15:29,752 --> 01:15:31,170
What are you guys doing?

841
01:15:32,588 --> 01:15:33,547
Wrestling.

842
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:34,882
Yeah.

843
01:15:35,224 --> 01:15:36,475
What's up?

844
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:38,310
Phone. Mom.

845
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:41,439
- Okay.
- Mom.

846
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:44,734
Big wrestling fan.

847
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,578
Okay, okay.
Who needs a margarita?

848
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:56,620
Hi.

849
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,040
Yo, Aaron.

850
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:01,500
Fresh batch, baby. You want one?

851
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:03,502
No, thanks, Mr. McCarthy. I'm good.

852
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:05,588
Come on, man. Don't be a punk.
Have a drink with me.

853
01:16:06,172 --> 01:16:07,590
And don't call me Mr. McCarthy.

854
01:16:07,673 --> 01:16:09,008
- I'm not that old.
- Dad!

855
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,178
I think we're good.

856
01:16:13,971 --> 01:16:16,307
All right.
If we're good, guess we're good, huh?

857
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:22,480
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

858
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:25,149
I asked you a question.

859
01:16:25,316 --> 01:16:28,110
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

860
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:32,239
You wanna be the best,
you gotta take out the best.

861
01:16:37,453 --> 01:16:40,164
All right, I can take a hint. It's all good.

862
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:44,502
- I'll see all you guys later, all right?
- So long, Mr. McCarthy.

863
01:16:48,005 --> 01:16:50,508
Shit. Can you believe Tyler bailed
on the Beatdown?

864
01:16:52,593 --> 01:16:54,512
What? Why?

865
01:16:55,429 --> 01:16:57,556
He's scared of getting his ass kicked, man.

866
01:16:57,681 --> 01:16:59,725
That's not the word on the street, man.

867
01:17:00,393 --> 01:17:01,352
Oh, yeah?

868
01:17:02,937 --> 01:17:03,938
What is it?

869
01:17:03,988 --> 01:17:07,283
What is the word on the street?

870
01:17:07,408 --> 01:17:09,619
My bet is that he can kick your ass.

871
01:17:12,705 --> 01:17:13,664
What?

872
01:17:20,371 --> 01:17:21,331
What's up?

873
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:22,790
Just hitting the mats.

874
01:17:23,499 --> 01:17:26,544
You're training with Roqua.
You must be getting pretty good.

875
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:29,422
Mad Max, master of the ground and pound.

876
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,549
Yeah, dude.

877
01:17:32,383 --> 01:17:33,343
Thanks.

878
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:38,640
So, I heard your boy doesn't want
to roll at the Beatdown.

879
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:40,767
That's correct. He's out.

880
01:17:41,184 --> 01:17:44,479
Would have been sick, right?
You and him made it to the finals.

881
01:17:44,604 --> 01:17:46,064
Guess we'll never know.

882
01:17:48,483 --> 01:17:49,484
Take it easy.

883
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,451
Hey, you wanna come hang at the house?

884
01:17:58,993 --> 01:18:01,704
Show some of the guys
the new moves you're working on?

885
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:04,499
Sure thing, man.

886
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:09,045
Hey, no, come on. Ride with me.

887
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:17,845
Max! Max!

888
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:30,149
Come on, dude. Jump kick some more.

889
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:31,442
Nice. Lower it.

890
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:32,610
Let's go.

891
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:36,573
- Check it out.
- Good.

892
01:18:38,283 --> 01:18:40,285
Hey, man, you gotta...

893
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,036
You wanna kind of, like,
control the breathing.

894
01:18:42,537 --> 01:18:44,539
Seriously, most fights end
because one fighter gets gassed.

895
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:46,249
And then when that happens,
dude, forget about it.

896
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:48,167
You know, we can do without
the insight, Sensei. Thanks.

897
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:49,377
Sit down, Max.

898
01:18:49,502 --> 01:18:51,796
Don't laugh at him, you assholes.

899
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:54,132
He's right.

900
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,635
Most guys lose because they get winded.

901
01:18:58,177 --> 01:18:59,178
Right?

902
01:18:59,554 --> 01:19:00,513
- Right.
- Yeah.

903
01:19:01,347 --> 01:19:03,099
Come on. Me and you.

904
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:06,394
Let's teach these boys a lesson, huh?

905
01:19:07,103 --> 01:19:08,104
Yeah.

906
01:19:08,187 --> 01:19:09,397
Come on.

907
01:19:12,358 --> 01:19:15,528
Guard up. Guard up. Guard up.

908
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:21,868
You know, you can tell everything about
a fighter from how they take the first shot.

909
01:19:23,578 --> 01:19:24,537
Shit.

910
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:32,337
When you get tagged,
your mind only registers two thoughts,

911
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,589
back the hell up or get the hell in.

912
01:19:38,635 --> 01:19:40,011
Dude, I don't have any gear on.

913
01:19:40,094 --> 01:19:41,763
That's what it comes down to.

914
01:19:43,014 --> 01:19:45,391
You're either backing out
or you're getting in.

915
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:51,773
Ryan, don't! Stop!

916
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:55,276
Jesus, Ryan!

917
01:19:57,362 --> 01:20:00,240
You know, I don't think
I've seen this one on ESPN.

918
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:01,358
You just wait.

919
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:02,734
Indian Poker's gonna be huge.

920
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:04,569
See, Hold 'Em's all about luck.

921
01:20:04,694 --> 01:20:06,988
This, thinking man's game.

922
01:20:08,323 --> 01:20:09,866
Raise you two blues.

923
01:20:11,243 --> 01:20:15,330
I got a strange feeling I should fold,
but I'm definitely gonna call you.

924
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:23,338
How do you win every time?

925
01:20:23,713 --> 01:20:25,548
It is a thinking man's game.

926
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,178
So, you wanna wrestle?

927
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:34,933
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

928
01:20:35,058 --> 01:20:37,519
Hurry up. Go. Hurry up, man. Go.

929
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:46,152
Jake?

930
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:52,784
Max! Max!

931
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:57,330
Oh, no! Call 911!

932
01:20:58,623 --> 01:21:00,166
It's gonna be okay, man.

933
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,933
Fractured ribs, six stitches
inside his lip, and a broken nose.

934
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,021
That must have been one hell of a fall.

935
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:23,440
You're gonna be fine,

936
01:21:23,523 --> 01:21:25,775
but we'll have to keep you here
overnight for observation.

937
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:27,986
- Called your parents?
- Yeah.

938
01:21:28,862 --> 01:21:29,905
Are they coming?

939
01:21:32,073 --> 01:21:34,034
- We have to call the police.
- No way.

940
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:35,535
Why not?

941
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:40,498
I need to borrow your car.

942
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,170
Jake!

943
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:47,213
Jake, wait!

944
01:21:47,297 --> 01:21:49,424
He's baiting you, just like at the party.

945
01:21:49,549 --> 01:21:51,927
- This is different.
- Really?

946
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,011
'Cause from right here it looks like

947
01:21:53,136 --> 01:21:54,262
you're giving him exactly what he wants.

948
01:21:54,346 --> 01:21:57,682
Who's next? You? Charlie?

949
01:21:58,808 --> 01:22:02,228
Jake, walking away and giving up
are not the same thing.

950
01:22:02,896 --> 01:22:05,148
Good, 'cause I'm not doing either one.

951
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:25,961
Hey, Jake!

952
01:22:27,162 --> 01:22:28,121
Jake!

953
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:30,082
Where's Max?

954
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:35,253
He's in the hospital.

955
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:37,673
That boy

956
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:40,968
whose truck Max got into, he hurt Max.

957
01:22:45,347 --> 01:22:47,140
- Revenge...
- No.

958
01:22:47,849 --> 01:22:49,726
Revenge has nothing to do with this.

959
01:22:49,851 --> 01:22:52,229
Listen, whatever your reasons,
right or wrong,

960
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:54,273
the consequences will be the same.

961
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:57,859
That's fine by me.

962
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:01,196
Do this and you can never come back
in my gym again.

963
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,740
I let you get away with it once, not twice.

964
01:23:05,784 --> 01:23:06,743
Wait. Wait!

965
01:23:06,868 --> 01:23:08,453
What? You think this is what I want?

966
01:23:08,578 --> 01:23:10,664
To never train with you again just to

967
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:13,292
give some asshole
the show that he's looking for?

968
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:15,168
Then stop. Let it go!

969
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:23,427
The night my dad died,

970
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,429
I just let him drive.

971
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:27,306
I didn't even try to stop him.

972
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:30,309
Doing nothing has consequences, too.

973
01:23:30,392 --> 01:23:32,519
You cannot live in the past, my friend.

974
01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:33,604
Really?

975
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:38,358
If you could go back
and stop the guy who shot your brother...

976
01:23:38,483 --> 01:23:40,819
- Don't push me.
- I know you would have fought that guy.

977
01:23:41,612 --> 01:23:43,488
- I know that you would have...
- You know nothing.

978
01:23:43,572 --> 01:23:46,199
Seven years.

979
01:23:46,283 --> 01:23:49,661
Seven years, I have not seen my family,

980
01:23:49,786 --> 01:23:51,121
my friends.

981
01:23:51,204 --> 01:23:53,707
And every day, like the day before,

982
01:23:53,832 --> 01:23:57,377
I wake up, wash my face,
look myself in the mirror,

983
01:24:01,423 --> 01:24:02,424
disgusted.

984
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:06,094
Why not go back?

985
01:24:08,797 --> 01:24:10,132
And face my father?

986
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:14,303
The last time he spoke to me

987
01:24:15,387 --> 01:24:18,557
he said both of his sons died that night.

988
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:27,191
If that's what you believe,

989
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,444
then he was right.

990
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:32,279
You gave up.

991
01:24:33,947 --> 01:24:35,991
Sometimes fighting the fight

992
01:24:36,116 --> 01:24:39,828
means that you have to do the one thing

993
01:24:39,912 --> 01:24:41,580
that you don't want to do.

994
01:24:42,998 --> 01:24:45,292
You have to fight for his forgiveness.

995
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:48,462
You can't just hide here forever.

996
01:24:49,296 --> 01:24:50,547
At least I can't.

997
01:24:52,007 --> 01:24:53,968
I'm gonna stop this guy.

998
01:24:55,427 --> 01:24:57,763
Win, lose, it makes no difference.

999
01:24:59,848 --> 01:25:01,100
It ends tonight.

1000
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:04,728
This is my fight.

1001
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:07,523
Everyone's got one.

1002
01:25:13,445 --> 01:25:14,405
Jake.

1003
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:18,492
No matter what happens,

1004
01:25:20,285 --> 01:25:21,996
control the outcome.

1005
01:25:22,955 --> 01:25:24,123
It's on you.

1006
01:25:24,456 --> 01:25:25,666
Always has been.

1007
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:52,776
Come in.

1008
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:55,654
I was wondering...

1009
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:02,286
I don't want to lie about this.

1010
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:08,334
I'm not gonna ask you to.

1011
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:45,788
Hold up.

1012
01:26:46,163 --> 01:26:47,623
No, no, no, he's cool.

1013
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,085
You have fun, Jake.

1014
01:27:22,775 --> 01:27:24,610
<i>Everybody do what they gotta do.</i>

1015
01:27:25,569 --> 01:27:26,529
<i>Yeah.</i>

1016
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:28,322
<i>That's right.</i>

1017
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:31,158
<i>It's 12:00 right about now.
You know what time it is?</i>

1018
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:32,952
Beatdown!

1019
01:27:33,077 --> 01:27:38,457
<i>Lock the doors, nobody gets out alive.
It's time for the Beatdown!</i>

1020
01:27:38,582 --> 01:27:39,041
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!

1021
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:45,464
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!

1022
01:27:48,092 --> 01:27:50,302
<i>The first match is about to begin.</i>

1023
01:27:50,428 --> 01:27:52,805
<i>Let's give it up for Camin and Mintz!</i>

1024
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:02,440
This is a no holds barred match.

1025
01:28:02,565 --> 01:28:06,444
No eye gouging,
no crotch shots and no biting.

1026
01:28:07,153 --> 01:28:09,989
Bout ends with a tap out or a knockout.

1027
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:12,158
Fight!

1028
01:28:12,283 --> 01:28:13,451
Come on, Mintz!

1029
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:20,916
<i>Check that right.</i>

1030
01:28:24,462 --> 01:28:25,463
Do it, man!

1031
01:28:25,546 --> 01:28:26,881
<i>Camin and Mintz!</i>

1032
01:28:28,132 --> 01:28:29,717
It's gonna go down!

1033
01:28:32,011 --> 01:28:34,263
<i>Whoa! It's over.</i>

1034
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:38,142
<i>Kick to the face.</i>

1035
01:28:38,642 --> 01:28:41,103
<i>Mintz is going on to the next round!</i>

1036
01:28:41,354 --> 01:28:43,356
<i>Yeah!</i>

1037
01:28:43,814 --> 01:28:45,858
<i>Show your stuff. Show your stuff.</i>

1038
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,737
Jake Tyler, checking in.

1039
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:51,697
<i>We're still in the first round.</i>

1040
01:28:51,822 --> 01:28:56,285
<i>And we have 32 fighters
going for the title of Beatdown King.</i>

1041
01:28:56,410 --> 01:29:00,247
<i>And right about now, we got the new guy,
Jake Tyler, trying to throw up</i>

1042
01:29:00,331 --> 01:29:05,461
<i>against current Beatdown King,
Ryan McCarthy!</i>

1043
01:29:15,596 --> 01:29:16,764
Oh, my God!

1044
01:29:19,058 --> 01:29:20,017
Wow!

1045
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:29,860
Ryan is so hot!

1046
01:29:29,985 --> 01:29:32,238
<i>Check mine out, too, yeah.</i>

1047
01:29:32,988 --> 01:29:34,990
<i>Strictly for the ladies.</i>

1048
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,780
<i>New guy, he's been doing some push-ups,</i>

1049
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:42,657
<i>but he's still a dead man walking.</i>

1050
01:29:50,957 --> 01:29:53,000
<i>McCarthy and Tyler.</i>

1051
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,459
<i>McCarthy and Tyler.</i>

1052
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:58,631
<i>Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!</i>

1053
01:29:58,715 --> 01:30:01,342
<i>Slight mix-up, man.
It's not McCarthy versus Tyler.</i>

1054
01:30:01,426 --> 01:30:03,136
<i>It's McCarthy versus Taylor.</i>

1055
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:05,813
<i>I'm sorry, y'all.
It's McCarthy versus Taylor,</i>

1056
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:08,066
<i>and not McCarthy versus Tyler.</i>

1057
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:10,777
<i>We made a mistake. We misread. I'm sorry.</i>

1058
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,571
<i>I can't read sometimes.
I can't read. Damn it!</i>

1059
01:30:13,696 --> 01:30:15,031
<i>Don't boo me. I'll beat your ass.</i>

1060
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:16,824
You dodged a bullet there, huh?

1061
01:30:16,908 --> 01:30:18,826
Stick around. This'll be quick.

1062
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:32,173
<i>Oh, knee to the head!</i>

1063
01:30:43,518 --> 01:30:44,644
<i>Beatdown King.</i>

1064
01:30:57,365 --> 01:30:58,366
<i>Leg lock!</i>

1065
01:31:04,998 --> 01:31:06,624
<i>Jake Tyler!</i>

1066
01:31:16,634 --> 01:31:17,635
<i>Yeah!</i>

1067
01:31:52,712 --> 01:31:53,963
<i>Reversal!</i>

1068
01:32:08,645 --> 01:32:10,730
<i>He tapped out! He tapped out!</i>

1069
01:32:14,776 --> 01:32:17,820
<i>Jake Tyler returns from the dead.</i>

1070
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:38,675
Yeah!

1071
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:55,441
<i>Only eight guys left, people!</i>

1072
01:32:55,567 --> 01:32:58,903
<i>And we got Jake Tyler versus Dak-Ho.</i>

1073
01:33:01,197 --> 01:33:03,366
Down! Let him bring it!

1074
01:33:05,618 --> 01:33:07,620
<i>Jake Tyler is hurt!</i>

1075
01:33:07,704 --> 01:33:09,247
<i>A kick to the ribs.</i>

1076
01:33:13,626 --> 01:33:15,795
<i>Many exchanges with these two.</i>

1077
01:33:15,879 --> 01:33:16,880
<i>Watch out!</i>

1078
01:33:17,422 --> 01:33:18,840
<i>Superman!</i>

1079
01:33:18,923 --> 01:33:20,049
<i>Punch to the face!</i>

1080
01:33:20,175 --> 01:33:21,384
<i>Dak-Ho!</i>

1081
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,513
<i>- Come on!
- Dak-Ho is killing him out there!</i>

1082
01:33:26,848 --> 01:33:28,850
Bust that pretty face!

1083
01:33:35,398 --> 01:33:36,941
<i>Tyler slams Dak-Ho.</i>

1084
01:33:50,663 --> 01:33:52,749
<i>Leg lock! He's got the ankle.</i>

1085
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:56,711
<i>I think it's a wrap for Jake Tyler.
It's over. It's over.</i>

1086
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,676
<i>Reversal!</i>

1087
01:34:05,678 --> 01:34:09,307
<i>Jake Tyler, back from the dead.
How does he do it?</i>

1088
01:34:11,476 --> 01:34:12,560
<i>Triangle choke!</i>

1089
01:34:16,648 --> 01:34:18,525
<i>He tapped out!</i>

1090
01:34:18,983 --> 01:34:21,653
<i>It's over! It is over!</i>

1091
01:34:23,855 --> 01:34:26,191
<i>Jake Tyler is going on to the semi-finals.</i>

1092
01:34:26,274 --> 01:34:29,152
<i>I can't believe it! Dak-Ho is out of there!</i>

1093
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:31,696
<i>Fight fans have got to love it.</i>

1094
01:34:34,157 --> 01:34:38,411
<i>Give it up for the new guy, Jake Tyler!</i>

1095
01:34:56,429 --> 01:34:57,639
Hey!

1096
01:34:58,723 --> 01:35:00,350
Are you sure you can fight?

1097
01:35:01,184 --> 01:35:02,852
Yeah. Just give me a minute.

1098
01:35:13,613 --> 01:35:15,323
I said just give me a minute.

1099
01:35:18,243 --> 01:35:20,704
So, I show up,
and that's the welcome I get?

1100
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:24,291
You look like shit.

1101
01:35:26,543 --> 01:35:28,336
That's an insult to shit.

1102
01:35:29,713 --> 01:35:31,590
What are you doing here?

1103
01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:36,011
I guess I couldn't walk away either.

1104
01:35:37,971 --> 01:35:38,972
Why not?

1105
01:35:40,682 --> 01:35:43,101
I went back and sat with Max after you left,

1106
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:46,021
wondering when...

1107
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:49,858
If someone from his family
was going to show up.

1108
01:35:53,445 --> 01:35:55,488
Then I realized they already had.

1109
01:35:56,865 --> 01:35:57,991
I get it,

1110
01:35:59,242 --> 01:36:00,452
why you're fighting.

1111
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:09,127
It's like the Shield of Achilles.

1112
01:36:10,212 --> 01:36:12,964
You're fighting so that
you don't have to fight again.

1113
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,470
Shield of Achilles.

1114
01:36:21,431 --> 01:36:22,390
Nicely done.

1115
01:36:27,604 --> 01:36:29,064
You can do this.

1116
01:36:34,528 --> 01:36:36,446
<i>This is the semi-final round!</i>

1117
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:39,741
<i>Looks cute, but it's not enough.</i>

1118
01:36:41,201 --> 01:36:43,161
<i>Body slammed on the floor!</i>

1119
01:36:46,122 --> 01:36:48,708
<i>Come on, champ. What are you doing?
Why can't you finish?</i>

1120
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:52,587
<i>He ain't even fighting back.
Why you taking so long, champ?</i>

1121
01:36:52,796 --> 01:36:55,590
<i>This ain't the Ryan McCarthy
we've been seeing all night!</i>

1122
01:36:55,757 --> 01:36:57,300
<i>Give us a show, baby!</i>

1123
01:37:03,181 --> 01:37:05,517
<i>He taps out. Villa taps out!</i>

1124
01:37:05,642 --> 01:37:08,520
<i>Ryan McCarthy is the winner!</i>

1125
01:37:10,355 --> 01:37:11,690
<i>Give it up again!</i>

1126
01:37:11,898 --> 01:37:12,857
Yeah!

1127
01:37:12,983 --> 01:37:14,943
<i>Let him hear it, y'all. Let him hear it!</i>

1128
01:37:15,068 --> 01:37:16,194
We love you, Ryan!

1129
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:17,487
<i>McCarthy is going on</i>

1130
01:37:17,612 --> 01:37:18,905
<i>- to the Championship Round!
- Wait. Hold up.</i>

1131
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:20,156
Let me see.

1132
01:37:22,117 --> 01:37:25,161
McCarthy! Illegal move. DQ. Eye gouge.

1133
01:37:25,287 --> 01:37:26,621
<i>- Eye gouge?
- You're out.</i>

1134
01:37:26,705 --> 01:37:28,290
- Get over there.
- What? Keep it moving.

1135
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,375
<i>- Hold on, y'all!
- You're out!</i>

1136
01:37:32,335 --> 01:37:34,212
<i>Ryan McCarthy eye gouges Villa!</i>

1137
01:37:34,337 --> 01:37:36,298
<i>He is disqualified.</i>

1138
01:37:49,936 --> 01:37:53,523
<i>This is Jake Tyler versus Tommy Kline.</i>

1139
01:38:01,489 --> 01:38:03,074
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1140
01:38:06,077 --> 01:38:07,037
Are you ready?

1141
01:38:07,913 --> 01:38:08,872
Ready?

1142
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:12,792
Fight, already!

1143
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:15,629
- What happened to McCarthy?
- DQ.

1144
01:38:16,713 --> 01:38:17,672
Fight!

1145
01:38:23,094 --> 01:38:24,554
Did he just tap out?

1146
01:38:24,971 --> 01:38:26,348
You're not serious!

1147
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:28,183
Come on, let's go.

1148
01:38:29,935 --> 01:38:33,897
<i>Jake Tyler taps out!
He didn't even throw a punch yet.</i>

1149
01:38:35,815 --> 01:38:38,652
<i>The winner by default is Tommy Kline.</i>

1150
01:38:38,735 --> 01:38:40,987
<i>So, what the hell is going on tonight, man?</i>

1151
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:43,532
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

1152
01:38:43,615 --> 01:38:48,411
<i>I guess the championship match
is between Villa and Kline.</i>

1153
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:50,330
<i>Sounds like a bad law firm.</i>

1154
01:38:50,455 --> 01:38:53,250
<i>I'm pissed off.
I'm going in the back to cool off.</i>

1155
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:53,500
<i>I'm pissed off.
I'm going in the back to cool off.</i>

1156
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,043
You sure you're okay?

1157
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:56,670
Yeah.

1158
01:38:59,256 --> 01:39:00,674
What the hell was that?

1159
01:39:06,263 --> 01:39:09,766
This is about me and you.
I don't care about some tournament.

1160
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:15,021
You giving up? Is that what you're doing?

1161
01:39:15,105 --> 01:39:18,525
No. I showed up. I'm here. I'm ready.

1162
01:39:22,737 --> 01:39:24,531
There's nobody here to watch now.

1163
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:27,367
That's all you care about, right?

1164
01:39:27,617 --> 01:39:28,910
"Spectator sport"?

1165
01:39:32,122 --> 01:39:33,456
That's all you got.

1166
01:39:34,332 --> 01:39:35,500
Now you got nothing.

1167
01:39:36,835 --> 01:39:38,795
Walk away from it, man.

1168
01:39:46,553 --> 01:39:47,846
Ryan, stop!

1169
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:03,445
It's on.

1170
01:40:04,029 --> 01:40:06,907
The real championship is going on outside.

1171
01:40:09,576 --> 01:40:11,244
<i>Where the hell y'all going?</i>

1172
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,788
<i>Y'all can't leave the Beatdown like that.</i>

1173
01:40:14,247 --> 01:40:15,707
<i>Fight? Oh, shit!</i>

1174
01:40:26,509 --> 01:40:27,719
Light them up, man!

1175
01:40:29,763 --> 01:40:30,722
Watch his feet!

1176
01:40:30,847 --> 01:40:32,265
Kill him, Ryan!

1177
01:40:36,853 --> 01:40:38,897
Come on, Ryan. You past his door, baby.

1178
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,152
Don't let him tie you up!

1179
01:40:46,071 --> 01:40:48,657
Come on, grapple with him.
Get on the ground with him.

1180
01:40:50,575 --> 01:40:52,661
Yeah, baby. Come on, Ryan, get up!

1181
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:54,204
Come on, Ryan! Get up!

1182
01:40:55,664 --> 01:40:59,084
Come on, Ryan. You did it before.
Overhand right. Overhand right.

1183
01:41:05,131 --> 01:41:08,301
Jake, you're weak, man. You're weak, Jake.
You ain't got nothing!

1184
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:22,732
This is the Beatdown right here!

1185
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:24,693
You got moves!

1186
01:41:24,818 --> 01:41:26,403
Nice shield! Nice shield!

1187
01:41:28,947 --> 01:41:31,700
Go for the ribs, Ryan. He's hurt.
Go for the ribs.

1188
01:41:35,996 --> 01:41:37,372
Come on, Ryan! Get him!

1189
01:41:47,257 --> 01:41:49,134
Come on, Ryan! Get out of it!

1190
01:41:52,345 --> 01:41:53,346
Come on, Ryan!

1191
01:42:02,147 --> 01:42:05,192
Crack those ribs, baby.
Break them. Tenderize them!

1192
01:42:05,692 --> 01:42:06,693
Go, Ryan!

1193
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:08,445
Ryan, stop it!

1194
01:42:14,075 --> 01:42:15,160
Jake! Come on!

1195
01:42:26,129 --> 01:42:27,547
Don't freak out, man!

1196
01:42:46,024 --> 01:42:46,983
Jake!

1197
01:42:52,322 --> 01:42:53,573
What the hell are you doing?

1198
01:42:53,657 --> 01:42:54,699
Ryan, you're an asshole!

1199
01:42:54,783 --> 01:42:56,701
Come on, Jake! Tap out, man!

1200
01:42:56,826 --> 01:42:57,786
Jake!

1201
01:42:57,911 --> 01:42:59,663
What are you doing? Ryan!

1202
01:42:59,955 --> 01:43:01,623
Ryan, let go!

1203
01:43:01,706 --> 01:43:04,459
You're gonna kill him, Ryan!
What the hell are you doing?

1204
01:43:05,585 --> 01:43:06,586
Jake!

1205
01:44:15,363 --> 01:44:16,656
Yeah!

1206
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,078
Sorry.

1207
01:45:02,994 --> 01:45:04,746
You should not be driving a stick.

1208
01:45:04,871 --> 01:45:06,998
That's big talk from a guy
who takes the bus.

1209
01:45:40,198 --> 01:45:42,325
Hey, Max. You okay?

1210
01:45:43,201 --> 01:45:46,955
Improving significantly.

1211
01:45:47,247 --> 01:45:48,373
Yeah!
