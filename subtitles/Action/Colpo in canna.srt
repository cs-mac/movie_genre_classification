1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,450
Attention please, we are landing
in Naples at Capodichino Airport.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,448
All passengers are kindly requested
to fasten their seatbelts.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,566
May I?

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,925
- Everything all right, Father?
- Yes, my child.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,049
Why don't you sit here with me?

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,567
It's against regulations.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,764
A good deed is never
against regulations.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,048
Air conditioning? Certainly.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,921
Fasten your seatbelt please.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,490
LOADED GUNS

11
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,606
- Where's Nora?
- I dunno! Get in.

12
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,651
I was sure I'd find you
with a man! Was he nice?

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,005
Generous. He gave me 100 dollars
to deliver this letter.

14
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,442
Maybe he gave you his home address.

15
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,001
Well then, 100 dollars isn't enough!

16
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,561
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Naples is full of warmth.

17
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,447
- It's marvellous.
- The people are full of warmth too.

18
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,730
Can you stop here, please?
I've got to get off.

19
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,288
- Where are you going?
- To run that errand.

20
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,730
- I'll see you at the hotel.
- So, they call it an "errand" now!

21
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,048
It's an amusement park, silly!

22
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,931
What is it, Father?

23
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,811
I started out
as a missionary in Africa.

24
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,449
We're in the same hotel, but I
expect you'll want an early night.

25
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,731
IT'S SPRING
YOU CAN SEE IT, I CAN'T

26
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,129
You're gorgeous!

27
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,967
- May I help you?
- I have a letter for Mr Silvera.

28
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,811
- Give it to me.
- I have to deliver it personally.

29
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,570
Follow me.

30
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,647
Women always follow me.

31
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,366
You're beautiful! This way.

32
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,571
Women always come with me.
Posillipo, Mare Chiaro. You know it?

33
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,762
I'll take you there too.

34
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,727
We're here. I'll wait for you.

35
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
He's brought personality
to the team.

36
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,161
Excuse me, I have a letter
for Mr Silvera.

37
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,207
- Mr Silvera?
- That's me.

38
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,250
Well, I'd better be going.

39
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,288
No, we always send a reply.

40
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,925
- It's from the American.
- The American's here?

41
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,040
- Who gave you this letter?
- You'd better answer.

42
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,127
A man at the airport
asked me to do him a favour.

43
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,761
He said he couldn't
deliver it himself

44
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,607
because he was leaving right away.
He said it was important.

45
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,366
- He gave me 100 dollars.
- Describe him.

46
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,843
- I really don't know...
- Not the face!

47
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,523
He was a tall, heavily built man.

48
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,490
He was wearing a Panama hat
and big dark glasses.

49
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,522
I didn't really see his face.

50
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,481
That's all I can tell you,
I don't know anything.

51
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,524
You hardly said a thing.

52
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,090
100 dollars.

53
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,843
Her name's Nora Green.

54
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,889
What was in the letter?

55
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,208
The American says I'm a dead man.

56
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,170
It's his style,

57
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,966
but he's made a mistake
by warning me.

58
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,450
If she brought the letter, she must
work for him. I'm sure of it!

59
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,003
Only one thing's for sure
with the American.

60
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,410
Whoever sees him never lives
to describe him. He works alone.

61
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,730
- But she...
- I think she's telling the truth.

62
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,411
But she must've seen him.

63
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,605
You don't send a death sentence
without making sure it's delivered.

64
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,687
The American is close by
so he can check up on her.

65
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,800
- It's not true that he left.
- Oh yes, the American's here.

66
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
But he'll be very sorry
that he stuck around,

67
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,286
because she'll lead me
right to him.

68
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,409
Where are you staying?

69
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,604
The company booked us
into the Holiday Inn.

70
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,321
Think you could recognise him
if you saw him again?

71
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,601
Maybe.

72
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,322
- Maybe yes or maybe no?
- Maybe yes.

73
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,161
Okay, stay in town
until he makes contact with you.

74
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,886
The plane can leave
minus one hostess.

75
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,731
But they'll want to know why.

76
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,129
Because of your health.
Your health's in danger.

77
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,603
- What do you mean?
- Get this through your head:

78
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,805
We don't play games.

79
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,651
And I don't have to remind you
to keep quiet

80
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,002
about what happened
in here.

81
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,005
Not a word to anybody,
understand?

82
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,570
Now get her out of here!

83
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,045
Follow her.

84
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,691
Miss!

85
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,771
How lovely!

86
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,889
She's like a statue.

87
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,646
Miss!

88
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,684
Are you sleeping?

89
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,446
What's she dreaming about?

90
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,322
So smooth!

91
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,090
The tits...

92
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,840
- I really like you!
- Tano, what are you doing?

93
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,208
- Dirty pig!
- What do you want?

94
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,208
- Leave me alone!
- Beat it!

95
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,684
Jealous!

96
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,050
I saw her first!
I know how to handle women!

97
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,328
I've had more than you!

98
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,001
And I satisfied all of them!

99
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,681
I never had any complaints!

100
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,082
I never had any complaints!

101
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,524
I'll come looking for her!

102
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,090
Don't lose them.

103
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,207
He's asking for trouble.

104
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,249
He's taking her home!

105
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,964
Okay, pull up here.

106
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,207
Get out! Everybody out!

107
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,444
Manuel, you said we could
stay here today.

108
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,127
- Some friend!
- Get out!

109
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,681
Beat it!

110
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,562
- Who are you?
- Just get some rest.

111
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,125
This is my place.
You're safe here.

112
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,681
I've got to go out
but I'll be back soon.

113
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,886
Get some sleep
and you'll feel better.

114
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,242
Yes, it's a good idea.

115
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,569
- You're sure it's no trouble?
- Of course not!

116
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,489
I set it for eight.

117
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,124
I'll be back by then.

118
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,602
I'll get your uniform repaired.

119
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,847
You're very kind.
I don't know how to thank you.

120
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,091
Don't worry,
we'll work something out.

121
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,408
213, please.

122
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,322
Carmen, it's Nora.

123
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,682
Where the hell are you?

124
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,402
Chasing after some cute guy?
The captain was looking for you.

125
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,081
- What for?
- We've got engine trouble.

126
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,328
They're sending spare parts
from Turin,

127
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,523
so in the mean time
we're on holiday.

128
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,444
He wanted you to know.

129
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,843
So, what's this man like?

130
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,209
- What man?
- Don't tell me you're not in bed?

131
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,443
- What's he like?
- What's yours like?

132
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,243
Mine's divine! You know him.
I was surprised by his talents.

133
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,083
- Mine's adorable.
- And what's he like in bed?

134
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,840
I don't know yet. Bye, Carmen.

135
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,568
See you tomorrow, at the hotel.

136
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,160
It was a girl I work with.
I thought she might be worried.

137
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,765
- They roughed you up a bit, huh?
- About as much as I could take.

138
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,410
- Want something to drink?
- Oh, yes please!

139
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,920
Fine.

140
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,366
- Just two fingers.
- Okay.

141
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,682
- Here.
- Thanks.

142
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,160
What if Silvera doesn't like the idea
of your helping me?

143
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,250
You work there, right?

144
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,364
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

145
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,401
Anyway, my contract ran out.
I'll go somewhere else.

146
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,921
- What's your name?
- Manuel.

147
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,486
And yours?

148
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,602
My mother always told me
never to trust strangers,

149
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,163
but the man at the airport
seemed nice enough.

150
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,922
And I only delivered a letter
to Mr Silvera for him.

151
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,364
Want some music?

152
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,126
I didn't expect
a welcome like that.

153
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,443
What was in the letter?

154
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,207
I didn't read it,
but from the way they were talking,

155
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,761
it sounds like somebody
called the American

156
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,801
is in Naples and
threatening to kill Silvera.

157
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,767
They think he'll contact me
to ask if I delivered it.

158
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,001
Like to know more about
the American?

159
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,886
Oh God, no!
I don't want roughing up again.

160
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,527
I've never had a beating like that
in my life!

161
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,969
Maybe it's better
that you know everything.

162
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,169
Get dressed now.

163
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,603
- I've got nothing to put on.
- Don't worry.

164
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,242
What are you talking about?

165
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,843
Take anything you want.

166
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,846
My God! Where did you get
all those dresses?

167
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,528
This place is an open house.
Women come and go.

168
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,764
You'd be surprised
at what you can find here.

169
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,606
You should look good in this.
Like it?

170
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,524
It's gorgeous!

171
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,002
- Here!
- Thanks!

172
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,771
It's perfect.

173
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,126
What are all
these photographs?

174
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,965
Are you a boxer?

175
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,569
I used to be.

176
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,010
- But I quit.
- Why?

177
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,329
It was too hard.

178
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,604
Now I work as an acrobat,
it's more fun.

179
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,163
How do I look?

180
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,761
- You're fantastic.
- Thanks.

181
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,729
Come on, let's not waste any time.

182
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,888
We've got to go to the police.
You need protection.

183
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,889
- The police?
- Yes, come on.

184
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,162
- We'd better hurry.
- Shouldn't we just let it drop?

185
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,284
We'll go to Inspector Calogero.
He'll give you a hand.

186
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,206
And what'll I do with Calogero's hand?

187
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,605
Silvera told me not to tell anyone.

188
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,049
But if you really think
the police should know...

189
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,046
l do.

190
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,646
I really do.

191
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,843
Come on. It's near here.

192
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,204
Is the inspector here?

193
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,488
Ammirata, I'm talking to you!

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,490
May we come in?

195
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,443
Excuse me! Please...

196
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,921
...sit down.

197
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,731
Hi, Manuel.
You always keep good company.

198
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,124
Are you English?

199
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,571
They're Tuscan,
the finest Italian quality.

200
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,365
Give her a light.

201
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,969
Later. The first drag's bad,
the second one's worse.

202
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,608
I'm at your disposal for
whatever it is you need.

203
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,207
- You're very kind.
- Don't mention it.

204
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,170
Who is the American?

205
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,523
- Who's the American?
- An aperitif.

206
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,767
You want me to tell you
who the American is? Why?

207
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,331
He's in town and wants to kill Silvera.

208
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,004
That's good news.
Did the lady tell you that?

209
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,923
Give me your passport!

210
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,651
Passport.

211
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,842
Nice, eh?
But you're better in the ﬂesh.

212
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,971
She took a letter from the American
to Silvera and now she's bait.

213
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,882
- You've got to do something.
- I'm afraid I can't do much.

214
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,731
Arrest Silvera. The American leaves
and the girl has no more trouble.

215
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,525
There's no evidence.

216
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,208
- Arrest the American then.
- Sure, we'll arrest the American!

217
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,761
It's been five years, dammit,

218
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,004
that we've been trying
to arrest him!

219
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,046
Even the FBI
didn't manage it!

220
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,807
There are no documents,
or proof!

221
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,447
As soon as anyone sees his face,
they're dead!

222
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,366
Then he shows up:
"Why don't you arrest the American?"

223
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,409
As if it was a piece of cake!

224
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,924
His presence has been reported
all over the world!

225
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,365
There's a rumour going round
that he killed Anastasia

226
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,011
at the barbers.

227
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,761
He's always nearby
when drugs are involved.

228
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,562
Hashish, cocaine, LSD,
score settling...

229
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,811
He pits gangs against each other,
screws 'em and vanishes.

230
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,004
He's useful: He screws the gangs
while we try to screw him!

231
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,282
And this one asks
why we don't arrest him!

232
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,446
To make it short. lf l don't have
a case, I can't do a thing.

233
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,807
I've got to make a phonecall.

234
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,967
- What did you say?
- I said good evening.

235
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,402
Are you blind or deaf?

236
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,045
Let's go.

237
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,005
A prisoner governor asks a
condemned man in the electric chair:

238
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,126
"What can do I for you?"
"Hold my hand!"

239
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,766
"Today I'll get some sun!"
"Well, put it back afterwards!"

240
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,526
Government ministers
eat too much.

241
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,730
The cabinet they spend most time in
is the W.C.!

242
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,443
"Yes, who's speaking?"
"I haven't even said hello yet!"

243
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,081
- Are you busy, sir?
- No.

244
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,646
- And you?
- No.

245
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,969
Well let's get moving
or we'll be here all night!

246
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,727
Thank you.

247
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,651
- Hi, Rosy.
- My dear Manuel!

248
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,083
Is this your latest conquest?
Good luck, miss.

249
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,250
Few men are as good in bed
as Manuel.

250
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,090
And if I say that...

251
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,523
The American's in town
and he wants to kill Silvera.

252
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,126
Does Don Calf) know?

253
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,728
The only ones who know are
Silvera, Calogero and us.

254
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,523
Us? Who is she?

255
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,083
My name's Nora.
Nice to meet you.

256
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,411
I'm Rosy.
The pleasure's all mine!

257
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,329
You're a very pretty lady.

258
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,126
From you, that's a real compliment.

259
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,047
Nora wants to know what'll happen.

260
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,169
She's very interested.

261
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,207
Silvera and Don Calo are the bosses
They've been feuding for years.

262
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,251
If the American is here,
there's going be trouble.

263
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,488
Big trouble for everyone.

264
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,970
I'm telling you this for free,
but if you bring plenty of money...

265
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,522
I'll tell you something else.

266
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,568
- Do me a favour. See those two?
- Yes.

267
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,607
Keep them busy for a while.

268
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,050
The forces of law and order, eh?

269
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,446
- Who's she?
- She was Silvera's mistress.

270
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,171
Then Calo's.

271
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,240
Maybe she's Calogero's mistress now,
but no one knows for sure.

272
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,887
She knows everything about everyone.

273
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,329
Ammirata must still be at the club.

274
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,481
You call this place home?

275
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,841
There's even a john
in the lounge!

276
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,127
I swear by the Blessed Virgin,

277
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,250
I've never seen a house
with a john in the lounge!

278
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,923
Now let's talk about you.

279
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,403
Outings to police headquarters
won't do you any good.

280
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,082
Silvera told you he didn't want
his private business going public.

281
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,160
And Silvera's always sorry when
someone doesn't do what he said.

282
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,923
You'd better go back to the hotel,
someone might come looking for you.

283
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,966
Curtain!

284
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,160
Stop him!

285
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,651
You took a bath, eh?
You still stink though.

286
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Go dry yourself!

287
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,441
Come on, you big lump.

288
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,364
Inspector, we've got
some very rowdy guests here,

289
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,161
can you give us a hand?
I'm at Manuel's place.

290
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,162
Don't worry, I've got men everywhere.
Even outside Manuel's.

291
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,649
Now I'll kill you!

292
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,684
I'll kill you!

293
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,764
I'll send you to hell.

294
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
Bastard!

295
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,126
- At last!
- Where are they?

296
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,681
One's in the closet
and there's two on the bed.

297
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,925
They're friends, but they got drunk
and wrecked the place!

298
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,967
You're in trouble
because of me.

299
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,764
Sure, I'm in trouble,
but not because of you!

300
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,128
How disappointing.

301
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,083
I knew something
was going to happen to me.

302
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,766
I happened to you.

303
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,323
- But you're no trouble.
- Who knows?

304
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,761
Would you tie it for me?

305
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,809
Slop it! I'll do it!

306
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,842
Don Calo, it's Manuel.

307
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,681
Yes, she's leaving now.

308
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,969
Don't make a fuss.
Get in the car.

309
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,886
- Where are we going?
- Dancing.

310
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,289
How nice!
You can teach me some new steps.

311
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,209
I'm Cali). I was anxious
to meet you.

312
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,208
I can't say the same.

313
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,447
I heard about the message
you took to Silvera

314
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,330
and what he did to you.

315
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,886
Oh, yes?

316
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,041
Well then, you also heard that
I told your friend everything I know.

317
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,601
Silvera and I are not friends.

318
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,809
Actually, we're rivals.

319
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,651
Would you like to earn some cash?

320
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,324
No. I took a beating while
I was earning some cash this morning.

321
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,004
Take it all the same, you don't have
to deliver it anywhere.

322
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,808
Take it, it's yours.
You can spend it how you want.

323
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,442
Ten thousand dollars.

324
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,763
Nothing I can tell you
is worth ten thousand dollars.

325
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,330
And I don't want to buy anything
from you.

326
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,287
It's a minimum payment

327
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,048
for the pleasure of meeting you.

328
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,207
If the American moves against
Silvera, we won't interfere.

329
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,967
If Silvera moves against
the American, we will.

330
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,648
As you can see,
it's to your advantage.

331
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,365
It's to my advantage to be caught
in the crossfire?

332
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,082
I'm going to dance with my friends.

333
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,888
You know that this
is a very dangerous game.

334
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,089
Are you afraid?

335
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,527
No, I'm not. Are you?

336
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,001
I love dangerous games.

337
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,128
- Father, shall we dance?
- I don't know how.

338
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,044
Come on, it's easy.

339
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,203
We'll teach you how.

340
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,570
But I can't.

341
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,004
- Let yourself go.
- I'm in my work clothes.

342
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,760
Well done!

343
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,560
- Even priests dance too?
- I've got papal dispensation.

344
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,844
Well done!

345
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,887
I'm going back to the hotel, guys.

346
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,411
You boys
don't even know how to kiss!

347
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,170
I'm exhausted!

348
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,969
Later. Listen...

349
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,727
Miss Gren...

350
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,730
Green, not Gren.

351
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,367
- Right away.
- Call her!

352
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,841
Someone to see you,
Miss Green.

353
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,084
- Me?
- I think they're policemen.

354
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,002
Okay, thanks. I'll be right down.

355
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,401
Believe me, she's got a double
helping of legs!

356
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,444
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

357
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,921
Anything come up?

358
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,402
- What?
- New developments.

359
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,286
None.

360
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,126
Apart from the fact
that I'm always followed.

361
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,207
I don't know if it's because of
my legs or because of the American.

362
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,922
It seems that you received
a large amount of cash.

363
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,730
Ten thousand dollars.

364
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,924
- Did you call me?
- You're wanted on the phone.

365
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,684
- Me?
- You, Miss Green.

366
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,445
Yes, just a moment.

367
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,764
It's Manuel, he wants to make love.

368
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,801
He wants to know if he should come
here, or I should go to him.

369
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,725
I don't know.

370
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,004
Here? His place?

371
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,169
You decide. What do I care?

372
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,923
Come here darling. I'll expect you.
But not till this evening.

373
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,561
I'd like to break her...

374
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,250
- I...
- Let's go!

375
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,840
- Forcella. Quickly!
- Certainly.

376
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,291
- God, it's so hot!
- Yes. Take something off.

377
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,449
- Excuse me, are you married?
- Yes, I was young and foolish.

378
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,686
- Have you got a mistress?
- Yes, I'm middle-aged and stupid!

379
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,605
- Listen.
- Certainly.

380
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,130
A Citroen and a Fiat are behind us.
My husband's in the Citroen

381
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,249
and my lover's wife
is in the Fiat.

382
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,047
What is this? A quiz?

383
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,850
Imagine

384
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,245
that the man in the Citroen
is your mistress' husband

385
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,046
and the women in the Fiat is
your wife. What would you do?

386
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,731
I dunno, but there's a green
Alfa Romeo after us too.

387
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,128
Really? Where?

388
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,922
- Who could it be?
- It'll be the Green Brigade!

389
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,640
If my lover's wife is in one car
and my husband's in the other,

390
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,445
maybe it's the police.

391
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,444
- The police?
- What'll we do?

392
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,481
I don't get it, but if it's
the police I'll put my foot down.

393
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,683
Anyway, it's fun!

394
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,045
Bloody hell!

395
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,923
Where do they think they are?
Monza?

396
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,921
- We've got to lose them!
- Well, we don't want to find them!

397
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,370
I'll drop you at the traffic lights
and you can make a run for it!

398
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,604
You're a darling!

399
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,648
Wait for the green.
Get ready.

400
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,127
Take the second on the right,
it's pedestrians only.

401
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,206
Go!

402
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,443
She loves me, she loves me not...

403
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,923
- What is it?
- I'm down in the dumps.

404
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,481
What happened? You lost?

405
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,046
Everything.

406
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,010
Including a cute guy.

407
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,123
Want to play with me?

408
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,003
I'd prefer Manuel,
if you're hiring him out.

409
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,681
Manuel doesn't belong to me.

410
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,811
Wait a second,
are those pounds or francs?

411
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,721
Ten thousand dollars.
I want to gamble with you.

412
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,688
Dollars? I'm short-sighted,
I need to see them up close.

413
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,611
Well...

414
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,968
Place your bet.

415
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,083
What are we playing?

416
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,964
Who's who.

417
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,448
Don Calo and Silvera
are watching the port, airport

418
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,843
roads and train stations
and they're after the American.

419
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,731
You can't leave either, you know.

420
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,647
Well then, I've won this hand.

421
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,728
- Go on.
- Silvera and Calo hate each other.

422
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,285
They're both waiting for you
to make a move.

423
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,205
Let's Play

424
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,285
- Luck's on your side, eh?
- On mine, yes.

425
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,328
But you're in very hot water.

426
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,682
Not even Calf) can help you.

427
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,524
- One last question.
- What's the use?

428
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,368
- You've not got long left.
- Answer it anyway.

429
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,331
Who controls the drug traffic
here?

430
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,722
Ali. He runs "La Nigra", a nightclub
just outside town.

431
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,005
I'm seeing him tomorrow at ten.
Got a message for him?

432
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,648
Put a good word in for me
with the American.

433
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,763
Tell him I helped you.

434
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,242
- Who do you work for?
- Everyone.

435
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,569
Anyone who has
a Swiss bank account.

436
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,606
- But I'm small fry.
- Try not to get any bigger.

437
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,162
Mr. Manuel
called three times.

438
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,010
Thanks. My key.

439
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,490
I hope you're not trying
to leave town.

440
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,209
Don't worry, if I leave I'll
let you know. You don't scare me.

441
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,045
You still need
to work on that kiss.

442
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,650
- Look who's here. What do you want?
- I've got a delivery for you.

443
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,050
How kind! And what else?

444
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,204
Can't you see?

445
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,727
- What are you doing?
- Taking everything off.

446
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,606
The jacket's no problem. Let's do it.

447
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,969
- Who do you work for?
- I just work for myself.

448
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,040
But if you're nice, I'll work for
you too. I'm yours on special offer.

449
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,125
- Well, I've got better offers.
- But I've got this!

450
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,364
- Let's do it to music.
- Yes!

451
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,568
Music turns me on!

452
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,490
Great!

453
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,851
It's Nora. Yes, everything's fine...

454
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,687
...except for one little thing.
There's a blockage in the bathtub.

455
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,764
Come and remove it.

456
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,285
In there.

457
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,209
Hello, darling.
Yes, everything's fine.

458
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,490
Did he drown?
That's lucky!

459
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,843
What is it?
Okay, this evening.

460
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,208
I can't right now, I'm busy.

461
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,923
Who's Manuel with?

462
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,962
Maybe he works for Silvera, and
maybe he has contacts in the police.

463
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,250
You need to be very clever
to work it out.

464
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,242
I've got it worked out.

465
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,085
Excuse me, but that priest
just talked dirty to me!

466
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,010
We'll take care of him!

467
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,408
These modern priests!

468
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,605
- You're a fine example!
- I'll do the talking!

469
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,002
Father, you've gone too far.

470
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,129
I can assure you that
I had the purest of motives.

471
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,649
- The filthiest of motives.
- No...

472
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,211
Careful with those brooms.
A priest's collar is a uniform!

473
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,971
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

474
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,843
They were swept away!

475
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,651
- We'll win the shield this year.
- I don't think so.

476
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,684
Hi, sweeties!

477
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,930
That bitch!

478
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,602
To Ali's club, quickly.

479
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,048
- It's you!
- Miss!

480
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,203
- Full speed ahead?
- Yes.

481
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,083
Here. Look, this place has
a bad reputation.

482
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,250
I know, I'd never bring
my boyfriend here.

483
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,366
- What are you going to do?
- Don't go. I owe you for two rides.

484
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,366
I don't care, I'll wait.
You'll be quick, right?

485
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,968
- I'm sure I will.
- She's so nice!

486
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,930
She loves me, she loves me not.

487
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,524
What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

488
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,842
- Hooking.
- Well!

489
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,489
How much?

490
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,649
Whatever you want to give.

491
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,600
Okay.

492
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,524
What about me?

493
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,083
One at a time!
I work in the traditional way.

494
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,725
You can wait.

495
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,127
- You know the way.
- I come this way often.

496
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,602
Gonna take on my buddy afterwards?

497
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,321
- Is he good in bed?
- How should I know?

498
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,126
Well, these days
you never can tell...

499
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,521
You don't beat around
the bush.

500
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,684
What's that?

501
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,446
Ether.

502
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,571
Lousy thief! What've you taken?

503
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,126
Don't get mad.
Forgive me, please.

504
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,289
Believe me, I...
just wanted some spare change.

505
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,321
Pity. He looked like
he'd be good in bed.

506
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,082
You went in normal
and came out super!

507
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,887
The Holiday Inn.
Slowly, this time.

508
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,923
Maybe we should go fast
to keep ourselves in shape.

509
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,969
Hold tight!

510
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,445
That blind man didn't see me.

511
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,808
The mike's been planted.

512
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,206
It should be on 27 megs.
You've got to tune in.

513
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,808
- Who is it?
- Manuel.

514
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,810
Come in.

515
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,601
- Your uniform.
- Thanks.

516
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,925
This is Silvera.
Let me speak to Ali.

517
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,208
I'll go get him.

518
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,809
Think about me now.

519
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,249
It's me. What is it, Silvera.

520
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,524
- Whers the shipment due?
- It belongs to Don Calo.

521
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,161
I'll triple what he's paying for it.

522
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,730
Forget it. What's going on?
I don't want trouble with Don Cali).

523
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,288
The American's in town.
Just blame it on him.

524
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,969
The Americanls here? You want me
to screw Don Calo and blame him?

525
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,242
You're crazy! Do you know
what I'd be getting myself into?

526
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,569
- I don't want to get killed.
- The American's here to kill me.

527
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,367
I could tell him you came up with
this idea to get him out of the way.

528
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,843
- You can't do that to me.
- I'll do worse, you bastard!

529
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,410
I need that shipment
for the people in Miami.

530
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,968
That's the only way I can watch
my back and get rid of the American.

531
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,245
That's your business.
I can't double cross Don Cali).

532
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,367
I'll give you 25%.

533
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,284
That's a pile of money.

534
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,682
It could be
the cost of my life.

535
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,449
You're life's worthless if you don't
tell me where that shipment docks.

536
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,321
Okay, but don't get me
mixed up with the American.

537
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,161
I don't want
to even hear his name.

538
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,411
I'll tell Don Calf) that
I lost contact with the Tunisian.

539
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,967
The shipment docks
at Cala Bianca at four.

540
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,846
Do what you did last time,
then we'll take over.

541
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,810
It's always three men
who bring it.

542
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,522
Don't mention me to the American.

543
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,365
Don't worry.

544
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,650
Why did you want me to hear that phonecall?

545
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,045
You're not really
a stewardess, are you?

546
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,570
I thought only women
were curious.

547
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,845
You can't get out of it like that.
I want to know everything.

548
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,960
Forget it. You're too young,
too cute and too good in bed.

549
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,449
- Why kill yourself?
- Who do you work for?

550
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,650
Want some advice?
Get as far away as possible.

551
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,003
You'll read about
what happened in the papers.

552
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,124
What else can you do
besides make love?

553
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,922
- Nothing.
- You'll find a job easily.

554
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,129
If you give me a hand.

555
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,285
It's Nora. Get up here right away.

556
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,764
Are you a cop?

557
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,442
Do you work for the guys in Miami?

558
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,481
You're the American's lady friend?

559
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,444
You work for him.

560
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,968
- Tell me who you work for.
- Forget it, darling.

561
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,605
Come here.

562
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,481
Look after him, he's mine.
I want him back in one piece.

563
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,050
The shipment arrived
and has already changed hands.

564
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,250
Silvera's men have got it.
There's three of them.

565
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,285
They're on the way up. Get ready.

566
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,003
The Lord awaits you.

567
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,850
- Me?
- Yes.

568
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,601
Mr. Silvera, how are you?

569
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,130
I've got something here
that's very important to you.

570
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,808
I've got my vices,
but cocaine isn't one of them.

571
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,447
So I thought I'd let you have it.

572
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,287
- There's a price, naturally.
- Any price. Name it!

573
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,002
Send your underdogs out for
a walk and I'll bring it to you.

574
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,204
- Come here right away!
- Don't worry, I'm close by.

575
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,124
I'll come when I'm ready.

576
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,762
You understand that
I can't take any risks.

577
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,809
Be seeing you!

578
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,607
And of course, when I say money,
I mean dollars.

579
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,720
Damn bitch!

580
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,922
Inspector Calogero? Hello.

581
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,050
Did you enjoy the party at Cala Bianca?

582
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,044
Where are you?

583
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,169
I'm out having coffee.

584
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,920
Will I ever catch up with you, goddammit?

585
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,930
Inspector!

586
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,365
It just slipped out!
Where are you exactly?

587
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,763
I'm having coffee.
Work it out.

588
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,562
She's calling from a public phone.
Try and trace it!

589
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,608
Say hi to your deputy for me.
You won't have time to trace me.

590
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,163
Do you want to clean up,
once and for all?

591
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,046
Catch Silvera and Don Calo red-handed?

592
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,284
- No, I want you!
- I know, but you're not my type.

593
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,002
Don Calo is on his way to Silvera's.

594
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,891
They'll probably
tear each other apart.

595
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,969
You'll find the cocaine too.
Goodbye.

596
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,242
What do you mean, goodbye?

597
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,444
Try not to get there
before Don Cali).

598
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,411
- Wait a moment.
- Bye, ugly.

599
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,409
She meant you.

600
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,842
Everyone's after Nora.
She won't get away with it.

601
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,004
No, this time
she's risked too much.

602
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,047
She wanted to invite
the inspector to the party too.

603
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,808
As usual,
Nora loves gambling.

604
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,648
And if we come out of hiding?

605
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,766
It took us 10 years to build
the image of The American.

606
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,003
There's the local police too.

607
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,411
Crooks and cops everywhere will know
that the American's just a bogeyman.

608
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,968
And Nora came here as a stewardess.
That's how she's got to leave.

609
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,924
If she gets out.

610
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,607
She always does what she wants.

611
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,323
Anyway, this character we invented,
The American,

612
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,568
buys us our daily bread.

613
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,729
And he'll keep on buying it.

614
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,924
They just called.
Don Calo's coming with his men.

615
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,607
Get ready, but no shooting.

616
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,126
Okay.

617
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,445
May I?

618
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,922
You outsmarted us all,
you goddamned bitch!

619
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,447
Mr Silvera, what language!

620
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,001
And in front of a lady too.

621
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,124
Here's your dollars.

622
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,010
You won't get far!

623
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,687
What manners!
Don't force me to shoot you!

624
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,048
Watch out, you dirty bitch!

625
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,727
This time the American's
not here to save you!

626
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,169
- Thanks.
- Your welcome.

627
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,922
We came to give you a hand,
the others didn't want to.

628
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,684
- What a waste. Want some?
- Depends on the quality.

629
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,330
Second rate.

630
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,921
- Awful.
- Let's go. See you at the airport.

631
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,969
See you. Bye, my child.

632
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,971
Careful.
Getting out of here won't be easy.

633
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,003
Go look for them.

634
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,002
Get over to the Bumper Cars!

635
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,968
Don Calo's here with his men.

636
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,961
- What use is half a cane?
- It'll come in handy.

637
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,966
Here come two of them.

638
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,525
Here they are...

639
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,089
What is it, my son?

640
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,480
One, two, three, four...

641
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,763
- Now I'll smash...
- Your head.

642
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,691
Now I'll smash...

643
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,322
- Now I'll smash...
- Your head.

644
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,966
- Here!
- My poor head!

645
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,001
I'm ﬂying!

646
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,044
Go, mosquito!

647
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,250
- You big lump!
- How dare you! Shorty!

648
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,726
You big lump!

649
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,363
Wait, I'll be right back.

650
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,170
Fix him!

651
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,566
Wait.

652
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,410
Are you leaving?

653
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,049
Hey, big lump!

654
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,330
Here!

655
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,568
Now I'll unblock your ears!

656
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,446
<i>I'm coming</i>

657
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,523
So, you didn't understand me!

658
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,283
Yes, I understood. Come down.

659
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,409
Forget it.

660
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,170
You're leaving?

661
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,920
- Scared of me? Come here.
- You come here.

662
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,090
I've had a nice rest.

663
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,208
I want to see
what's going on in your head!

664
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,684
I'm fresh as a daisy!

665
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,570
- Come here.
- What are you doing? Get me down!

666
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,808
- Get me down!
- Come with me.

667
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,001
Stay here.

668
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,851
- Putting me a in a cage?
- You're an animal!

669
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,888
- Come here!
- Fly!

670
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,288
Get me down!
I'll show you!

671
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,286
Open the cage!

672
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,125
I'll tear you to pieces!

673
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,329
Get me down!

674
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,607
Big Lump! Poor dear, you're soaked.

675
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,571
You'll catch cold, poor thing!

676
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,524
He said, "Oh".

677
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,531
Call for back up
and go to the amusement park!

678
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,850
The cops! Run!

679
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,005
- Put it in fifth!
- I am!

680
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,486
- Sixth.
- We don't have sixth!

681
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,606
The crooks have six, and we don't?
We're the crappiest cops ever!

682
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,802
Quick!

683
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,846
That's not a mini,
it's a maxi!

684
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,529
We're taking the stairs?

685
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,090
Get off me!

686
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,649
Here we go again!

687
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,362
My head!

688
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,290
Vagliaquiiiiiiiinto!

689
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,242
Vagliaquinto, you stupid dick!

690
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,570
What is this, the way down
from "Wuthering Heights"?

691
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,808
- Why did you stop?
- You said, "Stop, quick!"

692
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,529
I said, "You stupid dick!"
Let's go!

693
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,926
What a beautiful day!

694
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,648
The usual idiot!

695
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,570
Want to overtake, eh?

696
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,444
Get over!

697
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,730
Vagliaquinto!

698
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,167
Can't you go a bit slower?

699
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,366
What is it? Overtake,
if you can!

700
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,287
Let me pass, dammit!

701
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,325
What are you waiting for?

702
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,882
Okay, if that's what you want.

703
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,369
Now some make up,
but I'm keeping an eye on you.

704
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,327
The final touch...

705
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,325
Brake!

706
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,890
You put it in reverse?
Don't go backwards!

707
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,764
How embarrassing!

708
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:44,366
What are you doing?
You let her get away, as usual!

709
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,689
- Drive, you idiot! Let's go!
- I'll handle it!

710
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,770
You'll handle it?
You're leaving me here?

711
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,611
I'll see all of you in hell!

712
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,769
- Are you gay, by any chance?
- Who, me?

713
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,531
The price of salad, and
we waste it like this!

714
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,249
Engaged!

715
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,205
How dare you!

716
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,280
Instead of crooks, we arrest
people while they defecate!

717
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,651
This is crazy! You can't even
use the crapper in peace!

718
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,208
What a disgrace. They'll report us
for lavatorial abuse!

719
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,689
- I've not finished yet!
- Go home and finish.

720
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,206
The toilet!

721
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,723
- Take it away
- I forgot the most important thing!

722
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,650
Beat it! Vagliaquintol Let's go!

723
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,844
How do the police manage to arrest
everyone in American films?

724
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,043
Put it in fifth!

725
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,767
I was born in Canosa, Puglia and
I emigrated to Naples for work.

726
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,963
Instead of going to America!

727
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,128
- Wait for me here!
- Who's moving?

728
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,531
- Who's she?
- An English girl who likes me.

729
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,040
- What?
- It's true.

730
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,130
- You lucky ass!
- You should see hers!

731
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,530
She hit the wall!

732
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,410
Drive over!
I don't give a damn!

733
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,564
What is this? Where are we?

734
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,968
Stuffed in the tomatoes!

735
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,370
What a disgrace! St. Gennaro!
Why the hell do I bother?!

736
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,286
St. Marzano!

737
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,648
- Full speed ahead?
- Yes, to the airport.

738
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,400
You could have problems
with Inspector Calogero.

739
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,763
What problems?
He's my twin brother!

740
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,931
He graduated but went bald
from the effort.

741
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,690
Quick!

742
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,965
Dammit!

743
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,050
If my kids see me...
I can't find my shoes!

744
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,288
Why give me tomatoes?

745
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,925
Beat it!

746
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,686
Here we are.

747
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,769
Thanks for everything.

748
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,970
I won't forget you!

749
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,567
Last call for ﬂight A 107.

750
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,450
Hurry!

751
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,685
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
wishes you a good ﬂight.

752
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,404
Good morning, boys.

753
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,731
Here.
