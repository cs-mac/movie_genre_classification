1
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,687
How is it? Are you convinced?

2
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,291
Yes, we're convinced.

3
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,096
OK, I'll go with you.

4
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,691
Sir, where are we going?

5
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,291
To see your boss.

6
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,177
You're magnificent.
My boss will definitely hire you.

7
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,896
This way, please.

8
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,650
OK, let's go.

9
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:23,933
Here. What are you afraid of?
Hand it to me now.

10
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,656
Sir, what do you want?

11
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:29,606
Black cloth.
You said you have to blindfold me.

12
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,131
That's right.

13
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:37,446
- Here it is, Ting.
- Go on, then.

14
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,178
Oh, of course... of course...

15
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,735
Please hop on, sir.

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,688
- Go.
- All right.

26
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:31,966
Master Ting, this is the place.

27
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:37,209
I can't find my way blindfolded.

28
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,413
Get me a stick.

29
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,411
What? A stick?

30
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,967
I promise not to hit anyone with it.

31
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,451
Master Ting,
I have nothing to do with this.

32
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:19,136
I know your boss is testing
my Kung Fu. Let's go.

33
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,207
This way...

34
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:37,577
It's here.

35
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,298
Master Ting, please wait a moment.

36
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:46,608
Hey, if you don't remove my blindfold
now, I might really become blind.

37
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:56,492
This place is quite impressive.

38
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,007
Such good wine and food,
but no one's touching it.

39
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:27,332
You're overly cautious. You're my
invited guest, I won't poison you.

40
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,408
I'm used to my own chopsticks.

41
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:36,771
I'm Lam Nan.

42
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,928
Lady Nan...

43
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:43,488
I'm very different from the big
bosses you've met, aren't I?

44
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:47,367
You didn't invite me here
just to wine and dine me, right?

45
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:50,894
I've been hearing the name
Ting Chung for a long time.

46
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,616
You're brave and good at Kung Fu,

47
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,690
you're a busybody but a fair judge,

48
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:59,487
you fight a lot and hardly ever lose,

49
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:03,936
not many people can beat you,
even if you're blindfolded...

50
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,658
That's why you're the one.

51
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:09,537
- The one for what?
- The one to die for us.

52
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:13,691
I won't die. If a cat has nine lives,
I've got eighteen.

53
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:17,571
How many lives do you have left now?

54
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,457
I don't keep track.
I've got more than one.

55
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:25,487
You certainly do... One is
my brother's and one is mine.

56
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,966
Where do you want me
to deliver your lives?

57
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:32,096
- The Stormy Mountains.
- Are you crazy?

58
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:35,887
I'm not crazy.
My younger brother is very ill.

59
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:40,973
If I can't get him to the capital
to Yip the physician in three days,

60
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:42,890
I'll have to watch him die.

61
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:47,813
The only way to get there in time
is through the Stormy Mountains.

62
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:51,129
Do you know how many bandits
there are in the Stormy Mountains?

63
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:54,927
They'll want your body,
your money and your lives.

64
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:58,090
That's why I'm hiring you
to be our bodyguard.

65
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:12,366
Money is no object.
Just name your price.

66
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:16,017
How much do you think
my life is worth?

67
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,169
I'll pay whatever you ask.

68
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,297
I have no price.
I might be worthless.

69
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,937
I'm curious. Why pick me?

70
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:29,218
As you have so many lives, only you
would agree to be our bodyguard.

71
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:35,177
You're right. You've found
a lunatic to die for you.

72
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:39,251
This lunatic doesn't work
for money or lives.

73
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,488
- What do you work for?
- Nothing.

74
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,446
- Why are you agreeing to go?
- You'll never guess.

75
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,652
I've also employed
a few highly skilled assistants.

76
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,329
- You'll lead them.
- Can I meet them?

77
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:55,977
Certainly.

78
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,208
Lady Nan.

79
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:02,768
Here they are.
They're all very well trained.

80
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,735
I'll pick just a few.

81
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:15,295
You... you...

82
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,690
You... you...

83
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,167
You and you...

84
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:25,535
Those I've picked stand over here,
the rest stand there.

85
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,417
Those I picked can work as porters.

86
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,136
The rest can go now.

87
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,653
What? Work as porters?

88
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:39,729
That's what you're fit for.

89
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:44,176
Ting, are you doing this to deny us
the chance to make some money?

90
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:47,887
What's the use of money
if you'll die while making it?

91
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,333
You can't get rid of us this way.

92
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:51,613
What can you do?

93
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,087
Any more challengers?

94
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:42,137
With their kind of Kung Fu, they'll
surely die on the Stormy Mountains.

95
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:46,491
They're really useless.
Would you be OK alone?

96
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,250
I have to bring two guys with me.

97
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:50,454
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

98
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,052
- I have three holes to show you.
- Three holes?

99
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:56,449
Look at the first hole.
I made this secretly.

100
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,893
I was blindfolded but not blind.

101
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,288
Look at these two holes.

102
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:06,532
If I was really blind,
these two holes would be on my body.

103
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,087
I'd like to have these two fighters with me.

104
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:13,570
- Do you think they're of use to you?
- Definitely.

105
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,696
You've got taste.
You picked the two beautiful ones.

106
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,655
Beautiful ones?

107
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:21,651
Sisters, come and meet
the famous Ting.

108
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,729
On our way!

109
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:43,374
The formidable Twin Swords.
I'm impressed.

110
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:48,975
It's our honour, Master Ting.

111
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:52,255
Well done.
How do you know of them?

112
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:55,330
I've known of the Twin Swords
for a long time.

113
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,251
We can't go to the Stormy Mountains
without them.

114
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,407
Can we set off now?

115
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,695
- Not yet. I need one more helper.
- Who is he?

116
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,497
Chang, the deaf guy at the city gate
who repairs leather.

117
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,617
- The deaf guy? What use is he to us?
- He's very useful.

118
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,857
This way.

119
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,535
- Here?
- Yes.

120
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:27,336
Here. Here.

121
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,090
Hit it!

122
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:38,457
You're the leather repairman?

123
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,815
Is there another reason
you sent for me?

124
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,689
What kind of skin
do you specialise in?

125
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,930
I do them all, except for human skin.

126
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:54,814
How could he hear me
with all the drumming?

127
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:59,415
He was reading your lips.

128
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:04,334
He knows how to lip-read.

129
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:06,216
Long time no see, Brother Chang.

130
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:07,731
Brother Chang!

131
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:13,532
Brother Chang,
why do you always run from me?

132
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,575
You always bring bad news.

133
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,650
- You're quite right.
- There you go.

134
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:33,890
You can't run.
We've got a business deal.

135
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,618
- Like what?
- We're trading... our lives.

136
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,530
Where?

137
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,017
- The Stormy Mountains?
- Yes.

138
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:45,617
We really need your help, Chang.

139
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,612
- Are you going?
- How could I refuse such an offer?

140
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:59,407
It's late now.
What are we waiting for?

141
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:01,569
For the women. They're usually late.

142
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:09,213
We can set off now.
Come and get the sedan chair.

143
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,609
I thank you in advance
for this journey.

144
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:39,054
Why is the sedan chair so wrapped up?
He might suffocate.

145
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:44,526
- He can't be exposed to the wind.
- Or he can't face anyone.

146
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:50,895
If he gets worse,
who will be responsible?

147
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:56,530
Don't forget that she's our boss.
The boss is always right.

148
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,087
Let's go.

149
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:03,297
- I entrust our affairs to you.
- Rest assured, Lady Nan.

150
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,216
Let's go.

151
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:54,694
Stop.

152
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,929
The Town of Flags is straight ahead.
Beyond are the Stormy Mountains.

153
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:02,089
Brother, you go
and check the place out.

154
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:04,647
There's nothing to check out.

155
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,571
No one's been brave enough to go to
the Stormy Mountains in ten years.

156
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:11,014
So there's no reason to go to the town.

157
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,816
It's a ghost town.

158
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,446
I know of someone
living in this ghost town.

159
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:20,055
- Who is it?
- The Old Lady of Mar Po Inn.

160
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:23,210
That monster who can hardly walk?

161
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:26,814
I also know that some people
visited this town recently.

162
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,729
Hey, Old Lady!

163
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:18,053
Finally, I've got customers.

164
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:30,054
Sir, what would you like to eat?

165
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:35,770
A spring chicken, pork liver,
steamed prawns and a bottle of wine.

166
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:39,214
- I don't have...
- What don't you have?

167
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:46,214
Spring chicken, pork liver,
prawns and wine...

168
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,731
I don't have any of it.

169
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,731
Why did you have them on the menu?

170
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:55,289
We had them earlier. You're too late.

171
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,050
How late are we?

172
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:58,890
Ten years too late.

173
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,777
For the past ten years,
I haven't had a single customer.

174
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:04,736
Where could I get the money
to buy meat and wine?

175
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,412
- What do you have now?
- Egg fried rice.

176
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:10,331
- And?
- Rice fried egg.

177
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:11,931
Which one do you want?

178
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,247
Both.

179
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:17,969
Sir, you're such a kind man.

180
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,208
Two taels of silver. Pay up now.

181
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,051
What? Two taels of silver?

182
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:28,895
Customers are rare here. We have
to make up for the previous years.

183
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:31,815
Thank you, sir.

184
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:37,247
And you two?

185
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:39,852
- Here you go.
- Take this, too.

186
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,497
Thank you.

187
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:55,255
Welcome, everyone. Welcome.

188
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:02,248
No wonder the birds are singing. The
god of fortune is sending customers.

189
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:10,247
It's more like the work
of the gods of misfortune.

190
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:16,331
Strange. They paid for the rice,
but no one is eating.

191
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:22,056
That's all right, I can keep it
for the rest of the week.

192
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,854
Cowards! Shame on you.

193
00:20:57,178 --> 00:21:00,932
I presume you all know of me?

194
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:04,374
You must be the God of Darts,
Wu of a Thousand Hands.

195
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:09,134
Right. You robbers are afraid
of just one man. Tsang.

196
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,254
Did he invite you here?

197
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:16,535
He demanded half of your spoils.

198
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:23,653
Any opposition will be
skinned alive. Am I right?

199
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,973
- Am I right?
- Yes, yes, yes...

200
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:33,656
Don't worry. With me around,
he won't dare to even touch you.

201
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,536
But...

202
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,848
I need to collect a protection fee.

203
00:21:38,018 --> 00:21:39,576
How much do you want?

204
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,376
A 3-7 split.

205
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:43,972
- You take 30%?
- I want 70%.

206
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:47,574
What?
You want more than Master Tsang?

207
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:51,094
I'm the God of Darts. Who is he?

208
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:53,453
What about you?

209
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:59,410
Wu, these things can't touch me.

210
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,091
Come out here.

211
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:26,572
I'll only take half your spoils.
First come, first served.

212
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,046
He's back.

213
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:39,728
- Did you see anything?
- Yes, I did.

214
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,172
What did you see?

215
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,977
- Wu of a Thousand Hands.
- The God of Darts?

216
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,210
He not only lost his hands,
he lost his life and skin as well.

217
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:51,212
The God of Darts is highly skilled.
Who is more skilful than him?

218
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:56,452
He also deals with skin,
but not the type I deal with.

219
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,812
What's the difference?

220
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,176
I repair all kinds of skin
except human skin.

221
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:06,047
- And him?
- He doesn't repair, he only skins...

222
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:07,571
and he only skins humans.

223
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,888
But he doesn't skin good people.

224
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:15,451
I know. He must be the famous Tsang.

225
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,375
Thank you, Master Tsang.

226
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:30,974
Neither of us have enough.
What shall we do?

227
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:35,890
I'm very old now, but you're still young.

228
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,091
If you take mine, you'll have enough.

229
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:42,807
Uncle, I can't do that.
You've got a wife and kids.

230
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:46,015
I'm single
and no one will miss me if I die.

231
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,168
Take mine and you'll have enough.

232
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:52,296
- That's no good.
- It doesn't matter. Take it.

233
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:57,213
Stop the hypocrisy!
I've never seen a considerate robber.

234
00:24:57,378 --> 00:25:02,133
I hate the likes of you. If you don't
come in now, I'll skin you two.

235
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:04,571
Uncle, you go.

236
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:07,650
- I can't.
- I'm serious, Uncle. You go.

237
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:09,695
What about you?

238
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:12,489
Congratulations, you two can go now.

239
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:15,536
- Go?
- That's what he said.

240
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:17,097
He's letting us go?

241
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:19,772
Why are you so dense? Can't you tell?

242
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:24,253
I know him well.
He's normally a man of few words.

243
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,978
If he scolds you, you're in luck.

244
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:31,814
Ting, when did you become
such a busybody?

245
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:33,491
Ask them to go now.

246
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,377
What did he say?

247
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,496
- You two can go now.
- Go, go, go...

248
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,455
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,051
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,371
Does he always scold people?

251
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:51,895
No, it's easier for him to kill
than to scold people.

252
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:56,973
Hey! Are you coming out, or do we
have to come in and carry you out?

253
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:00,897
What now?

254
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:18,657
He's smarter than me.

255
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:20,774
What? He's left?

256
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:23,771
Don't worry, we'll find him.

257
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,211
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I need a ride.

258
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,495
- There's someone inside.
- Dead or alive?

259
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:45,252
If he's alive, tell him to get out.

260
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:49,530
- He's very amusing.
- Hilarious.

261
00:27:17,978 --> 00:27:19,696
Stop!

262
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:22,372
Brother Tsang, please be kind.

263
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,970
How are you, Big Brother?

264
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:29,808
He's bad news,
but you can't ignore me, right?

265
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:33,493
It's been two years since we
last met. How are you doing?

266
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:38,887
So-so.

267
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,017
I know you won't go.
You know I'll drag you in.

268
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:46,011
Do you want to see
who we're protecting?

269
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:51,495
- Who?
- My brother. He's seriously ill.

270
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,252
Come with us to the mountains.
It'll be fun.

271
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,377
Do you think he'll go?

272
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,132
He killed the God of Darts,
so he will.

273
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:10,333
Why?

274
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:13,535
Wu was the lover of Lady Liu
of the Stormy Mountains.

275
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:20,171
He'd rather go look for Lady Liu than
wait for her to come seeking revenge.

276
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:22,932
Ten thousand taels of silver
and two jars of good wine.

277
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:25,817
Is that all you want?

278
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:30,094
Ten thousand taels of silver?
I'll pay.

279
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:44,849
A bond
of ten thousand taels of silver

280
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:47,816
and the finest Nu Er Hong wine
as my gifts to you.

281
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,286
I'm Tsang Mo-Yi, third in the family.

282
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:05,216
- Your father is Tsang Man-Tien.
- Yes.

283
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,251
Good wine must be shared.
Drink with me?

284
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:16,136
Certainly.

285
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,936
Go on.

286
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:26,290
Wonderful wine.

287
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:30,006
More.

288
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:41,455
Are you going
to the Stormy Mountains?

289
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:46,248
Your whole family died doing that.
Do you want to die like them?

290
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,533
No.

291
00:29:56,298 --> 00:30:01,167
The bandits of the Stormy Mountains
are managed by four deputies.

292
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:05,217
One is called the Scholar,
the second is called Fake Monk,

293
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:08,893
the third is called Old Wolf
and the last is Lady Liu.

294
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,696
I'll keep that in mind.

295
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:15,978
The four of them may be powerful,
but I think you can deal with them.

296
00:30:16,138 --> 00:30:21,417
But if you met the Lord, I'm not sure
you'd survive three of his moves.

297
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:22,931
Who is he?

298
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:26,090
Did you know that I had a lover?

299
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,971
Look at this portrait of me
when I was young.

300
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:34,369
Though I wasn't exquisite,
I was considered beautiful.

301
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:39,533
So he loved me.

302
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:44,453
He loved my cooking
and visited me often.

303
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:49,567
He hasn't been visiting lately,
but I believe he'll come soon.

304
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:54,016
I'll wait for him
until the end of time.

305
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:56,167
Do you know who he is?

306
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,932
The ruler of the Stormy Mountains,
Lord Chu.

307
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:00,292
Lord Chu?

308
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:07,288
You're drunk.
Good wine is hard to come by.

309
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:11,007
You're a good kid.
I don't want you to die there.

310
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,975
This is for you.

311
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:19,657
- What can it do?
- It can save lives.

312
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:24,209
In the mountains, give this to a man
with six fingers on his left hand.

313
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,130
He can save your lives.

314
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,287
Thank you.

315
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:30,256
There's no need for that.
Be off with you.

316
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:37,937
# When the spring comes

317
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:44,207
# Hundreds of flowers start to bloom

318
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:48,656
# In a garden
of hundreds of flowers

319
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:53,175
# I wait alone... #

320
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:56,937
The Stormy Mountains
are a menacing place.

321
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:00,090
If you don't want to die there,
you have to follow the rules.

322
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:01,452
Follow the rules?

323
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:04,337
From now on,
I'm leading the expedition.

324
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,296
Do not leave the group without my
permission and be quiet at all times.

325
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,337
- No drinking, either.
- Can we be flexible on the drinking?

326
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:15,047
If you break any rules,
I'll skin you alive.

327
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:18,850
Big Brother, I'll follow all your rules.

328
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,246
Let's go.

329
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:24,733
Move out!

330
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:47,007
# The lofty, undulating
Stormy Mountains

331
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:50,853
# As hard to conquer as the sky

332
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:54,613
# Dangers and obstacles along the way

333
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:58,532
# Like the path
leading to the gate of hell

334
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:02,452
# The four deputies guard the corners

335
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:06,657
# Lord Chu's skills
are hard to counter

336
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,972
# The Stormy Mountains
may be our graves

337
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:27,613
# Fast and furious, the Iron Fist

338
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,612
# Spreading virtue and stifling vice

339
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:35,532
# Friends to share
our woes and worries

340
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:39,134
# We'll sacrifice to do our duty

341
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,088
# Tsang is a fighter
whom few can match

342
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:47,217
# Chang is deaf
but his eyes are sharp

343
00:33:47,378 --> 00:33:52,816
# Together, as one,
we'll conquer the Stormy Mountains

344
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:16,093
# The lofty, undulating
Stormy Mountains

345
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:20,046
# As hard to conquer as the sky

346
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:23,813
# Friends to share
our woes and worries

347
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,857
# We'll sacrifice to do our duty

348
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:31,897
# Tsang is a fighter
whom few can match

349
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:35,653
# Chang is deaf
but his eyes are sharp

350
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:41,372
# Together, as one,
we'll conquer the Stormy Mountains #

351
00:34:53,098 --> 00:34:55,407
Pretend you didn't see them.

352
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,136
Go on.

353
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:32,012
Read their lips
and see what they're talking about.

354
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:41,496
They said that we'll never
get out of this place alive.

355
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,693
There could be another ambush ahead.
Be careful.

356
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,531
This is only the beginning.
Anyone want to quit?

357
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:53,897
Tsang, we don't need cynicism.
None of us here are quitters.

358
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:56,094
Sister, that's rude.

359
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:57,486
He has no faith in us.

360
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:00,570
You're not afraid to die?
Good on you.

361
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,615
Let's run across!

362
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:19,416
Listen.

363
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:23,129
- What's up?
- Someone's shouting for help.

364
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:25,289
I can't hear it.

365
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,971
I heard it too.

366
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,208
It's coming from over there.

367
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:44,415
They'll be victims of the robbers
in these parts.

368
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:47,494
Nonsense, I don't see anything.

369
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:50,536
Are you blind?
There are so many wounded there.

370
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:52,529
I can't see them.

371
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:54,848
Don't forget
we still have a long way to go.

372
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:58,567
How can we leave them here to die?
Sister, let's go and see.

373
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,332
- They've fallen for it.
- Right.

374
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:07,807
- They're faking it.
- Faking?

375
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,616
They said we've fallen for it.

376
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:11,131
Guard the sedan.

377
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:20,376
Drop your weapon, or I'll kill her!

378
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:27,173
Let's help them.

379
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:29,056
No need, Tsang can deal with it.

380
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,697
Come here.

381
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:46,733
I know you're the skinner.
Do you dare to skin me?

382
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:50,015
Maybe... not.

383
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:02,133
Come any closer and I'll kill her.

384
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:05,608
If she dies, you'll die as well.

385
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:07,891
Let her go.

386
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,208
I said let her go.

387
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:26,412
Let her go!

388
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:30,969
- Now get lost!
- OK.

389
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:36,656
He was so fierce a moment ago, Sister.
Look how obedient he is now.

390
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:40,493
- Go thank that gentleman.
- OK.

391
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:43,570
Thank you for saving my life.

392
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,651
Serves you right.
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

393
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:53,011
What are you waiting for?

394
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,406
Go!

395
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:00,818
Mister, thank you for saving my sister.

396
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,695
It's my pleasure, ladies.

397
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,494
Courtesy is a way of life. Take this!

398
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:30,454
I'm Wan Leung Yoke.
I'm familiar with your reputations.

399
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,495
Your visit has livened up
this uneventful place.

400
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:37,650
Mr Wan,
what is it you really want to say?

401
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,696
The Stormy Mountains
are full of danger.

402
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,055
If you don't want to die, be careful.

403
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,369
Mr Wan,
why are you being so kind to us?

404
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:51,651
I'm concerned about my assets.

405
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:55,527
What you're guarding
will soon be mine.

406
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,609
Come and get it, then.

407
00:39:58,418 --> 00:40:01,728
Robbers also have standards.
Courtesy before aggression.

408
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,776
I'll be back tomorrow.

409
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:08,328
Hope you survive the night.

410
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:15,697
Bye for now. See you tomorrow.

411
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:24,533
Chasing your enemy is foolish. As
you're still young, I'll forgive you.

412
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:27,770
If you leave the group again,
I'll skin you alive.

413
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:15,812
You lot stay here to guard the sedan.

414
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,127
Let's check the place out.

415
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,209
It's strangely quiet here.

416
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:05,049
Big Brother,
this must be the Luo Han Temple.

417
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,413
The candles are lit.
There must be monks here.

418
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:09,489
I'll go get them.

419
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:14,655
Did you say we're in
the Luo Han Temple?

420
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:17,412
Haven't you seen those eighteen
Luo Han Buddhas there?

421
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,853
Eighteen Luo Han Buddhas?

422
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:34,446
The weapons in their hands are
different from the Luo Han Buddha's.

423
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,655
Could be another ambush.
Let's get out of here.

424
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:46,406
Get out.

425
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:52,811
- I can't take it any more!
- Me either!

426
00:46:57,538 --> 00:47:01,690
- How do we get out?
- We'll be carried out as corpses!

427
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:05,134
Hey, what are you two doing?

428
00:47:05,298 --> 00:47:09,337
- We'll be dead soon!
- You'll die with us!

429
00:47:09,498 --> 00:47:11,773
Me, die with you?

430
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:13,815
Fine.

431
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:26,133
BUDDHA

432
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:02,210
No one escapes from
the Chamber of Monster Bells.

433
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:07,047
Sifu, the three of them
will stop breathing soon.

434
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:12,417
This is Ting Chung.
He's got the world's fastest punch.

435
00:48:12,578 --> 00:48:15,888
What a pity
that I won't get to witness it.

436
00:48:22,018 --> 00:48:24,486
Now you'll get to witness
my stinking feet.

437
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:25,736
Now you'll know how fast I can punch.

438
00:49:27,538 --> 00:49:29,210
Let's get out of here!

439
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:38,136
They won't give up that easily.

440
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:40,448
We'll be in more danger
if we don't escape.

441
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:43,052
I'm worried about the ones outside.

442
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:02,089
- Let us out.
- OK.

443
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:06,332
That way!

444
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:20,731
I waited here just like you said to,
so am I a good girl?

445
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:21,887
Cut that crap out.

446
00:50:22,058 --> 00:50:24,970
What took you so long?
I was worried for you guys.

447
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,174
This place isn't safe. Let's go.

448
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:31,297
Please don't worry.
I'm a businessman, not a robber.

449
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:34,256
Don't be afraid.
There's nothing to worry about.

450
00:50:34,418 --> 00:50:36,056
You're safe here.

451
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:40,131
I really am a businessman
and not a robber. Don't worry.

452
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:42,016
Doing business
in the Stormy Mountains?

453
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:43,327
I'm the only one doing it.

454
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,171
With so many robbers,
what business can you have?

455
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:51,014
Even robbers need to eat and drink.
I make their lives here bearable.

456
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:54,409
So they let me run
a small business here.

457
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:56,694
It's getting dark soon.

458
00:50:56,858 --> 00:51:00,737
It's lucky you met me, or you
wouldn't get any peace tonight.

459
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:03,617
Is there a peaceful place
in the Stormy Mountains?

460
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:07,009
- There's only one.
- Where is it?

461
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:10,056
Peace Hotel. That's my place.

462
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:14,257
Shameless self-promotion.
You only care about our money.

463
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:18,696
I can guarantee your safety, but I
only welcome certain kinds of people.

464
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:21,531
- What kind of people?
- Rich people.

465
00:51:21,698 --> 00:51:27,568
Only the very rich, because I do
charge more than your average hotel.

466
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:29,729
How much more?

467
00:51:29,898 --> 00:51:31,616
20 to 30 times more.

468
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:34,935
That's daylight robbery!

469
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:37,851
I can't help it.
I don't have many customers.

470
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:39,974
What kind of people are you,
may I ask?

471
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,094
- Rich people.
- That's right.

472
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:45,330
We're filthy rich.

473
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:47,773
That's wonderful. This way, please.

474
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:59,973
I assure you, you'll feel safe and
peaceful as soon as you're inside.

475
00:52:00,138 --> 00:52:02,857
I have an agreement with the robbers.

476
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:05,168
- Boss, you're back.
- Yes.

477
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:11,457
Ask them to keep quiet.

478
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:12,733
Stop!

479
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:19,368
Sir, I thought we'd agreed that you'd
let me run my business in peace.

480
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:22,769
But they're not
inside your hotel yet.

481
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:25,168
Who killed my brother, Iron Wolf?

482
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:26,691
I did.

483
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:31,693
So you're the skinning swordsman. Did
you kill my brother with that sword?

484
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,693
I don't have to draw this sword
to defeat scum like you.

485
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:42,696
You sure talk big. Come over,
I'll avenge my brother today.

486
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,687
Big Brother, let me deal with him.

487
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:50,337
I'm second, I'll be next in line.

488
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,056
Stand aside.

489
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:57,611
Let's play.

490
00:52:58,538 --> 00:53:01,052
Who are you?

491
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:02,970
A leather repairman.

492
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:05,616
What weapon do you use?

493
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,176
Legs.

494
00:53:09,538 --> 00:53:12,257
Legs? It's not fair.

495
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:15,774
That's to your advantage.

496
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:17,212
Move back!

497
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:49,894
Impressive kicks.

498
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:18,492
I've been walking the whole day,
so my feet might smell.

499
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:20,489
Time to vomit?

500
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,209
Enter, please.

501
00:54:26,378 --> 00:54:28,494
Your Kung Fu isn't quite there yet.

502
00:54:28,658 --> 00:54:30,455
Get lost.

503
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:31,653
Let's go.

504
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:39,011
Everything is fine now.
Please go in.

505
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:53,171
Look how spacious and peaceful
my place is. You'll like it.

506
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:56,694
- Which is the biggest room?
- That one.

507
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:00,617
Can I carry the sedan to the room?

508
00:55:00,778 --> 00:55:03,770
What? You want to carry
the sedan into the room?

509
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,611
That's what I just asked you.

510
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,977
Of course you can. Rich people
can do whatever they like.

511
00:55:10,138 --> 00:55:12,572
- Bring the sedan in.
- OK, come in, please.

512
00:55:12,738 --> 00:55:14,057
- This way.
- Come in, please.

513
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:17,574
- Be careful.
- Slowly...

514
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:21,617
- That's the way.
- Straight through...

515
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:31,567
Staff, brew some nice tea
and prepare some food.

516
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:34,650
They're filthy rich,
give them the best service.

517
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:05,334
Please knock before entering my room.

518
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:10,216
I'm here to ask you something.

519
00:56:10,378 --> 00:56:13,450
- Is it about the sedan?
- Something's fishy about it.

520
00:56:13,618 --> 00:56:14,812
What's so fishy about it?

521
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:19,449
Have you ever seen anyone carrying
a sedan into a room before?

522
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:22,451
I thought the patient
couldn't be exposed to the wind.

523
00:56:22,618 --> 00:56:25,894
I wonder if it's the wind, or if
it's that he can't expose his face.

524
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:27,730
- Are you curious?
- Aren't you?

525
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:29,217
Let's go, then.

526
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:14,893
Can you sleep comfortably
in the sedan?

527
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:16,286
There's no wind here.

528
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:18,335
Come out for a chat.

529
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,896
What are you doing here?

530
00:57:42,298 --> 00:57:44,687
No one's around. I stayed
to find out what's happening.

531
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:47,372
Big Brother, what's going on?

532
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:49,210
- Let's discuss this outside.
- OK.

533
00:57:54,658 --> 00:57:57,934
Big Brother, do you know
what they're up to?

534
00:57:58,098 --> 00:58:01,773
I'm risking my life
guarding an empty sedan.

535
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:03,451
How do you know it's empty?

536
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,210
You saw it before.

537
00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:08,415
I didn't see anything.
I was sleeping in my room.

538
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:13,169
I didn't see anything.
I was sleeping in my room, too.

539
00:58:16,778 --> 00:58:19,008
They're definitely smarter than me.

540
00:58:19,898 --> 00:58:22,173
Dinner for 14 costs
135 taels of silver...

541
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:26,650
Water costs five taels, candles
five taels, and toilet paper...

542
00:58:26,818 --> 00:58:29,969
Boss, hurry up, please.
We've got a long way to go.

543
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:33,574
I'm a fair businessman.
I need to charge you accurately...

544
00:58:42,138 --> 00:58:44,891
- Pearl...
- What do you need?

545
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:48,334
Get me some medicine.

546
00:58:48,498 --> 00:58:50,090
Quickly.

547
00:58:55,818 --> 00:58:58,969
It's 245 taels of silver in total.

548
00:58:59,138 --> 00:59:01,129
Your place is really pricey.

549
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:05,689
I've been very fair, I told you
in advance that we're expensive.

550
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:14,298
You're our best guests.
Please come again.

551
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,971
Fat chance.

552
00:59:17,938 --> 00:59:20,213
- Let's go.
- What's the rush?

553
00:59:20,378 --> 00:59:23,211
Have some hot tea before you go.
It's half-price.

554
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:25,494
- Let's go.
- Have a safe journey.

555
00:59:25,658 --> 00:59:27,410
- Quick.
- All right.

556
00:59:41,098 --> 00:59:42,690
- Big Brother.
- What?

557
00:59:42,858 --> 00:59:44,814
- Did you see?
- See what?

558
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:48,175
- There's someone in the sedan.
- Did I say it was empty?

559
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:51,808
- Why didn't he meet us?
- Why must he meet you?

560
01:00:09,618 --> 01:00:12,337
Big Brother, this way is very dangerous.

561
01:00:12,498 --> 01:00:13,851
What choice do we have?

562
01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:17,135
This is the only way through
the Stormy Mountains.

563
01:00:21,658 --> 01:00:24,218
Wan. He's really waiting for us.

564
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:27,176
Glad to see you again.

565
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:37,650
You look fresh and well rested.

566
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:40,537
You must have slept comfortably.

567
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:43,053
You seem to care a lot about us.

568
01:00:43,218 --> 01:00:48,133
I don't care about you. I care about
the assets of mine you're guarding.

569
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,329
On what condition
will you let us through?

570
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:57,774
- My conditions are simple.
- Spit it out.

571
01:00:57,938 --> 01:00:59,894
I'll keep the treasure,
he'll keep the ladies...

572
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:02,526
He? Who's he?

573
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:09,248
Amitabha...

574
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:12,535
He's me... I'm him.

575
01:01:15,058 --> 01:01:19,097
That's how it works in the Stormy
Mountains. We split equally.

576
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:23,248
So you'll split it equally?
What about the other men here?

577
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:25,886
Each of the men must leave a hand here.

578
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,049
It's up to you which hand.

579
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:38,093
You're a scholar.
We're simply passing through.

580
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,249
Is there room for negotiation?

581
01:01:40,418 --> 01:01:43,091
I always mean what I say.
End of discussion.

582
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:47,092
What if we disagree?

583
01:01:47,258 --> 01:01:50,409
It's up to you.

584
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:54,093
You have till the afternoon
to consider your options.

585
01:01:54,258 --> 01:02:00,049
Don't be foolish. If you don't
believe me, just take a look...

586
01:02:32,938 --> 01:02:36,726
This is our territory.
Unless you meet our demands,

587
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:39,366
you must suffer the consequences.

588
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:52,008
Retreat!

589
01:02:57,298 --> 01:02:59,448
Big Brother, we can make a run for it.

590
01:02:59,618 --> 01:03:02,257
You might be able to.
What about the rest?

591
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,050
At least we could try.

592
01:03:04,218 --> 01:03:08,973
We can't take that chance,
unless it's our last resort.

593
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:11,931
What can we do now?

594
01:03:12,098 --> 01:03:15,135
There's one person who can help us.

595
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:17,095
Who is he?

596
01:03:17,258 --> 01:03:21,046
I don't know. All I know is that he's
got six fingers on his left hand.

597
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,049
Six fingers?

598
01:03:24,058 --> 01:03:27,175
Oh... six fingers?

599
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:30,216
- Where can we find him?
- He might know.

600
01:03:33,658 --> 01:03:37,731
- The hotel owner?
- Yes, I'll go look for him.

601
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:47,209
If you see the six-fingered man,
give him this. He'll save us.

602
01:03:49,418 --> 01:03:51,488
How will you get out of here?

603
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:54,013
You guys have to cover me.

604
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:06,530
Why did you grope me? I'd rather
be with that monk than you!

605
01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:07,847
When did I touch you?

606
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:11,488
- I'll teach you to harass my sister!
- Stop being unreasonable!

607
01:04:11,658 --> 01:04:15,048
- How dare you?
- Stop, please!

608
01:04:53,618 --> 01:04:58,089
- Mister.
- My beloved guest.

609
01:04:59,098 --> 01:05:01,328
You're here again.

610
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,534
What business
are you bringing me this time?

611
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:07,008
I've got some
unusually big business for you.

612
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:08,850
I thank you in advance.
How many guests?

613
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:12,613
It's not accommodation...
I want to sell you something.

614
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,770
Something to sell me? What is it?

615
01:05:15,938 --> 01:05:18,054
Someone's life.

616
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:23,048
- Whose life?
- Yours.

617
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:29,297
My life belongs to me.

618
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,813
It's mine now.

619
01:05:32,578 --> 01:05:34,887
Do you want it back?

620
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:40,336
It's no use threatening me.
I grew up with robbers.

621
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:45,413
Is it because I overcharged you
and you want your money back?

622
01:05:45,578 --> 01:05:49,457
- I don't want money.
- What do you want, then?

623
01:05:49,618 --> 01:05:54,453
- Help us cross the mountains.
- Cross the mountains?

624
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:58,054
I don't know of anyone who's made it
across the Stormy Mountains alive.

625
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,931
You'd have to cross
with Lord Chu's blessing.

626
01:06:01,098 --> 01:06:05,888
- Take me to see Lord Chu.
- Me? I'm not that influential.

627
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,296
I'm just a businessman.
Why are you doing this?

628
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,255
Help me look for someone.

629
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:16,252
- Who is he?
- A six-fingered man.

630
01:06:16,418 --> 01:06:20,809
- Why are you looking for him?
- I have something for him.

631
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,408
Bring me to Lord Chu.

632
01:06:27,258 --> 01:06:31,092
He can't help you,
even if you threaten to kill him.

633
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:32,930
I'm the only person who can do that.

634
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:35,896
You must be the notorious Lady Liu?

635
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,526
That's right.

636
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:43,408
Are you the one
who killed the God of Darts?

637
01:06:43,578 --> 01:06:46,376
I'm Ting Chung.

638
01:06:46,538 --> 01:06:50,497
So you're the Ting with many lives.

639
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:55,607
The world's fastest boxer.
I'm familiar with your reputation.

640
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,770
Can you take me to see Lord Chu?

641
01:06:58,938 --> 01:07:01,088
Yes, but...

642
01:07:01,258 --> 01:07:07,208
you killed my lover, the God
of Darts. Find me a replacement.

643
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:09,972
This guy's eloquent
and has good business acumen.

644
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:13,892
He'll be a fantastic lover for you.

645
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:17,494
No, I don't like him.

646
01:07:20,058 --> 01:07:22,253
Who do you like?

647
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:24,976
I like you.

648
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:31,811
May I have a cuddle?

649
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:51,134
Your punches really live up
to my expectations.

650
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:27,737
What else can you do, you bastard?

651
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:41,014
First I'll blind you in both your eyes,

652
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:44,773
then I'll take you home
and torture you slowly.

653
01:09:59,218 --> 01:10:03,530
You've inhaled poisonous gas.
You'll die in a few hours.

654
01:10:10,298 --> 01:10:12,937
Luckily I found the antidote on her.

655
01:10:13,938 --> 01:10:15,894
You...

656
01:10:18,098 --> 01:10:20,407
So it's you.

657
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:24,730
They've been surrounded
and their lives are in danger.

658
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:29,895
They must be in Death Valley. Take
the antidote, I'll see what I can do.

659
01:10:30,058 --> 01:10:31,332
Can you save them?

660
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:34,695
I'm wearing a good-luck charm.
I hope it helps.

661
01:10:34,858 --> 01:10:37,326
I'll be back soon.

662
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:57,056
Tsang, it's past noon now.
Why haven't we had any news?

663
01:10:57,218 --> 01:11:00,574
Don't worry.
There'll be a way out.

664
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:04,647
Look.

665
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:14,733
- How did you get here?
- Don't worry, I'll get you out.

666
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:17,287
Why should I trust you?

667
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,813
Look.

668
01:11:21,498 --> 01:11:24,376
It's you. Thank you.

669
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:26,415
Let's go with him.

670
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:31,857
Fellows, listen up!
They carry Lord Chu's insignia!

671
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,417
Let them through.

672
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:34,806
Let's go.

673
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:39,893
Fellows, listen up!
They carry Lord Chu's insignia!

674
01:11:40,058 --> 01:11:42,288
You have to let them through.

675
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:47,248
Fellows, listen up!
They carry Lord Chu's insignia!

676
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:49,329
Please let them through.

677
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:06,126
- How is it?
- I've taken them to a safer place.

678
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:08,414
- They can't cross the mountain yet.
- Why?

679
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:11,729
No one crosses the mountain
without Lord Chu's permission.

680
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:18,494
Take me to Lord Chu. If he doesn't
let us through, I'll fight him.

681
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:21,695
- It's no use, unless...
- Unless what?

682
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:23,655
Trade in your fists.

683
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:25,092
Is he interested in my fists?

684
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,933
Yes, I know that he lacks
a pair of fast, strong fists.

685
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:33,734
Sounds like a business deal.

686
01:12:33,898 --> 01:12:38,255
Yes, I'm a businessman.
I'll make sure you get a good deal.

687
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:39,851
Where are my friends?

688
01:12:40,018 --> 01:12:42,168
Only I know where they are.

689
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,976
I want to see them first.

690
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:46,732
OK, follow me.

691
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:01,532
Where are they?

692
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:03,336
Are you trying to trick me?

693
01:13:03,498 --> 01:13:05,568
Nonsense.

694
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:07,615
Why would I to lie to you?

695
01:13:07,778 --> 01:13:11,327
You're too mysterious
for me to trust you completely.

696
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:22,335
- This is...
- They've definitely been here.

697
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,729
- Lady Nan!
- Tsang!

698
01:13:25,898 --> 01:13:28,253
- Lady Nan!
- Tsang!

699
01:13:30,258 --> 01:13:33,614
- Lady Nan!
- Tsang!

700
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,891
NAMO AMITABHA

701
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:44,657
Long live Lord Chu.

702
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:46,410
Rise.

703
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:49,976
Are you Ting Chung?

704
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:56,247
We're helping an ill man across the
mountains. Please give us permission.

705
01:16:58,578 --> 01:17:01,854
I can't break the rules of
the Stormy Mountains just for you.

706
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,293
Isn't Lord Chu interested in my fists?

707
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,497
If you let us through,
you'll have free use of these fists.

708
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:13,493
You may be willing to offer them,
but I need to try them out first.

709
01:17:13,658 --> 01:17:16,331
I'm not sure if your fists
are worth that much.

710
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:20,694
- Iron Man.
- Here!

711
01:17:20,858 --> 01:17:24,487
He's learnt the Thirteenth Prince
fighting technique.

712
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:28,731
His left punch is 300 pounds,
his right is 500 pounds.

713
01:17:28,898 --> 01:17:31,253
Impressive.

714
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:33,613
See if you can handle my Iron Fist.

715
01:17:46,298 --> 01:17:48,095
You call these Iron Fists?

716
01:18:40,338 --> 01:18:44,854
Lord Chu, I deserve to die...

717
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:46,417
- Begone!
- Yes...

718
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:48,967
Thank you, Lord, for sparing my life.

719
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:56,536
Is Lord Chu satisfied with my fists?

720
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:02,049
Yes, if you stay here with us,
you'll be handsomely rewarded.

721
01:19:02,218 --> 01:19:05,255
What about my friends?

722
01:19:05,418 --> 01:19:07,568
Your friends are safe with us.

723
01:19:07,738 --> 01:19:11,526
They've just eaten and showered.
They're resting now.

724
01:19:11,698 --> 01:19:13,928
- Where are they?
- There.

725
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:36,812
Sister, look at him.

726
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:41,137
We've been tricked.

727
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,252
You lied to me?

728
01:19:45,418 --> 01:19:49,297
I haven't lied to you. I was helping
the Old Lady of Mar Po Inn

729
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:50,732
to get you out of Death Valley.

730
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:53,970
I'm Lord Chu's man.
How could I betray him?

731
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:55,890
I had to bring you here.

732
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:58,936
Don't forget that I hate liars.

733
01:19:59,098 --> 01:20:03,455
Tsang, don't threaten me.
Have you forgotten where you are?

734
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:08,572
No matter where I am,
I'll skin you alive.

735
01:20:46,698 --> 01:20:48,097
Big Brother, watch out!

736
01:21:03,218 --> 01:21:06,051
How dare you kill my man
right in front of me?

737
01:21:06,218 --> 01:21:09,255
I haven't killed a man, I killed a mongrel.

738
01:21:09,418 --> 01:21:11,932
You don't have much respect for me.

739
01:21:12,098 --> 01:21:18,970
I have no wish to offend you.
We have no conflict of interest.

740
01:21:19,138 --> 01:21:23,416
If you let us through,
I'll repay your kindness one day.

741
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,933
What if I refuse?

742
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:28,737
We'll have to do it by force.

743
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:34,014
You two are very naive.

744
01:21:34,178 --> 01:21:37,329
Luckily for you, I've just struck
a deal with your friend,

745
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:39,329
or I'd let you learn
from your mistake.

746
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:43,571
- We just need your blessing.
- We're not afraid to die.

747
01:21:43,738 --> 01:21:48,687
I will settle this peacefully
for Ting's sake,

748
01:21:48,858 --> 01:21:54,137
but I'll need to know
what's in the sedan.

749
01:21:54,298 --> 01:21:57,176
It's my brother. He's very ill.

750
01:21:57,338 --> 01:21:59,056
Is he really ill?

751
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:01,288
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

752
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,097
All right, can I meet him?

753
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:06,567
He can't be exposed to the wind.
It'll kill him.

754
01:22:06,738 --> 01:22:08,615
Death from wind exposure?

755
01:22:09,618 --> 01:22:11,654
I don't believe it.

756
01:22:16,858 --> 01:22:19,008
Can't you hear how sick he is?

757
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:23,057
- I must look at him!
- I urge you not to disturb him.

758
01:22:24,058 --> 01:22:26,094
- Force him out!
- Yes!

759
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:38,572
Didn't I warn you not to disturb him?

760
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:45,007
As I expected, the best fighter
among you is inside the sedan.

761
01:22:45,178 --> 01:22:47,328
Please show yourself.

762
01:22:58,018 --> 01:23:00,816
A trivial trick. Get out!

763
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:17,417
- What's happening?
- Just watch.

764
01:23:45,378 --> 01:23:49,849
It's been five years.
We will settle our old scores today.

765
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:15,374
The Old Lady of Mar Po Inn!

766
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:19,417
- It's unbelievable!
- How strange...

767
01:26:20,338 --> 01:26:23,808
I was forced into hiding
for five years, all because of her.

768
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:27,368
Lord Chu, it's our fault
that we mistook her for you.

769
01:26:27,538 --> 01:26:29,369
Lord Chu, how did it happen?

770
01:26:30,098 --> 01:26:35,092
She came to me for help ten years ago.

771
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:42,767
For old times' sake, I let her
run the inn in the Town of Flags.

772
01:26:42,938 --> 01:26:46,135
I never thought she'd set me up.

773
01:26:46,298 --> 01:26:48,493
She used my name for material gains.

774
01:26:48,658 --> 01:26:54,654
Lord Chu, how could she sound
so similar to you?

775
01:26:54,818 --> 01:27:00,017
She'd planned it right from the start
and had made a mask of my face.

776
01:27:00,178 --> 01:27:03,773
Imitating my voice
wasn't a problem for her.

777
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:08,728
She drugged me
and tried to bury me alive.

778
01:27:08,898 --> 01:27:11,935
I managed to escape and came back
to the Stormy Mountains.

779
01:27:12,098 --> 01:27:17,456
That's when I realised
that there was another Lord Chu.

780
01:27:17,618 --> 01:27:22,214
When I went to the inn,
the Old Lady was there, too.

781
01:27:22,378 --> 01:27:27,850
I was puzzled. To get to the bottom
of this, I went underground.

782
01:27:28,018 --> 01:27:31,772
What has this got to do with Lady Nan?

783
01:27:32,738 --> 01:27:36,697
She's my daughter
and had never lived in the mountains.

784
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:41,693
We'd planned this for five years
before we got to see the Old Lady.

785
01:27:41,858 --> 01:27:47,171
Now the truth is out.
I'm here and I'm the rightful Lord.

786
01:27:53,298 --> 01:27:56,927
Long live Lord Chu!

787
01:27:57,098 --> 01:28:02,730
Health and power to Lord Chu!

788
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:04,934
Father...

789
01:28:05,938 --> 01:28:07,371
Uncle Chu.

790
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:13,416
- You may rise.
- Thank you, Lord Chu.

791
01:28:22,658 --> 01:28:27,448
I thank you for your effort
in making this possible.

792
01:28:27,618 --> 01:28:30,655
Stay here with me
and you'll live in luxury.

793
01:28:30,818 --> 01:28:34,447
A life of luxury is not what we seek.

794
01:28:34,618 --> 01:28:38,930
Rejecting my offer
is not very respectful.

795
01:28:39,938 --> 01:28:43,328
I'm sorry, we've not
completed our mission yet.

796
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:44,487
What mission?

797
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:48,936
To help you cross the mountains
to get to the capital.

798
01:28:49,938 --> 01:28:54,216
The Stormy Mountains are home.
I'm not going to the capital.

799
01:28:54,378 --> 01:28:56,812
- You have to.
- Why?

800
01:28:56,978 --> 01:29:00,971
You've occupied the Stormy Mountains
for nearly 20 years.

801
01:29:01,138 --> 01:29:03,936
I must take you to the capital
to face justice.

802
01:29:04,098 --> 01:29:05,736
Can you?

803
01:29:05,898 --> 01:29:09,334
Lord Chu, do you remember
that the imperial army

804
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:12,092
tried to retake this place 15 years ago?

805
01:29:12,258 --> 01:29:15,648
You killed over a thousand soldiers
and General Ting Kwok-Chung.

806
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:18,048
How are you related?

807
01:29:18,218 --> 01:29:20,209
He was my father.

808
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:25,736
No wonder you joined this mission
with no care for money or your life.

809
01:29:25,898 --> 01:29:29,732
There's no way any of you will get
out of the Stormy Mountains alive.

810
01:29:29,898 --> 01:29:32,492
I must avenge my father's death

811
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,695
and rid the world of crooks like you.

812
01:32:45,418 --> 01:32:47,693
Father!

813
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:38,247
Run!

814
01:34:48,178 --> 01:34:50,248
We'll take it in turn to exhaust him.

815
01:36:58,618 --> 01:37:00,495
Big Brother, I got him!
