1
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,432
When's your plane, darling?
Wish you weren't going.

2
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,561
The board is expecting me tomorrow.

3
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,726
I know. I wish
you didn't have to go.

4
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:57,895
I gotta see the old bastard.
When I get back, we'll take a trip.

5
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,652
- Isn't he a beauty?
- You're a beauty.

6
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,778
No, I'm not going to ride.

7
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,459
You got it.

8
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:44,405
You're under arrest
for Enrique Cordoza's murder.

9
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:46,983
Ann!

10
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,118
Enrique...

11
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,703
What do you mean, Enrique?

12
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,204
Jay!

13
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,421
What are you talking about?

14
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,189
- Mr. Wagner.
- Mr. Cable.

15
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,654
The frame-up is complete.

16
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:31,748
Your grandson was arrested in
Santiago, extradited to Mexico City.

17
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,000
He'll be convicted within the month.

18
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,129
Sentence?
- Between 25 and 30 years.

19
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,589
You resent my interference
in this matter.

20
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:47,796
We have a procedure
for those on the wrong side.

21
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,934
There's them and us.
The winning side and the losing side.

22
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:56,556
The line has not yet been drawn.

23
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:59,183
He supports those against us.

24
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:04,070
He threatened CIA interests
and my stockholders?

25
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,864
- Who did you have murdered?
- No one of importance.

26
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:13,123
I don't want my grandson
to suffer the same fate.

27
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,370
- Is that clear, Mr. Cable?
- Yes.

28
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,786
Your grandson will try to escape.

29
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,712
It's a pity, at my age...

30
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,632
falling victim to a cliché.

31
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,344
I don't know what you mean.

32
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:36,604
Because of a distant link
between his chromosomes and mine...

33
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,474
my grandson stays alive.

34
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,899
I say it's a mistake.

35
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:45,531
Perhaps.

36
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,107
Twenty-five to 30 years.

37
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,281
There's no possible way the accused
could have left Santiago...

38
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:00,832
flown to Mexico City and returned
at the time we documented.

39
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,789
Nonetheless, it is...

40
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:07,128
the decision of this court...

41
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,129
that you...

42
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,263
Jay Louis Wagner...

43
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,559
are guilty as charged.

44
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,265
You shall serve a term...

45
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:24,183
of 28 years
in the federal penitentiary.

46
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:29,071
You'll be allowed the same
privileges as all prisoners.

47
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:32,901
Including conjugal visits
every two weeks.

48
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,368
This judgment is final.

55
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:38,256
Jay, what are they doing to you?

56
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:42,392
Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
But....

57
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:50,155
Well, it is pretty bad.
It really is. Where's the money?

58
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:55,234
In the back of the radio.

59
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:06,165
- I'll talk to your grandfather.
- No, absolutely not.

60
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:10,005
- I don't know what to do.
- I won't kiss his ass.

61
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,382
This is all we need.

62
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:15,631
They'll sell anything.
Including freedom.

63
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,311
I really think you must do it legally.
Sanchez has filed an appeal.

64
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:24,471
I can't wait that long.

65
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,142
Last week there was a guy
in for pushing drugs.

66
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,902
He walked and they're not
looking for him...

67
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,694
because he paid his way off.

68
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:37,234
I still think we should...

69
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,282
Absolutely not! No!

70
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,035
Look at this place.
Look what they're doing to me.

71
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:10,319
Jay.

72
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,989
I want you.

73
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:29,826
The day we're reduced
to making love in here is....

74
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:32,040
That's the day I give up.

75
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:50,979
Don't worry, darling. I have a plan.
And this money will do it.

76
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,520
What's going Okay? Let me out!

77
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,613
Wait, man. Just wait.

78
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:11,999
- What's happening? Let me out!
- All right, I will.

79
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,440
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

80
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,695
Let me out of here!

81
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,487
When I am ready, Mr. Wagner.

82
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,325
Let me out of here!

83
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,324
Let me out!

84
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,657
Let me out of here!

85
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:38,621
Let me out of here!

86
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:52,348
We can't let him stay
in that horrible place.

87
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,935
- Of course not.
- We can't. I can't.

88
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:57,356
Ann...

89
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,983
it isn't just a matter
of fire and earth...

90
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,445
and air and water
that makes up this world.

91
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:09,991
It's passion and strength
and cunning...

92
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:11,245
and money.

93
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,444
I've got money.

94
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:16,699
As much as you'll need.

95
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:23,173
Jay thinks he won't get out
of that place legally.

96
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,458
He wants to escape.

97
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:29,137
Has he got a plan?

98
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,973
Not yet.

99
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,142
Well....

100
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:38,177
Whatever it costs,
you can count on me.

101
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:59,372
Hawk! Let's get the hell out of here!

102
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:02,498
- Come on!
- I can't breathe, Nick!

103
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:06,124
- Where's the bucket?
- Get the hell out!

104
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:10,720
Hey! Get back!
There's gasoline in there. The thing...

105
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,344
It's okay. It's okay.

106
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:21,763
You can't burn smoked fish.
But look. I wouldn't have believed it.

107
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,020
- You know about smoked fish?
- Smoked fish?

108
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:29,275
- You from the health department?
- Do I look like It's?

109
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,195
I'm looking for Nick Colton.

110
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,740
They made me burn my fish.

111
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,822
There's two tons in there.

112
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,746
Maybe they made you
because your fish is spoiled?

113
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,914
No, they're opposed
to fish on principle.

114
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:48,251
I've got to find Nick Colton.
Do you know him?

115
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,515
Who wants to know?

116
00:19:55,808 --> 00:20:00,849
He was recommended by a man
in Fort Worth. Mr. Charles Mazdick.

117
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:06,441
That's Charming Charlie. Hey, Hawk!

118
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:09,149
She knows Charming Charlie.

119
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:15,361
He said, ask Nick Colton.
He'll do anything for money.

120
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:25,585
If old Charlie said so, you can
plug in, baby, because I'm Nick.

121
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,502
- You?
- Hawk, keep shoveling.

122
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,755
I'll be back to help.

123
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,188
So you want me to fly to Mexico...

124
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:45,397
pick up this dude,
and bring him back.

125
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:46,650
Exactly.

126
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:51,236
I should tell you
Pan Am does it five times a day...

127
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,238
with meals! Sit down.

128
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:56,445
Not on that road, they don't.

129
00:20:57,286 --> 00:21:02,162
- Got a name? Passport? This guy?
- None that needs to concern you.

130
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:07,331
A poor slob needs a lift.
Be Kind to Hitchhikers week?

131
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,166
Can you do It's?

132
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:14,296
I can land a jumbo jet on a quarter.

133
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,087
I'm willing to offer $1000.

134
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,388
I'll tell you, 1000 has never
been a figure to palpitate me.

135
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,940
Don't judge us on looks.
We're growing.

136
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:35,236
Or the fish out there. I have checks
I haven't cashed. Look here.

137
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:40,070
Here's one for $500. I haven't had
time to take it to the bank.

138
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,737
That job was easier than yours.

139
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:45,163
All right. What's your price?

140
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,873
Like I said, we're pretty busy.

141
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,171
How much?

142
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,256
- Twelve hundred.
- Ag reed.

143
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,626
- And 39 dollars.
- Good enough.

144
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:00,140
And 52 cents.

145
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:09,023
Whoa. Cash. Cash.

146
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:25,491
- I'll pay you after we get back.
- Before we take off.

147
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,160
If you insist.

148
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,413
We've got a deal.

149
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:33,791
Not quite.
The fee included an airplane.

150
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,716
We got one of those.

151
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:37,171
I didn't see it.

152
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,219
Well, it's out there.

153
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:41,963
I'd still like to see it.

154
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,893
Follow me.

155
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,780
- That'?
- Yeah. It flies like a bird.

156
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,871
- That won't be ready in time.
- I can nail it together in 30 minutes.

157
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:14,505
It has to be tomorrow.

158
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:19,128
It'll be ready. Don't worry.
You just trust old Nick.

159
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:23,716
Run along. Don't worry.
It's under control.

160
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:25,967
I certainly hope so.

161
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:45,282
Remember, you just trust me.

162
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,094
That's the last time
I shovel your mess.

163
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,516
You did a good job.

164
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:10,390
Why do I always end up shoveling?

165
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:13,220
While you shoveled,
I made us $500.

166
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:17,480
- Five?
- She's paying me to fly to Mexico.

167
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:19,818
We lost more on the fish.

168
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:24,366
I know that. Hell, I'm ready
to pay my loss right now.

169
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:29,618
There's a check for $500 made out
by Chili Shuster himself.

170
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,794
Shit! Chili's doing 20
in Huntsville for bad checks.

171
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:40,872
What are you gonna do, condemn a man
because he was caught? Damn it.

172
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:48,817
According to this map,
we should be almost there.

173
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:52,411
- Any last-minute things to say?
- Like what?

174
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:57,790
- This guy we're gonna pickup?
- You've been well paid, Mr. Colton.

175
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,234
What the hell?

176
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:07,102
- That's him! Wait!
- Where'?

177
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,158
- You didn't pay me for this!
- Wait!

178
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:31,678
- Stop, you bastard!
- Let go! Let go!

179
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,738
For trying to escape.

180
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:00,700
For underestimating me.

181
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,424
You need companionship.
You will learn.

182
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:12,815
Yeah, what did I tell you?
Right on time.

183
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:23,288
You know what you can do.

184
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,500
What the hell happened?

185
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:28,839
Coward!

186
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,965
There were guys shooting at us.

187
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:36,257
- We could have done it!
- You almost got us killed.

188
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:39,680
- You were paid to get my husband!
- Not to get shot!

189
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,677
- Your husband?
- Yes.

190
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,804
Yes. And you were paid.

191
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:49,229
All I knew was it was a pickup.
I wasn't supposed to get shot at.

192
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:53,026
I didn't know it was your husband.
Got a slug in the oil line.

193
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,281
The oil line?

194
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,364
We'll find someone else.

195
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:01,996
You listen to that shyster. Maybe
you'll manage to get somebody killed.

196
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,991
Want my advice? Talk to a pro.

197
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,960
Like you?

198
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:10,831
Yeah, like me!

199
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:14,917
You look at me
and see a bum in a funny hat.

200
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:19,222
But I am a pro.
I make my living on this border.

201
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,181
I know the ins and outs.

202
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:23,135
And you see this hat?

203
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:27,220
It's to strain the lousy gasoline
you sell there.

204
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,191
I'm not about to rip her off...

205
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:34,025
- ...and blow my reputation.
- We don't know you.

206
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:35,981
To hell with you!

207
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:39,152
- it's leaking like a sieve.
- I know.

208
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,321
Ann! Ann!

209
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:46,915
I don't care what it costs.
I want Jay out of there.

210
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:50,163
Mr. Colton, I want you to try again.

211
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:57,463
This time you tell me everything.
Why won't they let him out?

212
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,214
He's in prison.

213
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:01,722
Shit.

214
00:31:07,354 --> 00:31:10,806
In that case, it'll cost you $2000.

215
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:12,265
Preposterous!

216
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:15,444
That's 2000 to get him.
2000 on delivery.

217
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:16,947
No!

218
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:21,148
- Can you guarantee delivery?
- I don't know what he did.

219
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,367
But there are ways.

220
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:24,735
He's innocent.

221
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,116
What's the difference?
It's just as tough and costs the same.

222
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:31,492
Give him 2000.

223
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:34,833
- We should discuss this.
- Give it to him.

224
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,253
Privately.

225
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:42,086
Nobody else has done anything.
He will try.

226
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:45,011
Maybe he can. Give it to him.

227
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:51,183
- How would you do It's?
- That's none of your business.

228
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,563
Give him the money.

229
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:06,491
So the hat is used for things...

230
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:10,792
other than straining
our poor Mexican gasoline.

231
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,469
Two thousand.

232
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,185
Hawk!

233
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:57,165
- They're paying us $2000?
- Right. She already gave me 1000.

234
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:59,380
1000 more when they're out.

235
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:03,543
We have to pay expenses,
maybe give a cut to Myrna.

236
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:08,799
- Okay to me.
- Spence. How are you doing?

237
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:12,517
- Giving out any traffic tickets?
- What do you want?

238
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,430
Just here to say hello
and maybe borrow your wife.

239
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:20,276
- You son of a bitch!
- Someone mention my name?

240
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:22,813
There she is.

241
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:27,243
Look at that. There's my...
His baby.

242
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:29,991
We got us a very big contract.

243
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:34,375
- All we need is the feminine touch.
- Beat it!

244
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:40,832
I want to hear it.
He's better than television.

245
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,295
He ain't to me.

246
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:47,759
Spencer, if you're going to make
sheriff, you've got to be friendly.

247
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:49,094
Right.

248
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,722
Myrna and me, we go way back.

249
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:55,560
Yeah, way back.
Like way back behind a haystack.

250
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:59,651
Every cop should have
a sense of humor.

251
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:04,445
- What's this "touch of femininity"?
- I haven't worked it out yet.

252
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:07,148
But we need someone to wear a wig.

253
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:11,366
When I want to give money away,
I think of my friends.

254
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,625
- I'm here to give Myrna $100.
- 100'?

255
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:19,453
- She ain't interested.
- Suit yourself.

256
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:22,792
It doesn't amount to more
than a little walk.

257
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:27,386
- And it's hard for Myrna to make $200.
- Yeah.

258
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:30,759
You said $100.

259
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:34,011
That's $100 down
and $100 when it's over.

260
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:37,348
Yeah, we got the money too.
Show them, Nick.

261
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:42,726
- Where do I take this little walk?
- It's not far from here. In Mexico.

262
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,862
- Mexico?
- Don't worry. Nick will fly her.

263
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:50,324
Bullshit! You ain't taking
my baby to Mexico.

264
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:52,570
I don't trust you with her.

265
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,535
Hold it. I want to hear this.

266
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,794
There's a young guy down there.
He's the clean-cut type.

267
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:01,540
He's locked up.

268
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,922
All Myrna has to do
is wear this wig.

269
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:08,960
Make herself up so she
doesn't look like the clean...

270
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:13,349
young wife of the future sheriff
of our county.

271
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:18,811
- She'll look like a Mexican whore.
- Whore.

272
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:24,230
- Whore! You son of a bitch!
- All right, forget it.

273
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:27,861
I thought you could use
an extra $300.

274
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:32,868
- Three hundred?
- For you, 350.

275
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:36,154
Spence, maybe..

276
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:40,956
Like my husband says,
I'm not interested.

277
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:44,420
Shit. That leaves me in a hole.

278
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,666
Well, hell.
It's not that tough.

279
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:52,587
With the right makeup,
anybody can look like a whore.

280
00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:00,974
Yeah.

281
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:04,520
I think you're right, Myrna.

282
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:12,440
Exactly what I'm thinking.

283
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:15,783
You gotta be kidding.

284
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:21,000
Nick....

285
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:25,286
Oh, come on, Nick.
No, sirree-bob-dixie.

286
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:30,506
I'm not going to dress up in all
that garbage there. No, sir.

287
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,595
- You got the makeup?
- Yeah.

288
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,260
What cell is he in?

289
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:39,350
- Number 15.
- That's right.

290
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:44,271
Tell him to use plenty of lipstick
and eye makeup.

291
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:48,938
Coming out, he's got to mix
with those whores. I'll be here.

292
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:52,571
I give him this wig and dress
and come back here?

293
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:57,492
That's right. But make sure
you take your makeup off.

294
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,952
- Get going.
- I wish this was you.

295
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:04,542
Hawk, you might even get to like it.

296
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:11,048
Hawk, don't forget to swing it.

297
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:30,496
Wagner? You Jay Wagner?

298
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,151
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?

299
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:04,448
Let him go!

300
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:07,204
Goddamn it, let him go!

301
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:13,044
Let him go!

302
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:24,763
This is the way I figure it.

303
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,640
We dig a tunnel just about here.

304
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,476
Then, we dig another tunnel there.

305
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:34,861
If they locate one, they won't think
to look for another.

306
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:37,235
- He'd be free.
- I don't know.

307
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:39,738
It will be expensive, Ann.

308
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:43,741
But it's better than wasting
money with those guys.

309
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:47,240
Mr. Henderson, this is
a lot of trouble.

310
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,163
My husband might be safe right now.

311
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:55,752
Ann, I keep on telling you.
We'll never see Colton again.

312
00:39:58,094 --> 00:40:01,297
- You double-crossing bastards.
- Where's Jay?

313
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:04,550
Shut up! I'm mad enough to bust you.

314
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:07,388
I got questions
and I expect answers.

315
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:09,721
You! What do you gain...

316
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:15,360
- ...if your husband stays in prison?
- You're out of line, Mr. Colton.

317
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:19,022
- You too, out.
- Now stop it!

318
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,988
- We're not leaving you with him.
- It's all right.

319
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:26,037
All right. We'll be outside the door.

320
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:38,545
The answer to your question
is nothing. I stand to gain nothing.

321
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:41,381
Tell me what happened down there.

322
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:45,006
They beat up my best friend
and my partner.

323
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:50,012
They were waiting for us.
Somebody told them. They knew.

324
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:57,566
- They always know.
- Right, I think you told them!

325
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:01,064
I think you got drunk
and shot your mouth off.

326
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:05,024
I never get that drunk!
And what the hell is this?

327
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:09,285
That is a scale plan of the prison.

328
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:14,077
You can forget it because I'm
going back. I'm getting him out.

329
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:16,372
No, Mr. Colton.

330
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:20,499
You've had your chance and you failed.

331
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,302
Do it your way!

332
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:26,546
Go with their plan.
Whatever it is. What is It's?

333
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,308
Dig a tunnel's?

334
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,762
Maybe two, in case the first
is found out.

335
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,301
You know what?

336
00:41:33,564 --> 00:41:37,562
They'll dig and they'll hit rock,
and they'll hit water.

337
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:40,819
They'll dig for two years,
and your husband...

338
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:43,823
He'll be sitting there and rotting.

339
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:50,035
Maybe that's what you want.

340
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,541
No!

341
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:58,704
No, I want him out.
But I don't know what to do.

342
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:03,920
You keep coming to me
with your sure-fire schemes.

343
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:09,470
And I keep hoping and believing in you.

344
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:14,683
I'm paying and nothing seems to work.

345
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:27,023
Hell.

346
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:31,365
Come on, you don't have
to cry like that.

347
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,285
I don't like to see anybody crying.

348
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,199
Look.

349
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:45,261
You cut your hair.
Look at that.

350
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:47,837
It looks good.

351
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:52,264
I'll tell you what.
I'll take another whack at it.

352
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:55,596
- How much were they asking you for?
- $100,000.

353
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:59,102
One hundred thousand dollars!

354
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:05,775
I'm going to do it for nothing.

355
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:08,283
Nothing!

356
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:11,193
That's nothing up-front.

357
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:16,370
I'll only ask for half as much
on delivery. Fifty thousand dollars.

358
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:20,121
- You have another idea?
- Yeah.

359
00:43:20,337 --> 00:43:22,045
What is It's?

360
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know.
I ain't thought about it yet.

361
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:59,365
Forget about the preliminaries.

362
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:02,414
I know what makes it
go up and down.

363
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:06,290
Okay. How do you intend
to pay for your lessons?

364
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,543
Hurry. Bill.

365
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,224
I have a better idea.
I'll pay you for the lessons now.

366
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:22,934
This is made out for too much.
Just give me the balance.

367
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:25,268
We can't accept checks.

368
00:44:25,486 --> 00:44:27,775
- You can't?
- No.

369
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,115
We'll settle up later.
You can trust me.

370
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:36,788
I'm uneasy about your grandson. It's
been a while since his escape attempt.

371
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,247
Relax, Mr. Cable.

372
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,999
Unlike yourself, some men
do eventually give up.

373
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:45,879
No, something is going on.

374
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,045
If there is, his wife will tell me.

375
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:50,961
I can't count on that.

376
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,096
He gets to the States, we can't
touch him. You know my instructions.

377
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,093
All too well, Mr. Cable.
All too well.

378
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:19,866
Maybe next time
you'll tell me your plan.

379
00:45:20,124 --> 00:45:22,580
I don't have any more money on me.

380
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:25,500
You don't have to pay.

381
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,081
All I want from you
is to take me with you.

382
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:32,708
You promise?

383
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,295
- Give me that bottle.
- Good.

384
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:43,018
I got a hell of a good idea.
Let's get drunk.

385
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:06,623
Goddamn stupid. You dressed that
big ape up to look like a whore!

386
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:11,588
- Who did you think you would fool?
- I'm so sorry, Jay.

387
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:17,259
This Colton thinks it's a joke.

388
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:19,139
It wasn't a joke.

389
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:23,935
And that "big ape" nearly lost
his life trying to get you out.

390
00:46:24,188 --> 00:46:26,809
Well, they were paid, weren't they?

391
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:30,151
Anyway, it was Cohen's idea.

392
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:33,477
How come I never get to meet him?

393
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:35,568
Jay....

394
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:41,737
I can't bring him here so that
everyone knows he's working for us.

395
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:45,156
Not anymore, he's not.

396
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:49,584
You pay him off.
That's the end of it.

397
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:53,924
What happened?

398
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,633
I just cut it.

399
00:46:56,887 --> 00:47:00,422
- Don't you like It's?
- It's different.

400
00:47:00,683 --> 00:47:03,719
You used to always check
with me before.

401
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:07,599
I see.

402
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,980
What do you see?

403
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:17,943
Jay....

404
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:24,367
Jay, you think I'm sleeping
with someone. But I'm not.

405
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:30,871
Well, I notice things.

406
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,123
What things?

407
00:47:35,843 --> 00:47:39,212
Every time you come
to visit, you're a little...

408
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:42,426
colder. A little bit more
matter-of-fact.

409
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:45,017
Matter-of-fact?

410
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:49,097
Are you still as horny
as you used to be?

411
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,312
This guy Colton.
How is He's?

412
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:56,901
- Does he give you a good hump?
- Oh, Jay!

413
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:02,367
- You're still my wife. Get these off.
- No.

414
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:05,864
Conjugal privileges.
You can be his whore...

415
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,366
- ...or my whore.
- No, Jay.

416
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:11,919
- You're my whore.
- Jay, no.

417
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:31,721
Shit!

418
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:53,538
Shit! Damn it!

419
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:03,168
- Take it, take it!
- You got to understand this machine.

420
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:07,512
- Understand it? I'll break its neck.
- I'm afraid of that.

421
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,457
Wait a minute.

422
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:43,668
Some people can't chew gum
and tap at the same time.

423
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,168
I can.

424
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:48,515
It's only your third lesson.
Give it time.

425
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:50,844
Let's lay it on the line.

426
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,564
With two more weeks of lessons,
would I be as good as you?

427
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,147
No. You'll never be that good.

428
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:01,395
That's all I wanted to know.

429
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,328
Goddamn it, the way you come here
to borrow my wife.

430
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:15,032
- She ain't a lawn mower.
- You're right, Spence.

431
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:17,660
I admit I was out of line before.

432
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:22,880
I don't know how I could ask
your lady to pose as a whore.

433
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:26,011
But I swear, this time it's nothing.

434
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:31,133
- What do you want?
- Like he says...

435
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:34,721
- Let him tell it.
- It's just clown there and back.

436
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:38,142
You get to go to the lake.
I get no day off.

437
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:41,271
Now this time she's right.
Fair is fair.

438
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:45,194
Spence, you're going
to make a thousand dollars.

439
00:50:46,117 --> 00:50:50,280
- A thousand dollars for doing nothing.
- Practically nothing.

440
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:53,912
- No.
- Spencer, I got a say in this too.

441
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:59,954
You're the wife of an officer.
And you don't do nothing illegal.

442
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,999
Who says illegal?

443
00:51:02,216 --> 00:51:05,087
If it wasn't,
you'd say what she has to do.

444
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:09,051
- She has to get out of a car and yell.
- Yell what?

445
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:12,930
She has to yell that she's been raped.

446
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:17,063
You get out of here.

447
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:20,439
Rape! Rape!
Come on, Spencer.

448
00:51:20,693 --> 00:51:23,148
A thousand bucks just for that.

449
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:26,399
Just think.
You can buy fishing gear...

450
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:28,899
make a payment on a new car...

451
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:31,490
maybe even a color TV.

452
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:39,205
What guarantee do we have
that we'll ever see the money?

453
00:51:40,337 --> 00:51:41,452
That.

454
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:44,419
A check for five hundred dollars.

455
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:52,592
- Don't cash it until we get back.
- Why not?

456
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:57,560
It has sentimental value.
Look at the date. It's two months old.

457
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:01,099
It's the last check
my best friend ever wrote.

458
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,890
I'd like to keep it
as long as I can.

459
00:52:04,111 --> 00:52:07,895
I will let you hold it,
just to show my good faith.

460
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,999
<i>Okay?-</i>

461
00:52:20,711 --> 00:52:25,706
But if you lay one hand
on my Myrna...

462
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:29,218
I'll tear your head off
and shit in it.

463
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:39,301
Take it from me, nothing ever happens in
this world until you're self-employed.

464
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:44,312
I can't believe his luck.
Getting a chance like this.

465
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:47,404
- You want him to fly that ore?
- What ore?

466
00:52:47,613 --> 00:52:52,608
Sure. He can borrow one of the
choppers. He's got 10,000 hours.

467
00:52:52,827 --> 00:52:56,990
- Thirty-six hundred and fifty.
- Thirty-six hundred and fifty.

468
00:52:57,998 --> 00:53:00,536
I'll lay it on the line for you.

469
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:05,330
There's a lot of money here.
A lot of money involved.

470
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:10,252
I'm offering you five percent.

471
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,053
What do you say?

472
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:23,264
I say, hot damn!

473
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:43,536
I told you to come alone.

474
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:47,874
It was my fault, Mr. Colton.
I insisted.

475
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,188
Did you have to do that?

476
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:13,115
I don't trust him.
Did you bring them?

477
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:14,408
Yes.

478
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,789
The one on top is the most recent.

479
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:27,212
He might be hard to recognize.
He's changed so much.

480
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:29,581
He's changed?

481
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,084
That's great.

482
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:34,845
Do this.

483
00:54:35,096 --> 00:54:39,841
Tell him I want him in that
courtyard at 3:00 in the afternoon.

484
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:43,434
- One week from today.
- But he's a very sick man.

485
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:46,724
He's in the hospital.
I don't know if he can do it.

486
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:50,315
He's got to be there.
Tell him to get better.

487
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:52,105
Three o'clock.

488
00:54:52,363 --> 00:54:55,946
Not five minutes before,
not five minutes after.

489
00:54:56,158 --> 00:55:00,156
We'll wait for 10 seconds.
I leave with or without him.

490
00:55:05,126 --> 00:55:07,118
To tell you the truth...

491
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,709
a part of me hopes it's
without him.

492
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:17,004
How will you do it?

493
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:20,882
If I tell you
and they're waiting for us...

494
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,760
what will I think?

495
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:27,137
You don't trust me.

496
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:32,820
We will fly him out by helicopter.

497
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:37,364
- But that's so dangerous.
- You're damn right it's dangerous.

498
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,621
Nick, Hurry....

499
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:53,213
Don't worry.

500
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:11,147
All yours.

501
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,355
I don't know.
It doesn't look right.

502
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:58,988
- There's something wrong.
- You said blue.

503
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:03,065
By this picture, the attorney
general's is royal blue.

504
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:06,826
- Hell, blue is blue.
- Hey!

505
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,365
Holy shit!

506
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:15,582
What are you doing?
Who told you you could do that?

507
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:16,924
Do what?

508
00:57:17,758 --> 00:57:19,965
Do what? That!

509
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:22,295
What will the boss say?

510
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:27,758
Probably thanks. Hell, we won't
even charge him for the paint.

511
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:29,977
Looks better, huh?

512
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:43,943
I'll tell you something,
there better be a big score in this.

513
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,658
You wait, buddy.
You wait!

514
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:55,369
I need a moment with him alone.

515
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,747
Sosa's my good friend.

516
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,628
I know he is.
He's not going away.

517
00:58:01,218 --> 00:58:02,713
Please.

518
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:08,553
I will be close by, amigo.

519
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:18,777
Jay.

520
00:58:19,487 --> 00:58:21,278
Jay, listen to me.

521
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:26,067
Friday afternoon at 3:00,
Colton will get you out. Understand?

522
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:28,657
- 3:00.
- That's right.

523
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:30,246
Which clay?

524
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:33,833
- Jay, which day?
- Friday.

525
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,743
Right. In the courtyard.
You'll only have 10 seconds.

526
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:41,504
You must be there at 3:00.
And there's...

527
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:46,467
There's one other thing,
Cohen's never seen you.

528
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:49,053
- You must...
- You have to leave.

529
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:52,392
- I need a few more minutes.
- Okay, but come.

530
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:56,304
I have a right to speak
with my husband.

531
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,499
By tomorrow night you'll
be a real wife.

532
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,416
Yes, you will.

533
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:33,014
You be here.

534
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,410
See you tomorrow.

535
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,488
Good afternoon.

536
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:01,499
- Here you are.
- Hi.

537
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:04,994
What is the purpose
of your visit into Mexico?

538
01:02:05,212 --> 01:02:07,750
Not in front of the lady, huh?

539
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,128
We're just tourists here
for the weekend.

540
01:02:11,343 --> 01:02:14,297
- Welcome to Mexico.
- Oh, yeah. Si, sf.

541
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:19,638
- Just like old times, Myrna?
- Yeah, like old times, baby.

542
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:24,436
Spencer has good qualities.
I'm not knocking him.

543
01:02:24,648 --> 01:02:26,974
But you men...
Who are you calling?

544
01:02:27,234 --> 01:02:29,642
Just trying to get a weather fix.

545
01:02:30,071 --> 01:02:33,190
You're married to a cop,
and you can't even jaywalk.

546
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,276
Could you undo me?

547
01:02:37,328 --> 01:02:40,329
You can't believe the guilt
I feel now.

548
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:44,661
- Goddamn!
- What'? What's the matter?

549
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:47,795
Chance of high winds tomorrow.

550
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:52,709
I know. And it might even
get stormy tonight.

551
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:55,542
That's all I need, high winds.

552
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,046
- Nick?
- What?

553
01:02:58,265 --> 01:03:00,591
I've been worried
about tomorrow.

554
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,890
I have to be convincing,
and I've never been raped.

555
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:09,852
- We should all be so lucky.
- What's that joke?

556
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:12,738
A guy says, "So help me,
I'll rape you."

557
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:15,948
The girl says, "So rape me,
I'll help you."

558
01:03:16,158 --> 01:03:17,403
So?

559
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,578
So, rape me. I'll help you.

560
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:24,489
Oh, Myrna.

561
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:27,451
Is that all you got
on your mind?

562
01:03:27,795 --> 01:03:32,872
You never had anything else on your
mind but that, since kindergarten.

563
01:03:33,134 --> 01:03:35,340
I got something else now.

564
01:03:35,553 --> 01:03:39,253
I know the chopper will lift off.
But landing it...

565
01:03:39,473 --> 01:03:41,382
- Tell her, not me.
- Who?

566
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,179
- I see the way you look at her.
- You're crazy.

567
01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:50,062
Never thought you'd stick
your neck out for a girl.

568
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:55,936
- I'm in this for the money.
- You're doing it for her.

569
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:58,696
So what? It's my neck!

570
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:01,827
Remember that when
you fail tomorrow...

571
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:05,786
and spend the next five years
in some beaner jail.

572
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:08,961
You sure know how
to make a guy feel good.

573
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,996
How do you think I feel?

574
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:15,591
You brought me here. I thought
we were going to have some fun.

575
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:21,133
Now if we did it, you'd think of her
and I'd think of Spencer.

576
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:25,933
Spencer and her would make
a lousy couple.

577
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,603
Go on, get out of here.

578
01:04:29,023 --> 01:04:32,059
Save your strength for tomorrow.

579
01:04:37,114 --> 01:04:40,364
Rape. I should be so lucky.

580
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:57,088
Come on, pile in.

581
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:03,215
- Have you leveled with him yet?
- I will now.

582
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,923
- If he says no?
- How could he say no?

583
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:08,350
Who could say no to Nick?

584
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,486
- Harvey.
- Hi, Nick.

585
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:25,034
- What did you do with the beer?
- It's down here.

586
01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:28,989
These things, they either fly
or they don't.

587
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,334
There's been a little
change of plan.

588
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:34,838
All right.

589
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:39,958
Instead of lifting ore off a mountain,
we'll lift a guy out of jail.

590
01:05:42,596 --> 01:05:44,838
You son of a bitch.

591
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:46,808
Just hear me out.

592
01:05:47,184 --> 01:05:50,600
This guy shouldn't be there.
He was framed.

593
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:55,682
Look at it as a mission of mercy.
You can do it with your eyes shut.

594
01:05:55,901 --> 01:06:00,896
- What happens if we get caught?
- If it was dangerous, would I go?

595
01:06:01,115 --> 01:06:04,235
You're not listening.
I won't do it.

596
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,579
I never figured you'd turn chicken.

597
01:06:07,788 --> 01:06:12,000
Chicken? Chicken doesn't have
anything to do with this.

598
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:17,376
I'm something you never figured
with all your angles. I'm in love.

599
01:06:18,716 --> 01:06:20,340
You're what?

600
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:23,459
I'm getting married
in three weeks.

601
01:06:24,138 --> 01:06:29,049
I'll help you. I'll give you a part
of my share, Hawk will give you...

602
01:06:29,268 --> 01:06:31,806
- ...a part of his.
- What are you saying?

603
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:36,019
- it's a wedding present.
- No, I said I'm in love.

604
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,606
I'm getting married. Nothing...

605
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,820
will keep me away
from that ceremony.

606
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:44,611
Not you. Not some guy in prison.

607
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:48,568
Or all the goddamn money
in the world. Nothing!

608
01:06:57,004 --> 01:06:59,626
- He means it.
- We'll cancel everything.

609
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,462
- No, I'll do it.
- You can't fly that.

610
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:04,135
I took lessons.

611
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:09,428
- You're good, but not in a chopper.
- Goddamn it, Hawk, shut up!

612
01:07:09,683 --> 01:07:14,559
Those pepper-bellies have been
sticking it to us since we started.

613
01:07:14,814 --> 01:07:19,392
It's my turn now. This is my show.
I do it on my own.

614
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:41,419
So, a miraculous recovery.

615
01:07:56,731 --> 01:07:59,815
I just wanted
to get some fresh air.

616
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:03,768
Either you stay in bed,
or I'll send you to solitary.

617
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,903
For your health.

618
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:25,915
Ready.

619
01:08:26,594 --> 01:08:30,508
Hawk and Myrna ought to be
getting there about now.

620
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:52,406
Take it easy. Don't over-control.

621
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,694
Good luck.

622
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:12,973
Shit!

623
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,306
Are you sure you know nothing?

624
01:09:58,519 --> 01:09:59,764
Nothing.

625
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,690
He talks. I don't understand.

626
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,567
- And when his wife visits him?
- They whisper. I could not hear.

627
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,945
Somebody heard Wagner said,
"Friday afternoon."

628
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,539
Friday afternoon? Today?

629
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:21,394
Yes?

630
01:11:22,228 --> 01:11:24,635
How long do I have to sit here?

631
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,041
Until Friday's over.

632
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:48,863
One thousand and one.

633
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:52,911
One thousand and two.
One thousand and three.

634
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:57,083
- One, Mississippi. Two, Mississippi.
- Rape! Hey, you guys! Rape!

635
01:15:57,294 --> 01:15:58,539
Three, Mississippi.

636
01:15:59,046 --> 01:16:00,671
Four, Mississippi.

637
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:02,673
Five, Mississippi.

638
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:04,959
Six, Mississippi.

639
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,968
One thousand and six.
One thousand and seven.

640
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:10,379
Rape!

641
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:12,635
Help! Help!

642
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:15,390
- Let's go.
- Help!

643
01:16:15,646 --> 01:16:17,888
Help! Rape! Rape!

644
01:16:20,192 --> 01:16:22,434
One thousand and ten.

645
01:16:27,867 --> 01:16:30,192
Goddamn it, where are you?

646
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,794
Get back! Get back! Get the hell back!

647
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:44,130
Get away! Get away!

648
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,887
You're going to get hurt! Get back!

649
01:16:51,182 --> 01:16:52,462
Get away!

650
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,374
Now, you get back!

651
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,171
Get back! Get back!

652
01:17:25,049 --> 01:17:26,673
Now, you get back!

653
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,385
Get away! Get away!

654
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:31,680
Get away!

655
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:35,222
- Jay Wagner?
- Colton?

656
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:37,095
Let's go!

657
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:23,010
Goddamn, man!

658
01:20:45,082 --> 01:20:48,950
Easy. Easy. You got it made.

659
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:51,451
Easy.

660
01:20:57,762 --> 01:21:00,881
Holy shit! Easy!

661
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,176
Easy! You got it made!

662
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,053
Come on, you fool!

663
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,602
Easy, easy!

664
01:21:19,617 --> 01:21:24,195
- I can't believe it. You made it.
- Goddamn right, Harve.

665
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,038
Come on, Wagner. Let's go!

666
01:21:31,295 --> 01:21:33,833
I can't believe it's still
in one piece.

667
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,925
You better take off.

668
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:40,048
There's a suitcase with clothes.

669
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,715
Here they come.

670
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:31,558
Move your ass, Hawk. Come on!
Son of a bitch!

671
01:23:41,425 --> 01:23:43,085
Nick, the jeep!

672
01:24:12,164 --> 01:24:14,572
Just like old times, huh?

673
01:24:20,214 --> 01:24:22,503
- Everybody comfortable?
- Yeah.

674
01:24:23,926 --> 01:24:25,835
How fast can we go?

675
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:29,509
We're doing it now.
Ninety miles an hour.

676
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,888
Brownsville to Piper 87 Hotel.

677
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:35,636
Brownsville to Piper 87 hotel.
Oven

678
01:24:37,815 --> 01:24:41,480
Go ahead. This is 87 Hotel.

679
01:24:41,736 --> 01:24:45,484
Land at Brownsville
to clear customs and immigration.

680
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:48,147
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

681
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:51,277
Goddamn!

682
01:24:52,413 --> 01:24:53,907
What's that about?

683
01:24:54,165 --> 01:24:57,997
U.S. Customs wants me
to land in Brownsville.

684
01:24:58,252 --> 01:25:01,917
- You won't obey them, will you?
- I am.

685
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:04,833
They're not looking for you.

686
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:07,969
They think I got a plane
full of shit.

687
01:25:08,179 --> 01:25:10,467
We'll come up clean...

688
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:12,965
and we'll be home free.

689
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:17,302
I'm driving to Brownsville.

690
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:20,061
Ann, he said to wait here.

691
01:25:20,274 --> 01:25:23,192
You wait.
Something's gone wrong.

692
01:26:27,675 --> 01:26:30,960
- What do you say, Colton?
- Hey, Smitty.

693
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:34,092
What did you bring this time?
Wetbacks?

694
01:26:35,349 --> 01:26:37,840
My friends look like wetbacks?

695
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,013
Bring your papers. Come with me.

696
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:18,931
A little off your usual route,
aren't you?

697
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,435
Mexico?

698
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:28,147
- What's the purpose of the flight?
- Pleasure, Smitty. Pleasure.

699
01:27:28,402 --> 01:27:30,940
Pleasure? In Matamoros?

700
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:33,903
Take it where you can get it.

701
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:49,127
Just a minute.
Call from Mexico, Harry.

702
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,332
- Want it?
- You handle it.

703
01:28:49,608 --> 01:28:50,889
Good evening.

704
01:28:51,402 --> 01:28:54,853
- Are you the customs man?
- No. Immigration.

705
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:58,816
Do you have Mr. Jay Wagner here?

706
01:29:00,036 --> 01:29:01,743
Mister Wagner?

707
01:29:04,248 --> 01:29:05,707
Come with me, sir.

708
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:09,665
- What do you want with him?
- Just routine.

709
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:12,165
Easy does it.

710
01:29:13,007 --> 01:29:14,466
There we are.

711
01:29:19,346 --> 01:29:21,386
Maybe you'd better wait.

712
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,476
It's government business, sir.

713
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:28,437
A plane from Mexico.

714
01:29:28,856 --> 01:29:32,605
- Would you speak a little louder?
- Wait here.

715
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:37,606
Smitty, one of the passengers is sick.

716
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:41,486
He's really sick.

717
01:29:49,168 --> 01:29:51,706
- What about a sick man?
- What'?

718
01:29:51,962 --> 01:29:56,256
- You mentioned a sick man.
- There's a guy on the plane.

719
01:29:56,467 --> 01:30:00,050
Bring him in. We'll look at him.
I'll keep these.

720
01:30:22,827 --> 01:30:25,781
- I think I know you.
- Really'?

721
01:30:26,664 --> 01:30:28,288
I don't think so.

722
01:30:28,999 --> 01:30:30,873
No, I remember.

723
01:30:31,252 --> 01:30:33,957
- Get in the car, please.
- I remember.

724
01:30:34,422 --> 01:30:37,257
Some immigration guy
came for Wagner.

725
01:30:37,508 --> 01:30:39,050
- Where'?
- Over there.

726
01:31:29,477 --> 01:31:31,019
Jay Wagner!

727
01:33:19,253 --> 01:33:24,330
- I already got one of those.
- I know. But this is a good one.

728
01:33:33,642 --> 01:33:35,552
Thank you for my husband.

729
01:33:42,485 --> 01:33:44,726
Nice to have met you, Colton.

730
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,014
- Do we celebrate?
- How much we got?

731
01:34:27,113 --> 01:34:28,737
Fifty....

732
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:36,660
Fifty thousand, thirty-eight dollars,
and fifty-three cents.

733
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:42,911
I'll buy you a beer.
