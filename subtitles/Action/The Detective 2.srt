0
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:06,412
Heads up! Good defense!

1
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,039
Good defense!

2
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,722
We're going downtown.

3
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:19,109
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

4
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,903
What do you want?

5
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:26,033
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. I have a package for you.

6
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,620
It sounds broken.

7
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:35,333
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

8
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:38,336
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

9
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:41,298
...we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

10
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,095
That's a lovely dog.

11
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:50,974
-Do you mind if I pet him?
-I don't give a rat's ass.

12
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:04,571
Oh, brother!

13
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,823
That's fine. I can finish the rest.

14
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:10,660
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

15
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,133
Excuse me! HDS!

16
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:27,218
HDS! Coming through!

17
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,887
Got a package, people!

18
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:44,861
Get away from the door.

19
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:51,367
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

20
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,540
Son of a bitch!

21
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,751
That was a close one!

22
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,086
Unfortunately...

23
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:05,673
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

24
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,477
Hungry, fellow?

25
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,483
There you go.

26
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:32,283
No problem. It gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

27
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,536
Or we can try it now.

28
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,871
Putz!

29
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,164
Come on!

30
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:40,666
Get out! Get out!

31
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,463
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

32
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:53,345
Give me a push while you're back there.

33
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,474
Alrighty, then!

34
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,104
It's alive!

35
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:04,064
It's alive!

36
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:52,445
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

37
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:57,117
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

38
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:02,455
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
gonna hurt my baby, no he's not.

39
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,169
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

40
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,966
How can I ever repay you?

41
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:14,551
A reward would be good.

42
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:18,847
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

43
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:25,395
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

44
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:29,440
Gee! Let me think.

45
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:31,025
Sure.

46
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:42,412
People are real friendly around here.

47
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,487
Ventura!

48
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,199
Yes, Satan?

49
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,245
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

50
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:51,039
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

51
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,043
You owe me rent.

52
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:58,380
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

53
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,175
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

54
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,220
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

55
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,807
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

56
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,017
As soon as I find this bird...

57
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,185
...you're paid.

58
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,896
I heard animals in there.

59
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,941
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

60
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,193
I never bring my work home with me.

61
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,736
Oh, yeah?

62
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,781
What's all this pet food for?

63
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,658
Fiber.

64
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,620
Wanna take a look inside? Come on!

65
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,580
Come on!

66
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,970
Go ahead. Snoop around!

67
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,234
Well?

68
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,194
Are you satisfied?

69
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,034
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

70
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:11,536
All right.

71
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:14,080
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

72
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,333
Loser!

73
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,278
Come to me, jungle friends.

74
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,338
Roger, let me ask you one question.

75
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,257
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

76
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:09,843
What?

77
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,304
I'm sorry, I was just going to say...

78
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:15,349
...that it's not a fish. It's a mammal.

79
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,726
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

80
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,853
She didn't mean anything by that.

81
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:23,398
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

82
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:26,026
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

83
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:29,613
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

84
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,492
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

85
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,913
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

86
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:41,166
You know how superstitious
these players are.

87
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,879
I have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

88
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:50,217
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

89
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,178
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

90
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,140
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

91
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,892
Find the fish...

92
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,811
...or find new jobs!

93
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,939
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

94
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,108
I'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

95
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,069
Always out with their signs:

96
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:12,239
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

97
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,532
That fish lives better than they do.

98
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:19,412
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

99
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,916
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

100
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,959
...I hired a pet detective.

101
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,544
A what?

102
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:29,297
A pet detective.

103
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,676
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

104
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:36,096
Well, actually, he was quite good.

105
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:40,975
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

106
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,198
Like a glove!

107
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,543
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

108
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:51,629
Thanks, Martha.

109
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,422
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

110
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:54,924
Pleasure to meet you.

111
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,051
Any trouble getting in?

112
00:13:57,384 --> 00:14:01,514
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

113
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,682
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

114
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:08,270
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll get right to the point.

115
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:13,609
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

116
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,027
Negative.

117
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:18,906
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

118
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:22,451
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

119
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:23,660
<i>Let's go.</i>

120
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,913
<i>Blue 42, blue 42!</i>

121
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,331
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

122
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:32,002
<i>All right!</i>

123
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:38,926
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

124
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:45,432
<i>Good boy!</i>

125
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,317
Would you like an ashtray?

126
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,278
I don't smoke.

127
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,614
It's a disgusting habit.

128
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,996
The police came today.

129
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:11,416
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a...

130
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,836
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

131
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,839
Roger, how you holding up?

132
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:22,093
If I'm walking funny it's because
I got two dozen reporters up my ass.

133
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:25,388
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

134
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,643
Who's he?

135
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,312
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

136
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,397
He's our pet detective.

137
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,486
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

138
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,112
Martha Mertz?

139
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,948
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

140
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:49,871
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when I found her.

141
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,456
Is that the tank?

142
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:53,499
Excuse me.

143
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,928
-Cops drain it?
-Yes, this morning.

144
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,974
If I'm not back in five minutes...

145
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,684
...just wait longer.

146
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:32,788
Captain's log, stardate 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

147
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,210
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

148
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:39,587
So far...

149
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:44,091
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it.

150
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,553
If I have to tear another black hole,
I'm going to find it!

151
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:51,348
I've got to, mister!

152
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,737
Oh, great!

153
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,947
I'll try to head them off.

154
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,158
Ace, get out of the tank.

155
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,035
I just can't do it, captain!

156
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:13,203
I don't have the power!

157
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:16,957
People!

158
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,543
I said, get out of the tank now!

159
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,422
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man!

160
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:25,090
Where's Snowflake?

161
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,302
Snowflake is not available right now.

162
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,973
Roger, I've been waiting all day.
I got to get a shot of his new trick!

163
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:34,725
What, is he sick?

164
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,826
People, people!

165
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,905
Lassie must be missing.

166
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:39,162
Make any good collars lately?

167
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,122
Or were they leashes?

168
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,508
Homicide, Ventura.

169
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,095
How are you gonna solve that one?

170
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,475
Good question, Aguado!

171
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:03,144
First, I'd establish a motive.

172
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:08,107
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

173
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,156
Then I'd lose 30 pounds
perking his wife!

174
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,616
Come on!

175
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,579
Now, kiss and make up!

176
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,168
Excuse me.

177
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:29,920
I’d like to ass you a few questions.

178
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:31,964
This is not the time, Ace.

179
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:36,802
If Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

180
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:42,182
I can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

181
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,853
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

182
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:49,440
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

183
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,109
Five minutes alone, that's all I need!

184
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,112
Better look alive.
Einhorn's on her way down.

185
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,865
Come on, now. Ace, please.

186
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:02,244
What's that matter?
Afraid I'll make a stink? Come on!

187
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,705
Aguado's working the case, all right?

188
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,165
Aguado!

189
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:08,625
Good call!

190
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,961
We're just a little busy now...

191
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,048
...with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

192
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,260
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

193
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:23,849
Now you've pissed him off.

194
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:28,270
-Would you give me a break?
-I can't hold him much longer!

195
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,521
My boss is coming!

196
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,649
Okay, look.

197
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,610
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

198
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,990
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

199
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,452
<i>So far, nothing, nathin', nada.
All right?</i>

200
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,954
Any unusual bets being made?

201
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,206
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

202
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:51,042
-What'd you find out about the tank?
-Nothing.

203
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,504
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

204
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:57,257
-That's it?
-I swear.

205
00:21:57,465 --> 00:22:00,719
Now will you please get out of here
before I get in trouble?

206
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,890
Thank you for your cooperation.

207
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:09,102
By the way, do you have a mint?

208
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,563
Perhaps some Binaca?

209
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,494
<i>Assholomio</i>

210
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:29,581
<i>Osadomia</i>

211
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:36,170
Holy testicle Tuesday!

212
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:39,507
What the hell is he doing here?

213
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:41,342
I came to confess.

214
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:45,096
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

215
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:50,268
Spare me the routine. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

216
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:54,439
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

217
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,899
We'll find the porpoise.

218
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,362
Now I feel better.

219
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:05,741
Of course, that might not do any good.

220
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,495
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
It’s a dolphin that's been taken.

221
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:12,415
The common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

222
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:16,711
...while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncatus...

223
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,424
...has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

224
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:24,385
But I'm sure you already knew that.

225
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,971
That's what turns me on about you.

226
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,806
Your attention to detail.

227
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:31,392
Listen, pet dick...

228
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:35,604
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

229
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:39,942
Well, I'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

230
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,152
But thank you for asking.

231
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,701
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

232
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:50,286
Your number still 911?

233
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,371
Alrighty, then!

234
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,829
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

235
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,039
Thank you!

236
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,728
What's the password?

237
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:01,565
New England clam chowder.

238
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,734
Is that the red or the white?

239
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,904
I can never remember that!

240
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:10,073
White?

241
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:15,203
Hey, Woodstock!

242
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:17,664
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

243
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:21,376
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

244
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:22,627
Do you?

245
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:24,087
Don't l?

246
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:27,090
So what are you up to?

247
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,884
Just watching the fishies.

248
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,304
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

249
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,392
I'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

250
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,852
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

251
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,896
...before they find any whales.

252
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:46,734
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

253
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:48,319
Of course I can. Why?

254
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,738
I wanna trace the sale of equipment...

255
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:53,908
...for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

256
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:57,245
Come on, I thought you had
a challenge for me.

257
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:02,250
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank...

258
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:05,545
Wait a minute. Look here.

259
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,674
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

260
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,801
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

261
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,470
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

262
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,516
Really?

263
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,768
That is the face of the enemy.

264
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:24,772
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

265
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,524
Hold on.

266
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:28,609
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

267
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,488
That sub-genius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

268
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:37,910
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

269
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:43,916
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

270
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:54,552
I'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

271
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:59,807
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

272
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:02,559
If you do anything to embarrass me....

273
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,687
What? Like this?

274
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,736
Hi, Captain Stubing.

275
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:14,571
How are Gopher and Doc?

276
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,282
Permission to come aboard, sir.

277
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,428
I'm sorry, ladies.

278
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:43,225
Glad you could make it.

279
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:44,976
Thank you.

280
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:47,604
You look wonderful.

281
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,566
And who is he, a friend?

282
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,737
No, this is...
This is my date.

283
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:59,324
He's a lawyer.

284
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:02,702
Does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

285
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,625
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...

286
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:11,586
Tom Ace.

287
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,005
Pleasure to meet you.

288
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,216
Congratulations on all your success.

289
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:17,968
You smell terrific!

290
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:21,137
One of the first lessons we learned...

291
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,472
...back at...

292
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:27,852
...Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

293
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:31,439
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

294
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:32,899
...with little else.

295
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,195
How is everybody feeling tonight?

296
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:39,989
Very, very well, thank you.

297
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:42,075
Look, honey...

298
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,077
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

299
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:54,963
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

300
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:57,548
What are you trying to do?

301
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:05,306
Will you keep him occupied
while I work my magic, please?

302
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:12,814
Smooshy, isn't it?

303
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,493
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

304
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:28,079
Excuse me, Ron...

305
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,331
...I need to use the bathroom.

306
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:32,792
I think it's the pâté.

307
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,752
Sure, it's over there.

308
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:38,672
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

309
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,641
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

310
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:28,990
Gravy!

311
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,287
Don't worry, Snowflake.

312
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,247
Ace Ventura's here.

313
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,877
Yummy!

314
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:01,397
Snowflake!

315
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,567
Here, Snowflake.

316
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,904
I've got a snack for you.

317
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,128
They're wonderful, aren't they?

318
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,839
Yes, they certainly are.

319
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,884
No matter what's going on in my life...

320
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:32,178
...I can always watch them swim...

321
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,847
...and be totally at peace.

322
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:43,856
It's not Snowflake!

323
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,317
It's not Snowflake!

324
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:50,488
It's not Snowflake!

325
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,383
Are you sure your date is all right?

326
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:13,510
It's been an awfully long time.

327
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,095
Who, Tom?

328
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,598
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

329
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:30,319
Do not go in there!

330
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:47,878
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

331
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:52,215
Do that! If I'd been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

332
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,593
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

333
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,892
What're you doing?

334
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,643
I'm sorry, Ron.

335
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:05,228
What's he doing?

336
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,855
Let's go!

337
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,735
Stop it!

338
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:15,989
I don't even wanna know
why your pants are missing!

339
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,033
You could've cost me my job!

340
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:22,329
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

341
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,748
I found it in the filter, thank you.

342
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:29,461
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

343
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:32,839
What're you talking about?

344
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,301
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

345
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:38,678
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

346
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:41,347
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

347
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:44,559
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

348
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:46,644
Ring? What ring?

349
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:52,650
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

350
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:58,364
I find the ring with a missing stone,
I find Snowflake.

351
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,284
How you gonna do that?

352
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:04,662
Simple.

353
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:12,879
Loser!

354
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:15,339
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

355
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,634
You wanna play?

356
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,854
Damn it!

357
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:55,373
That stone could've come from anywhere.

358
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,292
It could've come from...

359
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,503
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

360
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:05,049
It came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

361
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:14,017
Einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

362
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:19,439
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

363
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,691
Over half a million members worldwide?

364
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,818
No. Who are they?

365
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:25,736
Did you know...

366
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:30,283
...they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

367
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:32,034
What do you feed your dog?

368
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:35,830
Dog food. Why?

369
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,498
He is miserable!

370
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,458
What are you talking about?

371
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:43,671
He's very unhappy. I feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

372
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,007
It's amazing he's still alive.

373
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:52,263
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

374
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:53,848
You can't express anger.

375
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,726
Yeah? And you're ugly.

376
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:01,564
I'm not even gonna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

377
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,691
Why? So you can beat him?

378
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:04,984
Fatty!

379
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:07,153
You're unbelievable!

380
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:09,697
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

381
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:12,783
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

382
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:19,290
You like her, huh?

383
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,834
Yeah, she's all right.

384
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:33,429
Look, Melissa, l....

385
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,311
I'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

386
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:45,274
...where Roger Podacter, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

387
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:47,568
...has apparently committed suicide...

388
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,613
...allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony....

389
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,124
You okay?

390
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,002
I told you. I was in my apartment...

391
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:06,420
...across the hall.

392
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,755
I heard a scream...

393
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,966
...so I called the manager.

394
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:14,886
The place was empty, except for the dog.

395
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,639
I opened the balcony door
and looked out...

396
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,016
...splat, bang, pancake time.

397
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,352
Okay, thank you very much.

398
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:29,025
Hi there, fella.

399
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,694
Have a bad night?

400
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:42,747
So...

401
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:45,208
...animals can sense evil.

402
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,293
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

403
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:50,046
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

404
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:55,176
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

405
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:58,930
Face it...

406
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,224
Forget it. She's right.

407
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:02,475
Besides...

408
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:07,230
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

409
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:23,079
So...

410
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:27,125
...you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

411
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:32,004
I wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

412
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:35,550
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

413
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:42,682
May I tell you what I think happened?

414
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,308
Alrighty, then!

415
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:48,187
Roger Podacter went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

416
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:52,233
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

417
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:55,027
..and he was thrown over that balcony.

418
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,738
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

419
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,740
He was murdered.

420
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:03,786
That's a very entertaining story...

421
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:08,249
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

422
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,042
...evidence.

423
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:14,463
I think I heard a toilet flush.

424
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:17,007
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

425
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:22,137
Well, l....

426
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,099
I guess I'm out of my league here.

427
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:28,811
Good work.

428
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,072
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

429
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:43,826
This woman is Roger Podacter's neighbor.

430
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,370
She said she heard a scream. Right?

431
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:49,581
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

432
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:53,335
-That's true.
-You're sure you had to open this door?

433
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:54,586
I'm certain.

434
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:56,838
What's the point, Ventura?

435
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:59,466
Only this.

436
00:43:12,187 --> 00:43:15,565
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

437
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:19,403
...she could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

438
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:21,988
The scream she heard
came from inside...

439
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,118
...before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

440
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:32,290
Can you feel that, buddy?

441
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:38,630
I have exorcized the demons!

442
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:43,343
This house is clear.

443
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:46,388
-Losers.
-Get him out of here!

444
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:50,141
-Losers! Losers!
-Let's go, Ace.

445
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,060
Losers.

446
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:55,647
Come on.

447
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:57,649
Back to the zoo.

448
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,403
What are you thinking?

449
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:05,490
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

450
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,618
I want to find that other ring.

451
00:44:10,537 --> 00:44:12,705
Ace, you checked all the rings.

452
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:15,124
Receipts? What about receipts?

453
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,043
There's gotta be receipts.

454
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:29,514
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

455
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:31,933
You don't have to tell me.

456
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,935
I was there.

457
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,899
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

458
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:42,068
I don't do humans.

459
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,988
You really love animals.

460
00:44:47,782 --> 00:44:49,492
If it gets cold enough.

461
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,038
No, I have a kinship with them.

462
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:55,790
I understand them.

463
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,710
Wanna hear something spooky?

464
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,170
Sure.

465
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:08,219
One time when I was about 12, I had
a dream that I was being followed by...

466
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,262
...a big dog with rabies.

467
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:12,431
He had these bloodshot eyes...

468
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,475
...and foam came out of his mouth.

469
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:19,814
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

470
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,902
Then just before I got
to my front door...

471
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:27,738
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

472
00:45:29,782 --> 00:45:31,659
That's when I woke up...

473
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,995
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

474
00:45:38,248 --> 00:45:39,583
Bastard!

475
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:43,587
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

476
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:46,173
Want to know why I do this?

477
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,133
I'm not sure anymore.

478
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:49,843
You better be sure...

479
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:53,055
...because once you get
inside my head...

480
00:45:53,347 --> 00:45:55,015
...there's no turning back.

481
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,611
So....

482
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:11,823
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

483
00:46:12,074 --> 00:46:14,159
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

484
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,036
Who the hell is that?

485
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:17,704
What?

486
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,043
That.

487
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:25,629
Who the hell is that?

488
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:29,716
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

489
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,261
Why isn't he in this picture?

490
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:42,562
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

491
00:46:47,943 --> 00:46:51,529
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

492
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,406
Cost the Dolphins the game.

493
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:56,076
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

494
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:58,620
Definitely.

495
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:01,706
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

496
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:04,667
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

497
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:08,254
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

498
00:47:08,713 --> 00:47:11,341
"The kick heard round the world."

499
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:14,969
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

500
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:18,890
Poor guy.

501
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:21,392
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

502
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:23,311
Where is he now?

503
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:26,773
I heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

504
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:31,277
Really?

505
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:35,615
You're gonna drop me off before you go?

506
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:39,243
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

507
00:47:39,494 --> 00:47:42,080
It might not be safe at your apartment.

508
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:44,624
What do you suggest?

509
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:30,586
Oh, my God!

510
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:33,130
Oh, my God.

511
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,425
Three times?

512
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:39,720
I'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

513
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:42,264
I must be tired.

514
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:47,519
Okay, I'm ready again.

515
00:49:39,654 --> 00:49:41,573
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

516
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:44,618
...and a clean pair of shorts.

517
00:49:44,826 --> 00:49:47,746
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

518
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:52,959
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

519
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:56,963
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

520
00:49:57,213 --> 00:49:58,798
Most points and distance.

521
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,885
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

522
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:04,971
And one hell of a model American.

523
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:13,521
<i>Are you another one of them
Hard Copy guys?</i>

524
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:14,814
No, sir.

525
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:16,524
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

526
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,528
This is my Graceland, sir.

527
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:23,448
Will you put that gun down?

528
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:27,076
The boy is a fan of our son.

529
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:30,038
So nice to meet you.

530
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:31,748
I'm Ray's mother...

531
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:33,708
...and this is Ray's father.

532
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:36,252
It's a real honor!

533
00:50:36,878 --> 00:50:39,839
It's an honor to have you here.

534
00:50:41,507 --> 00:50:44,427
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

535
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:47,180
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

536
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,599
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

537
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:52,477
Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

538
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:56,439
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

539
00:50:56,731 --> 00:50:58,357
Yummy!

540
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:06,824
Ray Finkle's house.

541
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,785
I can't wait to meet him.

542
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,665
Ray ain't coming home.

543
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,544
But your wife expects him any minute.

544
00:51:18,753 --> 00:51:21,422
She expects him home any minute.

545
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:26,260
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

546
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:28,888
Eight years ago...

547
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:33,225
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

548
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:36,312
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

549
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:40,190
It was all that Dan Marine's fault.
Everyone knows that.

550
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:43,736
If he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

551
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:46,363
...Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

552
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:50,909
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

553
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,162
Would you like a cookie, son?

554
00:51:55,956 --> 00:51:57,374
What do you know?

555
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,793
They're little footballs.

556
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:01,378
Laces out.

557
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:05,757
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

558
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:08,343
...he'll never even know he was gone.

559
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:11,471
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

560
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:35,328
Oh, boy!

561
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:38,373
What a sports nut, huh?

562
00:52:50,177 --> 00:52:51,136
May l?

563
00:52:51,386 --> 00:52:53,430
Oh, yes, by all means.

564
00:52:56,975 --> 00:53:00,270
<i>Five seconds to go here
in Super Bowl 17.</i>

565
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,314
<i>Dolphins trailing the 49ers...</i>

566
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:06,317
<i>...by one. This will
win the game for Miami.</i>

567
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:08,236
<i>There's the snap.</i>

568
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:09,696
<i>Marino holds.</i>

569
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:11,114
<i>The kick...</i>

570
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,825
<i>...and it's high. No, it's...</i>

571
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:14,951
<i>...no good.</i>

572
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:19,122
<i>Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!</i>

573
00:53:19,372 --> 00:53:21,249
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

574
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,209
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>

575
00:53:23,418 --> 00:53:27,630
<i>The Dolphins lose!
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!</i>

576
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,676
<i>-Melissa, it's Ace!
-Where are you?</i>

577
00:53:31,926 --> 00:53:35,513
I'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

578
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:36,931
Why?

579
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,310
He's about to join Snowflake.
I've gotta know where he is!

580
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:44,772
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

581
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:48,067
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

582
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:50,278
Ace, what's going on?

583
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:54,490
Thought I left?

584
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,327
I'm really gonna go this time.

585
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:09,171
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

586
00:54:09,422 --> 00:54:10,298
Action!

587
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:14,593
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

588
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:23,894
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

589
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:25,855
...with Isotoner gloves!

590
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:28,023
Cut! Again from the top.

591
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:29,316
I said, cut!

592
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,860
Guys, it's a cut!

593
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,446
What the hell are they doing?

594
00:54:33,696 --> 00:54:35,322
That's a cut!

595
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:42,955
-What is this, a rewrite?
-Shut up!

596
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:48,836
-Where'd they go?
-Over there!

597
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:50,087
Let's go!

598
00:54:57,177 --> 00:54:58,762
Excuse me, gentlemen!

599
00:54:59,013 --> 00:55:00,139
Pet detective!

600
00:55:08,814 --> 00:55:09,815
Come on!

601
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:11,316
What's wrong?

602
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:13,026
Can't you hit me?

603
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,431
Have there been ransom demands?

604
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:45,142
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

605
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,310
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

606
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,062
The game is on as scheduled.

607
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,231
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

608
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:54,484
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

609
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:58,697
-Are the crimes related?
-I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

610
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:00,865
Now, if you'll excuse me....

611
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:05,120
Get me the autopsy on Podacter!

612
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,206
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

613
00:56:08,456 --> 00:56:11,042
And somebody get me some coffee!

614
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:15,171
<i>Tonight on Miami Vice,
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!</i>

615
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:20,635
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

616
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:23,304
Is it number one or number two?

617
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,807
I just wanna know how much time I have.

618
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,854
By the way,
I went ahead and solved that...

619
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:34,065
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-
Marino thing.

620
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:38,444
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

621
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,078
All right, Ventura...

622
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,539
...make it quick.

623
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:53,042
I found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

624
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:55,962
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

625
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,340
It would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

626
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,551
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

627
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:06,430
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room.

628
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,891
Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

629
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:12,061
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

630
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:17,275
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

631
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:22,154
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

632
00:57:22,363 --> 00:57:24,198
Finkle took it personally.

633
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:28,327
So where is Finkle now?

634
00:57:28,536 --> 00:57:32,998
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

635
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,918
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

636
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:38,003
The time when it'd hurt them most:

637
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:40,381
Super Bowl time.

638
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:43,008
Man, I'm tired of being right!

639
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:49,014
Congratulations.

640
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:53,060
You've done some fine detective work...

641
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,146
...Ace.

642
00:57:57,815 --> 00:58:00,442
I'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

643
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:02,820
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

644
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:07,991
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

645
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,836
Your gun is digging into my hip.

646
00:58:19,086 --> 00:58:20,546
What's wrong?

647
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:23,257
Want me to read you your rights?

648
00:58:24,216 --> 00:58:25,842
Maybe later.

649
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:30,138
What is it?

650
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:31,974
That bony little bitch...

651
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:33,934
...Melissa Robinson?

652
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:36,728
You just don't do anything for me.

653
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:39,439
Down, boy!

654
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:44,236
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

655
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:46,279
Fine, sergeant.

656
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,407
You want me to throw him out?

657
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,743
Why don't you throw yourself out?

658
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:55,038
Yes, ma'am.

659
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:01,169
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

660
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:04,673
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

661
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:06,591
When we find Marino...

662
00:59:06,841 --> 00:59:08,885
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

663
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,221
When I find Snowflake...

664
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,432
...I'll deliver Marino.

665
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:27,779
Melissa, it's Ace!

666
00:59:28,029 --> 00:59:30,907
What are you doing here?
It’s the middle of the night.

667
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:33,660
You have to commit me.

668
00:59:34,828 --> 00:59:38,289
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

669
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,792
They aren't gonna let us look around.

670
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:42,126
I know.

671
00:59:42,377 --> 00:59:45,213
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

672
00:59:45,463 --> 00:59:46,506
Mrs. Robinson...

673
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:48,883
...I'm Dr. Handly.

674
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:51,552
Now who is it you want us to look at?

675
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:53,054
My brother...

676
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,889
..Larry.

677
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,604
I'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

678
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:04,774
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

679
01:00:05,066 --> 01:00:06,776
Just gotta stay positive.

680
01:00:08,945 --> 01:00:12,114
I'm gonna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

681
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,435
Let's see that...

682
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:43,312
...in an instant replay.

683
01:00:58,661 --> 01:01:01,956
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

684
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:04,917
-Is that right?
-Yes, we're very sensitive...

685
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:07,628
...to the stress athletes
have to endure.

686
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,838
I'm open! I'm open!

687
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:12,383
I'm open!

688
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:15,719
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

689
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:18,138
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

690
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:19,973
Over here!

691
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:23,894
351!

692
01:01:24,353 --> 01:01:26,146
351!

693
01:01:26,396 --> 01:01:28,357
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

694
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,571
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

695
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:37,157
Has he had a history of mental illness?

696
01:01:38,617 --> 01:01:40,410
As long as I've known him.

697
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:44,956
This is one of our therapy rooms.

698
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:49,252
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

699
01:01:49,503 --> 01:01:53,423
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...

700
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:55,175
Halftime!

701
01:02:09,147 --> 01:02:13,068
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

702
01:02:14,653 --> 01:02:16,988
I'll show you the dormitories, then.

703
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:30,478
Isotoners.

704
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:52,208
Obsess much?

705
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:55,461
Where are you going?

706
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,714
-To clean the storage room.
-No, clean the cafeteria.

707
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:01,008
I don't tell you how to do your job.

708
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:02,885
The schedule says...

709
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,554
-...clean the cafeteria.
-I know what I'm doing.

710
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,056
You should've done it earlier.

711
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:10,559
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
I'm cleaning in here!

712
01:04:10,768 --> 01:04:12,853
You take breaks too long. You smoke...

713
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,356
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

714
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:40,631
"Search called off for missing hiker."

715
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,800
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

716
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:47,638
...were unable to find the body
of Lois Einhorn."

717
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,433
A hiker missing since Friday?

718
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:53,268
Lois Einhorn?

719
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:57,272
Holy shitballs!

720
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:13,830
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

721
01:05:42,984 --> 01:05:44,277
"Love, Roger"?

722
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,078
<i>Ace, it's E.</i>

723
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:57,415
<i>You think the article you found
was something?</i>

724
01:05:57,665 --> 01:06:00,168
<i>I got a note from Roger to Einhorn...</i>

725
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,754
<i>...thanking her for a wonderful evening.</i>

726
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:05,590
<i>Something ain't stirring
the Kool-Aid, man.</i>

727
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,717
Wiggles, rewind.

728
01:06:11,888 --> 01:06:15,266
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

729
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:18,644
Come on, think!

730
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:22,023
Finkle and Einhorn, in it together.
How? Why?

731
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,698
All right! Here we go.

732
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:34,160
Answer's right there!
Just gotta get blood to the brain!

733
01:06:34,744 --> 01:06:37,413
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

734
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:39,999
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

735
01:06:54,138 --> 01:06:55,473
Quitter!

736
01:06:57,641 --> 01:06:59,560
What do you want?

737
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:03,647
I don't have any food for you.

738
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:06,775
I have to have money to buy food.

739
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:10,404
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

740
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:20,122
Let's face it...

741
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:22,416
...your master is a loser.

742
01:07:39,516 --> 01:07:41,476
What the...?

743
01:07:43,437 --> 01:07:45,355
That's it.

744
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:49,067
That's it!

745
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,862
Einhorn is Finkle.

746
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:54,489
Finkle is Einhorn!

747
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:57,159
Einhorn is a man!

748
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,662
Oh, my God!

749
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,665
Einhorn is a man!

750
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:02,640
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

751
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,976
God!

752
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:11,149
<i>And the big story in this
Super Bowl game is the abduction...</i>

753
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:14,444
<i>...of Miami's starting quarterback,
Dan Marino.</i>

754
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:17,822
<i>It's gotta be a strain
on this Miami team, Bob....</i>

755
01:09:56,152 --> 01:09:59,655
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

756
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:03,701
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

757
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:06,245
A magical afternoon...

758
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,873
...where dreams are made...

759
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:11,458
...and crushed.

760
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:15,296
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

761
01:10:16,839 --> 01:10:20,426
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

762
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,803
...met someplace before?

763
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,806
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

764
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,475
<i>Now the coin toss.</i>

765
01:10:29,226 --> 01:10:30,477
Kickoff time.

766
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,105
My favorite thing.

767
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,321
Laces out!

768
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,094
I made some refreshments, Dan.

769
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:07,889
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

770
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,101
I'll be right back, Dan.

771
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:45,427
I don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but I'll double it.

772
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:48,888
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

773
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,850
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

774
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,768
Check it out, Marino.

775
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,312
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

776
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,574
Damn!

777
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,575
Go get some more fish!

778
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,452
I'm gonna kill that dolphin.

779
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,372
Lovely party.

780
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,374
Pity I wasn't invited.

781
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,972
Where the hell's the smelt?

782
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,941
Unconscious. Exactly as I planned.

783
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,117
What the hell was that?

784
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,337
Shit!

785
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:12,096
What happened? What's going on?

786
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,305
You okay?

787
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:14,890
Guess what?

788
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,350
It's nap-time!

789
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,479
<i>What a hit!</i>

790
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,733
Heads up!

791
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,199
Who are you?

792
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,870
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

793
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,747
The quarterback sneak.

794
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,666
Penalty!

795
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,044
Too many men on the field.

796
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,672
I warned you, Ventura.

797
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:48,924
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

798
01:13:49,132 --> 01:13:50,926
Good question.

799
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:56,014
Be careful with that phone.
Ln time, you could develop a tumor.

800
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,976
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

801
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,980
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

802
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,649
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

803
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,777
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

804
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:15,617
<i>Code 11 in progress,
343 Victorville Road...</i>

805
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:17,452
<i>...at the Palmdale basin.</i>

806
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:20,956
<i>Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura...</i>

807
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,792
<i>...should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

808
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,170
It's Ace. We gotta break out of here.

809
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,132
Is he in trouble?

810
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,802
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

811
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,263
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

812
01:14:36,888 --> 01:14:39,182
Don't kill me!

813
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,477
Please!

814
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:45,230
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

815
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,816
-He's who you want! Kill him!
-Kill him!

816
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,819
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

817
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,654
Come on, look at him!

818
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:54,155
-Crybaby!
-Jock!

819
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,323
-Wimp.
-Musclehead.

820
01:14:55,573 --> 01:14:57,075
Shut up!

821
01:14:57,325 --> 01:15:01,704
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

822
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:04,082
<i>And there's the snap.</i>

823
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,208
<i>The kick!</i>

824
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,502
<i>And it's good!</i>

825
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:10,630
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

826
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:20,014
What would you know about pressure?

827
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:22,850
Well, I have kissed a man.

828
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:28,189
<i>Of course, there's never been
a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...</i>

829
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:30,733
<i>...than the "kick
heard around the world. "</i>

830
01:15:31,234 --> 01:15:36,322
<i>I mean, it's clear to me that it was
a good hold. Finkle just booted it.</i>

831
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:38,908
The laces were in!

832
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,993
They were in!

833
01:16:01,263 --> 01:16:02,890
You like that?

834
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,308
You like that?

835
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:11,690
And that! And that!

836
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,620
Having a little trouble with the lady?

837
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:26,497
You don't understand...

838
01:16:26,747 --> 01:16:27,957
...she's a...

839
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,878
Get him, Lois! Get him!

840
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:38,217
Get him!

841
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,933
Shoot him!

842
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:50,020
-Shoot him!
-Hold your fire!

843
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:52,981
Don't shoot!

844
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,442
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

845
01:16:56,235 --> 01:16:57,694
I mean it!

846
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:00,364
She's not joking!

847
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:02,115
He kidnapped Snowflake!

848
01:17:02,366 --> 01:17:06,954
He killed Roger Podacter and was about
to kill Marino and me!

849
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:12,334
Fiction can be fun!

850
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:15,504
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

851
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:17,130
For instance...

852
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:18,632
...if you look up...

853
01:17:18,882 --> 01:17:23,345
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

854
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:27,307
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

855
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:32,187
...who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

856
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:38,902
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

857
01:17:39,152 --> 01:17:42,447
...only to escape and join the police...

858
01:17:42,697 --> 01:17:45,909
...in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

859
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,286
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

860
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:51,498
What are you talking about?

861
01:17:51,706 --> 01:17:55,877
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

862
01:17:56,086 --> 01:17:57,170
He's lying!

863
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,713
Shoot him!

864
01:18:01,883 --> 01:18:04,969
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

865
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:09,224
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

866
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,315
Boy, that's really on there!

867
01:18:17,857 --> 01:18:19,567
But tell me this:

868
01:18:19,776 --> 01:18:21,361
Would a real woman...

869
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,821
...be missing these?

870
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,163
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

871
01:18:32,705 --> 01:18:34,540
But I doubt very much...

872
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:38,795
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

873
01:18:39,045 --> 01:18:40,379
...to get rid of...

874
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,672
...big old...

875
01:18:41,881 --> 01:18:43,508
...Mr. Knish!

876
01:18:51,432 --> 01:18:52,850
Oh, boy!

877
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,104
Come here.

878
01:18:57,939 --> 01:19:00,775
Would you excuse me for just one second?

879
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:10,785
Ladies and gentlemen...

880
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:14,288
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

881
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:17,249
...brought new evidence to my attention.

882
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,501
Now...

883
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:22,755
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

884
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,841
...criminal investigator can be wrong.

885
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:28,135
But if I am mistaken...

886
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:31,472
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

887
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:34,016
...as she claims to be...

888
01:19:34,266 --> 01:19:35,434
...then, my friend...

889
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:40,272
...she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!

890
01:19:41,815 --> 01:19:44,109
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

891
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:46,779
He found Captain Winkie!

892
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:57,122
Good night!

893
01:19:57,331 --> 01:20:00,876
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

894
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:07,925
Die, animal boy!

895
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:10,052
Quick decision.

896
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:33,617
Loser!

897
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:42,000
You have any more gum?

898
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,546
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

899
01:20:47,339 --> 01:20:49,966
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

900

909
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:08,044

Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

911
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:16,260
Yeah? Blow me!

912
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,305
