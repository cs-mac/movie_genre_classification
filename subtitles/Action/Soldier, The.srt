1
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,417
Look at me. Calm down.

2
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,168
Calm down.

3
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,959
What happened to the others?

4
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:48,667
Look at me.

5
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:51,584
Fucking dead!
The whole fucking platoon!

6
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,210
The Sarge totally lost it, went nuts!
Killed everyone!

7
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,667
Get off me! Let me go!

8
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,335
They're all dead!
All fucking gone!

9
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,667
You son of a bitch!

10
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,001
Let's get the fuck out of here!

11
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,459
No response at the village.

12
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,918
Luc, come on, man, come on.

13
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,751
Sarge?

14
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:07,084
What the hell happened here?

15
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,626
They wouldn't listen.

16
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,126
The village was cleared.
These people are innocent.

17
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:28,501
They're all fucking traitors.

18
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,542
You turn around and
they stab you in the back.

19
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,626
Hey, Sarge.

20
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:39,375
My tour is up.
I just want to go home.

21
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:41,959
Come on. Let's go home.

22
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,417
Let's go.

23
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,751
Just like the others.
You just want to leave.

24
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,626
Like none of this shit ever happened?

25
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,501
It happened!
And it doesn't just go away.

26
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,626
You just can't walk away.
Do you hear me?

27
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,126
Do you hear me?

28
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:15,918
You're a traitor too,
aren't you, farm boy?

29
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,584
No.

30
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,584
Prove it.

31
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,501
Kill her!

32
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,751
Kill that motherfucking traitor.

33
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,209
That's an order!

34
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,043
Get up. Come on!

35
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,043
Come on!

36
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,834
Come on.

37
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,709
Run!

38
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,292
Run!

39
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,751
No!

40
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,501
You've got four minutes!
Four minutes!

41
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,751
- OK, next.
- Four more.

42
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,417
- I can't find his tags.
- Excuse me, sir.

43
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,167
All right, here we go.

44
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,167
What the...?

45
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,250
Jesus Christ.

46
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,709
Nice touch. I'd hate to be the poor
schmuck who has to explain this shit

47
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,834
back home to Ma and Pa.

48
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,667
Sir, how do we write this one up?

49
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,626
I mean,
what do we say happened here?

50
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,334
Nothing.
Nothing happened here at all.

51
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:55,626
MIA. We didn't find anyone.
Do you understand me?

52
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,250
What,
they're gonna call this MIA?

53
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
Lincoln, this is Eagle. Come in.

54
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,959
I've got a code zebra.
Can you copy?

55
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,918
Only a few hours ago.
At least ten bodies.

56
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:08,459
Yes, sir.

57
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,167
- Pack 'em in ice.
- We're moving out.

58
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,250
Great.

59
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,042
Ice.

60
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,334
Let's move it, move it, move it!
Let's go, go, go!

61
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,334
All right.
How's the picture?

62
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,751
- Pretty ugly-
- Very funny.

63
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,334
Very funny.

64
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,751
I need a ladder.

65
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,958
Can you see me?
How's my hair?

66
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,417
Let's go.

67
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,833
- Somebody my size. Yeah.
- Systems check.

68
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,917
Next

69
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,083
- How's the focus?
- All right.

70
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,833
Good. Let's go.

71
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,250
OK, brother, go.

72
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,875
All right, so we got 'em all.

73
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,958
We don't have much time.

74
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,125
- Position seven, status.
- They're bringing the next one out.

75
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,542
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

76
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:32,791
I'll have a statement for you
later on, OK? Thank you.

77
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,709
- Colonel, they killed another hostage.
- Current status.

78
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,917
We can't even take one down.
They're linked to an intercom.

79
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
They're in the water.

80
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,417
Colonel, where'd you drop 'em off?

81
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:03,334
- About a mile and a half away.
- A mile and a half? We got 13 minutes.

82
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,542
Come on! Yo!

83
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,667
Hold on a minute. Hold on.

84
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,417
Hi. I'm with the press - CNA.

85
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,167
- They're waiting for me.
- Right through there.

86
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,250
- I'm canceling the remote.
- Charles, will you relax?

87
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:23,125
- We have to go live in one minute.
- He's absolutely gonna kill me.

88
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,501
Look out.
Hey, where are you going?

89
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,584
See? There she is.

90
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,501
- I know. I'm running a little late.
- A little?

91
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,375
- That traffic killed me.
- Veronica, we're live in 20.

92
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,791
Where were you?
I called your hotel for hours.

93
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,167
- Your mark?
- I got my mark.

94
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,042
- Come on.
- We're on the satellite.

95
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,833
- Glasses.
- Glasses.

96
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,334
Mike.

97
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,000
Mike. OK.

98
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,334
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Nice shoes.

99
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,750
- No feet.
- Stop screwing around. Come on.

100
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,666
- ...three...
- Cigarette.

101
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,875
And live.

102
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,542
With nearly 30 hostages held
inside the power station

103
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:01,375
the gunmen claim
they will not release any prisoners

104
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,209
until their comrades are released
from federal US penitentiaries.

105
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,209
- Checkpoint two, all clear.
- Checkpoint three, all clear.

106
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,209
Keep your eyes open.

107
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,833
Shut up!

108
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,417
I said shut up!

109
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,459
Hey, do as you're told
and you won't get hurt.

110
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,459
Quiet down.

111
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,209
Checkpoint three, all clear.

112
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,167
- They're at the tower.
- We need a unit.

113
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,875
A mile and a half
in under four minutes?

114
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,125
They're eight seconds behind schedule.

115
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,875
This is Veronica Roberts
reporting live for CNA.

116
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,958
- And we're out.
- See? What'd I tell you? No problem.

117
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,875
No problem? This network
does not revolve around you.

118
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,833
Are you saying
I'm not the center of the universe?

119
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,833
- Don't crack wise with me.
- Come on, lighten up, Charles.

120
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,833
I don't play by your rules,
but I always get you the story.

121
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:10,750
You think just because you broke
a few stories that you're indispensable.

122
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,917
I had a chat with the network today.
Know what, Ronnie?

123
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,583
No, what, Chuck?

124
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,666
You're fired.

125
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,167
They're entering the drain-off tunnels.

126
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,209
GR13, take aim and hold fire.

127
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:41,501
- Checkpoint one, all clear.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

128
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,250
GR44 is in position.
Take aim. Fire.

129
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,334
Fire.

130
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,583
Move in and secure the objective.

131
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,501
Clear that image up.

132
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,791
Clear it.

133
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,750
Got it.

134
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,583
Interceptors are
secured and powered.

135
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,209
- Begin playback.
- Playing back.

136
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:19,375
- Rolling.
- Checkpoint one, all clear.

137
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,917
Checkpoint two, all clear.

138
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,459
Checkpoint three, all clear.

139
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,833
They're buying it.

140
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,125
Who the hell are these guys?

141
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,334
- OK, OK. Here we go, here we go.
- Terminate objectives.

142
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,583
Checkpoint three, all clear.

143
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,666
Activate interceptors now.

144
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,375
- Homeboy's starting to like this shit.
- Don't be ridiculous.

145
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,666
Continue playback.

146
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,459
Checkpoint three, all clear.

147
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,209
- We're inside.
- Begin phase two.

148
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,125
Phase two initiated.

149
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,708
- Look at this guy.
- How the hell did he...?

150
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,875
- Hold it there, buddy!
- Hey! Hold it, pal.

151
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,292
Two gunmen, semiautomatic,

152
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,500
fully loaded,
main target to rear,

153
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,417
loaded pistol
and explosives detonator.

154
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,167
Shoot him!

155
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:19,167
You are cleared.
I repeat: You are cleared to proceed.

156
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,083
GR13. All clear.

157
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,833
No injuries. Gentlemen,
I think everybody's OK.

158
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:04,583
- Arizona team.
- GR44, status report.

159
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,292
GR44, do you read me?

160
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,875
- Problem?
- He's not responding.

161
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,334
Try another frequency.

162
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,000
GR44, status report, now.

163
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,583
Kill the motherfucking traitor.

164
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,416
That's an order!

165
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,875
GR44, respond!

166
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Colonel Perry,
how many UniSols were injured?

167
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,666
Who are these guys?

168
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,167
I will address your questions
accordingly.

169
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,791
This marks the third successful mission
for the universal soldiers,

170
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:48,250
again without any casualties
and without any injuries.

171
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,500
As to the identity of the UniSols,
that remains classified.

172
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,958
- But, Colonel...
- These men have families,

173
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,666
and I will not do anything
to jeopardize their lives.

174
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,708
Now, excuse me. I have other matters
to attend to. Thank you.

175
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,167
Lieutenant, could I have
a statement, please?

176
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,917
There will be a complete briefing
this evening.

177
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,958
We can't shoot these guys.
We need pictures.

178
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:12,917
Lieutenant, please,
just one statement. Lieutenant!

179
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,209
Huey...

180
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,958
- I've got an idea.
- No, you don't.

181
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,291
- Yeah, I do.
- I hate when you do this.

182
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:39,167
Ronnie, what are you doing?
This is too close.

183
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,250
They're gonna see us.

184
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,000
We shouldn't be here.

185
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,666
All these guards.
They must still be in there.

186
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,750
Yeah.

187
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,209
- You getting this?
- They've got one hell of a mobile home.

188
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:17,249
They're turning blue.
Lowering to final stage...

189
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,249
at 60 sub zero.

190
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,333
- He just froze up. We can't tell why.
- What do you mean, "froze up"?

191
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,583
At the end of the mission,
he became completely unresponsive.

192
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,083
- Did he overheat?
- Colonel, he hardly broke a sweat.

193
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,167
GR44.

194
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,083
Why did you not respond?

195
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,000
What happened?

196
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,042
- Innocent.
- Innocent?

197
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,958
What do you mean by "innocent"?

198
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,541
The village was cleared.

199
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,833
The girl was innocent, Sarge.

200
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,917
Sarge?
Who the hell's he talking about?

201
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,291
That could be an old memory.

202
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,666
We should take him out of the program,
run some tests on him

203
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,875
and find out what's going on
in his head.

204
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,958
- GR44 stays with the program.
- But, Colonel...

205
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:13,249
He just got a little mixed-up.
Just give him the serum.

206
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,083
OK, guys. Memory clearance.

207
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,458
Take your positions.

208
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,249
Activate injection.

209
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,958
They're moving something else
onto the tarmac.

210
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:53,708
- We won't get anything from out here.
- Are you nuts?

211
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,000
It's a classified military operation.

212
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,583
You won't get
within ten yards of that truck.

213
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,666
I'll be right back.

214
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,208
You were confused.

215
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,750
I was confused.

216
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,583
You must follow orders
at all times.

217
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,042
I must follow my orders.

218
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:20,917
- He's fine.
- Well, if you say so.

219
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,416
You're in charge.

220
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,042
Here we go.

221
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,833
This looks pretty bad.

222
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,791
Looks pretty bad.

223
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:47,666
As soon as the flotation chamber
is filled, we'll have to put him in.

224
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,917
Great.

225
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,541
Why do I always have to do this part?
I hate this part.

226
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:04,042
Hey, Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!
Can I get a little help on this?

227
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,958
Jesus.
No casualties or injuries, huh?

228
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,500
Power up the cooling generators
on the flotation chamber.

229
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,583
You got it.

230
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,124
- He's ready.
- Bring him in.

231
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,208
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

232
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,458
Prepare for flotation chamber entry.

233
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,291
Colonel, we've spotted an intruder.

234
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,500
Who the fuck is that?

235
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,625
She's taking pictures.

236
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,707
Huey!

237
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,041
Shit. What the hell
has she done this time?

238
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,124
Start the car!

239
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,208
I think now would be
a good time to leave, Huey.

240
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,166
- What'd you get?
- Redemption.

241
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:22,791
Let's get outta here.

242
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Do you think we lost 'em?

243
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,833
How you doing?

244
00:25:57,124 --> 00:26:00,999
Veronica Roberts.
CNA.

245
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,541
You wanna help me out?

246
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,041
Thank you.

247
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:13,416
Hey, easy.
Take it easy, man.

248
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,917
Let go of me!

249
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:21,082
- Huey...
- OK, OK.

250
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,291
You all right?

251
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:29,708
OK, they got 'em.
Bingo.

252
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,999
I want to speak to
someone in charge.

253
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:39,082
- You guys speak English?
- Awaiting instructions.

254
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:43,166
Tell them to find that film
and bring those civilians back to base.

255
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,957
I'm sure we can handle
this whole situation

256
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,333
if I could make a phone call.

257
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:52,208
- What's wrong with these guys?
- GR13, get the film and return to base.

258
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,291
The film.

259
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,291
Fellas, I don't know where...

260
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,416
Hey, she didn't do anything.

261
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,874
Christ! GR13, cease fire!
Cease fire!

262
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,916
Do you read me?
Cease fire! I repeat...

263
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,999
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

264
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:12,500
That's an order!

265
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,374
No! Let go of me!

266
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,916
GR86, visual.

267
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,166
What the fuck is he doing?

268
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,750
Stop the girl.
Shoot if you have to.

269
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,750
GR44, stop the car.

270
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,416
That is an order.

271
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,166
- He stopped the car.
- Cease fire. Cease fire.

272
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,832
What the hell are you doing?

273
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,999
Come on! Get out of here!

274
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:56,500
Go! Jesus Christ,
they'll kill us!

275
00:27:57,082 --> 00:28:00,916
GR44, turn the car around.

276
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,291
- Are you deaf?
- You are simply confused.

277
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,957
I'm confused.

278
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,500
What are you talking about, man?
Let's go. Hit it!

279
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,291
Do not listen to her.

280
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:13,333
What the hell is that thing?

281
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,874
Can you hear me?

282
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:17,999
Will you stop fucking...
Stupid piece of shit!

283
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:20,333
Shit! The bitch cut me off.

284
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,625
Go!

285
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,708
I must follow orders.

286
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,166
Bullshit. Hit the road!

287
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,832
Shit!

288
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,666
Woodward,
do something, will you?

289
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,790
Traitor.

290
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:45,166
He didn't do anything.

291
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:49,790
Well, they're not getting away
with this shit, I swear to God.

292
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,708
- You ready?
- Just about.

293
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,832
We have to take him out of the loop.
He shot a man.

294
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,374
Don't tell me what to do.

295
00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:01,666
Right now I need every soldier I've got.
We're going after them.

296
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,832
Colonel Perry.

297
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,666
We killed an innocent man.

298
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,999
What do you suggest
we do, Woodward?

299
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,832
Let that reporter run off
with one of our UniSols?

300
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,416
We can't just cover this up.

301
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,749
We have a moral obligation
to tell the truth about this.

302
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:21,874
I thought you were more clever
than that, Woodward.

303
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:25,166
This whole goddamn program
is off the shelf.

304
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:28,291
Do you really think
those wimps at the Pentagon

305
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:31,832
would allow the regeneration
of dead soldiers?

306
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,790
American soldiers?

307
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:38,249
I don't think I can be
a part of this anymore.

308
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:42,291
If this is uncovered now,
we're all going to jail.

309
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:44,874
Do I make myself clear?

310
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:54,500
Why did you do that?
Why did you help me out like that?

311
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:58,416
My tour is up.
Just want to go home.

312
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,707
But I can't until you're safe.

313
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,790
What do you mean?

314
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,957
My God. You've been shot.

315
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:12,957
Jesus. Jesus, we gotta stop
the bleeding.

316
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:16,625
Jesus Christ,
it's gotta hurt you, man.

317
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,041
The bleeding has stopped.

318
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,707
Get in here.
Secure your positions.

319
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:38,749
All right, secure and lock!

320
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,333
What? Why are we stopping now?
What happened?

321
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,625
Out of gas.

322
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,916
You're out of gas.
Why not?

323
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:13,249
Shit.

324
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,999
God.

325
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:31,166
Oh, God.

326
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:33,874
Tracking system activated,
and we're in business.

327
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:37,749
We've picked 'em up moving due east
seven miles ahead of us.

328
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,583
Estimated time of interception.

329
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,124
- Four minutes.
- Four minutes and marking.

330
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,082
How you doing?

331
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:07,374
You must be pretty tired
after all that pushing and stuff.

332
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,790
Well, I'm gonna go...
I'll be right back, all right?

333
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:16,249
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go make a phone call.

334
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,333
D'you mind?

335
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:22,416
OK? OK.

336
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,582
OK.

337
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:35,124
Change.

338
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:38,166
OK. All right.

339
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:52,999
- I need some gas.
- Ran out of gas yesterday.

340
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,916
Refueling truck
will be here in the morning.

341
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:00,874
You wanna rent a roo.... room?

342
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,500
Nice outfit.

343
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,082
Shit.

344
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,707
Hey, pal,
you don't look so good.

345
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,249
I need to cool down.

346
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,540
Well, all our rooms
all have air conditioning.

347
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,291
Got some with waterbeds.

348
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:25,624
The pay phone's out.
Can I use your phone?

349
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:29,166
All our rooms all have telephones, too.
Only $50 a night.

350
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:31,874
No, look. I don't need a room,
I need a phone.

351
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:37,208
- What about this one?
- Sorry. That's for employees only.

352
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:58,624
Since there's the two of you,
that's called double occupancy.

353
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:00,582
That's another $10. Yeah.

354
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,082
Yeah, OK. Great.

355
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:08,665
And a matter of
a small $20 security deposit.

356
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:12,665
- Of course. $20. Here you are.
- Have a nice stay.

357
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:14,749
Great.

358
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:29,916
Great. Maybe there's already
something on the news.

359
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:58,333
Commence UniSol deployment.

360
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:01,916
B and C teams,
take supporting positions.

361
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:09,166
GR13, seek and destroy local
communication lines in target area.

362
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,665
And one prays for
the expedient, concise handling

363
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,540
of the terrorist situation.

364
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:21,832
In a related story, only hours
after the rescue at McKinley Dam,

365
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,374
news reporters become news makers.

366
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,499
Reporting live from the scene,
Chris Garfield.

367
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:30,749
In a surprising development,
a CNA cameraman, Huey Taylor,

368
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:34,333
was shot and killed in a motel room
in neighboring Eagle Rock City.

369
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:38,166
Witnesses allege that Veronica
Roberts, a CNA correspondent,

370
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:40,208
shot him after an apparent argument.

371
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,999
Cocaine and other narcotics
were found at the scene.

372
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,082
No way.

373
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,333
No way.

374
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,041
I don't believe this.

375
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,832
They won't get away with this.
This is crazy.

376
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,874
You must return to your room.

377
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:57,874
I mean, for crying out loud...

378
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:00,082
Mother, come here.

379
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,999
There has got to be a phone that works
in this godforsaken place.

380
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:07,249
- This area is not secure.
- You know, why don't you...

381
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:10,624
What are you doing?

382
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:13,999
It's not safe for you out here.

383
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,166
Where are your clothes?

384
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,249
I have to...

385
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:21,249
I have to cool down.

386
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:32,082
My God. You're burning up.

387
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:41,540
I need ice.

388
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,373
OK. OK.

389
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Shame on you.

390
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,916
GR13, continue advance.

391
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,999
Target in center of structure.

392
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,999
What the devil's she doing
with all that ice?

393
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:08,832
Maybe I should call the police.

394
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:13,665
I've heard of cold showers before,
but this is just ridiculous.

395
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:15,749
How you doing?

396
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,790
I got all the ice that I could.

397
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,832
You OK?

398
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:25,665
How's your...?

399
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,749
Your wound.

400
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:39,166
It's... It's healing.

401
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:43,999
I'm... I'm gonna make
that phone call and...

402
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:46,540
I'll call a doctor or...

403
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,582
something.

404
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,999
Heat and infrared check.

405
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,998
Munitions and firearms identifier
powered and working.

406
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,790
Munitions and firearms identifier
powered and working.

407
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,332
- Don't even start with me, all right?
- Hey.

408
00:37:58,415 --> 00:38:01,332
- And take this lock off. No, I will.
- Hey!

409
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,041
Hey, lady,
what are you doing with the phone?

410
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:06,999
- You know how much these cost?
- Shut up.

411
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:09,499
- You got a lot of nerve.
- Will you shut up?

412
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,624
This one doesn't work either.

413
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,332
Women just don't know
how to use a phone.

414
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,415
You killed it!

415
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:21,957
This is coming out of
your security deposit.

416
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:24,166
Goddamn it.

417
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:26,499
He's got her in sight.

418
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:31,248
GR13 has a lock on the girl.
What do you want me to do?

419
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:35,790
- Tell him to wait till they're together.
- GR13, hold fire. Maintain surveillance.

420
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:56,499
<i>Now, back to
Nixon and the War Years, Part Seven.</i>

421
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:59,832
We will keep America
the strongest nation in the world,

422
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:03,874
and we will couple that strength
with firm diplomacy.

423
00:39:03,957 --> 00:39:06,124
No apologies, no regrets.

424
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:12,373
There was no question about that
because, as you know, when I resigned,

425
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:15,540
later, President Ford issued a pardon.

426
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:17,957
When I accepted the pardon,

427
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:22,165
in that I made it very clear
that I regretted what had happened,

428
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:26,290
and it was, in effect,
an apology for what had happened...

429
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:28,790
I want that place
completely surrounded.

430
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:32,749
GR86 and 61, take positions
at the rear of the motel.

431
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,457
On the war in Vietnam...

432
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,790
How are you feeling?

433
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:42,499
The war is over.

434
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:43,916
Maybe not.

435
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:48,665
All focus to visual.
Powering alternate scanning devices.

436
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:51,123
Motion detectors locked in.

437
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:56,248
Something weird is going on. None
of the phones in this entire hotel work.

438
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,123
There hasn't been a storm.

439
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,207
We got 'em
in the second room now.

440
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,540
You'd better duck and cover.

441
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:37,248
- Follow me.
- OK.

442
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:05,499
The last wall is solid concrete.
He's not going anywhere.

443
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,165
I think we got him trapped.

444
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:14,332
Well, go ahead. Knock it down.

445
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,207
What?

446
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:19,916
Get down.

447
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,499
Soldiers, move in.

448
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,499
Where in the hell is he?

449
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:51,332
- I think we lost him.
- That's impossible.

450
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:55,582
Garth, get back to your station and
get me some tracking, for Christ's sake.

451
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:00,665
You have a car?

452
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:03,207
- Give me the keys.
- Tell him to hurry.

453
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,790
Hurry-

454
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,123
You got 'em?

455
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,916
- Thank you.
- Good.

456
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:12,665
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

457
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:17,332
I am so, so sorry. I had nothing
to do with this. Really. I had no idea.

458
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,248
- They're leaving the motel.
- Damn it.

459
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,248
Come on, Woodward.
I need you out here.

460
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:57,582
Way to go, Garth.

461
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,790
$20 security deposit, huh?

462
00:43:12,832 --> 00:43:14,707
Woodward.

463
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,207
He's trying to cool himself.

464
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,373
Are you sure
they're not following us?

465
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:38,207
No.

466
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,457
You're such a comfort.

467
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,081
Buckle up.

468
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:44,832
- I'm fine.
- It's for your safety.

469
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,165
How can you be so damn calm?

470
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:50,790
Your buddies just shot enough ammo
at us to destroy Eastern Europe,

471
00:43:50,873 --> 00:43:55,165
and you're sitting here bitching
at me about a goddamn seat belt?

472
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:59,165
All right, all right, all right.
Here we go. All right?

473
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:00,665
I'm all buckled up.

474
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:03,790
All right, look, Mr. Top Secret.

475
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:07,248
I want some answers, OK?

476
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:13,332
I mean, first of all, you push a car
faster than my mother drives, OK?

477
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,790
You use ice
like other people use band-aids,

478
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:18,290
and then you run through walls.

479
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:21,998
Now, I'm sorry,
but this is not normal human behavior.

480
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:24,582
Now, just who the hell are you?

481
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:28,956
Where are you from, anyway?
France or Canada or...

482
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,873
I figured you gotta be French
or something because of your accent.

483
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:34,956
What accent?

484
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:39,332
All right, look.
You got a family? You got friends?

485
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:43,123
Is there a Mrs. 44
waiting for you someplace?

486
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:46,540
I mean, are you avoiding my questions,
or don't you know?

487
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:07,749
What the hell
did they do to you?

488
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,789
I don't know.

489
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,540
But I'm going to find out.

490
00:45:46,582 --> 00:45:49,499
Hey, lady.
No smoking around the pumps.

491
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:50,789
I'm sorry.

492
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,165
Come on. Would you quit
pulling on my arm? It hurts.

493
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:56,373
- Park the car.
- Park the...?

494
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,207
Let's go.

495
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,831
Park the car?

496
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:02,415
- I need some help.
- You need some help?

497
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:04,665
- I can't help you with this.
- Get in.

498
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:06,123
Come on!

499
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:08,207
What are you doing?

500
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:14,165
Come on, man.
Not this again?

501
00:46:14,248 --> 00:46:15,831
Is this necessary?

502
00:46:15,915 --> 00:46:18,165
At least
leave your pants on this time.

503
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:21,165
Great. Just great.

504
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:23,665
There must be
a tracking device on me.

505
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,831
What do you want me
to do about it?

506
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:28,332
Look for something unusual.

507
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:31,499
Something hard.

508
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:35,915
All right.

509
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:43,081
You stay in shape, don't you?

510
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:46,789
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing!

511
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:49,165
What do you mean, park your car?

512
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:51,831
You never heard of
valet parking?

513
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:54,457
Valet. Do I look
like a valet?

514
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,789
What does this look like?
Beverly Hills?

515
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:59,207
Is that supposed to be there?

516
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,789
Yes. Yeah, it is.
It's very normal.

517
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
Keep going.

518
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:09,081
Right.

519
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,207
Update informational
computer scanning system.

520
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,165
They've stopped up ahead
at a single-story structure.

521
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:23,248
I think I found something,
right here on the back of your leg.

522
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:31,998
- Cut it out.
- Cut it out?

523
00:47:33,123 --> 00:47:36,582
Wait a minute. I can't cut it out.
I'm not gonna cut you.

524
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,499
Oh, God!

525
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:49,290
Shit! Shit!

526
00:47:49,373 --> 00:47:53,624
You best hurry up and get out of there.
I got a business to run here.

527
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,123
- Take it.
- What?

528
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:01,499
- Take it.
- Take it?

529
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:04,457
We don't have too much time.

530
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:08,540
God, this is so gross.

531
00:48:12,415 --> 00:48:15,290
Oh, God, this is so gross.

532
00:48:15,373 --> 00:48:18,499
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

533
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,831
Good.

534
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,332
I gotta lie down.

535
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:48,207
I want a complete scan
of the entire area.

536
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:53,165
Enabling infrared.

537
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:56,165
- That's his car.
- Scanning for body heat.

538
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:57,540
Got it.

539
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:58,956
Arms.

540
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,332
Pistol, fully loaded. Desert Eagle,
semiautomatic. That's him.

541
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:05,081
Motions and heat scan.
Follow tracking.

542
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:06,789
Flanking advance pattern.

543
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:11,165
Three teams:
north, east, south.

544
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,081
Converge on my command.

545
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:14,748
Team advance.

546
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,332
Surround target.

547
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:21,207
Teams east and south,
prepare for break and ram.

548
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:33,081
Prepare for break and ram.
Full charge.

549
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:36,123
- OK, guys, move in.
- Full charge.

550
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:43,290
No, no! He tricked us!

551
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:44,664
Hold on!

552
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:50,165
Move out!
All UniSols, retreat immediately!

553
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:54,248
Evacuate! Let's go!
Get out of there!

554
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:57,081
Take cover!

555
00:50:02,915 --> 00:50:04,332
What the hell was that?

556
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:14,956
Oh, my God.

557
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,789
They're on fire.

558
00:50:17,873 --> 00:50:21,123
Portable coolant.
Portable coolant, quick!

559
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:36,664
Put him out! Get him out!
Extinguishers! Woodward, Garth!

560
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:39,081
Garth! Get over here!
Get this guy.

561
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:43,373
- Quick! Quick! Quick!
- GR74. Get GR14.

562
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:45,831
Over here, Woodward!
Get him down.

563
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:49,664
Damn you! Put him out, I said!

564
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:54,040
Get those coolants ready!
Get that truck operating!

565
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,415
Woodward, get 'em over here!

566
00:51:02,915 --> 00:51:04,915
Hurry UP-

567
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:07,539
Yes, Sarge.

568
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:14,748
Whoa.

569
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:21,040
Get over here! Get GR74!

570
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,207
Get him out!
Put that coolant on him!

571
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,623
We need more extinguishers!

572
00:51:26,706 --> 00:51:28,915
Got it. Let's go!

573
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:31,373
Come on, hurry!

574
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:36,081
Well, here I go again.
I'm outta here.

575
00:51:43,748 --> 00:51:48,207
- We're gonna lose these two, Colonel.
- $250 million apiece, we can't lose any.

576
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:51,498
- Buckle up.
- Seat belt, right. OK, go.

577
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,748
Jesus. He should've buckled up.

578
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,748
He's getting up. Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

579
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:52,955
Shit! They're pulling the plug.
Pack it up. We're heading home.

580
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:53,331
Shit! They're pulling the plug.
Pack it up. We're heading home.

581
00:52:53,414 --> 00:52:55,998
- Everybody, back into the truck.
- Let's move it!

582
00:52:56,081 --> 00:52:58,498
Woodward, what the hell
are you doing?

583
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:01,331
Yes, it's ice!
Get back in the truck!

584
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:03,623
Pack it up!

585
00:53:08,123 --> 00:53:10,664
Get back into the truck, GR13.

586
00:53:10,748 --> 00:53:12,956
The mission is canceled.

587
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:18,789
GR13

588
00:53:20,372 --> 00:53:22,623
I said it's over.

589
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:27,207
My name is
Sergeant Andrew Scott.

590
00:53:58,081 --> 00:53:59,498
He's just a mess.

591
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:03,372
Lieutenant, could you contact Colonel
Perry? We'd like him back in here.

592
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:04,915
Thank you.

593
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:08,998
You're wasting your time.

594
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,456
- He can't hear you.
- Jesus!

595
00:54:14,372 --> 00:54:17,331
I've relieved Colonel Perry
of his command.

596
00:54:17,414 --> 00:54:20,081
GR13, this mission
has been canceled.

597
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:23,831
I order you back
to the cooling chamber, now!

598
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:25,915
Orders?

599
00:54:27,915 --> 00:54:30,372
I'm giving the orders
from now on.

600
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:33,498
We have a mission to complete.

601
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
Any questions?

602
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:02,040
- Something to drink?
- Yeah. I'll just have coffee.

603
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:04,165
OK. You?

604
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:11,165
Brenda?

605
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:14,123
Yes, Joe?

606
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:18,789
You want something to drink?

607
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:19,872
Yeah? OK.

608
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:22,372
He'll have a soda pop.

609
00:55:22,456 --> 00:55:23,456
Great.

610
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:26,040
- He's not gonna make it.
- Shut up. He'll hear you.

611
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,122
Dr. Haines...

612
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:31,331
Look, if he thinks that we failed,
he's gonna kill us both.

613
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:36,372
You just keep working.
If he asks anything, just stall him.

614
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,915
What's he doing?

615
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,789
Overloading on muscle enhancers.

616
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:52,040
- He's making himself stronger.
- Great. That's just what we need.

617
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:58,789
You know, I feel like
I'm back in high school again.

618
00:55:58,873 --> 00:56:02,498
I can't make heads or tails
out of any of this stuff.

619
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:05,247
But apparently,
whatever they've done to you,

620
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:07,831
it's been done on a genetic level.

621
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:10,581
"The Surgeon General has warned

622
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:14,539
that cigarettes could be hazardous
to your health."

623
00:56:14,623 --> 00:56:18,623
Yeah, well,
don't believe everything you read.

624
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:25,164
- Hey. That is my last pack.
- Are you ready to order?

625
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:28,372
Yeah. Just bring us
two of your specials.

626
00:56:29,873 --> 00:56:33,623
Now look, they constantly refer to
a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

627
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:35,331
Do you recognize that name?

628
00:56:35,414 --> 00:56:37,748
No?

629
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:40,081
Nothing.

630
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:42,873
I think I saw a number
in here somewhere.

631
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:45,456
Do you think you can help me?

632
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:48,372
Well, it's definitely worth a shot.

633
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,956
- What?
- Why are you doing all this for me?

634
00:57:01,122 --> 00:57:03,122
I'm not. All right?

635
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,664
I'm not doing all this for you.
I'm doing it for me.

636
00:57:07,748 --> 00:57:12,289
You may not realize this yet,
but you are one hell of a story.

637
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:19,915
I wouldn't worry. When the truth comes
out, they'll probably make you a hero.

638
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,040
Here we go. "CG."
Christopher Gregor.

639
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:34,122
Look, I'm gonna go check this out. You
stay here and wait for the specials, OK?

640
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:38,998
- Do you have a phone?
- Out there.

641
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,206
- Thanks.
- Here's the special.

642
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,206
Sergeant Scott?

643
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:33,789
Could I have a word with you?

644
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:36,080
I'm all ears.

645
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:43,122
Your thermal monitor.
It's registering hot.

646
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:54,789
Nap time.

647
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,331
Are you nuts?

648
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:08,997
Why'd you tell him that?

649
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,414
Quadruple his serum.

650
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:15,789
What?

651
00:59:16,372 --> 00:59:18,372
I'm going inside.

652
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,164
When he sits down,
I'll give you a signal.

653
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:27,039
You increase the pressure

654
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:32,122
and I'll engage the injection device
on the arm of his chair.

655
00:59:38,414 --> 00:59:40,664
No, no, no.

656
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:43,664
It'll look better if I go.

657
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:29,498
- Is there a problem, medic?
- I'm just checking the injection device.

658
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:32,206
- Was it broken?
- It's making some strange noises.

659
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:37,623
- I just wanted to make an adjustment.
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

660
01:00:39,914 --> 01:00:42,664
Let's see if it still works.

661
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,164
Dr. Haines!

662
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:49,206
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you ready?

663
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:52,456
- It's memory clearance time.
- Stop it! No!

664
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:55,080
- Stop it! You're gonna kill him!
- Dr. Haines!

665
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:57,164
Let him go!

666
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:01,080
Don't. Stop it.

667
01:01:01,164 --> 01:01:05,164
- Stop it!
- Get off me! Get off me!

668
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:22,748
Shit. A fax.

669
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,955
Hey, you got enough money
to pay for all this?

670
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,664
You know, money? Cash?

671
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:53,748
Dollars? Dinero?

672
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,623
Hank!

673
01:02:01,706 --> 01:02:03,080
Yeah?

674
01:02:03,164 --> 01:02:05,498
We got ourselves a deadbeat
back here.

675
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:08,748
- What?
- He can't pay.

676
01:02:09,997 --> 01:02:12,289
Move it, Brenda.

677
01:02:12,372 --> 01:02:16,997
Hey, punk, I been slaving
all day making that slop.

678
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:21,164
- The food is good.
- Fuckin' A it is.

679
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:25,581
The question is:
How are you going to pay for it?

680
01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:29,997
I don't know.

681
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,414
You don't know.
Ain't that cute.

682
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,080
I'm gonna bust your head, punk.

683
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:37,331
I don't want to hurt you.

684
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:41,289
Me? You don't want
to hurt Hank?

685
01:03:08,414 --> 01:03:10,664
I just want to eat.

686
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:13,164
- Operator.
- Yeah, operator. A local number.

687
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,705
Prefix KL5.
Dr. Christopher Gregor.

688
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,955
Hey, look,
you ugly son of a bitch!

689
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:45,164
Better put that down, you son of a bitch,
'cause now I'm gonna make you bleed!

690
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:47,122
- May I help you?
- Veteran's Hospital?

691
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:50,914
- Great. Operator, where exactly is that?
- 1087 Clinton Avenue.

692
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:53,914
Clinton. Wonderful.
Thank you very much.

693
01:04:00,914 --> 01:04:02,663
Shit.

694
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:21,331
How was lunch?

695
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:04,164
I'm looking for a deserter.

696
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:07,331
He's traveling
with a female POW.

697
01:05:07,414 --> 01:05:09,788
Beat it, asshole.

698
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:14,914
Nice necklace. I got one just like it
made out of noses.

699
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:26,580
Now, they're in this white-and-yellow
Buick with no front or rear window.

700
01:05:27,997 --> 01:05:30,622
Does that refresh your memory?

701
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,331
GR74

702
01:05:45,414 --> 01:05:48,788
Sergeant Scott
has issued an order.

703
01:05:48,872 --> 01:05:52,122
- Will you obey that order?
- Yes, sir.

704
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,663
He would like for you
to hold this for 30 seconds

705
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,747
and then drop it.

706
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:11,498
One, two, three...

707
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,122
I know which way they went.

708
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:15,247
- You got a pencil?
- Sure.

709
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:17,580
By the way, I like your belt.
Can I have it?

710
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:21,663
25, 26...

711
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:41,414
Hey! Where's the freezer?

712
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:17,456
Can I help you?

713
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:19,788
Yes. We would like to speak
with Dr. Gregor.

714
01:07:19,872 --> 01:07:22,247
Do you have an appointment?

715
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,914
Yes. Yes, we do.

716
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,580
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

717
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:36,039
- Wait in there.
- OK. Thank you.

718
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,039
Oh, God.

719
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,206
Oh, man. I'd kill for
a cigarette right now.

720
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:54,164
You would kill someone
for a cigarette?

721
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:58,331
No. It's an expression.
You know, a figure of speech.

722
01:07:58,414 --> 01:08:01,872
I mean, I wouldn't actually
kill someone for a cigarette.

723
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:06,331
I might hurt 'em real bad at this point,
but I don't think I'd kill 'em.

724
01:08:10,164 --> 01:08:13,830
- Dr. Gregor, excuse me.
- Yes? What is it?

725
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:18,289
There's a young couple here to see you.
They say they have an appointment.

726
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:20,164
Appointment?

727
01:08:33,997 --> 01:08:34,997
Clear!

728
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:45,206
It's all right, Luc.
It's all right.

729
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,413
It's over.

730
01:08:57,622 --> 01:09:00,872
I... I saw it.

731
01:09:01,331 --> 01:09:04,164
I remember home.

732
01:09:04,247 --> 01:09:08,497
Is he all right? We need to get him into
the bathroom and cover him with ice.

733
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:13,206
I said stand to attention, private!
Get up!

734
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:26,872
Goddamn it! The whole
fucking platoon's dropping like flies!

735
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:32,914
What the hell
are you staring at?

736
01:09:32,997 --> 01:09:36,164
Do you have any idea
what it's like out there?

737
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:37,705
Do you?

738
01:09:37,788 --> 01:09:42,497
Well, I'm fighting this thing, man.
It's like kick ass or kiss ass.

739
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,538
And I'm busting heads.

740
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:49,330
It's the only way
to win this fucking war.

741
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:53,747
And these shitheads,

742
01:09:55,747 --> 01:09:59,330
these yellow, traitoring
motherfuckers,

743
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,788
they're everywhere.

744
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,663
And I,

745
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,371
Sergeant Andrew Scott
of the US Army,

746
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:25,122
I'm gonna teach 'em all.

747
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:27,622
- Hey, freeze!
- Get down!

748
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,663
Drop your weapons!

749
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:38,164
See?

750
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:42,580
They're everywhere.

751
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,705
How could you, a doctor,
be a party to this?

752
01:10:48,997 --> 01:10:51,788
I've been asking myself
that question for years.

753
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,705
Tell me how it worked.

754
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:56,164
By hyperaccelerating the bodies

755
01:10:56,246 --> 01:11:01,206
we discovered that we could
turn dead flesh into living tissue.

756
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:03,080
But to make the process work,

757
01:11:03,164 --> 01:11:05,997
the bodies ran
at dangerously high temperatures,

758
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,206
needed to be constantly cooled,

759
01:11:08,288 --> 01:11:11,622
the brain sedated, controlled.

760
01:11:11,705 --> 01:11:16,872
- Otherwise, it would eventually stroke.
- What are you saying, Doctor?

761
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:18,497
Dr. Gregor?

762
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,997
Excuse me.

763
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,580
Yes? What is it?

764
01:11:21,663 --> 01:11:23,997
There's something on the TV
you should see.

765
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,039
Thanks.

766
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,413
Officials believe Colonel Perry
was shot and killed early this morning.

767
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:36,830
Authorities are still looking for
reporter Veronica Roberts,

768
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:39,330
believed to be linked to the two deaths.

769
01:11:39,413 --> 01:11:41,288
They've set you up.

770
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:44,497
Closer to home, a robbery
at Hayes Supermarket turned deadly

771
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,080
when three armed men
entered the supermarket earlier today.

772
01:11:48,164 --> 01:11:50,497
The leader of the gang
was videotaped...

773
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,622
Regressive traumatic recall.

774
01:11:52,705 --> 01:11:53,997
What?

775
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,288
Trauma inflicted at the time of death.

776
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:59,747
See, in Luc's case,
he wanted to go home.

777
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:03,830
When he awoke as a UniSol,
he returned to that single emotion.

778
01:12:03,914 --> 01:12:09,164
As for Scott, he thinks he's still
in Vietnam fighting the insurgents.

779
01:12:09,246 --> 01:12:11,580
He doesn't realize he's alive.

780
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:13,163
He's not.

781
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:15,830
He's dead.

782
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,997
Just like me.

783
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,955
- Be sure to write.
- Now boarding, Los Angeles Express.

784
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:24,039
Now boarding.

785
01:12:24,705 --> 01:12:26,955
This is insane.

786
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:29,663
You heard the doctor.
You need medical help.

787
01:12:29,747 --> 01:12:34,163
I think you should turn yourself in and
get started on your treatments again.

788
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:37,497
- And then?
- Well, then we expose everything.

789
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,580
Dr. Gregor will help us.

790
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:41,205
I just want to go home.

791
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:46,163
You don't seem to understand.
There's a chance you won't make it.

792
01:12:46,246 --> 01:12:48,872
- I'm already dead.
- No, you're not.

793
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:51,663
Goddamn it, you are not dead,
all right?

794
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:56,330
You're alive, and that is precious.
You don't just throw that away.

795
01:12:56,413 --> 01:13:00,497
Now boarding,
Los Angeles direct line...

796
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:09,246
A bus ticket?

797
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,455
To Los Angeles.

798
01:13:15,747 --> 01:13:17,997
Well...

799
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,080
- What is this for?
- You're safe now.

800
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,580
He's only coming after me.

801
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:28,788
You know,
you're making a big mistake here.

802
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:31,914
You've got your story.
That's what you wanted.

803
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:33,997
You think...

804
01:13:34,914 --> 01:13:38,663
Last call, Los Angeles Express.
Now boarding.

805
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:41,497
Last call.

806
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:47,413
Passengers bound for Los Angeles.
Now boarding. Last call.

807
01:14:45,163 --> 01:14:48,955
You should have left me
while you had a chance.

808
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:53,997
What, and miss all the fun?

809
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,079
Shit.

810
01:15:27,246 --> 01:15:31,246
We're taking 'em to County right now.
Should get there just after lunch.

811
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,788
Oh, shit!

812
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:50,246
Get rid of 'em.

813
01:15:53,371 --> 01:15:54,914
Oh, shit.

814
01:16:04,288 --> 01:16:06,121
Got you now, boy.

815
01:16:06,205 --> 01:16:09,455
Jesus Christ.
He's coming right for us.

816
01:16:16,914 --> 01:16:18,996
Hey! Driver!

817
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,288
Get us out of here!

818
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,580
Holy shit!

819
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:47,872
Excuse me.
You should check on your driver, pal.

820
01:16:47,954 --> 01:16:49,788
He don't look too hot.

821
01:16:58,038 --> 01:17:01,079
- What do we do now?
- We have to stop the bus.

822
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:03,996
Gee, that's a great idea.
What a concept.

823
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:12,371
What are you doing now?

824
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:14,497
What the hell...?

825
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:48,330
Is it working?

826
01:18:02,413 --> 01:18:04,996
- Oh, God.
- Do you want to play catch?

827
01:18:16,371 --> 01:18:18,413
Oh, shit.

828
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,829
Can't find it. Here.
Oh, God.

829
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:29,330
Are we having fun yet?

830
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:51,288
Oh, my God.

831
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:55,829
You jump-

832
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:59,829
Wait a minute. What about
stopping the bus? I liked that idea.

833
01:18:59,913 --> 01:19:02,497
- You jump!
- I'm not going anywhere without you.

834
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:16,455
- We'll jump together.
- OK.

835
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:18,038
Together.

836
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:20,871
OK.

837
01:19:22,996 --> 01:19:24,163
Oh, shit.

838
01:19:48,913 --> 01:19:50,913
Hit him!
Hit him hard!

839
01:20:11,205 --> 01:20:14,746
Get the fuck up, soldier!
Get the fuck up!

840
01:20:20,246 --> 01:20:22,246
Fuck!

841
01:21:04,121 --> 01:21:06,121
Freeze!

842
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:10,163
Now, hold it right there!

843
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:19,163
Turn around.
Get down on your knees right now.

844
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:21,787
Put your hands over your head.

845
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:23,746
Put your hands over your head!

846
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:33,330
I had three brothers.

847
01:21:33,413 --> 01:21:35,413
Come on. Let's go.

848
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:39,913
Keys.
Come on! Get up!

849
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:43,746
Money. Here. Here we go.
Thank you.

850
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,288
Come on, here we go.
Let's go, let's go.

851
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,871
Get in the car.

852
01:21:48,954 --> 01:21:50,954
I'll drive, I'll drive.

853
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:54,455
Come on, get in the car.
Hurry up.

854
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,163
I'm gonna take you home.

855
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:04,246
Buckle up.

856
01:22:54,662 --> 01:22:58,163
John, there's somebody
in the driveway, I think.

857
01:23:04,288 --> 01:23:05,913
Mrs. Devreux?

858
01:23:06,829 --> 01:23:08,829
Luc?

859
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:13,996
John, come here!

860
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:16,079
<i>Luc! Mon fils.</i>

861
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:34,288
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
Charles isn't there?

862
01:23:34,371 --> 01:23:36,371
Where the hell is he?

863
01:23:36,913 --> 01:23:40,163
No, look. I don't care what you've heard.
It's not true.

864
01:23:41,787 --> 01:23:43,787
No...

865
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:48,579
- OK. Yeah.
- I can't believe he's alive.

866
01:23:48,662 --> 01:23:50,662
I'll meet them there.

867
01:23:51,662 --> 01:23:53,079
All right.

868
01:23:53,163 --> 01:23:54,496
All right, thanks.

869
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:00,330
I'm gonna have to get going.

870
01:24:00,413 --> 01:24:04,829
A news van from the network is gonna
meet me at the sheriff's station.

871
01:24:04,913 --> 01:24:09,163
They still don't believe me, but I think
we'll be able to change their minds.

872
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,246
Are you OK?

873
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,454
So many things are missing.

874
01:24:15,496 --> 01:24:17,662
So many things I remember,

875
01:24:17,746 --> 01:24:21,205
but so many things I can't.

876
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:25,829
Luc, it has been 25 years.

877
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,746
Such a long time, 25 years.

878
01:24:32,662 --> 01:24:35,288
I'll never get those years back.

879
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,371
Look at it this way.

880
01:24:40,662 --> 01:24:43,038
You look great
for a 50-year-old.

881
01:24:49,205 --> 01:24:51,330
Care for a cup, Miss Roberts?

882
01:24:53,412 --> 01:24:57,787
No, no. I'd better get going, you know.
They'll be waiting for me.

883
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,662
Be careful.
It's turning into a downpour.

884
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:06,288
OK.

885
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:10,163
- Thank you. Thank you both.
- You're welcome.

886
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:15,913
You gonna be all right?

887
01:25:17,038 --> 01:25:18,871
In time.

888
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:22,954
You know something?

889
01:25:23,038 --> 01:25:26,662
I haven't smoked a cigarette
in almost two days.

890
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,746
Maybe I'll quit.

891
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,330
I'll see you.

892
01:25:52,412 --> 01:25:54,412
Shit.

893
01:25:55,079 --> 01:25:57,079
Where's the key?

894
01:25:58,746 --> 01:26:00,205
Come on.

895
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,621
Shit.

896
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,829
Looking for something?

897
01:26:21,246 --> 01:26:23,246
Ma?

898
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:38,079
Ma? Are you there?

899
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:50,913
Devreux!

900
01:26:51,787 --> 01:26:53,746
Devreux, can you hear me?

901
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:55,246
Nice farm.

902
01:26:55,329 --> 01:26:58,246
Exactly like you described it
back in 'Nam.

903
01:26:58,329 --> 01:27:01,954
Why don't you come out here
and join our little family reunion?

904
01:27:03,954 --> 01:27:08,454
I mean, what the hell are you
waiting for, farm boy? Are you deaf?

905
01:27:13,454 --> 01:27:15,829
Get your ass out here!

906
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:19,454
We have some unfinished business,
you and me.

907
01:27:24,163 --> 01:27:27,954
Wow! She really
has beautiful ears.

908
01:27:28,038 --> 01:27:29,662
Sarge.

909
01:27:29,746 --> 01:27:32,579
You want me? I'm here.

910
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:36,829
- Let the girl go.
- Don't tell me what to do, soldier.

911
01:27:36,913 --> 01:27:40,913
I give the orders around here,
and you're gonna have to learn that.

912
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:44,829
She's a fucking gook traitor.

913
01:27:44,913 --> 01:27:49,329
I gave you an order to kill her. Now
you have to fulfill that order, private.

914
01:27:49,412 --> 01:27:52,746
Scott, the war...

915
01:27:52,829 --> 01:27:54,829
it's over.

916
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,537
Not for me.

917
01:28:01,245 --> 01:28:04,205
Not for her. Not for you.

918
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:47,245
You can't run from this war, soldier.

919
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:49,245
Not under my command.

920
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,537
You've grown weak.

921
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:57,913
You should've taken your...

922
01:28:57,996 --> 01:28:59,621
medication.

923
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:43,245
Come on. Get up and fight.

924
01:29:52,662 --> 01:29:56,204
Now I'm gonna teach you about
the chain of command, private.

925
01:29:58,204 --> 01:29:59,954
When I say jump,

926
01:30:00,704 --> 01:30:02,829
you say, "How high?"
Got it?

927
01:30:03,412 --> 01:30:05,038
Got it?

928
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,829
Why can't you get it
into your fucking head?

929
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:17,162
I gave you an order, soldier.

930
01:30:18,245 --> 01:30:22,245
Now let me see you waste
that gook traitor.

931
01:30:27,496 --> 01:30:30,787
Now, where are we gonna shoot her?
In the stomach?

932
01:30:32,204 --> 01:30:34,662
Nah. In the chest?

933
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:37,496
No.

934
01:30:38,162 --> 01:30:40,913
I think we should shoot her...

935
01:30:40,996 --> 01:30:42,829
in the head!

936
01:30:44,746 --> 01:30:46,871
Ready. Fire!

937
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,913
It's empty!

938
01:30:54,537 --> 01:30:56,204
It's empty!

939
01:31:03,245 --> 01:31:04,746
Luc!

940
01:31:05,204 --> 01:31:07,204
Oh, God!

941
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:09,287
Oh, God, help!

942
01:31:11,162 --> 01:31:13,496
Come on!

943
01:31:16,746 --> 01:31:18,287
Luc!

944
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:21,287
- Run!
- No! No, Luc...

945
01:31:21,746 --> 01:31:22,954
Run!

946
01:31:29,162 --> 01:31:31,162
Run.

947
01:31:35,704 --> 01:31:37,704
No!

948
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:18,913
Well, that's the spirit, soldier.

949
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:36,162
I mean, this is
a serious matter, private.

950
01:32:36,245 --> 01:32:40,204
I can't believe you got your poor folks
involved in this too.

951
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,579
I got a little secret for you, boy.
You're up for a court-martial.

952
01:32:47,953 --> 01:32:51,120
- You ready to go to trial?
- Give me your best shot.

953
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:13,746
Gee, I'm awful sorry about this,
but you're all sentenced to death.

954
01:33:18,912 --> 01:33:21,204
Say good night, asshole.

955
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:28,496
Good night, asshole.

956
01:34:55,329 --> 01:34:57,828
You're dead, soldier.

957
01:34:58,621 --> 01:35:01,287
No. I'm alive.

958
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,537
You're discharged, Sarge.

959
01:36:42,745 --> 01:36:46,162
- Son.
- You OK, Dad? Mom?

960
01:36:46,912 --> 01:36:48,912
Don't worry about us.

961
01:36:52,245 --> 01:36:54,412
It's over.

962
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:55,995
Here, let me help you.

963
01:37:25,078 --> 01:37:27,078
