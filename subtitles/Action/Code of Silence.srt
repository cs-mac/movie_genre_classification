1
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,556
Have a shot, kid. A little nerve tonic.

2
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,486
I'm not nervous, Cragie.
I just gotta take a leak.

3
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,155
Then do it now.

4
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,951
- On some poor bastard's grave?
- What do you care?

5
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:55,370
If someone was smart, they'd rip out
these graves and plant tomatoes.

6
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:58,202
These people are no good. They're dead.

7
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,800
Say, hey, hey, hey, Cub fans.

8
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:22,930
I sure hope to hell you all are down there,
cos we got the big game today.

9
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:25,188
Today is our day, baby...

10
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,775
Dig this, man.
You cats on the home team, listen up.

11
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:43,915
Spider's gettin' ready for the big play.
If you mothers drop that ball, Spider's...

12
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,464
- What's happenin', Doc?
- There you are, man.

13
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:54,719
- You take too fuckin' long.
- We ain't got far to go.

14
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:58,425
Get your ass in the car.
Fuck the cigarette smokin'.

15
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:02,389
- I got everything we need.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

16
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,521
They'll be waitin', man.

17
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:09,432
- Home team, ready in the bull pen.
- Copy, shortstop. Double play.

18
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,608
Break out the nuts.

19
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,941
Centre's in.

20
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,198
- Where's Cragie?
- Talk, left field.

21
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:22,578
Dammit... Ready, sir.
Left field is in position.

22
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,782
OK, guys. Runner on first base.

23
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,996
- Double play. You got 'em in sight?
- Yeah. He's headin' for the alley.

24
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:34,336
What is this? This guy's got
my nose in his pocket 6.30 in the morning.

25
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:39,923
Funky fuckin' neighbourhoods.
I'm sick of it. I've been waiting three days.

26
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm glad to get out though,
to tell you the truth, man.

27
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:49,140
You can't tell nobody about this stress.
How's somebody gonna relate to it?

28
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,311
Here we go.

29
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,650
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

30
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,782
Leave a space for the good guys.

31
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,702
I ain't never lettin' the car out of my sight.

32
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:22,382
This is lovely. Look at this. Zaro
and Abere went to Brazil with 12 people.

33
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:25,514
This is my vacation. Ain't this nice?

34
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:31,724
I'm tellin' ya, Spider, this ain't my style.

35
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:36,316
I can dig it, baby. It's too much
like real work even for me.

36
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:41,520
You'll have everything you want
in two hours. All the action you need.

37
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,696
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

38
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,044
Come on, baby.

39
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,762
Come on, baby. Do your thing.

40
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,054
Man, we're clean.
You think we're goddamn fools?

41
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:11,385
- Watch it, baby.
- Don't you know these guys, Spider?

42
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,306
- We oughta get married.
- Just wanna do some business.

43
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:17,724
This guy is nervous.
Does he speak English?

44
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:22,069
Fuck, man.
I can't believe this guy.

45
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,945
You do this every fuckin' time.

46
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,826
That one should have taken a Valium.

47
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:35,873
- Found you a present.
- Man, these things test your head.

48
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,208
These people trust me.

49
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:42,671
I trust you too,
but I want something out of it.

50
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,883
You're gonna get what you want, man.

51
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:52,508
Hola. ¿ Cómo está, amigo? Soy yo.
Abre la puerta. Ése es mi amigo.

52
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:56,224
- Tengo una cosa para ti.
- Catido, come here.

53
00:07:56,354 --> 00:08:02,558
I don't like the way it sounds. Where's
that money? That's mine until it's yours.

54
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:06,394
These guys ordering me up the hallway.
He's got a gun up my ass.

55
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,772
Caballeros.

56
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,078
I don't like people
that don't wanna shake my hand.

57
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,329
- I don't care where they come from...
- Shh.

58
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:26,507
I don't dig motherfuckers
that don't shake my hand.

59
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:27,913
¿ Qué pasa?

60
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,557
Come on, Eenie. Move your ass.

61
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,687
What the hell are those guys up to?

62
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,519
They're going to work. What do you think?

63
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,027
- At this hour?
- Don't worry about it. Let it roll.

64
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:53,484
They got a hard-ass for a boss. Like us.

65
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:02,788
I just wanna get outta here real quick.
This is my deal.

66
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,417
I wanna find out
what's going on here today.

67
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,852
Oh, Christ.

68
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:33,691
- Told you this was the right place.
- Scares me shitless.

69
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,658
Amor, váyase al otro cuarto.

70
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,322
Tell him I think that's a nice decoration.

71
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,822
Watch it. Cool it, man.
You're looking at that man's old lady.

72
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,447
- Comachos'll shoot your ass.
- Gimme a break.

73
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:04,632
- Man, Victor's got the best.
- The best!

74
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,894
You Comacho dudes are too much.
I can't believe you guys.

75
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,851
Parece que el hombre está contento.

76
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:15,234
This really looks right.
I feel some rocks up in there.

77
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:18,032
- This looks good.
- Damn right it's good.

78
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,994
By the numbers.

79
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:31,791
They got a good reputation. Tell him I'm
doing this because my people expect it.

80
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,628
I'm not insulting the guy.

81
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:37,669
El hombre como que tiene
un problema de diarrea de la boca.

82
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,089
Said you got
diarrhoea of the mouth, baby.

83
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,636
Tell him it's too bad. I thought
he had more class than that.

84
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:46,682
That's the colour I need. Let's go.

85
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,680
How's that?

86
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,806
OK, everybody. Get ready.

87
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:06,494
Right field's clear.
The painters are out of the way.

88
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,618
- What are you talking about?
- A crew of painters went in next door.

89
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,287
They're gonna wreck that building.

90
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,458
Call 'em in.

91
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,256
Jump street. Let's move, move!

92
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:29,717
Like I told you, Vic,
you can always depend on the Spider.

93
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,258
Go!

94
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:09,425
The door, Cragie. Get the door.

95
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:15,769
Come on, get the board.
Move it, move it, move it.

96
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:18,220
Come on! Let's go. Let's go.

97
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,063
Shh.

98
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,703
Give me the bag!

99
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,547
Check the door. Come on.

100
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:59,769
Come on. Hurry!

101
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,282
Forget it, Eenie! We're outta here!

102
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:32,006
- Get around to the hallway.
- Up against the wall. Let's go.

103
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,049
I'm going around to the front.

104
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,326
Shit!

105
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,205
Go, go, go.

106
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,677
Motherfuckin' son of a bitch!

107
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,602
Rosa, ¿ dónde estás, mi vida?

108
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,818
No salgas de ahí.

109
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:44,868
Cragie! Cragie?

110
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:49,208
It's OK. I got the son of a bitch.
Cover the stairs.

111
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:19,687
Citywide units, we have an officer shot -
4830 Kenmore.

112
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:23,357
Request for additional ambulances.
Several gunshot victims.

113
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:27,407
Use caution. Plain-clothes units
on the scene. Zone three radio.

114
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:29,994
Hey.

115
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,625
Told you to stay in there.

116
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:41,085
- Take it easy, Kopalas.
- Sarge...

117
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:44,172
The kid didn't dust him. I did.

118
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:48,885
Him or me, sarge.

119
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:53,595
The kid saw the whole thing.
Tell him, Nick.

120
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:01,946
Yeah, that's what happened.

121
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,442
Stay here, Cragie.

122
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,588
I want this kept clear.

123
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:39,770
Don't do that. Do you have any idea
how much these things cost?

124
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,106
Eddie, listen to this.

125
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,935
A bait shop. We get
some worms, some minnows.

126
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:50,532
We don't even have to get real worms.
We'll get those rubber ones.

127
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,873
Ow! You goddamn Dr Jekyll!

128
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,461
He's a butcher.

129
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,969
Sarge, I don't think these guys
know who their friends are.

130
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,772
I'm gettin' tired of this shit.

131
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:25,773
Efren, what's gonna happen to you when
big, bad Luis comes in from Bogotá?

132
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:31,655
I'll tell you. Your ass is gonna be
freeze-dried. Your goose is cooked.

133
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:34,700
You gotta know who did it!
Who'd you fuck over lately?

134
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,867
- Luis ain't gonna like this.
- Cállate.

135
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,831
You want a tune-up, fuckface?

136
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:44,085
Sarge, you know why
a Comacho's like a cue ball?

137
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,414
Cos the harder you hit 'em,
the better their English gets.

138
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,789
You wanna play pool?

139
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,835
Save it, Brennan.

140
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,012
Book 'em.

141
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,932
Come on, come on. Talk to me.

142
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,732
What do you know about it?

143
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,944
Bella.

144
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:21,029
- They got Vito and Eenie.
- Keep your eyes closed. Come on.

145
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:26,163
Ready? Now open.

146
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,368
Oh!

147
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:33,039
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- I'm so glad you're here.

148
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:36,045
- Happy birthday, Molly.
- Molly!

149
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,307
Molly, come here. Come on!

150
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:46,055
I want you to pack me a bag for the lake.

151
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,857
- Come on! I'm in a hurry.
- But why?

152
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,441
Business.

153
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,892
Now move. Do what I tell you.

154
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:55,943
Papa...

155
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,157
- Don't do it, Mama.
- Hey!

156
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,529
None of your lip today.

157
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:16,290
I cannot believe you. Nothing's changed.
Today's Mom's birthday.

158
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:19,794
She deserves better than this
and so do we.

159
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:28,474
Hey, Tony! Sorry I'm late.
Got stuck in traffic.

160
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,141
Picked up something nice.

161
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:34,724
Fuckin' Victor Comacho's alive.
Vito and Eenie are dead.

162
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,101
Jesus Christ! You pulled that hit?

163
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,988
- Don't go, Diana.
- I can't stay here, Grandma.

164
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,819
You put somebody on the house,
and you look after her.

165
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:48,163
You gone crazy? You're starting a war.
You're putting the outfit on the line.

166
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,788
- They'll probably try to starch your uncle.
- Keep your mouth shut!

167
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:55,500
What Mr Scalese don't know
won't hurt him.

168
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,006
Happy birthday.

169
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:12,010
Cragie, you're assigned
to headquarters until the hearing.

170
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,054
Hearing?

171
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:19,431
Who called for a hearing? That goddamn
little punk tried to shoot me in the back.

172
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:24,403
Sit down.

173
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:31,451
- Lucy Partida.
- That commie piece of shit?

174
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:35,993
Shut up, Cragie.
Partida's demanded a formal hearing.

175
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:40,587
You'll be under oath. The department
will provide you with a lawyer.

176
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,917
The citizens-review-board member
is waitin' to talk to you.

177
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,254
Doesn't sound like
you got anything to worry about.

178
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:51,171
Kopalas, you work with Cusack
until this is over.

179
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,595
Yes, sir.

180
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,766
That'll be all.

181
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:01,272
Thank you, sir.

182
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:10,325
- Where'd they take Dorato?
- County. He'll be OK.

183
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:15,611
Listen, I don't have time to nursemaid
a rookie. I don't need a partner.

184
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:19,448
That's right. You don't need a partner.
You need a goddamn keeper!

185
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:23,203
Jesus Christ!
How do I explain this one downtown?

186
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:25,794
We gave you 600 man-hours.

187
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,293
You took a month to plan it,
and what have you got to show for it?

188
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:34,718
Eight bodies, one dead informant, one
of my best men shot, for Christ's sake.

189
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,143
You'll have me back on the beat,
bustin' perverts in the park.

190
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,844
We've got a bigger problem.

191
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:45,931
This Luis Comacho's crazy.
He's not gonna take this lying down.

192
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:48,986
That's all I need. A goddamn war.

193
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:53,692
- What about this business with Cragie?
- You know what I think of Cragie.

194
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:56,819
All right, I'll deal with downtown.

195
00:21:56,954 --> 00:22:00,370
You find out who burned
the Comachos before they do.

196
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:02,539
Kates.

197
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:07,541
Eddie, you had a good setup.
Too bad it went to hell.

198
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,131
Yeah.

199
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:18,514
Los Comachos sabemos
quiénes fueron, Luis.

200
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:22,889
Luis, a war does no good for any of us.

201
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:26,437
It can only make what's bad... worse.

202
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:31,569
Get them out of here and fix them up.

203
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:35,065
I want them beautiful for their mother.

204
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:42,654
My brothers, I promise you
blood for blood.

205
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,348
How you doin', sarge?

206
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:15,571
Ése es el policía hijo de puta
que está involucrado...

207
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:18,022
Hey! I'd like to talk to you.

208
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,996
One day I would like to give you a gift...
of a Colombian necktie.

209
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:37,752
Very special. You slit the throat,
pull out the tongue,

210
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:42,879
and on you... it would look beautiful.

211
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:45,303
Why don't you give it to me right now?

212
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:49,057
Come. We're running late.

213
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,979
Hey, Eddie, you'd better grow
eyes in the back of your head.

214
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:00,651
Come on. Good shot again, Eddie.

215
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,656
Keep going. Keep it up.

216
00:24:04,953 --> 00:24:07,704
Good combination. Come on, Eddie.

217
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,955
Come on, again.

218
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,124
Come on, he's running.

219
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,088
Shit! Oh, man.

220
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,378
Out of my way, you side of beef.

221
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:23,675
Hey, partner!

222
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:27,172
I'm all right, man.

223
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,008
- How's the foot?
- Swinging. Listen to this.

224
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:35,763
We open up a beef-and-sausage stand
just outside of Wrigley Field.

225
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,604
You dish out the beef, I take in the cash.

226
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:42,234
Free games.
I happen to have a contact downtown.

227
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:46,492
How are we gonna watch the games
if we're hawkin' hot dogs?

228
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:49,870
I never thought of that.

229
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:53,616
Davis, I want a word with you, man.

230
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,996
Amano, when you're through
playing with that, I wanna talk to you.

231
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,755
Dooey, I want you to help me get some
signatures on this petition for Cragie.

232
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:05,801
I figure down the 14th -
we can get somebody down there.

233
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:09,628
I think we'll find
someone who'll collaborate.

234
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:13,256
Beautiful.

235
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:17,181
Gus, put that thing down and sit up.

236
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:22,016
I want you to sign this. It's for Cragie.

237
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:24,275
Attention all senior personnel.

238
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:29,695
There'll be a demonstration of the Prowler
tactical assist robot at 1600 hours.

239
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:32,233
Your attendance is required.

240
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:37,871
Cusack! How about taking the gloves off
long enough to sign this for Cragie?

241
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,670
- About the hearing?
- You betcha.

242
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:44,713
- I pass.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

243
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,041
He's burned out, Brennan,
and you know it.

244
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,135
Get off your high horse!

245
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:54,632
He made a couple of mistakes, OK?
The man was a hero.

246
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:58,515
What do civilians know about
coming up some shithouse staircase

247
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:00,685
scared out of your shorts?

248
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,604
They only know
we're supposed to protect 'em.

249
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:11,363
Cragie's gonna kill somebody else,
or he's gonna get somebody killed.

250
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,530
Maybe even you, Brennan.

251
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:19,779
Thanks a lot, sarge. You're a real prince.

252
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,908
Good shot. One more time. Come on.

253
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,494
The Prowler's standard
weapons complement

254
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,968
includes one MB40 recoilless rifle,
two Mark 19 grenade launchers,

255
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:34,177
and twin HB.50Bcalibre machine guns.

256
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:39,547
I have sufficient firepower to neutralise
a wide variety of security threats.

257
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,350
As you can see, this lightweight
handBheld control unit

258
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,638
enables you to direct my movements

259
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:49,392
while simultaneously operating
the various weapons systems,

260
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:53,193
either in manual or full automatic mode.

261
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:57,866
In full automatic mode, my infrared
heat sensors and Doppler radar

262
00:26:57,994 --> 00:27:00,663
mean that I can acquire
moving targets at night

263
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,362
without assistance from the operator.

264
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,121
That concludes
the programmed demonstration.

265
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,624
Now our factory representative

266
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:13,879
will discuss the features of the simplified
Mark 2 handBheld control system.

267
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,216
After the gyros are locked,

268
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,094
any movement of the hand controller
is duplicated by the Prowler.

269
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:24,802
This simple control system means that
even semiskilled employees can operate...

270
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:28,222
He's talking about you, Cusack,
so pay attention.

271
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,523
You've all got to qualify on this.
It's the future.

272
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,403
As they say, even a child can operate it.

273
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,483
You're looking at the perfect cop.

274
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:42,361
- Damn thing follows orders.
- Another gun without a brain.

275
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:48,498
Twin 50mm machine guns can be linked
to the laser range and guidance system.

276
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,117
If you pick someone
to try to elude Prowler,

277
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:54,753
I'll show you
our target acquisition system.

278
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,669
Halt. Police. Throw down your weapon.

279
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:01,799
We will not harm you. Please place
your hands above your head.

280
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,766
- Drop it.
- You are under arrest.

281
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:09,388
Please do not resist.
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,081
Eenie Verona's the gentleman's name.

283
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,460
Looks like you did
a hell of a job on him. Know him?

284
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,962
- He's just a punk thief.
- Looks like he graduated.

285
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,504
He sure flunked house painting.

286
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,227
He had an uncle. Served time together.
What the hell's his name?

287
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:56,434
- Gagleoni?
- Gamiani.

288
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,935
I think we should get to know him better.

289
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:04,995
This Gamiani is a real swinger.

290
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,173
Goodbye.

291
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:13,305
Take it easy, baby.
I'll be back real quick.

292
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:15,341
Here we go.

293
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,477
He's the most active one of all.
He's got great eyes, doesn't he?

294
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:07,647
What about the lion?

295
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:12,027
Look at that one.
He's standing up over by the cage.

296
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:15,690
He's trying to figure out what we're doing.

297
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:23,535
His pretty white breast - isn't that pretty?
Is that a leopard?

298
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:29,911
Well, that's good. And, uh...

299
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,756
- I'll be back in a second.
- OK.

300
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:40,344
Kinda young for that old guy,
don't you think?

301
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:43,677
What the hell's going on?
Eddie, this isn't panning out.

302
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:47,643
Why don't you watch, kid?
Learn something.

303
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:54,561
- What are you doing here?
- Your papa worries about you.

304
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:58,480
Get outta here, Lou, and leave me alone.

305
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,109
We're gonna go see the ducks.

306
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:05,990
- I don't wanna see the ducks.
- What's wrong with ducks?

307
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:41,736
Yeah, come on.

308
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,358
- Hey, Jenna!
- Hi!

309
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:55,332
Diana, thanks again!

310
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,926
What's so funny?

311
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:34,552
Enough already.

312
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:37,969
We're following them,
they're following her,

313
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:40,345
and nobody knows nothin'.

314
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:44,317
Let's find out something.

315
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,768
Stay here.

316
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:25,105
- Congratulations.
- I'm glad you could make it.

317
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:29,312
Excuse me. This is Mrs Wilson.
Mrs Wilson, this is my friend Diana.

318
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:32,529
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This must be a breakthrough.

319
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:36,025
It is. In fact I just sold
my first piece to Mrs Wilson.

320
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,865
Terrific. I really like your new stuff a lot,
especially the dead dog series. It's great.

321
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:53,373
- I wanna see some of the other stuff. Bye.
- Thanks a lot for stopping by.

322
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,383
He is really a character.

323
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:02,301
Maybe we should set up a date
and I can help you hang it.

324
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,474
I'd be delighted.

325
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:07,303
Excuse me.

326
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,852
Who was that girl you were talking to
in the black slacks? I think I know her.

327
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,227
Diana Luna.

328
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:39,218
- Understand it?
- Sure. Don't you?

329
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,838
Uh-uh.

330
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,008
I'm Eddie Cusack.

331
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:51,725
I make it Eddie the cop.

332
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,897
That obvious, huh?

333
00:36:55,486 --> 00:37:00,064
I don't know where my father is,
and frankly I don't give a damn.

334
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,031
I have nothing to do
with my father's business,

335
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,367
Uncle Scalese's business, or any of it.

336
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:08,869
So why don't you just leave me alone?

337
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:16,543
It was nice meeting you.

338
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,799
Whoa! I thought I was feeling good, but...

339
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:23,967
Happy? Whoo!

340
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,592
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah. Right over there.

341
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:43,066
Kobas, this is Sergeant Cusack.

342
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:46,235
I want a team to cover a house
on the Southwest Side.

343
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,155
Luna. L-u-n-a. Anthony.

344
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:51,779
Yeah, "Crazy Tony" Luna.

345
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:55,165
I don't know if he's around.
But if he shows up, bring him in.

346
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,333
Thanks.

347
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:05,459
Catch you later.

348
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,635
That's a very nice choice.

349
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:32,909
Oh, yeah.

350
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,540
Hey! You comfortable?

351
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:41,412
They're wastin' the show.
Tony's not even in town.

352
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:44,501
He'll get the word.

353
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:48,500
Mrs Luna,
come away from the window.

354
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,323
- How about yourself?
- Don't worry about me.

355
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,495
I'll take care of him.

356
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,587
Wait here.

357
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,003
- Eddie, I can back you up.
- Stay by the radio.

358
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,762
- Felix, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

359
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:54,232
Get me yesterday's numbers on Phoenix.

360
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,079
What the hell are you doin' here?

361
00:40:07,462 --> 00:40:08,838
Off, asshole.

362
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:18,802
Cusack.

363
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:26,929
The modern age's answer
to the crystal ball.

364
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:29,852
Marvellous, if you know how to read it.

365
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:33,439
If you got some extra cash, buy oranges.

366
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:37,948
The price is low and I can promise you
there's gonna be a trucking strike.

367
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,198
That a bribe, Mr Scalese?

368
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,367
It's a prediction.

369
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,031
No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie Cusack.

370
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,870
They tell me you're incorruptible,
untarnished.

371
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:53,289
I hear they call you
"stainless steel" on the street.

372
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,462
Me, I think you're a pain in the ass.

373
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:00,340
I'm looking for one of your nephews.

374
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:07,217
- Tony Luna.
- Goodbye, Mr Cusack.

375
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:10,520
There's a shitstorm coming, old man.
You can stop it.

376
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,890
Goodbye, Mr Cusack.

377
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:19,154
- Nobody talks, right?
- That's right, Sergeant.

378
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:22,982
Just like the cops.
Just like the Comachos.

379
00:41:23,786 --> 00:41:26,027
Nobody talks.

380
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:28,619
Omertà.

381
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:41,959
I'm gonna find Tony Luna.

382
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:47,848
I'm gonna nail his ass, and anyone else
connected to him. You got that?

383
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:51,594
Why, you punk! Nobody threatens me.

384
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:54,185
It's not a threat, Mr Scalese.

385
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,562
It's a prediction.

386
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:10,863
Roger, Homicide.
At the Lincoln Park Conservatory.

387
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,999
The victim is male Caucasian.
Multiple knife wounds.

388
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:18,871
The coroner's on the scene.
Request for laboratory backup.

389
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:30,756
Tony Luna's bagman.

390
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:36,311
They call that a Colombian necktie.

391
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:39,855
The manager of Tony's restaurant
was hanging from a meat hook.

392
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:42,356
Someone tried to carve
a canoe out of him.

393
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,736
Tony's used-car lot on Ashland
is burning as we speak.

394
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:48,320
Head salesman is fried zucchini.

395
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:51,701
Oh, Jesus. It's startin'.

396
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,319
Let's go.

397
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:14,890
- Good morning, Mrs Luna.
- Good morning.

398
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:18,268
Don't the eggplants look wonderful?

399
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:10,027
They're all over the place. In the house
and in the street. Looks like a war zone.

400
00:44:10,154 --> 00:44:12,230
- How many victims, 1021?
- Five so far.

401
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:14,571
Four adult females, one adult male.

402
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,943
This is Cusack. Was there a girl?
Late teens, brownish hair?

403
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,956
Negative. We got four adult females pretty
chewed up. The youngest looks about 40.

404
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,335
What kind of people are these guys?

405
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:41,723
What's it about? I'm not going.
I don't have to go.

406
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,473
Your mother got killed.

407
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:47,771
Take it easy. Just put your jacket on.

408
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,478
Let's get out of here.

409
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:00,949
Stick with me.

410
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:58,255
Run...

411
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,856
Stay here.

412
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,506
- Cut the chica.
- Angel!

413
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,958
Let her go.

414
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:31,839
Take out your weapons. Left hand.

415
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:37,763
Up against the wall. Move it!

416
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,473
Shit!

417
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,645
You heard me, Angel.

418
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,606
Diana, come here.

419
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:47,518
Back!

420
00:47:47,655 --> 00:47:50,490
Angelo, llévatela. Vete, ¿ eh?

421
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,776
Angel, let her go!

422
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:05,959
Eddie!

423
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,889
Come on!

424
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,994
Wait.

425
00:49:31,547 --> 00:49:34,038
Angel.

426
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:43,132
One more step... I'll cut her head off!

427
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,890
Give it up!

428
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:16,560
Get your ass up.

429
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:22,019
Shit!

430
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:34,656
No!

431
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:13,297
Is it true?

432
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:18,636
Yeah.

433
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:50,456
Keep your goddamn pants on.

434
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:58,876
Eddie, what the hell's goin' on?
Come on in.

435
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,847
Fred Pirelli... Diana Luna.

436
00:54:09,856 --> 00:54:11,896
Hiya, kid.

437
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:18,727
She won't go into protective custody
and I couldn't leave her out there alone.

438
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,616
I hate putting you on the spot like this.

439
00:54:23,745 --> 00:54:26,532
I spent 30 years on the spot.

440
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:29,665
Can you put her up
until I find her old man?

441
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,832
Whatever you need.

442
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:36,416
Brennan, I heard you're gonna retire
when you sober up.

443
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:38,707
In that case, I'll never retire.

444
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:42,425
Dorato, you only gotta buy one boot now.
You're gettin' off cheap.

445
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:45,923
I'm sick about it.
These boots were handmade in Italy.

446
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:49,676
$17.50 they cost me.
That was with the police discount.

447
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:51,769
Hey, Eddie.

448
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,936
Yeah, it's me.

449
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:55,476
Yeah...

450
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:58,479
Why don't you come by and tip a few?

451
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:03,817
Come on. Have a few beers with me.
It'll do you good.

452
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,035
Do I know it's late? I know it's late.

453
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:13,700
Eddie... I gotta talk to you.

454
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:22,339
Yeah. At Mike's.

455
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:25,721
All right, great. Thanks, pal.

456
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:39,271
What the fuck are you doin'?

457
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:42,188
Would you try and relax... Flash?

458
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,191
This is gonna be a slide, man.
Easy in, easy out.

459
00:55:45,323 --> 00:55:50,614
- Piece of cake, man. Nothing to it.
- German fuckin' chocolate cake.

460
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:53,366
- You sure you checked it out, man?
- Trust me.

461
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:56,701
- Man, you know the drill.
- I go to the back.

462
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:59,408
- You go to the bar. You order a drink.
- Right.

463
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:01,787
- What you gonna order?
- What's it matter?

464
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:05,588
- You got to know what you gonna order!
- You're making me nervous.

465
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:11,721
- Relax, will you? Have a toothpick.
- Fuck that. Let's go get some money.

466
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:29,230
Hey, Nick! You oughta crash, babe.
You had a heck of a day.

467
00:56:30,408 --> 00:56:33,279
- How you doing?
- Nicky, how are you?

468
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:37,164
Hurry up.

469
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:40,789
- It's a piece of art.
- It's a piece of shit. Hurry up.

470
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:43,456
You're talking to a ballerina.

471
00:57:02,397 --> 00:57:04,437
What's happenin'?

472
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:14,776
How you doing?

473
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:18,989
Give me a Black Russian
and a Courvoisier.

474
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:22,162
Straight up.

475
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:30,502
Where's the dancing girls?
Shaving their legs?

476
00:57:41,602 --> 00:57:44,686
All right!
Get your hands up, motherfuckers!

477
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:48,399
Which of you two guys
is the brains of the outfit?

478
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:52,736
You stupid motherfucker.
Dumb cocksucker.

479
00:57:52,863 --> 00:57:55,188
Bring that piece of shit over here.

480
00:57:55,323 --> 00:57:58,075
Worm-brain motherfucker, you!

481
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,858
Kiss the bar.

482
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:02,532
My old lady told me
he was fucked up in the head.

483
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:08,002
"Piece of cake, man. Nothing to it, man."
I should have listened to my old lady.

484
00:58:08,127 --> 00:58:10,535
Screw your old lady. Everybody else has.

485
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:13,708
Cuff 'em and get 'em outta here.

486
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:16,462
- Gimme your paw.
- They get dumber every day.

487
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:21,261
Let her get some sleep.
That's what I need too, real bad.

488
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:25,340
- Get some, and take care.
- I'll call you from the hearing tomorrow.

489
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:36,440
- Here's some tea.
- Thanks.

490
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:53,285
What if you...

491
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,958
What do you do
if you don't have someone?

492
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:03,300
You find someone.

493
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:08,180
Will you hold me?

494
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,525
You'll be fine.

495
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

496
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:39,005
- You talk big when my hands are cuffed.
- I'd kick your ass, handcuffed or not.

497
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:43,129
Shoot me so I don't have to
listen to his mouth any more.

498
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:44,885
Are you John Wayne?

499
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:48,713
I'll make you Jane Wayne
unless you shut the fuck up.

500
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:52,599
- Hey, sarge.
- Hi, sarge.

501
00:59:53,354 --> 00:59:56,888
- What's this?
- These morons tried to stick us up.

502
00:59:57,024 --> 01:00:01,769
We called the station 45 minutes ago
for a wagon. They didn't believe us.

503
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:04,229
Eddie, partner, come here.

504
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:09,613
Eddie, I want you to meet
a couple of friends.

505
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:13,528
This is Ruthie.
She's a dental hygienist. Very oral.

506
01:00:13,665 --> 01:00:18,742
This is Marlene. She works for a
proctologist. Don't turn your back on her.

507
01:00:18,878 --> 01:00:21,998
- Eddie, have a drink. I got a proposition.
- Later.

508
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:26,259
Just let me plant two words in your brain -
alligator farming.

509
01:00:27,803 --> 01:00:29,926
- Alligator farming.
- Yeah.

510
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:32,470
Yeah.

511
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:34,969
It'll work.

512
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,816
Thanks.

513
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:48,822
- How's the girl?
- She's fine.

514
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:52,867
That fucker. What's he doing down here?

515
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:58,237
Want a beer? Val, give me another
Southern Comfort, will you?

516
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,375
I really wanna be a good cop, Eddie.

517
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:08,632
Sometimes I get so scared, you know.

518
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,543
- Only a fool doesn't get scared.
- It's so easy for you.

519
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,515
Like you got all the answers.

520
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:17,681
But for me, I don't...

521
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:20,642
I don't know.

522
01:01:33,283 --> 01:01:36,237
Cragie planted the gun on that kid.

523
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:40,905
He just wasted him. Blew him away.

524
01:01:42,876 --> 01:01:45,414
And I went right along with it.

525
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:48,877
My partner.

526
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:56,132
Now I don't know what I'm gonna do
about that hearing tomorrow.

527
01:01:56,264 --> 01:01:58,303
Tell the truth.

528
01:02:01,102 --> 01:02:04,601
See? You make it sound so easy.

529
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:09,644
I got a wife, I got a kid,

530
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:12,268
and you're telling me to commit suicide.

531
01:02:12,404 --> 01:02:15,855
How the fuck do I live with these guys
if I sell out my own partner?

532
01:02:15,991 --> 01:02:18,030
And if you don't?

533
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,196
Cragie gets away with it.

534
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,453
And the chance to do it again.

535
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,824
It was a mistake. It was a fuckin' accident.

536
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,871
- And a kid was killed.
- I know. Don't you think I fuckin' know...

537
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:44,257
I see that boy's face
every time I close my eyes, Eddie.

538
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:47,678
Tell it like it is, Nick.

539
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:51,056
I'll back you up.

540
01:02:57,197 --> 01:02:59,688
- See you guys later.
- OK, Eddie.

541
01:02:59,825 --> 01:03:04,570
- Look what's here.
- Nice to see you out with the boys.

542
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,409
Cragie.

543
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:11,747
They tell me my sergeant wouldn't
sign for me. Wanna tell me why?

544
01:03:11,878 --> 01:03:15,413
- You know why.
- No. Tell me.

545
01:03:15,548 --> 01:03:17,671
You don't belong on the streets any more.

546
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,291
Fuck you. Where do you get off?

547
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,218
Right about here.

548
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:29,018
Good night, sarge.

549
01:03:31,522 --> 01:03:34,642
If it was dark, Officer,
how were you sure Vega had a gun?

550
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:39,651
We got lucky. There was a glint of light,
a reflection off the barrel of the weapon.

551
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,943
Officer Cragie, you have heard
Mrs Murillio's testimony.

552
01:03:44,076 --> 01:03:45,071
Yes, ma'am.

553
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:50,196
You heard her tell this panel that she saw
you lay the gun in her grandson's hand.

554
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:52,787
I'm not saying the woman
would make this up,

555
01:03:52,918 --> 01:03:58,837
but there's no way she could have seen
anything from where she was standing.

556
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,290
Like you said,
she's the boy's grandmother.

557
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:19,605
Young lady, you are about to have
the specialty of the house - eggs Pirelli.

558
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:23,186
You got your protein, your carbohydrates,

559
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:26,273
vitamin D, vitamin C.

560
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:29,160
Good for you. Strength. Eat now.

561
01:04:41,464 --> 01:04:42,460
Eat.

562
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:51,846
Right after you heard Officer Cragie's gun
discharge, what did you do then?

563
01:04:51,974 --> 01:04:54,596
I immediately advanced down the hall.

564
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:56,933
What did you see?

565
01:04:57,063 --> 01:05:01,060
The deceased - Vega - lying on the floor.

566
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:03,433
Officer Cragie was
checking his vital signs.

567
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:05,608
What happened then?

568
01:05:05,738 --> 01:05:09,735
We recovered a.25-calibre automatic
from the teenager's right hand.

569
01:05:09,867 --> 01:05:15,572
Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand
before Officer Cragie fired?

570
01:05:16,915 --> 01:05:19,371
Yes, ma'am.

571
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,493
No more questions.

572
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:26,253
You made that uniform look good.

573
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:29,882
That guy next to me -
handsome devil, huh?

574
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:34,963
That's Eddie's dad.
Better than a good cop.

575
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:39,100
He was killed in the line of duty. '71.

576
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:42,352
An accident.

577
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,390
- What do you want?
- Gas company.

578
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,471
How you doing?

579
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,892
I can't comment on that.
It was over before I got there.

580
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,025
You are his superior officer, are you not?

581
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,192
Cragie's in my unit, yes.

582
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,191
Did you request that
Officer Cragie be in your TAC team?

583
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,355
I did not.

584
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:42,031
Sergeant, I have a department document
dated 24 September of last year.

585
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,457
It is a request by you to have
Officer Cragie transferred to another unit.

586
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,835
- Are you familiar with this document?
- I am.

587
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,793
Why did you request this transfer?

588
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:59,970
Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone
to look at the city's guts, Miss Partida.

589
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:04,925
Are you saying Officer Cragie
is not fit to work the streets of Chicago?

590
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:11,478
That's what I'm saying.

591
01:07:13,486 --> 01:07:16,439
Come on, lady. Give the guy a break.

592
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:29,083
- Fuck him? No, fuck you.
- Why are you arguing with him?

593
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:34,041
He took me off of tactical.
He didn't want me on tactical.

594
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:45,631
Operator, can you check
555-6610 for me, please?

595
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:48,340
The man's got his tongue
stuck to his asshole.

596
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:51,929
That don't bother him.
He's the fuckin' white knight.

597
01:07:52,064 --> 01:07:55,516
Sorry, sir. The number's out of service.
I'll report it...

598
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:02,693
Wanna take on the whole world by
yourself? Now's your chance, Cusack.

599
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,305
We just got here, sarge.

600
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:40,601
- He was a friend of yours, wasn't he?
- More than a friend.

601
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,866
- Where's the girl?
- There was nobody else.

602
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:02,423
Squad, this is 1462. I need backup.

603
01:09:02,549 --> 01:09:07,175
Have 64 and 63 from TAC 4 meet me at
the billiard parlour on 18th near Halsted.

604
01:09:07,303 --> 01:09:08,798
Ten-four, 1462.

605
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,050
Come in, 1463.

606
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:17,015
- 1463, come in.
- Come on, Brennan. Chowtime!

607
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:22,564
1463, you've got 1462 requesting backup.

608
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:26,228
Meet him at the pool hall,
18th and Halsted.

609
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:32,366
Unit 1463 here. We can't respond on that.
We got a drug purchase in progress.

610
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,782
Reassign that.

611
01:09:34,913 --> 01:09:39,207
Anybody got an assist car? We got a
oneBman TAC team going into a pool hall.

612
01:09:39,334 --> 01:09:42,917
5447, we've got a call
from zone 10 for a backup.

613
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:48,087
Tactical Sergeant 1462 needs assistance
at the pool hall at 18th and Halsted.

614
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:51,172
- He's a one-man unit.
- 5447.

615
01:09:51,304 --> 01:09:55,136
We got a dead dog blocking traffic.
We're waiting for Animal Control.

616
01:09:55,266 --> 01:09:58,967
1420. We're tailing a suspicious vehicle
southbound on 12th.

617
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:01,773
Jack, do you have a backup
for 18th and Halsted?

618
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:04,685
You heard what happened.
Who's gonna back him up?

619
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:06,940
You're playing games, Brennan.

620
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:11,861
If you wanna respond, take a cab. This car
ain't going noplace for that son of a bitch.

621
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:15,905
Zone 10, we're not getting
any help for car 62.

622
01:10:16,537 --> 01:10:20,119
Can somebody assist car 62? He's alone.

623
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,325
B Go, 20.
B You're breaking up.

624
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:24,784
We're going in for a radio check.

625
01:10:44,897 --> 01:10:46,605
You don't wanna be in here.

626
01:10:46,732 --> 01:10:50,351
If I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

627
01:11:18,555 --> 01:11:20,797
Where is he?

628
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:29,018
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- I want Luis, you fucking punk.

629
01:11:29,148 --> 01:11:31,818
You better get your ass outta here.

630
01:11:35,112 --> 01:11:36,144
Agh!

631
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:44,451
¡Ay!

632
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,323
Talk, asshole.

633
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:50,126
He's... he's on his way.

634
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:10,855
Who wants the first one?

635
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,399
You, amigo?

636
01:12:19,947 --> 01:12:21,987
How about you?

637
01:12:38,674 --> 01:12:40,915
Gun, cabrón.

638
01:13:03,072 --> 01:13:05,278
Take him apart.

639
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:50,944
Grab his legs. Grab his legs!

640
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:02,872
Victor!

641
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:09,713
Victor!

642
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,974
Save him.

643
01:14:27,737 --> 01:14:30,773
When the sun comes up,
you give me Luna

644
01:14:30,907 --> 01:14:33,065
or the girl dies...

645
01:14:33,618 --> 01:14:35,693
slowly.

646
01:14:40,124 --> 01:14:43,824
Este señor no comprende, ¿ eh?

647
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:50,378
You don't understand, Eddie? Told you,
man, don't fuck with the Comachos.

648
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:13,607
Eddie? Eddie?

649
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,238
Eddie!

650
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:20,408
Where the fuck is he?

651
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:34,753
Cusack!

652
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:44,014
Hey, Eddie.

653
01:15:45,395 --> 01:15:48,147
- Jesus Christ! Are you all right?
- I'll live.

654
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:51,309
Eddie, I'd have been here,
but those guys kept it from me.

655
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:55,392
I talked to a friend of mine, Maggie.
Works at the Federal Building.

656
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:58,447
- You're gonna die.
- They've got Diana Luna.

657
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:02,868
She got a wire that Tony Luna's been
laying his head down in Wisconsin,

658
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:08,036
and he's comin' in town tonight
at the Union Station at 10 o'clock.

659
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:11,957
Hey, Eddie!

660
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:13,463
Eddie!

661
01:17:03,845 --> 01:17:05,885
Hello, Uncle Felix.

662
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:10,764
You're a bad boy, Tony.
I told you, leave it alone.

663
01:17:10,894 --> 01:17:12,970
But no, you had to start this.

664
01:17:13,104 --> 01:17:15,180
You were always that way.

665
01:17:15,315 --> 01:17:18,185
You're like a kid.
You see something, you grab it.

666
01:17:21,446 --> 01:17:24,612
- Give it to me.
- For what?

667
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:36,329
I'm only here to cooperate.

668
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,163
There's someone with us, boss.

669
01:17:43,342 --> 01:17:45,500
Move it.

670
01:18:45,944 --> 01:18:47,936
Son of a bitch is crazy.

671
01:18:51,616 --> 01:18:53,655
Get rid of him.

672
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:10,127
- Don't fuck with me, old man.
- Tony! We won't hurt you.

673
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:17,396
You tell Luis... I've got Tony Luna.

674
01:20:18,616 --> 01:20:21,072
I want a time and a place.

675
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:27,245
Got it.

676
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:51,639
Cusack! Where are you going
with my car?

677
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:02,691
Hello, my angel.

678
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:05,490
Have you had a nice night?

679
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,075
I have wonderful news for you.
Look at me.

680
01:21:08,206 --> 01:21:10,245
Look at the man, huh?

681
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:15,080
Daddy's on his way.

682
01:21:15,212 --> 01:21:17,454
Pow! Pow! He's dead.

683
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:32,555
Beautiful job.
See the way it came across?

684
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:35,807
Keep an eye on that.
Watch - it'll be a pass to the right.

685
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:37,980
Hi, Eddie. How are you?

686
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,603
Eddie's a heck of a guy.

687
01:22:03,968 --> 01:22:09,970
You gotta learn about football. To learn
about me, you gotta learn about football.

688
01:22:35,415 --> 01:22:38,499
I want not one, but two guys up there.

689
01:22:39,335 --> 01:22:42,040
- How many guys you put up front?
- I got two up there.

690
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:45,006
Make it four.
We're gonna be prepared for anything.

691
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:47,919
I don't trust this son of a bitch.

692
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:50,721
- Victor, take the girl back.
- OK.

693
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,133
Got a present for Luna.

694
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:56,017
- I got two more guys up the middle.
- That's great.

695
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:58,301
Efren, come with me.

696
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:39,304
Victor, when this is over,
Luna goes back to Bogotá with me.

697
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:42,601
Donde me quieras, Luis. Estaré contigo.

698
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:03,372
I don't know.
I was watchin' films with my girl.

699
01:24:03,499 --> 01:24:07,082
Next thing I know,
he locked the door, took the truck.

700
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:09,749
- I don't know what happened.
- What's going on?

701
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,748
- Cusack took a truckload of armour.
- He's a fuckin' one-man army now.

702
01:24:13,884 --> 01:24:15,676
The son of a bitch is crazy.

703
01:24:15,803 --> 01:24:18,969
OK, everybody, no more games.
Where's Cusack?

704
01:24:19,098 --> 01:24:20,971
He's savin' the world.

705
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:45,570
Eddie's by himself and you guys
are gonna let him die? Fuck all of you.

706
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:48,376
- Hey, kid, cool it.
- Cool it?

707
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:52,878
No, no. You fuckin' cool it.
I ain't gonna lie for you any more.

708
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,377
He laid a gun on that kid.
I saw the whole...

709
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,259
You fuckin' little bastard!

710
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,669
- Cragie! Kopalas!
- Break it up!

711
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,470
What's this for, partner?
Your next fuck-up?

712
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,970
You'd better be straight, Kopalas.
Your badge is on the line.

713
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,473
If I can't do this right, you can have it.

714
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:17,401
Get someone in the air.
We're gonna find Cusack.

715
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:47,637
Get out there.

716
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:08,616
This is Kates. We got a TAC sergeant
in a green SWAT wagon.

717
01:26:08,745 --> 01:26:11,152
We're lookin' for him. Who's in the air?

718
01:26:11,289 --> 01:26:13,578
Citywide.
Calumet Skyway. 130...

719
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:04,289
Go get him!

720
01:27:04,423 --> 01:27:06,215
Move it!

721
01:27:23,483 --> 01:27:25,310
Get the girl!

722
01:28:10,862 --> 01:28:12,404
Argh!

723
01:29:52,752 --> 01:29:55,160
This concludes our demonstration.

724
01:29:55,296 --> 01:30:00,717
If you have further questions, our factory
representative will answer them.

725
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:09,551
Vámonos p'arriba.

726
01:31:02,778 --> 01:31:06,063
Get up, you son of a bitch.
Get the fuck up!

727
01:31:20,795 --> 01:31:23,749
Come on, Eddie.
We told you we'd get you.

728
01:31:28,469 --> 01:31:30,509
Come on, asshole!

729
01:31:30,638 --> 01:31:32,631
Come on, Pompas. We got him.

730
01:31:32,765 --> 01:31:35,303
Come on out, you chickenshit.

731
01:31:53,952 --> 01:31:56,194
Come on, you bastard!

732
01:31:56,329 --> 01:31:58,369
Come on, Luis. We got him.

733
01:31:58,498 --> 01:32:00,289
Pompas!

734
01:32:00,417 --> 01:32:02,409
Efren!

735
01:32:03,044 --> 01:32:04,242
Argh!

736
01:32:53,676 --> 01:32:56,345
Cusack, you just killed that girl!

737
01:35:05,929 --> 01:35:07,968
You know where to find me.

738
01:35:25,155 --> 01:35:27,777
Hey, Eddie.

739
01:35:27,908 --> 01:35:30,778
Hey, partner. I got a great idea.

740
01:35:31,703 --> 01:35:34,823
Mail-order Christmas trees.

741
01:35:34,956 --> 01:35:36,996
Think about it.

742
01:35:41,296 --> 01:35:43,538
See you tomorrow?

743
01:35:53,516 --> 01:35:55,555
Yeah.
