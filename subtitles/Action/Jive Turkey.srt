1
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,422
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Tripoli,

2
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,724
where the time is 8:15pm

3
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,993
and the temperature
is a mild 82 degrees.

4
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:14,662
We ask you to please be patient with
our security procedures on the ground

5
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,500
and wish you a pleasant evening.

6
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,894
Oh, please, Chuck, none of that.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

7
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,857
I'm praying you've got good news for me.
How did it all go?

8
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,565
<i>The mission to assassinate
the Libyan dictator has failed, ma'am.</i>

9
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,129
I'm sorry.

10
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,070
Well, that's it, then.

11
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,204
The last roll of the dice
and it comes up snake eyes.

12
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,806
Thank you for your efforts.

13
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:23,546
It was always gonna be a long shot,
ma'am.

14
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:31,424
Now that we have exhausted
your final option, Madam President,

15
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,893
have you made a decision on mine?

16
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,022
I have.

17
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:41,927
Reluctantly,
and with a most heavy heart,

18
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:47,408
I am faced with no other option but to
support your position, General Thatcher.

19
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,511
We are going to war.

20
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,271
Fuck it! Fuckin', fuckin' outrageous!

21
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:42,903
I guess that means no needle.

22
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,744
<i>If only, asshole.</i>

23
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,616
We'd love to see you good and dead
like the innocents you slaughtered.

24
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:56,280
But your friend has pulled some strings.

25
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:58,657
I don't have any friends.

26
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,855
Oh, no?

27
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:04,421
It says here old Ironguts himself
has signed off on your release.

28
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:06,365
I thought Thatcher was dead.

29
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,027
Well, you thought wrong.

30
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:11,265
It'll take more than a stroke
to kill that old warrior.

31
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:12,967
Sign there.

32
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,476
There and there.

33
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,012
He's all yours.

34
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,974
So, Mr Tyler -

35
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,816
Rick -

36
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,344
let's make a deal.

37
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:03,415
I'm Meredith Baxter,
Senior VP with the network.

38
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Given the circumstances, I won't shake
your hand but consider us well-met.

39
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:08,886
What is this?

40
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,197
I'm the Executive Producer
of the most successful show on earth

41
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,999
and... you're our new star.

42
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:21,168
So now, just a quick briefing
and we're ready to play.

43
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,941
Mr Tyler.

44
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,674
Rick.

45
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,876
I'm fucking this puppy -

46
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:33,513
he's just lifting its tail,
so, stay with me, please.

47
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:38,624
Turkey Shoot's the game,
and you're the Turkey.

48
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:43,631
The game has three levels
and hidden in each level is this box.

49
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,633
You have a GPS with its coordinates

50
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,794
and the lock is activated
by your thumbprint.

51
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:50,394
So, here's the deal.

52
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:54,807
Locate and open the box within the time
limit, and proceed to the next level.

53
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,470
Run out of time, and you're eliminated.

54
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:01,641
Open all three boxes...
you win your freedom.

55
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,707
Eliminated?

56
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,813
It sounds a lot nicer than dead,
but that's what we're talking about.

57
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,914
Life and death.

58
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,991
- What the fuck is that?

59
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,962
Just a mild sedative
to introduce a tracking device

60
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,626
so the cameras can always find you.

61
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,159
Level 1 has four shooters,

62
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,899
with double that amount
introduced each level.

63
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:30,002
Their job is to hunt and kill you -
no prisoners, no mercy.

64
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,479
Of course, you can return the favor.

65
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,411
Any questions?

66
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,149
What if I don't play'?

67
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,317
Then you'll be a sitting duck.

68
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,952
I studied your file, Rick.

69
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,097
You survived combat, suicide missions,

70
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:57,003
attempts on your life in prison,
even a bullet in the head.

71
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:02,508
A guy like you...
just isn't wired to give up.

72
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,205
You might even be our first winner.

73
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,615
So... do we have a deal?

74
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,614
What's in the box'?

75
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,484
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

76
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,659
Sleep now.

77
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:32,240
When you wake... it's game on.

78
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,683
Real criminals, real life, real time!

79
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,153
You're watching smash hit event TV,

80
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:52,388
coming at you right here, right now,

81
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,361
wherever you are!

82
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:58,264
- Turkey Shoot!

83
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,927
It's live... with death.

84
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:13,872
Now let's give it up
for your hosts... Tom and Teena!

85
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,842
I'm Teena Fine.

86
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,376
And I'm Tom Faye.

87
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:21,013
Welcome to Turkey Shoot.

88
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:24,082
Teena, last week's Turkey
just not up to the challenge.

89
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,855
That's right, Tom.

90
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:28,260
Convicted multiple murderess,
Olga Rashenko...

91
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,924
- ..dubbed 'Satan's Babysitter'...

92
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,561
Straight from death row
in Russia's notorious Vladimir Prison,

93
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,593
Teena, and playing for a pardon.

94
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:41,041
Stumbled on the first level,
and didn't that make you happy?

95
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:51,242
This time,
she met something a lot tougher

96
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,777
than 14 defenceless children, Tom.

97
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,656
That's right. She forgot one of
the golden rules of Turkey Shoot...

98
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:03,228
And what is that rule'?

99
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,392
Remember Ramrod!

100
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:06,958
You got it.

101
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,903
You should never forget
our most successful shooter ever.

102
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,496
With 85 kills...

103
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:13,063
86 now, Teena.

104
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:16,270
Deadly from a mile, with a lethal smile.

105
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,678
When he's in the game,
get ready for pain.

106
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,943
The world's greatest marksman...

107
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,507
Ramrod!

108
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:26,281
Ramrod! Ramrod! Ramrod! Ramrod!

109
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:30,314
Afghanistan, Korea ll, World War Africa.

110
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,690
The stats are unanimous, people.

111
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,788
50,000 rounds expended
for every military kill.

112
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,766
Now, the elite sniper...

113
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,531
one round, one kill.

114
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:47,006
The deadliest weapon in warfare...

115
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,703
You're looking at him.

116
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,874
Congratulations, Ramrod!
You just keep extending your record.

117
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,781
Just doing my job, sir.

118
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:58,308
86 in the trash.

119
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,343
Don't be so modest, Ramrod.

120
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:05,189
As the successful shooter, you're
now in Game 177, to do it all again.

121
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,819
Looking forward, ma'am.

122
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,330
Where you'll be joined
by three new shooters,

123
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,196
as voted by our viewers worldwide.

124
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,826
That's right, Tom.

125
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:17,498
The count is done and the results
are tallied, as smartphone voted by you!

126
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,666
Individual territory charges applicable.

127
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:23,303
Meet the shooters
for Turkey Shoot, Game 177.

128
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,544
The USA has voted Alpha!

129
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,041
He's deadly with
primo weaponry.

130
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,645
Alpha!

131
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,520
Ooh... I love that guy.

132
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:41,154
Japan has elected Kintay -

133
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,892
martial arts and ninja
smarts are her thing.

134
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,422
Kintay!

135
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,092
Awesome!

136
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:52,670
And the Middle East
is unanimous for Golgotha!

137
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:56,268
He loves it up close and
personal with a blade.

138
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,243
Golgotha!

139
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,612
What a beast! Ramrod'?

140
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,514
Good men all, sir - including her.

141
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,577
OK, Tom, the suspense <i>is</i> killing me.

142
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,590
Just who is our new Turkey?

143
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,389
Teena,
we've got someone very special for 177.

144
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,293
He's a decorated soldier,

145
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:20,232
court-martialled three years ago
for massacring women and children.

146
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,894
He's Rick Tyler!

147
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,371
- Disgraced former Navy SEAL...

148
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:27,432
currently incarcerated
at Nee-Alcatraz Military Prison,

149
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,933
where he's serving life,
plus a thousand years, for war crimes.

150
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,379
My God! How can he live with himself?

151
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,441
He maintains
he has no memory of the killings, Teena,

152
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,213
after being shot in the head.

153
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,243
Uh-huh.

154
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:44,952
So, Ramrod, a fellow soldier.
What do you say to that?

155
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,325
Navy SEAL is Marine for 'pussy'.

156
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,920
- Oh... Ramrod!

157
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm a jarhead, Torn.

158
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:55,931
I say hoorah! Bring it.

159
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,566
You heard it from the man.
It's game on!

160
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,475
With nothing but the clothes
on his back and a GPS,

161
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,000
Turkey 177 will be dropped

162
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,274
into the
Appalachian Mountains rainforest,

163
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,339
approximately four miles
from the target.

164
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:13,113
While avoiding four shooters
with a license to kill.

165
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,418
Now...

166
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:18,324
- Are you...
- Ready to play'?

167
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,294
It's time to go live on Level 1,

168
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,961
for a rumble in the jungle,
where an ex-Navy SEAL takes on...

169
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:29,993
Ramrod,

170
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,767
Alpha.

171
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:35,469
Golgotha and Kintay

172
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:41,972
in Game 177 of Turkey Shoot!

173
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:44,815
It's live... with death.

174
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,051
Agh!

175
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:44,184
Aghhh!

176
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,612
Fuck!

177
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:33,601
Agh!

178
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,798
Tricked that asshole.

179
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:07,061
You ain't gonna make it, SEAL.

180
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,374
Fuckin' numbnuts.

181
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,914
I'd like some water, please.

182
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,025
Got yourself a nice little hide-out.

183
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:50,439
You've gone soft, Llewyn. And stupid.

184
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,636
It's 'Ramrod' now.

185
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,740
What kind of fuckin' name is that'?

186
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,978
That's cheating.

187
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:03,250
That's the perks for being number one.

188
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,621
Plus they really want you dead.

189
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,322
They'?

190
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:10,057
The powers that be.

191
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:11,588
Thatcher?

192
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,600
Even if I knew...

193
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,961
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

194
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,131
That's not very righteous.

195
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,270
What happened to you'?

196
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:28,840
Money, fame.

197
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:32,018
See, I'm a celebrity now.

198
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,647
What are you'?

199
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,783
The killer of women and children.

200
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,622
Isn't that what you said at my trial?

201
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,594
At least you remember that.

202
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,653
They shoulda offed you in the brig.

203
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,861
They tried - they died.

204
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,925
Don't do it.

205
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,872
I can tell you things
you don't remember.

206
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,805
You didn't kill those kids.

207
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:59,339
The massacre - you were framed.

208
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,972
One minute remaining.

209
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:05,281
59, 58...

210
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,945
You're not going to make it, SEAL.

211
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:08,478
57, 56...

212
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,457
- I'll see you on the next level.
- ..55...

213
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,049
Not if I see you first.

214
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:13,650
53...

215
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:18,688
34, 33, 32, 31...

216
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,395
30 seconds remaining.

217
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:25,200
18,17,16,

218
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:30,836
15,14,13,12,11...

219
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,312
10 seconds remaining.

220
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:37,181
9, <i>8,</i> 7, 6...

221
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,270
At ease, Commander.

222
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:36,938
Did you bring it?

223
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,983
Bunch of Nazis in this place.

224
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,085
It is a hospital, sir.

225
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:59,259
It's a filthy habit,
but when your days are numbered,

226
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:02,895
you have to do what you want,
whatever the consequences.

227
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,798
Did you watch it'?

228
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,776
Yes, sir.

229
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:12,404
I thought he looked good, considering.

230
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,582
I didn't recognise Sergeant Llewyn.

231
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,175
Ramrod?

232
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,089
He's different since the trial.

233
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,151
Profiting from death changes a person.

234
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,457
So, you know we're sending in
a team to finish the job'?

235
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:34,263
Yes, sir.

236
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,798
I want you to pilot the chopper.

237
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:42,473
Now, we both know that
Commander Tyler is a good soldier

238
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:45,638
who would never divulge
classified intelligence,

239
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:50,879
but my colleagues consider him a
loose end - and loose ends come undone.

240
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:57,487
Commander... it is imperative
to the security of this nation

241
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:59,515
that Rick Tyler be silenced.

242
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,186
I can't tell you any more

243
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,163
but know this position
is unanimous across command

244
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:07,190
and goes right to the very top.

245
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,724
Do you read me?

246
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,464
In triplicate, sir.

247
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:16,132
He should have died in that massacre.

248
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:20,139
But if you want a clusterfuck,
send in the Marines.

249
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,509
I don't understand, sir.

250
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,985
What's not to understand, Commander?

251
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,752
We framed Rick Tyler.

252
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,347
They say only
the pure of heart sleep well.

253
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,578
- Relax.

254
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,383
It's a cocktail
of vitamins and antibiotics.

255
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,519
It's cheating, I know, but I want you
to give Level <i>2</i> your best shot.

256
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,420
How do you feel?

257
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,295
Water.

258
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:23,367
Decapitation, self-surgery,
that thing with the arrow -

259
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,573
Game 177, so far, so amazing.

260
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:28,047
The audience like you.

261
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,244
No-one's retired
this many shooters before.

262
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:34,811
You've even been voted a classic-kill
and you're not even halfway through.

263
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,823
You haven't seen anything yet.

264
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:39,620
Really?

265
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,118
When I get Llewyn on the next level,
make sure all cameras are pointed at us.

266
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,496
Ramrod.

267
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:47,500
What is it with you two'?

268
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,928
Wait and see.

269
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:58,135
Tonight,
following the News At Ten,

270
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,306
a special report.

271
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,340
World War Africa -
a continent in meltdown...

272
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,278
"with the President..."

273
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,586
The Libyan dictator
must be removed.

274
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,182
..her allies...

275
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:17,162
I fully support my American counterpart
in our joint endeavors in Africa.

276
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,427
“the Libyan dictator...

277
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,334
and the consequences.

278
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:31,307
That's tonight,
after the News At Ten.

279
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,974
But now,
what you've all been waiting for...

280
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:41,386
Real criminals, real life, real time!

281
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:45,856
You're watching smash hit event TV,

282
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:50,125
coming at you right here, right now,

283
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,063
wherever you are!

284
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:55,992
Turkey Shoot!

285
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,664
It's live... with death.

286
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:11,573
Now let's give it up
for your hosts... Tom and Teena!

287
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:17,551
- I'm Teena Fine.
- And I'm Tom Faye.

288
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,183
Welcome to Turkey Shoot.

289
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:23,822
Teena, Turkey 177 - an army of one.

290
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:25,525
You're not kidding, Tom.

291
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,693
Ex-Navy SEAL Rick Tyler...

292
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:30,863
Currently serving life
plus a thousand for war crimes

293
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,429
and playing for his freedom...

294
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:36,567
"has embarrassed the best shooter
in the game to progress to Level 2!"

295
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:40,045
I'm betting our Marine
will have a new respect for SEAL skills

296
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,570
after Level 1, folks.

297
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:45,415
And the bearded beast,
also no match for Turkey Tyler.

298
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,547
Ditto Alpha.
He sure got an unexpected headjob.

299
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:56,189
And the deadly and beautiful Kintay,
a victim of friendly fire.

300
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:57,788
Ohh...

301
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:00,857
- So, now only Ramrod to the next level.

302
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:05,565
Where he'll be joined by more shooters,
as voted by our viewers worldwide.

303
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,575
Yes, Teena,
the count's done, the results tallied,

304
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:10,099
as smartphone voted by you!

305
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,203
Individual territory charges applicable.

306
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,612
Meet the shooters for Level 2.

307
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:20,076
Greater Europe's gone Viking
with Haakon.

308
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:23,089
- My, my, that's a big one.
-  Haakon! Haakon!

309
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,613
Haakon!

310
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,627
This guy is a lethal weapon.

311
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,663
Australasia ﬂips for Killshot.

312
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,996
<i>She puts the 'hun' into machinegun.</i>

313
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,933
Killshot! Killshot!

314
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,938
- Killshot!
- What do you think, folks'?

315
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:44,134
Neo Korea
explodes for Armageddon!

316
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,669
He's dyno-mite!

317
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,772
Armageddon!

318
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,806
Armageddon excited!

319
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:55,183
Well, get ready
for maximum excitement, Teena,

320
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:58,781
because we've also got some
very extra special guest shooters

321
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,418
for Level 2.

322
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:05,262
Four crack Navy SEALs
from the disgraced Turkey's own platoon.

323
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,857
- Wow!

324
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:08,765
They want some payback?

325
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,326
You got it, Tom.

326
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,364
They've got an axe to grind...
in the Turkey's skull. Lieutenant?

327
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:17,535
We've got a big chit to cash
with that mass-murdering son of a bitch.

328
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,169
He brought disgrace on the SEALs.

329
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:23,650
I can promise you now, we won't
stand down until honor's restored

330
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:27,119
and the chit's paid... in blood.

331
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:30,988
You heard it from the man.
These guys want vengeance!

332
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:33,823
It's gonna be all-out war!

333
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:36,455
With the added advantage
of a pair of boots,

334
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:39,022
Turkey 177 will wake
in the San Diego Docklands,

335
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,159
approximately one mile from the target.

336
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,465
He has exactly 90 minutes
to reach his goal,

337
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:47,634
while avoiding eight killers, armed to
the teeth and out for his blood.

338
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:49,233
Now...

339
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:52,835
- Are you...
- Ready to play'?

340
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:56,680
It's time to go live
in an eight-to-one showdown

341
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,582
when Rick Tyler takes on...

342
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,917
Ramrod, Haakon,

343
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:05,481
Killshot, Armageddon

344
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:08,825
and four SEALs on Level 2 of...

345
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,729
Turkey Shoot!

346
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,859
It's live... with death.

347
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:53,290
Say hello to my little friends.

348
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,185
Ha!

349
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,431
Keep tight, keep tight.

350
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,573
OK, keep... keep tight, come on.

351
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,943
Two exits here.
Two exits, I got two.

352
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:23,105
Clear!

353
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,080
Open season!

354
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,489
Yahh!

355
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,989
Aghh.

356
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,067
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

357
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,863
Clear!

358
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:23,670
Keep tight.

359
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,383
- Clear.
- Clear.

360
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,100
- Agh!

361
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,206
- Clear.
- Clear.

362
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:40,878
Contact!

363
00:42:42,277 --> 00:42:44,154
Pursue! Pursue!

364
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,385
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Forward! Forward!

365
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,255
Target! Target!

366
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,936
Left and right, left and right.

367
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:11,141
Fall back! Fall back!

368
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,516
Get down!

369
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,089
Target!

370
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,767
Keep tight, keep tight.

371
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:40,780
- Keep tight, keep tight, come on.
- Go through. Go through.

372
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,939
- Keep moving, just keep moving.
- Clear.

373
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:52,485
- Agh!
- Are you alright?

374
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:56,458
Get back, get back. Get outta there.

375
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,361
Keep tight, keep tight, come on.

376
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,664
Guys, keep together. Keep working
the sides, keep working the sides.

377
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:07,129
Keep moving, keep moving.

378
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:08,664
Clear.

379
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,507
Come on, keep together.
We're splitting up here.

380
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:16,239
Man down!

381
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,647
<i>Go, go, 90, 90, go!</i>

382
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:21,483
Go, go, go!

383
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:23,318
Man down! Man down!

384
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,317
Get him out of here,
get him out.

385
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,392
You fuckin' piece of shit.

386
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:45,371
<i>Go, go, 90, 90, go!</i>

387
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:38,787
Fucker.

388
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:57,173
Fucker.

389
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,860
Now, you fucker...

390
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,473
Fuck it!

391
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:57,840
Commander Wilson?

392
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,707
What the fuck is going on here?

393
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,011
What's it look like?
I just saved your ass.

394
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,542
Shit!

395
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,651
Putting her down.

396
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,755
Excuse me, sir,
we have a military emergency.

397
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,383
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

398
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:48,416
Yes, ma'am. Is that a Black Hawk?

399
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,690
I need you to stay here
with the Black Hawk, sir,

400
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:52,220
while we take your vehicle.

401
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:54,392
- Terrorists?
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

402
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,628
- I just filled her up.
- Your country thanks you, sir.

403
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,466
That was easy.

404
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:07,103
Hard word gets them every time.

405
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,206
One minute remaining.

406
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:11,046
- Piece of fuckin' shit!
- ..59...

407
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,915
Christ, you stink.

408
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,214
And you look like shit.

409
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:19,282
So is this part of the Turkey Shoot
as well?

410
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,784
Fuck Turkey Shoot. 24 hours ago, I was
happy for you to rot in jail forever.

411
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,321
Then I found out
you didn't kill those children.

412
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,259
Found out?

413
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,668
Thatcher told me
you were framed for the massacre.

414
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:35,264
He told you'?

415
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:37,276
The question is, why'?

416
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:39,073
Why were you framed'?

417
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,179
Hey, I just ruined
a brilliant career for you, asshole.

418
00:48:44,238 --> 00:48:45,945
You owe me an answer.

419
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:49,812
Tell me.

420
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,516
Hick?

421
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:59,962
I assassinated the Libyan dictator
two weeks before the invasion.

422
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:04,133
A black op, on the President's orders.

423
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:06,263
Her last-ditch effort to avoid war.

424
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,669
He's dead'?

425
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,704
I watched his head explode.

426
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:21,275
But the Libyans put in a double,
like we knew they would.

427
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:24,779
But the Generals told the President
that my mission was a failure.

428
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:26,655
Thatcher wanted war.

429
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:28,524
And you're the loose end.

430
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,122
The only one besides them
who knows the truth.

431
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:34,792
I can't believe it.

432
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:39,202
This whole shitty war is about
killing someone who's already dead.

433
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:43,809
- Why didn't you try and say something?
- I didn't have any proof.

434
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:46,573
- But at your trial you could've...
- Who would you believe?

435
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:48,739
A psychopathic killer
of women and children,

436
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:50,840
or four-star generals?

437
00:49:57,478 --> 00:49:59,549
We've got to deal with
that tracking device

438
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,685
or we'll never even
make it out of the county.

439
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,708
Wrap this around you.

440
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:36,720
Will this work'?

441
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:41,461
If it doesn't, it's been nice
seeing you again, Commander.

442
00:50:41,522 --> 00:50:43,297
Likewise, Commander.

443
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,970
Sorry I got angry before.

444
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:49,872
It's a lot to take in.

445
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,702
Somethings still bothering me.

446
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,044
Why did Thatcher tell you
I was innocent?

447
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,448
He never does anything without a reason.

448
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:03,548
I'll be sure to ask him,
right before I kill him.

449
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:07,650
Go back to sleep
while I find us a motel.

450
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:12,097
Whatever happens, thank you.

451
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:18,494
You're welcome, Rick.

452
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:45,287
I don't care if his tumor
is having a triple fucking bypass,

453
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,095
you tell his people
if I don't speak with General Thatcher

454
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:52,093
in the next 15 minutes,
he's gonna wish he was dead.

455
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:08,112
Good morning, Meredith.

456
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:09,678
Where is he, General?

457
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,519
I'm not too bad, thank you for asking.

458
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,719
Don't fuck with me, Thatcher.
Where's my Turkey?

459
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:17,558
Calm down, Meredith,
I've got my best people on it.

460
00:52:17,618 --> 00:52:21,191
Don't patronise me, you asshole.
I know you're behind this.

461
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,826
I thought we had a deal.

462
00:52:22,857 --> 00:52:25,736
I had nothing to do with it.
One of my people went rogue.

463
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:27,363
These things happen.

464
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:30,706
This is television, Chuck,
nothing happens on television -

465
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,369
not on my network.

466
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,074
We'll find him, Meredith.
You have my word on that.

467
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:37,844
If I don't get him back
within the next 12 hours, General,

468
00:52:37,872 --> 00:52:40,375
that cancer of yours
is going to have to get in line,

469
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,410
because I will fucking bury you.

470
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:00,092
Knee reconstruction - metal pins.

471
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:06,594
Nothing there?

472
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:08,300
Keep moving, soldier.

473
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,611
Bullet.

474
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,593
- Metal plate.

475
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,689
Roll over.

476
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,538
Anything there?

477
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,343
Not that I know of.

478
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:57,546
Found it.

479
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,404
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

480
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:17,067
This is gonna hurt you
a lot more than me.

481
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,638
Oh, fuck!

482
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,812
Gotcha.

483
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,059
Now...

484
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,564
hold still.

485
00:56:13,888 --> 00:56:19,304
32 seconds - you manipulate it
well, my dear, like part of your body.

486
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,237
It is my own design.

487
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,640
Yes, a very nice piece. Mm.

488
00:56:23,697 --> 00:56:25,699
And what did you bring
for the hunt, Tito?

489
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:27,371
Something excessive, I imagine.

490
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:28,971
Of course, my dear.

491
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:34,952
After all, excess is what makes
life worth living for people like us.

492
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,046
If I had more men like you
in the department,

493
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:40,149
I wouldn't have all these problems
with these blasted deviants.

494
00:56:40,214 --> 00:56:44,162
Yes, sir. Kill 'em.
No fancy stuff - just kill 'em all.

495
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:46,664
- What took you so long?
- The ultimate solution.

496
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,791
Food, clothes.
- You're a sharp man.

497
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,627
And I got us a car.

498
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,799
Anything you want, sir,
just let me know.

499
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,330
Hitler...

500
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:57,899
Are you having any?

501
00:56:57,932 --> 00:56:59,468
I'm gonna take a shower.

502
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,141
It's an amazing twist
in an amazing game, Tom.

503
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,414
You said it, Teena.
The Turkey's gone and the hunt is on!

504
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:11,617
And just who is this mysterious
blonde bombshell helping him?

505
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:15,149
She's been identified
as Commander Jillian Wilson,

506
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:20,188
a fellow Navy SEAL and an ace
chopper pilot - as if we didn't know!

507
00:57:20,254 --> 00:57:22,461
And check the live stats, people.

508
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,631
Rick Tyler's approval rating
is off the charts.

509
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:29,163
Wow!

510
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,143
You guys are really liking this Turkey.

511
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,841
We all love a man
who can take charge, Tom.

512
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,713
But let's not forget
what Rick Tyler is, Teena -

513
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:41,810
a cold-blooded killer
of innocent women and children.

514
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:45,813
Even battle-hardened veterans
were shocked by the insane bloodlust

515
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:50,317
exhibited in one of the worst rogue
killing sprees ever seen in combat.

516
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:54,390
That single act of merciless carnage,
perpetrated against unarmed...

517
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,204
For three years,
I thought that fuck was me.

518
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:09,546
I remember the kids, the village
and waking up in a hospital in Germany.

519
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,585
I can't remember the massacre.
But I knew I was guilty.

520
00:58:20,848 --> 00:58:22,555
Now you know the truth.

521
00:58:24,051 --> 00:58:25,758
Being innocent doesn't matter.

522
00:58:26,854 --> 00:58:28,527
Knowing you can do it...

523
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,171
I've killed a lot of people, Jill,
and felt nothing.

524
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,514
Maybe I don't have a heart.

525
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,512
Which hospital is he in'?

526
00:59:57,578 --> 00:59:59,580
There is no way
I'm taking you there.

527
00:59:59,613 --> 01:00:01,593
The place will be crawling
with security.

528
01:00:01,615 --> 01:00:03,754
That's never stopped me before.

529
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:06,162
Don't be crazy.
Thatcher's not worth it.

530
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,188
I wanna see him.

531
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:11,429
I mean it, Rick, it's too dangerous.
Just forget the General.

532
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,994
Let's disappear.

533
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,267
You realise he's planned
this whole thing.

534
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:18,037
- He wants me to get to him.
- Bullshit.

535
01:00:18,098 --> 01:00:20,305
He knows you, Jill, and he knows me.

536
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:22,007
He knew you'd do something.

537
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,639
He's crippled and helpless.

538
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,651
You know what that means for
a guy like him? He's already in hell.

539
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:28,846
Killing him is just doing him a favor.

540
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:31,550
I'm not gonna kill him -
it's not about revenge anymore.

541
01:00:31,612 --> 01:00:33,285
Then what's it about?

542
01:00:33,313 --> 01:00:35,020
I don't know.

543
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,390
Shit!

544
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:48,629
Fuck!

545
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:52,702
Hold On!

546
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,269
Breaking news this hour.
I'm Pete Sanchez.

547
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:31,714
Chaos in the downtown tunnels
as authorities pursue a high-speed chase

548
01:01:31,738 --> 01:01:35,015
causing a score of pile-ups
and creating gridlock across the city.

549
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:36,544
Police say the vehicle,

550
01:01:36,577 --> 01:01:40,354
believed to contain the mass murderer
whose dramatic escape from Turkey Shoot

551
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,882
has amazed the world,

552
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:44,225
has been lost
in the serpentine transit system.

553
01:01:44,251 --> 01:01:47,596
Crossing now to the network's
eye in the sky for live developments.

554
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,123
Here's Gina Jones.

555
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:50,691
Thanks, Pete.

556
01:01:50,724 --> 01:01:53,933
The network can report
that the chase is back on,

557
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:56,635
after the
pale-or white-colored vehicle,

558
01:01:56,697 --> 01:02:01,908
believed to contain escaped Turkey
Rick Tyler and his beautiful accomplice,

559
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:05,747
dramatically reappeared at the L21 exit.

560
01:02:17,918 --> 01:02:21,092
Dr Schwartz,
please report to Oncology.

561
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:26,161
SEAL Commander
Jillian Wilson surrendered to police

562
01:02:26,226 --> 01:02:27,933
after a crash ended the chase.

563
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:31,340
But the convicted mass murderer
remains at large this hour,

564
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:33,844
as a manhunt continues downtown.

565
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,437
It is believed
Turkey Shoot escapee Rick Tyler

566
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,973
exited somewhere
in the cover of the tunnel system

567
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,418
when the vehicle was lost
for over 20 minutes.

568
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:43,284
Authorities...

569
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,794
I've been expecting you, son.

570
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,801
I know. Why'?

571
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,865
Can't a dying old man say he's sorry?

572
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:02,497
Fuck you.

573
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:08,045
<i>The President's mission was impossible.
You were meant to fail.</i>

574
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:15,178
I cannot let World War Africa
be my legacy.

575
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,155
It has got to end.

576
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:20,215
And here you are.

577
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:25,525
We buried your mission, Commander,
but we couldn't bury you.

578
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,395
You're too good a soldier.

579
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:36,665
I have got the blood of millions
on my hands.

580
01:03:36,697 --> 01:03:40,474
I'd like the chance
to wash a little of it off.

581
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,037
I'm sending you
on one last mission, soldier.

582
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,812
What the fuck makes you think
I'd do anything for you?

583
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,255
Because you can end this war
and you can clear your name.

584
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:58,554
Unit 226, rails bag storage downtown.

585
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,691
Three years ago,
I stashed a little insurance policy

586
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:03,929
and now it's time to cash it in.

587
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,594
I'd do it myself,

588
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:09,835
but you know as well as I do
I'm not gonna leave this room alive.

589
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:13,871
Hubris, Commander.

590
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,211
I went to bed
the most powerful man in the country

591
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:19,877
and woke up wearing a fuckin' diaper.

592
01:04:24,044 --> 01:04:26,923
Don't worry - I can't feel it.

593
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,551
I'm not worried.

594
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:31,358
The lock is thumbprint activated.

595
01:04:31,385 --> 01:04:35,800
And inside that unit is the truth to
bring down the whole stinking mess.

596
01:04:35,856 --> 01:04:40,771
But you have got to get it to the
right people - people who won't bury it.

597
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,906
Would you do me the honor, son'?

598
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:48,572
It'd be righteous coming from you.

599
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,082
It'd be righteous coming from you.

600
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,612
I started a war
that has become a monster.

601
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,386
You have to end it.

602
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:03,086
That's an order.

603
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:11,617
I told you, no calls.

604
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:14,454
I have the President
of the network, ma'am.

605
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,016
Put him through.

606
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,596
Jeremy! How are you'?

607
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,191
I don't know, Meredith. You tell me.

608
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:26,466
Well, the Chinese were very receptive,
like we knew they would be.

609
01:07:26,526 --> 01:07:28,597
I'm talking about Turkey Shoot.

610
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:32,475
You've seen the numbers?

611
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:36,036
Through the roof. Congratulations.

612
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:42,151
I must say, it really was a masterstroke
on your part staging that escape.

613
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:45,451
That blonde chopper pilot - genius.

614
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,288
Thank you, sir. It's all going to plan.

615
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:49,817
Really?

616
01:07:49,883 --> 01:07:53,057
Because I just got off the line
to the Joint Chiefs.

617
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:55,293
It appears our friend
is no longer with us.

618
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,563
Thatcher committed suicide an hour ago.

619
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:02,638
I hope the rats
aren't deserting the ship, Meredith.

620
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,768
His illness was weighing heavy
upon him, sir.

621
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,779
He knew there was no hope.

622
01:08:08,802 --> 01:08:10,611
Warriors make bad invalids.

623
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:12,639
But they make good Turkeys, sir.

624
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:16,313
And Rick Tyler is about to take
this network to a whole new level.

625
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,846
Well, I can't argue
with the stats, Meredith.

626
01:08:18,912 --> 01:08:22,917
Hell, even the afternoon news
is getting a bump from this guy.

627
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:24,587
When the numbers plateau,

628
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:27,599
we'll stage his recapture
and then we'll go to Level 3.

629
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:30,261
It's going to be
history in the making, sir.

630
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,361
So, everything's under control?

631
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:35,167
Absolutely. No question.

632
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,801
Then keep up the good work, Meredith.

633
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:40,107
I'll have my girl set up a dinner.

634
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:41,703
Thank you, sir.

635
01:08:52,112 --> 01:08:53,682
I have your PA, ma'am.

636
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,215
Speak.

637
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:58,887
The police
cornered him downtown, ma'am.

638
01:08:58,952 --> 01:09:00,898
Yes?

639
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:02,627
They got him.

640
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:04,158
And?

641
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,965
He's been shot.

642
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:14,711
Breaking news this hour.
I'm Pete Sanchez.

643
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:17,840
The past Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
General Charles Thatcher,

644
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:19,748
has died at Madigan Memorial Hospital.

645
01:09:19,806 --> 01:09:23,379
The network can reveal the <i>cause</i>
of death is a single gunshot wound.

646
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,651
No further details
are available at this time,

647
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,421
but the President scheduled
a hasty press conference.

648
01:09:28,481 --> 01:09:33,157
For those of you who say
World War Africa has gone on too long,

649
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:37,999
I say to you, liberation day is near!

650
01:09:38,024 --> 01:09:41,403
Victory is within our grasp!

651
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:59,285
Bravo, Rick.

652
01:10:00,547 --> 01:10:03,084
Exceptional.

653
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,723
That buzzing in your head's the taser,
but it'll fade.

654
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:08,391
What's going on?

655
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:10,298
You mean what's going up?

656
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,369
The ratings, mister.

657
01:10:13,393 --> 01:10:19,400
The last 24 hours have made Turkey Shoot
the fastest trending show in TV history.

658
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,469
<i>You're a bona fide superstar.</i>

659
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:24,606
And that's why
we're going to give you Level 2.

660
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,310
Wilson?

661
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:28,579
She's in jail.

662
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:31,589
But she's OK... for now.

663
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,724
So... Mr Tyler,

664
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:39,321
Rick...

665
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,626
let's make a deal.

666
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,659
No-one's ever gotten this far.

667
01:10:45,725 --> 01:10:49,434
Our tracking estimates
Turkey Shoot 177 Final Level

668
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:54,070
will be bigger than a Super Bowl
and a Royal wedding combined.

669
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,943
You're a game changer, Rick.

670
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:59,280
The audience love you in the real world.

671
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:03,447
So we want you to finish the game
in the real world.

672
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:05,080
Excited?

673
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:06,852
No.

674
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:12,293
Your girlfriend's facing a court martial

675
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:16,198
and, I promise you,
I will make them throw away the key.

676
01:11:16,256 --> 01:11:20,671
Or... I can make it all
go away just like that.

677
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:23,297
All you gotta do is play.

678
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,347
She helped you, Rick, have a heart.

679
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:34,614
Save your girlfriend, finish the game.

680
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:39,817
Win or lose?

681
01:11:42,782 --> 01:11:44,557
You got yourself a deal.

682
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:53,804
Real life, real time, real world!

683
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:58,239
You're watching smash hit event TV,

684
01:11:58,298 --> 01:12:02,644
coming at you right here, right now,

685
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:05,206
wherever you are!

686
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,684
Turkey Shoot!

687
01:12:07,707 --> 01:12:10,984
It's live... with death.

688
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:15,254
Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

689
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:18,489
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

690
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:24,560
Now let's give it up
for your hosts, Tom and Teena!

691
01:12:26,693 --> 01:12:30,266
- I'm Teena Fine.
- And I'm Tom Faye.

692
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,368
Teena, Game 177!

693
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:35,003
It's mighty real.

694
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:36,570
Sure is, Tom.

695
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:40,847
Turkey Tyler flew the coop
and took us to a whole new level.

696
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:42,444
That's right, Teena.

697
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:45,011
We had an amazing chopper extraction,

698
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,217
the high-octane chase and arrest

699
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,454
of his blonde bombshell
Navy SEAL accomplice,

700
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:51,119
Commander Jillian Wilson,

701
01:12:51,184 --> 01:12:57,032
and the Turkey's own dramatic
taser arrest by authorities downtown.

702
01:12:57,056 --> 01:12:59,263
But now, he's back where he belongs.

703
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:05,937
And, for the very first time,
Turkey Shoot goes to Level 3!

704
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,070
- But there's more!
- That's right, Teena.

705
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:14,210
Turkey Shoot Final Level
will be played in the real world!

706
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,117
Wow!

707
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:19,089
With the added advantage
of a hoodie for disguise,

708
01:13:19,112 --> 01:13:21,991
Turkey 177 will find himself
in the middle of an unknown city

709
01:13:22,048 --> 01:13:24,119
approximately five miles
from the target.

710
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,892
He has exactly 90 minutes
to reach his goal,

711
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,130
in a world where anyone could be
a shooter and anything can happen.

712
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:35,731
- Now...
- Are you ready to play'?

713
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:42,270
It's Rick Tyler versus
the world on Turkey Shoot Final Level!

714
01:14:27,347 --> 01:14:29,554
- Holy crap!
- Awesome!

715
01:14:59,379 --> 01:15:03,259
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

716
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:02,082
Stop the war! End it now!

717
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,663
Stop the war! End it now!

718
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:31,010
- You really want to stop the war?
- Don't you?

719
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:32,640
Get this to someone. Take it.

720
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:34,948
Hey, you're that guy
from that disgusting show.

721
01:16:34,974 --> 01:16:36,681
Yeah. Get down. Down!

722
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:01,139
<i>Useless piece of shit.</i>

723
01:17:10,009 --> 01:17:11,682
Where are you, SEAL?

724
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,387
No way.

725
01:17:20,453 --> 01:17:22,364
You ready for your close-up'?

726
01:17:27,193 --> 01:17:30,402
Oh, you're a real funny...
 ..funny man.

727
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:34,036
So, you finished Turkey Shoot?
So what?

728
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,546
There'll be a new Turkey next week.

729
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,344
You'll always be remembered

730
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:41,909
as a chickenshit coward killer
of women and children.

731
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:47,720
And I'll always be Ramrod -
bona fide celebrity hero.

732
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:52,025
The victors write history, SEAL.

733
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:59,067
I want to you look into that camera
and tell them the truth.

734
01:18:07,066 --> 01:18:10,843
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

735
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:13,407
The great Ramrod has something to say.

736
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:17,054
Tell 'em what you told me.

737
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:23,583
Tell them.

738
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:31,566
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler
was framed.

739
01:18:31,591 --> 01:18:34,572
He didn't massacre
those women and children.

740
01:18:34,594 --> 01:18:37,097
In fact, he tried to save them.

741
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:42,044
He shouldn't be in prison.
He's innocent.

742
01:18:42,068 --> 01:18:44,708
How do I know this?

743
01:18:44,737 --> 01:18:48,981
Because I was there.
I saw everything.

744
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:02,757
You think they're going to put that
to air, you're stupider than you look.

745
01:19:04,056 --> 01:19:06,730
There's live and there's live, SEAL.

746
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:11,302
Who's laughing now?

747
01:19:21,407 --> 01:19:22,977
Not you.

748
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:32,027
Ten seconds remaining.

749
01:19:32,084 --> 01:19:39,366
Nine, eight, seven, six,

750
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:47,105
five, four, three, two,

751
01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:50,012
one, zero.

752
01:19:52,004 --> 01:19:57,613
Game over. Game over. Game over.

753
01:19:57,643 --> 01:20:01,455
Game over. Game over.

754
01:20:38,384 --> 01:20:43,891
It's official - the highest-rating
two hours in television history.

755
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:07,350
These seem to be in order.

756
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,190
Ramrod will be buried
with full military honors'?

757
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:13,026
The whole nine yards, ma'am.
As befitting a true hero.

758
01:21:13,052 --> 01:21:15,259
And we'll be there
to cover it exclusive.

759
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,198
Correct, ma'am.

760
01:21:17,223 --> 01:21:20,898
OK, then. Do your duty.

761
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:27,737
Commander Rick Tyler,
I'm arresting you

762
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:31,112
for the murder of
General Charles Donald Thatcher ll.

763
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:40,249
Hand over your weapon
and stand down, Lieutenant.

764
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:41,986
Stay out of this, Jill.

765
01:21:42,047 --> 01:21:44,391
It's a civilian risk, soldier,
stand down.

766
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:46,260
That's an order.

767
01:22:04,303 --> 01:22:06,579
Breaking the stories that matter.

768
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:09,313
Here's Katy Kelly - Global Cable News.

769
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,787
Bringing you this GCN exclusive.

770
01:22:11,811 --> 01:22:15,953
The architect of World War Africa
confesses from beyond the grave.

771
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:19,690
Will it bring down the administration?
And could it stop the war?

772
01:22:19,752 --> 01:22:21,959
You're listening to a dead man.

773
01:22:21,987 --> 01:22:24,194
Ironguts!

774
01:22:24,256 --> 01:22:27,863
And whatever you may have been
led to believe, I took my own life,

775
01:22:27,927 --> 01:22:33,138
with a gun that has served me well
in Afghanistan, Korea <i>ll</i>

776
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:36,374
and numerous other theaters of war.

777
01:22:36,435 --> 01:22:42,386
Simply put, I did it because I couldn't
stomach the secrets and lies any longer.

778
01:22:44,009 --> 01:22:51,484
Three years ago, our best marksman
killed the Libyan dictator

779
01:22:51,517 --> 01:22:54,191
on a mission ordered by the President.

780
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,666
Holy shit!

781
01:22:56,689 --> 01:23:00,159
We told the President
the mission had failed

782
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:04,231
in order to perpetuate a conflict

783
01:23:04,296 --> 01:23:08,802
that has now become
the terrible humanitarian catastrophe

784
01:23:08,834 --> 01:23:11,872
known as World War Africa.

785
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:22,240
And we framed the brave, honorable
soldier who pulled the trigger -

786
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,520
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler.

787
01:23:26,986 --> 01:23:31,435
We imprisoned him
for a crime he did not commit.

788
01:23:32,825 --> 01:23:34,498
Here's the truth.

789
01:23:34,527 --> 01:23:36,336
Back up, SEAL!

790
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,601
Back up, SEAL! Back up!

791
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:54,047
Take them out!

792
01:24:09,595 --> 01:24:12,132
Jesus Christ!

793
01:24:12,197 --> 01:24:13,938
Isn't that our hero'?

794
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:20,048
You're listening to a dead man.

795
01:24:20,072 --> 01:24:21,745
Not anymore.

796
01:24:21,774 --> 01:24:25,051
We told the President
the mission had failed

797
01:24:25,077 --> 01:24:28,149
in order to perpetuate a conflict...

798
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:36,229
So, Commander Tyler...

799
01:24:37,456 --> 01:24:39,299
"Hick."

800
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:41,396
Let's make a deal.

801
01:24:41,427 --> 01:24:44,135
..soldier who pulled the trigger...

802
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:47,804
Here's the truth...
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler...
