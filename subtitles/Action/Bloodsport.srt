1
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,180
Jackson, you really going to Hong Kong?

2
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,517
I love anything with full contact.
Need a few more scars on my face.

3
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,644
I heard you can get killed at that kumite.

4
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,272
Only if you fuck up. Unh.

5
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,077
Tomorrow we leave for the kumite.

6
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,849
Sir?

7
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,562
Excuse me, but Colonel Cooke would like
to see you before you leave on furlough.

8
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,314
What's the problem?

9
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,941
The colonel found out
you're going to Hong Kong.

10
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,486
- He wants to talk to you about it.
- Tell him I'll be right there...

11
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,821
...after I take a shower.

12
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,489
But I'll have to wait, sir.

13
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,825
Okay.

14
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,457
What's taking so long, captain?

15
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,710
Captain?

16
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,972
Shit.

17
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,117
Sir.

18
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,536
- Where's Dux?
- He was at the gym, like you said.

19
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,997
He took a shower, I waited,
and he disappeared.

20
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,668
- What do you mean, he disappeared?
- One minute he was there, next he wasn't.

21
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,045
If anything happens to Dux
in Hong Kong...

22
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,547
Get Helmer and Rawlins on this
right away.

23
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,510
And I don't wanna see your face again
until Dux is beside it. Understand?

24
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,490
- How is he?
- He's resting now.

25
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,450
He'll be so happy to see you.

26
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,245
It's so good to be here again.

27
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,667
I'll tell him you are here.

28
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,419
Thank you.

29
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,982
Wow! Look at the sword.

30
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,906
Let's get it.

31
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,909
Come on, Frank.
What's the matter, you chicken?

32
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,745
- No.
Then get in here.

33
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,540
Hey, Frank, you wanna hang
out with us, then come on.

34
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,754
You just gonna stand there
or are you gonna grab something?

35
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,591
Shit. They're coming back.
Let's get out of here.

36
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,094
- Come on, Frank.
Forget him. Let's go.

37
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,490
That's enough, Shingo.

38
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,533
Go do your studies.

39
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,130
You cannot get katana sword by stealing.

40
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,467
It is a very special sword.

41
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,011
You must earn it.

42
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,971
I wasn't going to steal it.

43
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,020
You didn't flinch.

44
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,106
You have fighting spirit.

45
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,400
You're not gonna call the cops?

46
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,027
Not if we make a deal.

47
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,279
What kind of a deal?

48
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,991
Your son and my son
are in the same school.

49
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,327
Frank sees my son's skill.

50
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,581
And he desires
to learn martial science too.

51
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,502
Yes, but what do you mean
by "martial science"?

52
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,382
Frank tell me you came to America
to grow vine.

53
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,759
Yes, that's right.
I work at the Verne vineyard.

54
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,513
I came here to grow fish in my hatchery.

55
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,224
We both grow children.

56
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,061
You use science
to make vines grow better.

57
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,940
Like vines, children need training.

58
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,652
Martial science
provides a way of training.

59
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,906
Brings mind, body, spirit together.

60
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,621
That's enough.

61
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,166
- That's all for today.
- Not yet.

62
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,293
Why don't you quit, round-eye?

63
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,713
Not yet.

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,966
Go practice your katas.

65
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,803
How come you coach him, but not me?

66
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,515
I brought you here to help me train my son.
Don't question me.

67
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,269
If you expect me to be his punching bag,
you can forget about our deal.

68
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,277
Yeah! Throw a punch.

69
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,920
Someday...

70
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,839
...I'll fight in the kumite
and make my father proud.

71
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,647
Shidoshi, I feel like I've lost
a part of my family too.

72
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:48,443
Shingo and I were close friends,
like brothers.

73
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,446
And you and Mrs. Tanaka...

74
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,575
...have treated me like a son.

75
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,582
What will happen now?

76
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,460
No more training.

77
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,212
I stop now.

78
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,886
But you have so much to teach.

79
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,639
You don't understand.

80
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,644
In the war, I lost my first family:

81
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,774
my son, daughter and wife.

82
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,487
They lived in Hiroshima.

83
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,035
I left Japan because of the war.

84
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,538
War was wrong.

85
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,333
I came here to start over...

86
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,588
...begin a new family, have a son.

87
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,757
Another chance to pass on the teaching.

88
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,677
For 2000 years...

89
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,681
...knowledge passed from father to son...

90
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,350
...father to son.

91
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,188
When Shingo died...

92
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,774
...it stopped.

93
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,281
Teach me. I can do it.

94
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,701
You are not Japanese.
You are not a Tanaka!

95
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,538
You taught me
using any technique that works...

96
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,750
...never to limit myself to one style...

97
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,002
...to keep an open mind.

98
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,087
Why?

99
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,717
To honor you, shidoshi.

100
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,727
Practice until you can meditate...

101
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,063
...and nothing can distract you...

102
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,315
...so that you see and feel nothing...

103
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,859
...except your own energy.

104
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,431
Are you awake, shidoshi?

105
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,851
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

106
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,811
How are you feeling?

107
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,941
Like an old man.

108
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,944
And how about you?

109
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,699
I'm going to Hong Kong.

110
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,242
You sure you want to do this?

111
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:22,623
To honor you means everything to me.

112
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,544
I have poured all my knowledge into you.

113
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,716
When you fight,
my spirit will fight with you.

114
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,137
In kumite, you will need it.

115
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,221
Hey, babe,
wanna go out with a real big man?

116
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,056
No, huh?

117
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,315
Too handsome for you, huh, honey?

118
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,697
This your first time in Hong Kong?

119
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,867
You two are here for the kumite,
aren't you?

120
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,204
Kumite? What is kumite?

121
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,958
Look, guys,
I know there's a secret full-contact event...

122
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,335
...being held in Hong Kong
in the next few days.

123
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,338
Yes. Hong Kong is an exciting city.

124
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,967
I also happen to know a little bit
about some of your competition.

125
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,679
Okay. Um...

126
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,765
Would you just tell me
how you got invited?

127
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,897
Thanks, guys.

128
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,409
What?
Think you can give me some competition?

129
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,578
Sure. I'll try.

130
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,540
That's what I like to hear,
a kid who isn't afraid to lose.

131
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,710
No, no, I got it.
I don't want to take your money.

132
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,714
- You ready?
- Yeah.

133
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,785
- You like this kind of fighting, huh?
- Yeah.

134
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,956
If you want to see some real fighting,
you can see me fight at the kumite.

135
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,417
I'm here, too, for the kumite.

136
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,503
Aren't you a little young for full contact?

137
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,341
Aren't you a little old for video games?

138
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,469
- You want to go at it again, huh?
- Yeah.

139
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,652
Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.

140
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,861
I'm Frank Dux.

141
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,871
Ms. Tanaka...

142
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,415
- Mrs. Tanaka?
- Y es?

143
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,002
Mrs. Tanaka, it's very important
to the government of the United States...

144
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,796
...that we find Frank Dux.

145
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,508
We understand that he might have visited
Mr. Tanaka here recently.

146
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,135
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.

147
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,513
We're sorry to hear that.

148
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,640
Was Frank here recently?

149
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,643
Frank came here to pay his respects.

150
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,812
- When was that?
- Two days ago.

151
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,440
Did he say or do you know
if he was going to Hong Kong?

152
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,567
I don't know.

153
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,861
Of course you know.
Look, we're not trying to-

154
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,907
Mrs. Tanaka,
we're very sorry to have disturbed you.

155
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,410
Thank you very much for your time.

156
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,751
May I help you?
How you doing?

157
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,879
My name's Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux.
Are our rooms ready?

158
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,842
Mr. Lin in Room 310
wants to see you after you check in.

159
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,927
Who the hell's Mr. Lin?

160
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,306
I'm Lin. You Jackson?
You look like a Jackson.

161
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,102
That would make you Frank Dux.

162
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,771
No, no, no. It's Dux.

163
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,107
Gotcha. Like "Put up your dukes," right?

164
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,526
Okay, so here's the deal.

165
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,570
This is the biggest kumite ever.

166
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,405
We got fighters from all over.

167
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,824
I've been assigned by the IFAA...

168
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,535
...to help you
and the other North American fighters...

169
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,579
...to find your way around.

170
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,081
I'm gonna make sure
you guys give it your best...

171
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,751
...and don't disqualify by fighting
outside the arena.

172
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,130
The Triad-
They are like the mafia.

173
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,592
- is allowing us
to hold kumite here this time.

174
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,057
Here it comes, man, the Walled City.

175
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,184
Not a place for outsiders.

176
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,894
You are in Hong Kong.

177
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,856
But you are about to cross
an invisible border into mainland China.

178
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,693
No joke, man.
It's a run-down piece of no man's land...

179
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,945
...in the middle of a tourist paradise.

180
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,075
Goes way back to the old lease agreement
between Great Britain and China.

181
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,495
Once you step out of the sunlight
into the narrow corridors...

182
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,456
...it's time to protect your nuts, guys.

183
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,135
Okay, U.S.A.

184
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,972
"Okay, U.S.A."

185
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,852
Okay, guys.

186
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,814
First, you can show the Black Dragon boys
your invitation.

187
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,859
Then you got to qualify
and prove to them...

188
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,154
...you can step onto the runway
and not get killed.

189
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,781
- Got it?
- Mm-hm.

190
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,075
You got it?

191
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,826
Mm-hm.

192
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,639
It says he represents the Tanaka clan.

193
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,433
You don't look like Tanaka.

194
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,686
Shidoshi Tanaka trained me.

195
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,145
What's the holdup?

196
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,774
He says Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi.

197
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,986
What's the difference
if Bruce Springsteen is his shidoshi?

198
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,989
If Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi...

199
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,283
...then show us the din mak.

200
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,868
What the hell is a din mak?

201
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,787
Death touch.

202
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,839
Thanks.

203
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,551
Vic, choose a brick.

204
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,845
Okay, Frank.

205
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,390
Uh, what about this one?

206
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,065
No!

207
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,445
Bottom one.

208
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,520
Whoa! Yeah!

209
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,028
Son of the bitch.

210
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,780
Is that good enough, guys?

211
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,116
We honor your invitation.

212
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,285
No shit, you honor his invitation.

213
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,039
That was great.

214
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,298
Very good...

215
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,967
...but brick not hit back.

216
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,155
Here's a picture of the man
that we're looking for.

217
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,283
His name is Frank Dux.

218
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,287
We have reason to believe
Frank is here in Hong Kong.

219
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,123
His name was on a list...

220
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,458
...on a flight from San Francisco
two days ago.

221
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,918
Two days ago?

222
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,212
Maybe he already left,
went somewhere else.

223
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,673
Ha. Asia's a very big place, you know.

224
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,467
We were hoping you would hold onto this
for reference.

225
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,345
We're here because Frank
is going to fight in the kumite...

226
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,431
...and we're here to stop him.

227
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,977
The kumite?

228
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,271
Yes.

229
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,370
Inspector Chen.

230
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,999
We all know that the kumite
is happening here in Hong Kong.

231
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,419
And we all know it's going on
over the next three days.

232
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,840
Look, all we want you to do
is pass this picture out to your men.

233
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,676
They spot Dux,
they give us a call at our hotel. Simple.

234
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,179
My men already overworked.

235
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,974
- Hey, if it's too much trouble, forget it-
Inspector.

236
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,020
We're all overworked,
but we need your help.

237
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,856
I'll see what can be done.

238
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,317
You know where to reach us?

239
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,320
Mm-hm.

240
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,989
You come upstairs with me
for an interview.

241
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,449
Like hell. Let go of me.

242
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,284
You want Hossein, no?

243
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,869
No. Hossein is an asshole.

244
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,746
What did you call me?

245
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,207
You want me to spell it out for you?

246
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,088
Leave the girl alone.

247
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,342
He is the American shithead
who makes tricks with bricks.

248
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,844
Guess the kumite starts
one day earlier this year.

249
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,639
- Look, guys, let's all just calm down, okay?
- No.

250
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,599
She is coming with me upstairs.

251
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,850
No, I'm not.

252
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,435
If we have to fight for her...

253
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,397
...then both of us would be thrown
out of the kumite.

254
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,775
Just for her?

255
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,403
We could arrange this another way.

256
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,657
- Do you gamble?
- What is bet?

257
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,117
You hold this.

258
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,912
If I can grab it before you close your hand...

259
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,205
...I get the girl.

260
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,833
If I cannot...

261
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,085
...she's yours.

262
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,422
Very good.
- What? You can't do this.

263
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,550
Just relax.

264
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,972
Take it.

265
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,770
Oh, jeez, Frankie,
I hope you know what you're doing.

266
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,107
Ready?

267
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,612
Go.

268
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,155
Ha!

269
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,117
You lose, American asshole.

270
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,379
Looks like she's mine.

271
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,966
Now leave the lady alone.
You understand that?

272
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,890
Why were you with Hossein?

273
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,894
I've been trying to get a story
on the kumite.

274
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,062
I'm a reporter.

275
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,567
He tell you anything?

276
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,695
He told me I had nice legs.

277
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,906
He's right about that.

278
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,451
Why is it that no one
will talk about the kumite?

279
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,578
What is this air of mystery?

280
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,164
I'm just trying to find out
what it's all about.

281
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,000
Why are you fighting in it?

282
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,835
It's personal.

283
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,171
You wanna prove your manhood
to the world?

284
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,592
The kumite is for the fighters,
not for the people who read newspapers.

285
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,887
I've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal...

286
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,848
...like a cockfight,
except it's with people.

287
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,851
You have the wrong picture.

288
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,895
Well, you tell me about it, Frank.

289
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,064
I want to have the right picture.

290
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,360
Okay, I'll talk to you, but one condition.

291
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,945
What's that?

292
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,031
You agree to have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

293
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,993
Well, actually,
I was hoping Hossein would be free.

294
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,679
That hurts me just looking at it.

295
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,186
Yo, Frankie.

296
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,688
Earth to Frankie.

297
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,649
This is ground control. Do you copy?

298
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,404
It's time to get ready.

299
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,535
You'd better stop doing that stuff.

300
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,704
You might wanna have kids
one of these days.

301
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,754
Victor's downstairs.
Kumite Express leaves in five minutes.

302
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,513
Are you ready?

303
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,938
I am ready.

304
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,286
You can almost smell the adrenaline
in this place, can't you?

305
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,829
Yeah.

306
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,125
They are gonna love me over here.

307
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,879
You can really love Asians
because we're good-looking.

308
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,939
Welcome, warriors of the world.

309
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,610
Today you become part of a tradition...

310
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,821
...that began hundreds of years ago.

311
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,658
The kumite was first used
by the Kokuryukai...

312
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,453
...the Black Dragon Society...

313
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:46,833
...to measure the fighting skills
and spirit of its members.

314
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:51,588
Every five years,
the best fighters in its ranks...

315
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,967
...would face each other in full contact...

316
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:01,306
...with one winner emerging
as the superior warrior...

317
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,599
...the champion.

318
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,310
The Kokuryukai has been joined...

319
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,021
...by the International Fighting Arts
Association...

320
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,109
...as co-sponsor for this event...

321
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:17,405
...and as the guardians
of our rich and powerful heritage.

322
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,158
After three days...

323
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,746
...one fighter will prove himself
to be the best.

324
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,290
May the mightiest warrior prevail.

325
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,704
Now, remember, it's full contact.

326
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,541
There are three ways to win:
One, you knock the guy out.

327
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,252
Two, the opponent quits and shouts,
"matté. "

328
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,629
It's like saying "uncle. "

329
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,590
Three, you throw the fucker
right off the runway.

330
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,843
Piece of cake.

331
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,002
That's why they call this thing
"blood sport," kid.

332
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,040
Watch this, Frankie.
I'm gonna show you how it's done, buddy.

333
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,024
Asshole.

334
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,715
Come on, get up! Come on!

335
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,135
I'm gonna kill you, man.

336
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,554
Yeah, you, man.

337
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,764
You got it.

338
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,689
Frankie. Ha!

339
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,443
Look at him, buddy. Yeah.

340
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,862
Yeah.

341
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,702
You check that out? Thank you.

342
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,121
- Good stuff, Jackson.
- Thanks.

343
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,083
But, uh, what took you so long?

344
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,919
Oh, funny. Real funny.

345
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,383
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

346
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,926
What's going on?

347
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,928
That's Chong Li, the current champ.

348
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,472
He's never been defeated.

349
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,683
Holds all the records,
including the fastest KO.

350
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,353
He killed a guy during the last kumite.

351
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,647
Yep. He kicked the poor bastard
right in the throat.

352
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,233
Guy died right there on the platform.

353
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,195
Chong Li stood there
and watched him die.

354
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,657
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

355
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,987
Now I show you some trick or two.

356
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,222
Whoa!

357
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,807
Fastest I ever saw.

358
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,576
Whoa, yeah!

359
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,711
His first fight in the kumite,
he broke the fucking world record.

360
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,129
Yeah! That's my buddy.

361
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,045
Go home.

362
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,414
This is real good stuff.

363
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,166
How's your eel, as good as mine?

364
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,210
I don't know, I haven't tasted it yet.

365
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,212
You gotta tell them to kill it first.

366
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,215
You should ask for forks.

367
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,008
Inspector Chen.

368
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,177
What a pleasant surprise. Please join us.

369
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,887
No. I never eat here.

370
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,056
I found some information for you.

371
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,683
What is it, inspector?

372
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,061
Frank Dux is at the East Lake Hotel
in Kowloon.

373
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,063
Thank you.

374
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,692
Hey, have some eel.

375
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,707
Okay, Dux, you know why we're here.

376
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,459
We're taking you back, Frank. Let's go.

377
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,253
Only when the kumite is over.

378
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,296
Who the hell are these two scumbags?

379
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,133
Just stay out of it, pal.
It's not your business, okay?

380
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,969
I ain't your pal, dickface.

381
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,140
Look, Frank...

382
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,351
...the government has invested
a lot of time and money in you.

383
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,562
Uncle Sam can't afford
to let you get hurt.

384
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,896
I won't get hurt.

385
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,608
That's why we're here,
to make sure of that.

386
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,569
Don't make it tough on us, Frank.

387
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,122
I'll be in the airport in two days.

388
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,833
That's not good enough.

389
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,129
Frank, read my lips.
We are taking you back now.

390
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,050
Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you,
Frank.

391
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,015
Excuse me.

392
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,808
You want to shit sparks?

393
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,977
You just stay put, okay?

394
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,021
Stay put.

395
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,142
All those different fighters in one event.

396
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,437
- It sounds wild.
- You have to see it to believe it.

397
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,731
Oh, come on, Frank.

398
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,232
Couldn't you just get me in?

399
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,569
I really want this story.
It would mean so much to me.

400
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,864
They have strict rules. No press.

401
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,824
I bet we could think of something.

402
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,035
I doubt it.

403
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,120
You telling me you never break rules?

404
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,997
What do you mean?

405
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,707
Who are Helmer and Rawlins?

406
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,252
Just friends. Why?

407
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,339
They must be very close friends.

408
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,425
They've been inquiring about you
all over Hong Kong.

409
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,303
What do you want from me?

410
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,973
Well, I'd really like you to help me
get into the kumite.

411
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,768
But more than that...

412
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,022
...I'd really like to get to know you.

413
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,319
After all, we have all night.

414
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,036
I have to go.

415
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,122
I know.

416
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,209
Good luck today.

417
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,836
Thanks.

418
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,756
Meet me for dinner again tonight?

419
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,508
Sure.

420
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,429
About the kumite, I'm sorry.

421
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,931
I cannot help you.

422
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,891
It's okay.

423
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,060
I'll get over it.

424
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,496
See you.

425
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,487
Where the hell have you been?

426
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,406
You can't just disappear
in the middle of kumite like that.

427
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,825
I got a rep to uphold, you know.

428
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,870
You don't tell me nothing
and Jackson don't tell me nothing.

429
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,455
You guys are driving me crazy.

430
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,791
Right now, hurry up and change.

431
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,460
Pick a brick, any brick.

432
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,962
I know. The bottom one, right?

433
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,518
See? Not a scratch on it.

434
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,686
Not din mak.

435
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,524
Neither is this. Aah!

436
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,901
For you.

437
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,489
- Yo, Frankie.
- Whoa.

438
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,324
I hope we don't bump heads.

439
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,034
Come on, let's do it, buddy.

440
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,494
You feel strong today?

441
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,912
I feel fine.

442
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,040
Good. You're a good fighter. You, good.

443
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,000
- Good.
- Thanks.

444
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,305
This isn't the first time
I've had to go undercover to get a story.

445
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,787
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

446
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,847
- All right, Frankie. Yeah!
- Well done.

447
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,979
Dux! Dux! Dux!

448
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,530
Time to separate the men from the boys.

449
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,409
Just be careful Chong Li doesn't separate
your head from your body.

450
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,537
Go for the gut. He's soft there.

451
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,541
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Chong Li's weak in the gut.

452
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,585
That's how Parades surprised him.

453
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,003
Hey, you listening to me?

454
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:37,007
Go for the stomach
and stay away from his right leg.

455
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,177
Will you stop worrying, Frankie?
I've got it under control.

456
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,597
You sound like my mother. Man alive.

457
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,247
- I got him! I got him!
- What are you doing?

458
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,582
Keep going!

459
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,418
Jackson! Jackson!

460
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,629
Jackson!

461
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,547
Jackson! Jackson!

462
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,511
Chant for him now. He's dead. I got him.

463
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,180
Yeah! Yeah!

464
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,265
Yeah!

465
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,353
Yeah. Unh!

466
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,783
- Unh!
- No. Stop!

467
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,551
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

468
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,479
Come back, Frank.

469
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,436
Ray.

470
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,855
Ray, I'm here.

471
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,732
Ray.

472
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,444
The doctor says you're gonna be okay.

473
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,989
You are lucky you have a head
like a rock.

474
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,617
Yeah, you'll be out of here in a week.

475
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,289
I'll get back at Chong Li.

476
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,541
That's a promise.

477
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:20,045
Do you think that's what he wants,
someone to share a room with?

478
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,005
Janice, stay out of this.

479
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,716
Frank, I don't wanna see you get hurt.

480
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,218
Then don't watch.

481
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,512
If you want to argue,
go elsewhere, please.

482
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,307
Sorry.

483
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,021
You're not even trying to understand
what this means to us, are you?

484
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,398
What's to understand
about a bunch of guys...

485
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,610
...who have to prove themselves
by beating each other's brains out?

486
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,780
- Why'd you become a reporter?
- What does that have to do with it?

487
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,448
Just answer the question.

488
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,866
My father was a reporter.

489
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,036
I was a good writer.
It seemed like the right thing for me to do.

490
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,622
And you want to be the best reporter
you can be...

491
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,666
...for him and yourself, right?

492
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,084
Yes, that's right.

493
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,254
Well, I'm just trying to be the best
I can be.

494
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,590
Not just for me, for Tanaka,
my shidoshi, too.

495
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,093
Great, Frank, that's just great.

496
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,469
Go right ahead.

497
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,472
I just hope you don't end up like Jackson,
or worse.

498
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,600
But I'm not gonna stand around
and watch it.

499
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,439
You're blowing it, Frank.

500
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,608
Forget about the girl.

501
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,069
Forget about getting back
at Chong Li for Ray.

502
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,072
You have a chance to take it all tomorrow.
Do you understand?

503
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,492
You can be the first Westerner
to win this thing.

504
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,328
But you got to have a clear head.
You hear me?

505
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,123
You hear me?

506
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,718
Why are you so interested
in stopping the kumite?

507
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,221
Someone almost got killed there today.

508
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,808
I have a friend fighting in it.
I don't want him to get hurt.

509
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,697
- Who is your friend?
- His name is...

510
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,241
...Frank Dux.

511
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,981
You guys here for the finals?

512
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:54,360
There aren't going to be any finals, Dux,
at least not for you.

513
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,529
Don't try to stop me.

514
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:00,075
We're not. He will.

515
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,538
I did not come this far to stop now.

516
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,999
You shouldn't have come
in the first place.

517
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,209
Take him.

518
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,366
You're really being a hard-ass about this,
Frank.

519
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,575
Uh, careful.

520
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,454
- Put these on and we won't have to use it.
- It's your last warning, Frank.

521
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:55,630
Inspector, no.
We've gotta take him back.

522
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,301
Frank, give us a break. We've been
chasing you all over Hong Kong.

523
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,637
- Can we stop this?
- Okay, Frank. You win.

524
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,765
But it's wrong what you're doing.
It's a mistake.

525
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,396
I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.

526
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,694
Now what?

527
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,904
How are we gonna stop him?

528
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,074
Follow me.

529
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:31,875
- Time's up. We can't wait any longer.
- Come on, give me one more minute.

530
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,668
I give you my word. He'll be here.

531
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,296
We must follow the rules.

532
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,755
Where's Mr. Dux?

533
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,342
You know, I wish everyone would just
calm down. I said, he'll be here.

534
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,262
- Too late.
- Too late?

535
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,265
No such thing as too late.

536
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,852
Ah. Finally.

537
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,773
- It's about fucking time.
- Sorry.

538
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,027
- How do you feel today, Dux?
- Feel good.

539
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,988
- I am ready.
- Dux, my man.

540
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,016
Come on! Come on!

541
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,376
Dux! Dux! Dux!

542
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,675
Well done.

543
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,619
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

544
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,456
You are next.

545
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:37,031
Prepare the platform for the final match.

546
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,867
This is it, Frank.

547
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,494
You can make history here today.

548
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,343
Frank.

549
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,011
You okay?

550
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:00,972
Frank?

551
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:02,390
Yeah.

552
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,194
You break my record, now I break you.

553
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,446
Like I break your friend.

554
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:27,243
Get him, Dux. Come on.

555
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,799
Get up, Frank!

556
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,777
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

557
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,657
Dux! Dux! Dux!

558
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,795
- Right on.
- Come on now, Dux. Come on.

559
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,667
More! More!

560
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,641
Up, up.

561
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,234
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

562
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:50,738
Get up, Frankie!

563
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:39,847
All right.

564
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,624
Say it!

565
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,044
Say it!

566
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,297
Say it!

567
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,508
Matté.

568
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,677
All right!

569
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:05,224
Dux! Dux! Dux!

570
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:13,690
Yeah, Frankie.

571
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:27,454
Mr. Dux, you fought with inspiration.

572
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:31,458
We of the Kokuryukai salute you.

573
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,938
This is for you, shidoshi.

574
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,860
So you stomped him real good,
huh, Frankie?

575
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,403
Worse.

576
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:01,780
What do you mean?

577
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,741
He made him say "matté. "

578
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:08,579
All right, Frankie.

579
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,456
But don't you get too cocky.

580
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:14,084
Because you might have to
go up against me next time.

581
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,836
I promise.
- Mm-hm.

582
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,006
You guys are out of your minds.

583
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,050
- I'll drink to that.
Ha, ha!

584
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:24,720
By the way, next time you fight...

585
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:27,389
...try to keep your clothes on.

586
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:36,857
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...

587
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,319
...if you ever need me, I'll be there.

588
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,616
I love you, my friend.

589
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,538
Me too.

590
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,794
Take care.

591
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,935
He's not gonna show.

592
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,812
Looks like he did it to us again, huh?

593
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,399
Hey, guys.

594
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,443
You coming or what?

595
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,405
You son of a bitch.

596
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:27,824
You're always late.

597
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,624
You know, you're really a pain in the ass,
you know that?

598
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,421
I'm just glad you're on our side, kid.
