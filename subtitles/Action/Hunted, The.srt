1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,007
Cafe Khalil, four o'clock.
Don't be late.

2
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:05,845
Do you expect to come back to work?
I'm your best operative.

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,080
Target is Jack Turner.
He is currently bidding to

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,440
acquire the Upper Khyber Dam.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,240
JTRP holdings, £1 billion.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,960
Dad, we're short 30 million quid.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,520
We'll just have to get hold of it,
won't we?

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,680
This is Gary.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,080
You're the mole.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,920
I did lie. I had to.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,640
The lovely Miss Thorpe
was blackmailing me.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
I know we can never get back
what we lost.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,680
What WE lost?

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,720
You nearly lost your life,
but the baby...

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,800
that was my loss, too.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,960
Five major
multinational corporations.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
They formed a secret pact.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,520
They called it Hourglass.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,800
What's Keel's connection?

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,080
Three members of the Byzantium board
are CEOs of Hourglass Corporations.

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,640
'I want people to become angry

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,720
'about the corrupt elements
in our country.

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,160
'You referring to
the privatisation of the Khyber Dam?

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,920
'I intend to expose and stop it.'

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,120
I went to the hospital
this afternoon.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,640
They said you checked yourself out
right after we left.

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,920
This programme
contains some violent scenes.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,000
This programme contains
some scenes of a sexual nature.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,760
SPEECH INAUDIBLE

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
FAX MACHINE BEEPS

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Then we're going ahead?

32
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
Of course.

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
You want me to tell Dave?

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,240
Dave's turning into
a useless old fart.

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
Just tell Tyrone.

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
Sorry. I had to make a phone call.

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
Another one of your girlfriends?

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,440
You know me too well, Auntie.

39
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,360
You want to help on this campaign,

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,640
you can't keep disappearing
all the time.

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,440
I would do anything for you.
You know that.

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
You seem worried, Umair.

43
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
Aren't you?

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
What is it?

45
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,400
I know how important this is,
but the risks are considerable.

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
I will do whatever it takes,
however long it takes.

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,920
Do you understand?

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
You have my loyalty. You know that.

49
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,120
SHE GASPS

50
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
WHISPERS: That was nice.

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,160
It's been a while.

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
Glad it was me.

53
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Me too.

54
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,280
That was from the accident.

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,360
We've both lost so much.

56
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,400
Get some sleep.

57
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,520
You all right?

58
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,720
Oh, it's nothing.

59
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
I get these sometimes.

60
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
And the bruises on your back?

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm really sorry.

62
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,720
You don't pay me to look like this.

63
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Perhaps you should tell me
what's the matter.

64
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm fine, really.

65
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm asking.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,240
It's a platelet disorder.

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,480
MDS.

68
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
Are you on medication?

69
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Mm-hm.

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,000
I feel weak. I'm tired all the time.

71
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
Don't worry for myself so much,
but...

72
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,480
..I have a little girl.

73
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
Must be very difficult.

74
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,600
All these months,
I've never asked your name.

75
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
It's Lianne.

76
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Lianne Wells.

77
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
DIALS NUMBER ON PHONE

78
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,840
This is Rupert Keel.

79
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,480
My regular girl, Lianne Wells...

80
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,320
..I don't want to see her any longer.

81
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
Send someone new next week.

82
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,960
PHONE VIBRATES

83
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,720
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

84
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,040
Stephen made a pass at me.

85
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,520
You reciprocated?

86
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
What do you think?

87
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,880
And what motivated you
to take THAT course of action?

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
My job.

89
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,960
So sleeping with him
had nothing to do with the fact
you actually care about him?

90
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,160
And his son?

91
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,520
It's a little late to be jealous,
don't you think?

92
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,160
Or maybe you let yourself feel
something for me again yesterday?

93
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,520
Must have scared
the hell out of you.

94
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,400
This is not about you. No, Sam.

95
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
It's about you.

96
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,760
Always looking for a way,
any way you can, to push me aside.

97
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,320
Why would I need to do that
when I don't even know who you are?

98
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,160
Yes, you do.

99
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,640
You have since the moment we met.

100
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,840
You just keep forgetting,
that's all.

101
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
ENGINE STARTS

102
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Sam. Aidan.

103
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Where's Fowkes?

104
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
Unavailable.
But this couldn't wait. Zoe.

105
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,920
So apparently, Jack Turner
did more than go drinking yesterday.

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,440
He had his financing for
the Khyber Dam put into liquidity.

107
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
£1 billion in total.

108
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,120
He's fully vested now. One phone
call away from purchasing the dam.

109
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,480
Then at 01:35 this morning,
he received a fax.

110
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
We don't know the contents.

111
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
A fax is still almost impossible
to intercept digitally.

112
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,800
What's remarkable about this?
Where it came from.
Private airfield in Pakistan.

113
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,520
According to our Islamabad office,
only one flight left at that hour.

114
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,480
And it was carrying
Fatima Zahir to London.

115
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
Two hours later,

116
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
the body of a Pakistani officer
was found at the airfield.
He'd been strangled.

117
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,840
That can't be a coincidence.

118
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,960
No, it can't.

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,160
We need to know who sent this fax,
what it said
and why it's worth killing for.

120
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,640
Perhaps Stephen Turner can be
helpful. He's Sam's latest conquest.

121
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,120
He seems to know little or nothing

122
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
about the criminal side
of his father's activities.

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
I could speak to Lewis Conroy.

124
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,240
Lewis Conroy is dead.

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,880
How?

126
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,040
We led Jack Turner to believe
his secretary saw him

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,640
murder the economics professor,
Vincent Cage.

128
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,880
Was this necessary?

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,640
It became necessary
when you let yourself be seen.

130
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
That's all. Thanks.

131
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Look, I just can't get past this.

132
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
You're human. I forgive you.

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
It's not your forgiveness I need.
What, then?

134
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Aidan. I still think he's lying.

135
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
He is.

136
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Then you think he got
Hasan captured,

137
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,320
despite what Natalie Thorpe
told you?

138
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,440
And Sam knows about it.
It seems they're working together.

139
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Then we're being lied to.

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,880
That's not a surprise.

141
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,760
We've known that since the day
Sam returned.

142
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,800
If he got Hasan killed, then the
rest of us could still be at risk.

143
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,040
Aidan had a chance to kill us
yesterday and he didn't.
Doesn't mean anything

144
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,240
or explain why
he's looking into Hourglass.
We have a client to serve.

145
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
He's grown very restive of late.

146
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Jack Turner seems far too confident.

147
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,400
Complete the op.

148
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
I'll take care of Sam and Aidan.

149
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,640
HE VOMITS

150
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
So, you was in the Army, yeah?

151
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
You feeling all right, Mr T?

152
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,240
I mean,
you're actually talking to me.

153
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
Dave says you was in the Army.

154
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,760
Yes. I was in the Army.

155
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,440
So you got to shoot rifles
and all of that?

156
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,480
Rifles, guns, knives.

157
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,760
If it hurt people,
I learned how to use it.

158
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,960
Sounds like fun.

159
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,920
Yeah. A lot of laughs.
Shooting people, getting shot at.

160
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,880
Good times all round.

161
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,520
What are we doing here?

162
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
DOOR BUZZER

163
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,960
What's the matter,
you don't trust me anymore?

164
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Who's your friend?

165
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,960
Weapons man.

166
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,360
It's in there.

167
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,560
It's a beaut.

168
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
Where's the money?

169
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,480
GUNSHOTS

170
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,600
What'd you do that for?

171
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't forget the case.

172
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,520
I got down early.

173
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,160
Managed to make a cup
before Mrs Sidwa came in.

174
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,320
That's the best cup of coffee
I've ever had in this house.

175
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
SHE CHUCKLES

176
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,520
I should go.

177
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,440
Eddie will be awake in a minute.

178
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,440
I don't know what to say.

179
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
You don't have to say anything.

180
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,200
SHOWER RUNS

181
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,800
There are seven members
of the Byzantium board of directors.

182
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,240
Three are Hourglass conspirators.
So where do we start?

183
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,320
Polyhedrus - the third largest
private corporation in the world.

184
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,400
Dr Hill, I'm going to get
you out of here.

185
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Any luck with the fax?

186
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm trying to recapture audio.
No luck.

187
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
What about Zahir?

188
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Her plane landed at Heathrow
an hour ago.

189
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,520
She's on a one-day fund-raising
trip. All closed meetings
at the hotel with big-money donors.

190
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,280
Except for a speech this afternoon

191
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,160
at the Asia Promise Society
at 3pm.

192
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,200
That's her only public appearance.

193
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,640
Rahim Soomro, the Pakistani minister
auctioning the dam
will also be there.

194
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm assuming Jack Turner
is nowhere on that itinerary.

195
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
Turner's hardly the sort of man
she'd invite to tea.

196
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,440
Everything all right, Deacon?

197
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,280
Bloody hell,
it's good to be back here.

198
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,760
Never thought those words
would pass my lips.

199
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,200
Why are you dumping this shit
on my desk?

200
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
It's for you. What is it?

201
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,680
Address and description
of two blokes Tyrone murdered.

202
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,240
I wrote those notes in the toilet.

203
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,280
What did he murder them for?

204
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
That's what I'd like to know.

205
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,720
He shot them both in cold blood.
Arts dealer?

206
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Arms. Says "arms." Uh-huh.

207
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,000
Nice bit of kit, actually -

208
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,520
heads-up display,
lightweight stock...

209
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,720
Wait a minute,
you're talking about a sniper rifle?

210
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Tyrone said he needed it
for something this afternoon.

211
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
What?

212
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,200
Candidate Zahir.

213
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
It's a privilege
to welcome you to London.

214
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,560
I appreciate your courtesy,
Minister.

215
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,000
But forgive me
if I question your sincerity.

216
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We may disagree politically, but
we both serve the same great nation.

217
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
I know what interests you serve -

218
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,280
the corporations that would loot
our treasury and line your pockets.

219
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
Surely even you appreciate
the need for investment.

220
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
To raise the standard
of living for our people.

221
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,200
If only that were your intent,
Minister.

222
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,240
Then you and I
would have no quarrel at all.

223
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,880
Excuse me.

224
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,360
Morning, all.

225
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
Coffee?

226
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Er...

227
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,640
No, thank you.

What's the book, Eddie? It's
The Snow Maiden. Alex gave it to me.

230
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,360
My mother used to read it to me.

231
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,640
She did, did she?

232
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,120
Huh. Mr Stephen. It's for you.

233
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
Hello...

234
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Yeah.

235
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah.

236
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Thank you.

237
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,400
What is it?

238
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,800
Um...

239
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
You saw Lewis the other night.
How did he seem to you?

240
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,120
He was fine. He seemed fine.

241
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Stephen, what's wrong?

242
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,160
Morning.

243
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,920
What's the matter, Stevie?

244
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,640
Er...that was the police.

245
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,720
Lewis is dead.

246
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,040
What?

247
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
Did they say what happened?

248
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
Er...murder-suicide.

249
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,640
They're saying that he killed
his secretary and her husband too.

250
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
Oh, no. That's awful.

251
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,480
Offed himself?

252
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, I didn't see that one coming.

253
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
No.

254
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,680
That's a heavy blow, son.
He was a...

255
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,120
Was a good friend to this family.

256
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,400
I don't want to tell Eddie,
not just yet.

257
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,800
No, no. Whatever you think best.

258
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,720
I just need a moment. Can you get
him ready for school? Right away.

259
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,440
Come on, sweetheart.

260
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,040
OK.

261
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,440
Here, let me help you.
Do you need these?

262
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Mm-hm. OK.

my name's Stephen Turner.

I understand you're investigating
the death of my friend.
Lewis Conroy.

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,800
That's right.

'I wonder
if we might speak in person.'

What's this about?

272
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,880
I have some information
I think you should hear.

273
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
What's your address, Mr Turner?

274
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,760
What's this?

Remains of the fax Jack received.

276
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,560
Good. We'll see what Zoe can do.

277
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,840
I also found a report.
With Horst Goebel's name on it.

278
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,600
You've had a busy morning.
Where'd you find it?

279
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,320
Stephen's bedroom.

280
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,080
What kind of report?

281
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,160
Highly technical, about
the completion of the Khyber Dam.

282
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,600
Apparently Goebel
is one of the engineers.

283
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,960
But I saw another name I recognised.

284
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
Arthur Hill.

285
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,760
The doctor Faroux tortured
in Tangier? He works at Polyhedrus.

286
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,200
Hourglass.

287
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Yeah, it all fits together
rather nicely.

288
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,320
Very snugly.

289
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,360
What are you going to do?
Polyhedrus has offices in London.

290
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm going to see if I can find Hill
for some answers.

291
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,440
That's bad timing.

292
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,080
Jack Turner's planning to have Zahir
assassinated later on today.

293
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,760
I didn't know Jack
was in the assassination business.

294
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,400
Fowkes picked up a sniper's rifle
with Tyrone.

295
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,640
We think they're going to use it
at the Asia Promise Society this
afternoon. Why would he kill Zahir?

296
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,280
She's opposed to the sale of the
dam. She may be, but she can't
stop it. He doesn't need her dead.

297
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,520
Perhaps. But we think
he wants her dead anyway.

298

Keel won't tolerate you
pursuing personal business.

This isn't personal.

300
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,960
I need to know what was in that case
that Horst Goebel gave Turner.

301
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,560
And Hill might have some answers.

302
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,960
"C...4."

303
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,040
"I'm trusting you."

304
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,800
Why would Zahir trust Jack Turner?
She wouldn't.

305
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,680
And what is
"Something something C4"?

Right, I want you to stay on him,
you understand?

309
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,280
You've got to make sure
he doesn't use that rifle.

310
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,840
Don't let him out of your sight.

311
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank you for coming, Inspector.

312
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,640
Please.

313
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,880
You said you had, er...

314
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,040
information.

315
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,680
Your officer told me
that Trudy Barnes and her husband,

316
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,480
they were shot with the same weapon
that killed Lewis.

317
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,960
That's correct.

318
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,000
Well, I can understand why you'd
conclude this was a murder-suicide.

319
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But I can tell you, Inspector,
it wasn't.

320
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
How do you know that?

321
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,320
He told me two days ago how happy
he was that she'd gotten married.

322
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
The idea that he'd kill her
or himself...

323
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,640
..it's not possible.

324
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,280
Mr Turner, if people
never did anything out of character,

325
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
we wouldn't have any murders,
would we?

326
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
Well, were you aware that his
professor was killed two days ago?

327
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Yes.

328
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,440
And we've already made an arrest
in that case.

329
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,560
With a full confession.

330
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,320
I read it in the paper.

331
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,200
But you still think there
might be a connection?

332
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,560
Well, I don't know. But it seems
worth looking at, doesn't it?

333
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,240
Two friends killed
in a matter of days.

334
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,680
It certainly does seem worth
looking at. And I'll do just that.

335
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Thank you, Inspector.
I appreciate it.

336
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,520
And please don't hesitate to call me
if you think of anything else.

337
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
I'll see myself out.

338
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Are you all right, Stevie?

339
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

340
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,040
How's it coming?
With the bid for the dam, I mean.

341
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Well, now that we're funded,

342
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,520
we just have to persuade Soomro
to accept our offer over the Chinese.

343
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,160
How do we do that?

344
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm working on it.

345
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,000
You know our portfolio went up
by £32 million yesterday,

346
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,040
right when we needed the money?
That's right.

347
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,480
That's an awfully neat trick, Dad.

348
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,600
Lucky, Stevie, that's all.

349
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
Just lucky.

350
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,480
This is where
she's giving her speech?

351
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,120
Yeah, in less than four hours.

352
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,080
'Thank you. Thank you all.'

353
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,720
Well?

354
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,720
She's as good as dead.

355
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,640
Gary, what you doing here?

356
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,960
Tyrone rang me.

357
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
Keeping you busy, is he?

358
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,600
We had a long night.

359
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
You watch yourself,
d'you understand?

360
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,440
I always watch myself, Dave.

361
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,320
No, I mean it. He's up to something.

362
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
I don't know what.

363
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,880
I thought all the jobs
come through you.

364
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,400
I'm being put out to pasture,
more and more.

365
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Whatever Tyrone's got you doing,
they don't tell me.

366
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Hey.

367
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,240
Yeah, what do you want?

368
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,520
My business is with him.

369
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,760
No, any business you do through me.
I still run things round here.

370
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
You got some glasses to wash,

That was you on the phone.

382
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,040
I need some answers, doctor.

383
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,960
Answers?

384
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,000
I think you owe me that much
after I saved your life last year.

385
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,000
What do you want to know?

386
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
A few hours after I rescued you,
I was ambushed by three men.

387
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,960
I have reason to believe
they were sent by your employer.

388
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,240
My employer? Polyhedrus.

389
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,440
Why would they want to hurt you?
You tell me.

390
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,880
I don't know anything about this.
What about Hourglass?

391
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
Hourglass?

392
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,520
What's Hourglass?

393
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,280
Look, um...can I get back to work
now? Cos I've got a lot to do.

394
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,680
Just one more question.

395
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,800
The man who captured you,
Bernard Faroux.

396
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Yes?

397
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,360
He was bidding on the Khyber Dam
in Pakistan.

398
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
The dam was built by Polyhedrus.

399
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,640
You were an engineer on the project.

400
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
That's right.

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,480
What made you so valuable to him?

402
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,600
What do you mean?

403
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,920
He had you tortured.

404
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,160
He must've been
trying to find out something.

405
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
I don't know.

406
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,240
You're a poor liar, doctor.

407
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,760
'Which floor?' Seven.

408
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,160

Got it. Reading her loud and clear.

411
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,000
She's having a private chat
with someone in his 20s,

412
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
'slicked back hair.' Who is it?

413
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,960
Umair Qassani,
ex-Pakistani special forces.

414
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,920
His family's a major clan,
allied to the Zahirs.

415
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,720
Any connection to the dam?
'Not directly.'

416
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,480
But the Qassanis' ancestral
territory is the Khyber Valley.
It's where the dam's built.

417
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,480
Good. Thank you.

418
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Are you sure about this?

419
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,560
Of course I'm not sure.

420
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,120

I don't see what business

I work for your father, sir.

And he wouldn't like you
snooping around his affairs.

Well then, let him tell me
that himself.

What happened to that man
down there, anyway?

You didn't take him
to the police, did you?

He's one of the bidders

465
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,280
And he's prepared to kill anyone

Including you.

467

We need you to cancel your speech

469
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,520
at the Asia Promise Society
this afternoon.

470
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,600
We think that's where he plans
to have you shot.

471
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,880
And who is this "we," exactly?

472
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
My client has asked us
to ensure your safety.

473
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
Your client?

474
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,160
And who might that be?

475
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,000
Does it matter?

476
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,480
Someone wants to kill you.

477
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,880
In my country, someone is trying
to kill me every day.

478
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,840
If I let that stop me,
I would never get out of bed.

479
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
I have a meeting, and I'm late.

480
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,960
So unless you intend
to kill me yourself...

481
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,440
I understand what you're
fighting against, Madam Zahir.

482
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
But you can't win the battle
if you're dead.

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,960
LIFT PINGS

484
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,680
That's him.

485
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,560
What do you want with him?

486
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,040
You remember where I said to meet?

487
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Yeah.

488
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,960
HE WHISTLES TUNLESSLY

489
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,120
Long day?

490
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,400
It's harder being a rabbit
than it looks.

491
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,400
GUN COCKS

492
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,640
Fancy a carrot?

493
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,880
Wallet and keys.

494
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,720
You're mugging Rafi the Rabbit?
Are you bloody serious?

495
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,640
Oi, give me the gun.

496
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,280
Get in.

497
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,400
Now look, I...

498
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,720
I said, get in.

499
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,320
I've done nothing to you,
what is all this about?

500
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,800
What are you doing?

501
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
THE MAN GROANS

502
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,240
Please, no.

503
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,120
GUNSHOTS

504
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,440
Are you freaking crazy?!
Get in the car.

505
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,480
Get in the car!

506
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

507
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,120
Right, now, we've received
your latest imaging scans.

508
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,000
And at least the news
isn't any worse.

509
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,720
You can see here, the astrocytoma
in your temporal lobe.

510
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,160
In the past few weeks, it's actually
shrunk a few millimetres.

511
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,680
So the medication's working?

512
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,600
It's possible, but with
a malignant tumour, unlikely.

513
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,960
I don't want you
to raise your hopes.

514
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Have you thought more
about what we discussed?

515
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,280
It is important
you get your affairs in order.

516
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,760
Yes.

517
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,240
How are you bearing up?

518
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,160
I'm throwing up
two or three times a day.

519
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,600
I feel weak down my left side,

520
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,600
and I have a headache
more or less all the time.

521
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,800
Mm.

522
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,160
I'm wondering about your spirits.
Your state of mind.

523
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,600
Oh, my state of mind?

524
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
How would you imagine it is?

525
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,320
Of course, this is difficult.

526
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah.

527
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,240
Facing one's own mortality
is frightening.

528
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,880
But it's also an opportunity.

529
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,320
Is it? For what?

530
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,840
To assess, to appreciate.
To find meaning in one's life.

531
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,560
Can I have a word?

532
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,120
Alone.

533
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,800
Of course.

534
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,880
Bingham said you'd had words.

535
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,280
I can understand
if you're upset about Lewis.

536
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,520
About Lewis?

537
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,680
How stupid do you think I am, Dad?

538
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,960
I don't think you're stupid at all.

539
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,120
You weren't "lucky". You caused
the explosion at Goncourt.

540
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,680
That's how you raised
£32 million overnight.

541
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,520
A woman was killed.

542
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,560
I don't know what you're
talking about, Stevie. Yeah, you do.

543
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm your son, Dad.

544
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,760
I tell you what you need to know.

545
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
I need to know the truth.

546
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,800
You never had any intention
of going legitimate with this dam.

547
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,440
That word - "legitimate."

548
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,720
You really think these men you went
to your fancy schools with,

549
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,400
these bankers and lawyers,
are better than your own father?

550
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,520
They don't get people killed.
Don't they?

551
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,280
Read the papers, son. What do you
think's happening out there?

552
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,600
You're crying because,
what, you want respect?

553
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm not looking
for your RESPECT, Dad!

554
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,600
You don't respect the life
I've built for you and for your son.

555
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,800
This life is rotten.

556
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,600
Eddie and I should've left
a long time ago.

557
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,400
You want to go? Leave, anytime.

558
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,360
But you'll never take my grandson.

559
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,160
Where the hell are we going?

560
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,880
IN URDU:

561
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,040
PHONE BEEPS

562
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,600
Flat 33, yeah?

563
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,200
I'll be right there.

564
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,040
Where the hell are you going?

565
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,760
I said, "I'll be right there."

566
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,360
NOISE OF CROWD DROWNS OUT SPEECH

567
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,120
Gentlemen, will you excuse me,
please? Yes, sure.

568
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,400
That was good. Absolutely.

569
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,440
A man got to her.

570
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,320
He got past her guards in the lift.
What are you talking about?

571
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,360
She told me he warned her she was
going to be killed this afternoon.

572
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,320
Has she changed her plans?
No. She's going forward.

573
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,240
Then hold your nerve, Umair.

574
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,920
Your family stands to make a lot
of money when this dam is sold.

575
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,600
It's going to be a good day.

576
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,720
A VERY good day.

577
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,320
Just seen Qassani talking to Soomro.

578
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,920
'What about?'

579
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,680
'I don't know,
but I think I could guess.'

580
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,440
Let's go.

581
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,400
How did you got here?

582
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,880
Got a call from Keel.

583
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,680
How did HE know I was here?

584
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,480
He didn't say.
He just said to come get you.

585
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,480
Now come on,
Zahir's speech is starting.

586
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,520
APPLAUSE

587
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,880
Thank you.

588
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,360
Thank you. Thank you all.

589
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,440
It's a cold day outside

590
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,080
but I am warmed by the sight
of so many friendly faces.

591
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Our country is blessed
with natural resources,

592
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,880
but riven with sectarian conflict,

593
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,120
making us vulnerable to predators -

594
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,440
multinational corporations,

595
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,040
interested in ever greater
wealth and power.

596
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,840
Where the hell is he?

597
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,360
It's not just Pakistan
whose fate is at stake.

598
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,240
This financial crisis
was engineered

599
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,640
by those same banks
and corporations...

600
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,040
..willing to make billions suffer.

601
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,640
Together we will fight
this fight...

602
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,000
..bless our country...

603
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,800
..only to further
enrich themselves...

604
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,440
..economic justice
with just words...

605
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,520
We will protect
the interests of our nation.

606
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,240
We will gather evidence
against foreign corporations,

607
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,120
bring them to justice...

608
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,960
..make it the right
of the Pakistani people

609
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,120
to live in a nation ruled by law,
not by profit.

610
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,400
Thank you.

611
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,920
APPLAUSE

612
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,120
I found the original document
on Hill's desk.

613
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,040
That fax you intercepted
wasn't from Zahir,

614
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,800
it was sent to her from Doctor Hill.

615
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,440
And a call log showed
that he sent a fax to Pakistan.

616
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Why would someone from Zahir's camp
forward that to Jack Turner?

617
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,520
Because Hill's
some kind of whistle-blower.

618
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,800
He ran when I questioned him.
So what is it he knows?

619
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,280
I don't know, but it must be
something worth killing for.

620
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,360
BRAKES SCREECH

621
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,080
Well?

622
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,240
There's no hurry,
the speech is over.

623
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,200
What happened? Zahir's gone back
to the hotel with her entourage.

624
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,040
Sam thinks Zahir's going to meet
with a whistle-blower. Dr Hill.

625
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,400
The man we rescued in Tangier.

626
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,600
PHONE RINGS
It's Fowkes. Where's Tyrone?

627
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,040
'I was trying to reach you.
He murdered Rafi the Rabbit.'

628
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
What? Tyrone.
He killed Rafi the Rabbit.

629
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,440
Now he's got me waiting in his flat.
What, Tyrone's?

630
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,720
No. Rafi's! You're waiting in
Rafi the Rabbit's flat - for what?

631
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
It can't be good.
He said he'd be right up.

632
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,880
'Here's the thing,
Rafi's flat is across
from Brensham Hotel.'

633
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,000
He's opposite Zahir's hotel.
'He's got to be messing with me.'

634
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,840
Stay put. Wait for him to come back.
We're on our way.

635
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,240
If Turner wants to stop Hill
talking, why wait for him to show?

636
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,640
The fax was unsigned.
He knows there's a whistle-blower,
but not that it's Hill.

637
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,000
He'll know it's Hill when he shows
up for their meeting. That's when
Tyrone'll pull the trigger.

638
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Fax said "4,"
that's two minutes from now.

639
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,400
Yeah, but we don't know
where it's taking place. Zahir does.

640
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,640
Split up, we need to find her.

641
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,160
It's all right, Umair.
No-one's seen us.

642
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,040
I just want to make sure
you're safe.

643
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,320
SAM: 'They're not
in the conference room.'

644
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,240
AIDAN: 'No sign of them
on the third floor.'

645
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,560
"WSC." They're in
the Winston Churchill room.

646
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,800
Which floor? 'Second. Second floor.'

647
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
Madame Zahir.

648
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,600
Thank you for trusting me, Dr Hill.
You're a very brave man.

649
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,520
No, I'm not brave.

650
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,160
I just couldn't live
with this anymore.

651
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,960
What is it you have to tell me?

652
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,320
Hundreds were killed.

653
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,360
And I'm responsible.

654
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,240
Get down!

655
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,360
GUNSHOT
GLASS SMASHES

656
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,240
TYRONE: 'So, you was in the army,
yeah?'

657
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,760
I'm the patsy.

658
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,640
I'm the bloody patsy.

659
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,360
Hill?

660
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,120
What did he tell you?

661
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,200
I don't know, something
about the dam. Some terrible crime.

662
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,960
How did they find out?
This meeting was secret.

663
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,880
You can't think that it was me?

664
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,160
Armed police! Armed police!

665
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,320
Go, go, go! Clear!

666
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,640
Armed police!

667
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,120
Suspect's in flight.

668
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,600
SIRENS BLARE

669
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,360
Eddie? What are you doing in here?

670
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,680
Dad's out,
and I didn't want to be alone.

671
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,800
What's the matter?

672
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,840
Nothing.

673
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,080
You're sure? Nothing happened today?

674
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,680
Uncle Lewis died.
Did Daddy tell you?

675
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,320
Yes, he did.

676
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,400
We only saw him a couple days ago.

677
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,200
And now he's gone.

678
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,280
Just like Mum.

679
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,160
Can you read your book to me?

680
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,880
Sure I can.

681
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,640
I'm glad you're here, Alex.

682
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,280
So am I.

683
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,840
Mr Turner.

684
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,840
Why all the cloak and dagger?

685
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,040
You know, I would've been happy
to meet back at your house.

686
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,320
I saw you talking
with Bingham this morning.

687
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,040
He's paying you, isn't he?

688
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,600
You'd best talk to
Mr Bingham about that.

689
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,000
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it.

690
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,160
Here's £10,000. Take it.
It's a down payment.

691
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,360
A down payment on what?

692
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,840
Information. Anything you tell him,
I want you to tell me first.

693
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,040
I don't think Mr Bingham
would like that too much.

694
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,800
He won't know.

695
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,680
C'mon, Inspector, take it.
We're all on the same side.

696
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,320
I just don't like being
kept in the dark, that's all.

697
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,320
As it happens, Mr Turner,
I do I have some information

698
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,720
that I was planning to take
to Mr Bingham this evening.

699
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
What is it?

700
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,440
That woman you have
working in your house...

701
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,560
Alex Kent?

702
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,960
..she's not who you think she is.

703
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,080
Explain this.
Are you accusing me of something?

704
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,360
Just answer the question.

705
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,640
'Sam was nearly killed
and Ballard's dead.'

706
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
You think they'd hesitate
to kill you too?

707
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,840
You trusted me,
that trust nearly got you killed.

708
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,640
And cost us our child.

709
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,560
I hope you don't expect pity.

710
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,720
No, not pity.

711
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,480
Respect.

712
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,840
Jack Turner's
finally shown his hand.

713
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,040
And it's blackmail.

714
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,200
Our client wants you dead. That's
why you disappeared last year.

715
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,040
SHE YELLS

716
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,880
'There was something else
in his files.'

717
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,960
The murder of Katherine Morton.
She was my mother.
