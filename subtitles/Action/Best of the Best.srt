1
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,170
Out of the darkness

2
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,059
Something is waiting.

3
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,563
Something you must overcome

4
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:31,870
No time for weakness or hesitating

5
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:38,923
This time it's got to be done

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,820
Tales of power

7
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:46,208
Tales of power

8
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,886
Tales of power all around you

9
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,614
Into the void you've been hurled

10
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,819
Tales of power will surround you

11
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,307
Now is the hour for
you to stop the world

12
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,413
- Sammy, how you doing?

13
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,817
- Hey guy, where you been?

14
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:13,551
Say, why don't you wait outside and we'll

15
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:14,905
go out for a couple of beers?

16
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:16,514
- I can't, Sam, I gotta pick up Walter.

17
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,292
- How is my godson?

18
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,588
- Walter's great, Walter is always great.

19
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:29,575
Are you ready for this?

20
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:30,521
- Yeah.

21
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,716
- Are you holding on?

22
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:35,200
- Yeah, are you holding on?

23
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,416
- I got you, Walter.

24
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:38,169
I'm right here.

25
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,404
Keep peddling.

26
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,957
Keep peddling.

27
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,642
Okay, Walter, you're on your own.

28
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,030
You got it?

29
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,482
- Dad.

30
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:49,910
Look, I'm doing it!

31
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,700
- Attaboy, Walter, you got it.

32
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:53,317
- I'm riding alone.

33
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,941
- I know, I know!

34
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,391
- Whoa!

35
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,431
- Four.

36
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:09,213
- Get serious.

37
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,558
Five.

38
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,675
Six.

39
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:23,678
You guys, stop, stop, stop.

40
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,675
I said stop, stop.

41
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,149
I said stop.

42
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:29,460
- He started it.

43
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:31,634
- Stop it, I said break it up.

44
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,009
Now what do I teach you guys?

45
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,250
- To be nice to people.

46
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,090
- Yes, and?

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,284
- Not to use what you
teach us to hurt people.

48
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,488
- Good.

49
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:46,253
So do you guys want to
beat each others' face in

50
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:49,108
or do you want to shake
hands and be friends?

51
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,687
- Friends.

52
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:55,757
- Okay, I want you to be
best of friends, understand?

53
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:56,935
- Yes sir.

54
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,452
- All right, let's continue.

55
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,142
Left and reverse punch one.

56
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,020
- Mr. Lee.

57
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,308
Excuse me, I think you should see this.

58
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,445
- Everybody.

59
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:12,983
Elliot, take over.

60
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,380
- Ma, I've been asked to try out for the

61
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,670
US National Karate Team.

62
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:32,779
- Can I see it?

63
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:33,791
- Yeah.

64
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,572
- Are you seriously considering this?

65
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,391
Don't they know about your shoulder?

66
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,231
- Ma, my shoulder's all right.

67
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:48,130
- Yeah, if you call plastic
cartilage in a steel pin

68
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:49,777
all right, it's all right.

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,364
Your shoulder's junk.

70
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,515
What happens if you get hurt again?

71
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,196
You could be paralyzed or something.

72
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,577
- Calm down.

73
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,835
Mama, I got nothing here.

74
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:04,223
Nothing.

75
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:08,598
Competing was the only
thing that made me feel...

76
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,669
You saw me.

77
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,967
- Yeah, I saw you.

78
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,964
- Dad, I'm in bed.

79
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:23,053
- And Walter, he's only five years old.

80
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,532
He needs his father at home.

81
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,034
What about your son?

82
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,047
- What about my son?

83
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:33,535
Mama, I love you.

84
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:38,374
Walter and I will work it out, okay?

85
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,846
And they were both wounded,
but they would not stop.

86
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:47,579
Lancelot and Arthur
battled for a full day,

87
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:50,557
finally defeating the evil Mordred.

88
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,314
And the kingdom rejoiced
as they rode through

89
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:56,612
the land together again as two friends.

90
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:58,900
Da da da!

91
00:05:59,068 --> 00:05:59,912
- Wow.

92
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,288
- Wow.

93
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,166
- So when would you go
away if you go away?

94
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,771
- That's up to us.

95
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:11,648
What do you think?

96
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,542
- Can I come?

97
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,218
- No, you've got school.

98
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,691
- How long would you be gone for?

99
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:20,541
- If I make the team,
maybe a couple of months.

100
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:21,738
- Like two?

101
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,625
- Or more like three.

102
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,995
- What do you get if you win?

103
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:27,216
- A medal.

104
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,130
- Can I have it?

105
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:28,752
- Yes.

106
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:29,693
- Then you'd better win.

107
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:30,835
- Okay, I will.

108
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:31,625
- Promise?

109
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,028
- I promise.

110
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,915
So I guess it's all set then, huh?

111
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,005
- Okay.

112
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:37,917
- You sure?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,913
- You positive?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:39,773
- Really, truly?
- Yes.

115
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:40,794
- Absolutely?
- Yes.

116
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,846
- Okay.

117
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,327
Here you go.

118
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,238
You have sweet dreams.

119
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,053
- I love you, daddy.

120
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,946
- I love you too, Walter.

121
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,241
Night night.

122
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:56,523
- Goodnight.

123
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,245
Dad?

124
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,437
- Hmm?

125
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,170
- You better win.

126
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,254
- You got it.

127
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,537
- Kim Yung.

128
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,606
Cho Han.

129
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:39,837
Tung Sun.

130
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,166
Kwon Sae Jin.

131
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,308
- Korea! Korea!

132
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,703
- Goddamn circus.

133
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,898
- Mind if I borrow your tape, man?

134
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,785
- Matter of fact, I do mind.

135
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,367
- Here you go.

136
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,427
- Thanks, man.

137
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:58,336
- Point.

138
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,001
Point white.

139
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,172
- Shouldn't block with your face.

140
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:30,747
- His mama probably
didn't breast feed him.

141
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,642
- Breast feeding is
actually very high in iron.

142
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,542
I was very fond of it as a child.

143
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,470
- I'm still fond of it.

144
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,892
Sonny, Sonny Grasso.

145
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,454
My friends call me Sonny.

146
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:42,692
I'm Italian.

147
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:44,151
- I'm Virgil Keller.

148
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:47,119
I used to be Italian, now I'm a Buddhist.

149
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:50,012
I'm just kidding, I was never Italian.

150
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:51,638
- I knew that.

151
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,090
- Sonny Grasso
and Travis Brickley,

152
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:56,256
please report to ring three.

153
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,246
- Look, the cowboy.

154
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,609
- Have a nice day, knucklehead.

155
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,943
- Point red.

156
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,164
- What are you talking about?

157
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,524
He hit me in the arm!

158
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,056
He hit me in the arm.

159
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,132
Are you blind?

160
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,198
- Hey, it was a good fight.

161
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,952
- We can fix that.

162
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,365
He's a fighter.

163
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,370
- I don't know about you
guys, but I'm impressed.

164
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:39,312
Good lord, half the board
of directors are out there.

165
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,676
They went completely nuts.

166
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,496
Frank, believe me, you'll
get anything you need,

167
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:43,454
first class.

168
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:45,078
- I expect no less.

169
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:48,675
This is your team.

170
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,249
- Frank.

171
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,399
Are you absolutely sure
about this kid Alex Grady?

172
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,130
I saw him take quite a beating
a couple years back, Frank.

173
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,006
And he's got a gimpy
shoulder, you know that.

174
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:10,623
- Mr. Jennings, your
expertise is business.

175
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,716
Mine is choosing and training champions.

176
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:15,224
No offense.

177
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,765
- On behalf of the sponsors,
the US Karate Federation,

178
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:39,038
Coach Couzo and his staff,
it's my pleasure to announce

179
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:43,831
the names of the five young
men who will represent

180
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:48,986
the United States of America
in competition against

181
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,897
Team Korea.

182
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,375
When I announce your name, please rise

183
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,611
and approach the podium.

184
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:00,657
Travis Brickley, Miami, Florida.

185
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,480
Virgil Keller, Providence, Rhode Island.

186
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,308
Sonny Grasso, Detroit, Michigan.

187
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:19,446
Thomas Lee, Fresno, California.

188
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,275
And the final selection,

189
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:28,901
Alexander Grady, Portland, Oregon.

190
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,833
Congratulations, men, and welcome to the

191
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,624
US National Team.

192
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,390
- It's been a long time.

193
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,538
How you doing?

194
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,230
- How you doing?

195
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:47,993
- Alexander Grady.

196
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:48,749
- Tommy Lee.

197
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,668
- Excuse me, fellas, fellas.

198
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:53,936
Can I get...

199
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,757
- At ease.

200
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:01,524
Anybody not a member
of this team or staff.

201
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,610
You are dismissed.

202
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,911
Okay, listen.

203
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:12,385
My name is Frank Couzo.

204
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:17,572
To you I'm either Coach or Mr. Couzo.

205
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:23,674
Starting tomorrow, you are mine

206
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,321
for the next three months.

207
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:31,351
That means no women, no alcohol, no drugs.

208
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:39,908
You will eat, sleep, and shit competition.

209
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,694
There are only two other rules.

210
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,726
Number one, don't be late.

211
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,146
Don't ever be late.

212
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,925
It shows disrespect to me, to the sport,

213
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,460
and to your teammates.

214
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:02,956
Two, we expect you to function as a team.

215
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,851
I'll say this only once.

216
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,811
A team is not a team if
you don't give a damn

217
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,855
about one another.

218
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:20,523
You are now members of the
US National Karate Team.

219
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:25,393
You represent the United
States of America.

220
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,527
Remember that and we will
accomplish our objective.

221
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:33,848
Our only objective, which is to win.

222
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,899
- Yeah.

223
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,565
- One more thing.

224
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,180
When you get settled into night,

225
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:42,218
Don will escort you into town.

226
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,002
It's your last night in three months.

227
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:48,101
If some of you are lucky,
you might even get laid.

228
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:52,195
Knowing the high standards
of the local females,

229
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:54,553
I seriously doubt it.

230
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,926
But that bus leaves at 1900
hours sharp, gentlemen.

231
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,296
- 1900 what?

232
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,998
- 7:00 PM, pinhead.

233
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,907
- I knew that.

234
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,594
- Frank, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

235
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,202
Someone I met last year
on a trip to the far east.

236
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,571
Quite an extraordinary person, really.

237
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,023
Trained in all kinds of things.

238
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:18,713
Psychology, sports medicine, kinetics.

239
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,624
Has a new book out now
on the power of the mind.

240
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:24,357
Something of a sensei, actually.

241
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:27,779
- Look, Mr. Jennings, I
was hired by the board

242
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:30,006
to do a job and I intend to do it.

243
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:32,093
- Nobody's questioning that, Frank.

244
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,399
- I don't need any damn sensei.

245
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:41,333
- Frank, there's a
trainer's position opening

246
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:47,390
and we would like Wade
to fill that position.

247
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:50,281
No offense.

248
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,981
- I see.

249
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,891
- Right this way, boys.

250
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:11,491
- Oh, so sorry.

251
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,399
- Well, this is us.

252
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:25,185
- Is it okay if I take this one?

253
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,121
- Yeah sure, man, go ahead.

254
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:40,833
- You have a kid.

255
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,711
- Yeah, well that's an old picture.

256
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,500
Walter's five now.

257
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,916
- Five going on 30, huh?

258
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,308
- Yeah, how'd you know?

259
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,803
- I work with kids, teaching.

260
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,372
Your wife's very pretty.

261
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,645
- Yeah, she was.

262
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,913
She died when Walter was a baby.

263
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,880
- I'm sorry.

264
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,718
- Yeah, me too.

265
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,735
- Man, this definitely ain't Detroit.

266
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,269
- I never been to Detroit.

267
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,343
What's it like?

268
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,235
- What?

269
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,026
- Detroit, what's it like?

270
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:20,025
- Well, it's what you might call urban.

271
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,640
It's kind of post urban,
you know, like those

272
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,583
movies of Berlin after the war.

273
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,603
Well that's the view out my window.

274
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:26,995
- Ash tray?

275
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,173
- Sure.

276
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,827
You sure have a lot of gear, man.

277
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:32,229
- What's that you say?

278
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:32,969
- What?

279
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,770
Oh, I said you sure have a lot of gear.

280
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,187
- Oh gee, I got every major tournament

281
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:37,416
the last five years.

282
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,107
- Oh do you?

283
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:38,707
- Right here.

284
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,921
If you want statistics, lookie here.

285
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:45,135
Hell, I got statistics on every
major fighter in the world.

286
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,521
That's right.

287
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,755
I'm something of a
collector, you might say.

288
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,824
- Yeah, me too.

289
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:51,522
Check this out.

290
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,789
This is rare shit.

291
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,219
- That's fantastic.

292
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:03,839
That is fantastic.

293
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,022
- Virgil, I've seen some
fine looking local snapper

294
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,684
out there and I think they
could use some of this

295
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,716
sweet Miami love muscle, if you
know what I'm talking about.

296
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:20,833
Virgil, what the hell are you doing?

297
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,398
You can do that for three months.

298
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,867
We're talking about young things.

299
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,634
We're talking about inner
and outer labia here.

300
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:28,502
We're talking about the bus leaving if you

301
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:29,705
don't get up and get dressed.

302
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:31,402
You look like a pinata.

303
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,779
Virgil, what are you going to do?

304
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,772
Sit around and play with
your ball all night?

305
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,330
Virgil.

306
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,188
Virgil!

307
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,457
All right, I'll go it alone.

308
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:53,984
- Travis.

309
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,625
Inner and outer labia?

310
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,618
- Simple enough, Frank.

311
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,709
- That's right.

312
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,007
- You going number one or number two?

313
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,481
- Drop dead.

314
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:55,494
- Later, sport.

315
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,507
- Excuse me.

316
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,175
- I'm sorry!

317
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,006
I've got a thing here.

318
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,553
You all right, did it burn you?

319
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,688
- No, no, it's okay.

320
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,618
- Bartender, this isn't hot enough.

321
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,613
Irish coffee is supposed to be hot.

322
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,657
- What did he say?

323
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,702
- I'm kidding.

324
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:25,664
- I thought you were serious.

325
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,006
- No, I'm Virgil.

326
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,001
- Carol Anne.

327
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:28,745
- Hi.

328
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,558
- Hi.

329
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,182
- Carol Anne.

330
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,214
- Would you like to dance?

331
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:34,719
- I'd love to.

332
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:36,208
- Good.

333
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:42,325
- You burned her hand
and she'd love to dance?

334
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,287
- Want to dance?

335
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:14,128
- Love to.

336
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,746
- Well let's go.

337
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:24,651
- Nothing.

338
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:25,414
Nothing.

339
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,219
Vodka.

340
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,382
- Vodka.

341
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,596
- How you doing this evening?

342
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:30,407
- I don't understand it, man.

343
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:31,470
- What?

344
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,358
- I mean, women love me.

345
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,337
- Not tonight.

346
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:35,844
- What?

347
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,717
- Not tonight they don't.

348
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,273
- Yeah, but I'm Italian.

349
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,096
- You know, well Virgil's doing great.

350
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,569
Maybe you should become a Buddhist.

351
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,829
- What could they be talking about?

352
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:50,938
- Buddha.

353
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,838
- It's one of those
conditioned automatic response

354
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,577
patterns that just gets in the way of our

355
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,286
natural abilities, you know?

356
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:58,496
- I know.

357
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,765
- Sweet bellybutton.

358
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,216
I'm going to give it a shot.

359
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:07,068
- He's a dog, an absolute dog.

360
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,164
- Hey Burt, you might want
to check the dance floor.

361
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,292
- Yes, uh, a collect call from Alex.

362
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,582
- Where do you live, Kelly?

363
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,921
- About a drink away.

364
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,975
- That's a nice neighborhood.

365
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,421
- That's as far as you go.

366
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:51,935
- Oh god, it took you until
now to realize I was gone?

367
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,766
Go away, Burt.

368
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,575
- Yeah Burt, go away.

369
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,874
- Hey.

370
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,624
Shit baby, I'm sorry.

371
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,916
- Well that's a good move, Burt.

372
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,075
Don't take any lip from her.

373
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:12,386
- Didn't take Mr.
Personality long, did it?

374
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:13,900
- God, I hate this.

375
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,962
- Don't you go.

376
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,514
- Keep in touch, fellas.

377
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:20,666
- Hey!

378
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,337
- We're out of here just like that.

379
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,326
- Who's this asshole?

380
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,625
- Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,334
He said he was sorry.

382
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,354
- Hey, who the hell are you?

383
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:37,506
Very impressive.

384
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,616
- I don't want to fight you guys.

385
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,096
We're out of here.

386
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,749
- I want him, I want his balls.

387
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:45,656
- I thought you were
missing a pair, asshole.

388
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:46,875
- Shut up, Travis.

389
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,448
- You're dead, pal.

390
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:52,790
- Get him, Burt!

391
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:58,030
- What?

392
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:59,395
No.

393
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:01,868
No, Walter, you cannot drive the car, no.

394
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,259
No, no, there is nothing to discuss.

395
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,683
Put your grandmother on.

396
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,725
Uh, ma, I gotta go.

397
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:47,247
Give Walter a kiss.

398
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,920
- This is just like Detroit.

399
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,233
- Okay, gentlemen, break it up.

400
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,980
Let's go, Virgil.

401
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,484
Come on, Grasso.

402
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,502
Let's go, gentlemen.

403
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:48,831
That's enough.

404
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,570
That's enough, Brickley.

405
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,552
- Good move, man.

406
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:55,780
- I didn't want to fight.

407
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,216
- All I wanted was a beer, shit happens.

408
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,470
- Excuse me, Coach Couzo?

409
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:19,607
- Yes.

410
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:22,056
- I'm Catherine Wade, I
believe you're expecting me.

411
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,057
May I sit down?

412
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:28,895
- Say, I'd like to introduce myself.

413
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:29,944
I'm Don Peterson.

414
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:30,758
- How do you do.

415
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:31,892
- Would you like some coffee, Miss Wade?

416
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:33,363
- No thank you.

417
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:39,232
- Look, Miss Wade, I'll
get right to the point.

418
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:40,810
This was not my idea.

419
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:42,636
I was hired to coach the
team, and quite frankly

420
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,265
I don't need any help, particularly.

421
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,776
- From a woman.

422
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,607
Well, I am a woman, Mr. Couzo.

423
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:50,138
But in spite of this
handicap, I'm hopeful that in

424
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,199
the next few months my
usefulness to this team

425
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,439
will become apparent.

426
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,061
- What exactly do you intend to do here?

427
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,253
- Train, Mr. Couzo, I'm a trainer.

428
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:58,809
- Don Peterson is my trainer.

429
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,115
Why do I need you?

430
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,469
- Well, I was raised in the far east.

431
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,994
I've studied eastern
philosophy all of my life.

432
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:08,797
This includes Buddhism,
Hinduism, Yoga, and meditation.

433
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,142
I also hold a belt in Tae Kwon Do.

434
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:13,773
- I'm sure that makes you
a very well rounded person.

435
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:15,126
- I would like to share what I've learned

436
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:16,802
with the American team.

437
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:20,503
- Look, Miss Wade, Mr.
Jennings hired you and I

438
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:22,758
have to accept that, I just
don't know where you fit in.

439
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:26,399
- Coach, even with my help
it will be difficult if not

440
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:29,705
nearly impossible to
defeat a team from Korea.

441
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,162
As you know, their
training is as much mental

442
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,866
as it is physical, and
they've been doing it for

443
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,448
most of their lives.

444
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,580
We only have three months.

445
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:41,965
Excuse me for saying so,
Coach, but without my help,

446
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:45,332
all of your modern training
techniques and high tech

447
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,421
equipment won't mean shit.

448
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,161
- Good morning, gentlemen.

449
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:12,724
At my side are your new team warm up

450
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:17,517
uniforms and jackets, courtesy
of our official sponsor.

451
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:23,632
However, until you become a team and have

452
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,590
earned the right to wear
them, what you have on

453
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,501
will suffice.

454
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:36,147
Okay, I want 20 laps around the track.

455
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,154
- 20?

456
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,568
That's five miles.

457
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,374
- That's right, Grasso.

458
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:41,992
- I knew that.

459
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,510
- Let's go.

460
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,251
Move it.

461
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:54,791
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

462
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,354
Something so strong, born of the sun

463
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:08,711
Like a fire, sea of fire,
burns inside me so strong

464
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,205
- How you feeling?

465
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,973
- This is kicking my ass, man.

466
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,360
I don't think I can do it.

467
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,019
- Hang in there.

468
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:19,615
- 163.

469
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:20,565
164.

470
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:22,999
165.

471
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,599
- Trainers out.

472
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,897
At ease, gentlemen.

473
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,931
They're listening.

474
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,014
- Good morning.

475
00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:52,345
My name is Catherine Wade.

476
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,956
I'm Mr. Couzo's new assistant trainer.

477
00:30:56,676 --> 00:30:59,457
You are all very talented athletes

478
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,458
and chosen for good reason.

479
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,843
However, talent alone is not enough.

480
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:09,962
We have a very powerful
adversary in the Koreans

481
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:12,744
and very little time to prepare.

482
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,185
So while Coach Couzo
and Don work with your

483
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:20,183
fighting technique, I will
work with your concentration.

484
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:23,899
At the end of the three
months, you will have a

485
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:28,568
balanced mind, sharp as a
razor, a body of perfect

486
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:33,356
health and strength, a
spirit of peace and clarity.

487
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:40,207
This is the final
conditioning needed to win.

488
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:42,611
Are there any questions?

489
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:44,800
- What's your phone number?

490
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,420
- I'm here to teach you how to win.

491
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,965
Winning isn't a sometime thing.

492
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,325
Winning is an all time thing.

493
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,869
We don't win once in a while.

494
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:59,743
We don't do the right
thing once in a while.

495
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,156
We do the right thing all of the time.

496
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,545
Winning is a habit.

497
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,108
Unfortunately, so is losing.

498
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:08,957
- Hey, that's good.

499
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:11,008
- That's Vince Lombardi.

500
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,546
Coach.

501
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,870
- Tommy.

502
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,533
- Yeah?

503
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,386
- How old were you when
you started training?

504
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,392
- When I was about four.

505
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,569
- Four? Shit.

506
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:29,758
You got any brothers or sisters?

507
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:32,783
- No.

508
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,661
Goodnight, Alex.

509
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,245
- Goodnight, Tommy.

510
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,177
- And one.

511
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:56,435
And two.

512
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:57,974
Put your shoulder into it.

513
00:32:57,973 --> 00:32:59,229
Three.

514
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:01,059
And four.

515
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:09,653
- Gentlemen, you'll be
competing using eastern rules.

516
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:12,532
In the event of a tie, the
winner will be determined

517
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,075
in a competition of strength and focus.

518
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,515
The objective is to
break as many as you can

519
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,756
in one blow using the hand or head.

520
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:23,059
- Center yourself.

521
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:25,993
Thought and action must be one.

522
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,560
There can be no hesitation.

523
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,606
- Who wants to go first?

524
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:39,100
Miss Wade will demonstrate.

525
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:07,346
- Impressive.

526
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,759
- Okay, who's next?

527
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:30,433
- Sit down, man, take a load off.

528
00:35:31,134 --> 00:35:32,803
Hey, spare ribs.

529
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,652
Now that's a white man's meal, Virg.

530
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:36,159
Real food.

531
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:38,232
You keep eating that shit, you'll end up

532
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,036
like Hop Sing over there.

533
00:35:41,997 --> 00:35:45,220
Your eyes will slant, dick will shrink up.

534
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,507
You'll open up a laundry.

535
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,314
- That's harsh.

536
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,802
- Hey, you don't eat that
raw fish shit do you?

537
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,722
- Travis, why don't you shut up?

538
00:35:56,717 --> 00:35:58,568
- Does it look like I'm talking to you?

539
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:00,160
- Alex, it's all right.

540
00:36:00,164 --> 00:36:01,919
- You're damn right it's all right.

541
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:03,727
You're damn right it's all right.

542
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:05,269
- Hey, get your own ribs.

543
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,339
- Are you scared?

544
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:09,632
- Alex.

545
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:11,363
Please, sit down.

546
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,284
- Yeah, sit down, Alex.

547
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:15,844
What do you boys think?

548
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:17,332
Think he's yellow?

549
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,234
So what about it?

550
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:22,219
You yellow, huh?

551
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,987
- Obviously.

552
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,327
- These are your
opponents, gentlemen.

553
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,978
If you were to fight them today,

554
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:47,132
you'd all be carried out on stretchers.

555
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:51,020
Losing would be the least of your worries.

556
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:53,307
- This is some of the Asian training.

557
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:56,058
Remember this when you think Coach Couzo

558
00:36:56,057 --> 00:36:58,157
is being too tough on you.

559
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:06,123
The Koreans train 12
months a year and enjoy

560
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:08,894
the full financial support
of their national government.

561
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:10,504
- Don.

562
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,680
Study these briefs carefully.

563
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:15,101
The more you know about your opponent,

564
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:17,148
better prepared you'll be.

565
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,146
Wade.

566
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:22,928
- Yung Kim, 155 pounds, gold medal 1984

567
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:24,742
world championship.

568
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,368
Silver medal, Tokyo Invitational.

569
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:28,673
He's yours, Sonny.

570
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,193
- Ah, great.

571
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:32,801
- He's crippled more than one
fighter with his strength.

572
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,229
- Wonderful.

573
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:35,421
- That's why we're
going to make your moves

574
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,434
smaller and more focused.

575
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:43,265
Travis, meet Mr. Tung Sung Moon.

576
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:46,104
Gold medal 1985 world championship.

577
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,670
Virgil, this is Mr. Han Cho.

578
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:55,164
Gold medal 1986, Hong Kong invitational.

579
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:57,013
They are completely singleminded in their

580
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:59,295
pursuit of excellence.

581
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:03,451
Alexander, meet Mr. Sae Jin Kwan.

582
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,960
Currently weighted number
one in his division.

583
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,544
The best fighter of his generation.

584
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:11,582
Gentlemen, many fighters have died

585
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,918
in the ring from such blows.

586
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:17,247
Tommy, you win the prize.

587
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:23,584
- Dae Han, 176
pounds, 35 years old.

588
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,901
Winner of every major invitational
for the last 10 years.

589
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,845
Whatever you may think of his age, never

590
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:31,966
underestimate his ability.

591
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,084
He's won gold medals for the '84 to '88

592
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:35,779
world championships.

593
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,784
He's still rated number one in the world.

594
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:40,375
- No problem.

595
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:46,235
- Gentlemen these tapes
are always available to you.

596
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:49,688
Watch them, observe
strengths and weaknesses.

597
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,082
Knowing them can mean the difference

598
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,059
between victory and defeat.

599
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,671
- Tommy look, there's David.

600
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:21,842
Someone will lose, someone must win

601
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,868
Only the strong will survive

602
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,670
Reach for the best

603
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,009
You have within

604
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:33,699
There is no compromise

605
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,670
You have to stand up and fight

606
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,576
When the challenge is right

607
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,440
Through your tears and the pain

608
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,820
Still the glory remains

609
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:44,906
You see the vision in sight

610
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:48,882
Put yourself to the test

611
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:52,653
Be the best of the best

612
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,372
- White two, red zero.

613
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,965
That's not a point, Tommy.

614
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:26,562
- Punk!

615
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:28,705
- Bow to each other.

616
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,805
- That's enough!

617
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,831
- All right, gentlemen, hit the showers.

618
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,439
Hit the showers.

619
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,149
Quickly.

620
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,041
What the hell is wrong with you?

621
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:51,633
You better shape up or you're
going to be hisrory, boy.

622
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:53,099
You got it?

623
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:59,471
That was quite an exhibition.

624
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:03,253
I'd be lying to you if I
didn't tell you it worries me.

625
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,786
Tommy, a man of your talent.

626
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:06,108
- What's on your mind, coach?

627
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:07,292
- You had a chance to take Travis out

628
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,748
and you didn't, you're holding back.

629
00:42:08,753 --> 00:42:09,981
That worries me.

630
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,158
- Coach, I'm fine.

631
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,406
- Then why didn't you finish it?

632
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,018
What are you afraid of?

633
00:42:15,014 --> 00:42:16,510
- What's that supposed to mean?

634
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:20,065
- Dae Han won't give you a second chance.

635
00:42:58,097 --> 00:43:00,015
- Anybody else seen this?

636
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:02,198
- Nobody.

637
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,566
- Let's keep it that way.

638
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,553
- Tommy, Tommy.

639
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,300
You okay, man?

640
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,210
- Yeah.

641
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,373
- It's kinda late, buddy.

642
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,579
- Dae Han is working just as hard.

643
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,347
- Bet your ass on that.

644
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:41,983
But even Dae Han sleeps.

645
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:45,163
- You sure about that?

646
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:47,453
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

647
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:49,832
- Let's get some sleep.

648
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,265
- Let's do it.

649
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:55,280
- Visualize the energy radiating from

650
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,859
your abdomen out to the world.

651
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:00,086
Breathe deeply.

652
00:45:00,138 --> 00:45:02,613
Inhale joy, courage.

653
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:06,494
Exhale fear, doubt.

654
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,890
Visualize the energy radiating from

655
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:13,157
the center of your being
out into the world.

656
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:17,468
This is your key, your life force.

657
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:22,534
This is where you will
find your greatest power.

658
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:25,043
- Hey Travis, you're gonna be late.

659
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:26,158
- It's for you.

660
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:26,735
- What?

661
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,200
- You want it? Get it.

662
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:32,578
- Hello.

663
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:34,182
Ma.

664
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:38,247
When?

665
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:47,191
- Push it, come on.

666
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,192
Get your butt in here, Grady.

667
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:50,461
- Hey coach, we gotta talk.

668
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:51,778
- I'm not interested.

669
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,097
You're out of uniform, Grady.

670
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:54,647
- Coach, I gotta talk to you.

671
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,182
- Hey Alex, what's wrong.

672
00:46:56,182 --> 00:46:57,391
- Outside, Grady.

673
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,761
- Okay, in a minute.

674
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:02,752
Coach, my boy Walter, he got hit by a car.

675
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:03,803
He was on his bicycle.

676
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:05,337
He's so small they didn't even see him

677
00:47:05,337 --> 00:47:06,699
and he's hurt really bad.

678
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,858
- I'm sorry to hear that, Grady.

679
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:08,880
- Anyway, I gotta go home.

680
00:47:08,888 --> 00:47:10,269
I'll be back as soon as I can.

681
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:11,505
- You know the program.

682
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:14,834
Three months, no
distractions, no exceptions.

683
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,856
Those are the rules.

684
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,570
- Don't talk to me about rules, coach.

685
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:19,461
My kid might lose his leg.

686
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,864
- We all have our priorities.

687
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:22,275
- What?

688
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:24,837
Are you telling me that if
I leave I can't come back?

689
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:26,121
- That's right.

690
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:28,386
- What is wrong with you?

691
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:30,533
What the hell is wrong with you?

692
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:32,028
Put yourself in my place.

693
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,895
- I'm not in your place, Grady.

694
00:47:33,897 --> 00:47:35,604
We leave for Korea in three days.

695
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:37,063
It's your choice.

696
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:40,482
- There is no choice.

697
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,448
I'm outta here.

698
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:49,331
- Alex, what's up?

699
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:50,866
- My kid's been hurt, I gotta go.

700
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:51,710
- Don't worry about this.

701
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:52,779
We will be here when you get back.

702
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:54,475
- You heard him, I can't come back.

703
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:55,675
- Just get back here.

704
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,054
We'll deal with Couzo then.

705
00:47:57,054 --> 00:47:58,598
- Look, you're here.

706
00:47:58,598 --> 00:47:59,452
I gotta go.

707
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,539
- Hey, hey, hey.

708
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,705
- Thanks.

709
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:06,504
- Mr.
Grady, I'm Dr. Weisman.

710
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:07,474
- How is he?

711
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,242
- Well, he'll
wear a cast for six weeks,

712
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:10,629
but the leg is not the problem.

713
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:11,281
- What do you mean?

714
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,065
- Mr. Grady,
your son is in a coma.

715
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,758
There appear to be no other complications,

716
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,868
but I must tell you he
could remain unconscious

717
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:18,822
for an hour or a month.

718
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:19,790
- Oh my god.

719
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,201
I want to see him.

720
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:40,354
Walter.

721
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:44,968
Walter, can you hear me?

722
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:48,139
It's daddy.

723
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:51,777
Daddy's here.

724
00:48:56,442 --> 00:48:58,130
Walter.

725
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:00,869
Don't leave me.

726
00:49:03,414 --> 00:49:05,284
I need you.

727
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:44,240
Walter?

728
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,066
- I crashed myself.

729
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,694
- Yes you did.

730
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:56,858
We're here, Walter.

731
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,100
We're right here.

732
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:02,621
That's my boy.

733
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,813
- Recoil, Travis.

734
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,551
- Okay Travis, go for it.

735
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,966
- It's 57 mile per hour,
195 pounds pressure.

736
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,448
That's pretty good, Brick.

737
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:18,066
- One more time, Travis.

738
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:19,423
- Coach.

739
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:20,802
- Don't bother, Grady,
you're off the team.

740
00:50:20,802 --> 00:50:22,202
- I need to talk to you for a minute.

741
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:23,902
- Nothing to talk about,
Grady, you made your choice.

742
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,194
- Coach, I caught the first plane back.

743
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:29,617
I had to go, can't you understand that?

744
00:50:34,223 --> 00:50:36,323
Well, do you want me to beg?

745
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,260
Do you want me to...

746
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:40,762
Hey Frank!

747
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:44,238
You want me to beg?

748
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:45,703
Okay.

749
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,598
I will beg.

750
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,329
I need this.

751
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:59,904
This is the only thing
I know I am good at.

752
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,687
Don't take that away from me, please.

753
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,420
- Don, line up the alternate.

754
00:51:15,424 --> 00:51:17,218
Who's next, Tommy?

755
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,907
Tommy.

756
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,269
- 53 mile per hour, 184 pounds pressure.

757
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,781
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

758
00:51:44,779 --> 00:51:46,352
We leave for the tournament in two days.

759
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,005
You're still pulling punches.

760
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,853
Holding back won't change a damn thing.

761
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,767
If you want to be here,
you've got to give us 100%,

762
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:54,032
no less.

763
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:55,464
Now do it again.

764
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:56,696
- Coach.

765
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,777
- I said do it again.

766
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:16,894
Do it!

767
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,147
- Is he okay?

768
00:52:28,149 --> 00:52:29,549
- Don't know yet.

769
00:52:29,735 --> 00:52:31,059
Pulse is okay.

770
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,532
Breathing.

771
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,812
- Virgil, Virgil.

772
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,027
- Hey, hey.

773
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:53,329
Big stretch.

774
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,186
- Hey, how are you, man?

775
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,171
- He's just taking a break.

776
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,041
- Tommy!

777
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:03,592
- Let him go.

778
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:05,932
- Virgil.

779
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,181
He's all right.

780
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,970
Virgil, you know where you are?

781
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:14,153
Do you know where you are?

782
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:17,937
- On the floor.

783
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:21,966
- Hey, hey where you going?

784
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:24,152
- How's your kid, Alex?

785
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:25,516
- He's gonna be okay, thank god.

786
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:26,512
Where are you going?

787
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:27,764
- I'm quitting the team.

788
00:53:27,765 --> 00:53:29,040
- Bullshit.

789
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:30,309
Why?

790
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,041
- Because I can't fight Dae Han.

791
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:32,626
- Why?

792
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,782
- Because I can't fight Dae Han.

793
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,940
- What are you talking about, man?

794
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:44,713
- Dae Han killed my
brother in a tournament

795
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,729
just like this one.

796
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,420
- Why didn't you ever tell me this?

797
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:51,550
- It wasn't your problem.

798
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:52,881
- That's bullshit, man.

799
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:53,991
- What do you want me to say?

800
00:53:53,993 --> 00:53:55,220
- Say something.

801
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,908
- I want to kill the son of a bitch.

802
00:53:56,908 --> 00:53:58,213
- Then kill the son of a bitch.

803
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,828
- Alex!

804
00:54:00,813 --> 00:54:02,933
I'm afraid.

805
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:07,088
If you don't deal with this right now,

806
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:09,819
you never will.

807
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:12,707
You'll just shove it inside like I did.

808
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:16,559
Melissa died and I just packed it in.

809
00:54:16,556 --> 00:54:20,603
I took all that pain
and I just packed it in.

810
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,942
I was wrong.

811
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:27,282
You are wrong.

812
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:30,527
Your brother is gone, man.

813
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:34,264
Melissa is gone.

814
00:54:37,022 --> 00:54:39,113
You need this fight bad.

815
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,078
You need this fight for you, man.

816
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:43,138
This is your chance.

817
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,598
Don't blow it.

818
00:54:47,097 --> 00:54:48,717
That's all I got to say.

819
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:50,870
Except you're an asshole.

820
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:16,556
- Hey, what are you doing
in Coach Couzo's office?

821
00:55:16,556 --> 00:55:17,880
You're not supposed to be doing that.

822
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:18,634
- What is it, Don?

823
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,119
What is it I don't know?

824
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:21,911
- I don't have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

825
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:23,642
- What is it about Tommy?

826
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:26,182
- Look, I really think
you should leave here

827
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:27,583
before Coach Couzo gets back.

828
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:29,962
- Don, there's two pages
missing from Tommy's file.

829
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:31,616
- Yeah, that's right, I can't discuss it.

830
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:32,813
Look, I really think you should...

831
00:55:32,811 --> 00:55:34,749
- I'm not leaving until you tell me.

832
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:35,663
- Oh boy.

833
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:37,090
- You're not responsible for this.

834
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:39,049
- Look, I know I'm not
responsible for this, Miss Wade,

835
00:55:39,046 --> 00:55:41,156
I just could lose my job because of it.

836
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:46,127
Now, you did not get that from me, right?

837
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,864
No, no, come on now, you
didn't get that from me.

838
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:55,475
You know the enemy
is waiting in the ring

839
00:55:57,129 --> 00:56:00,457
Fate is riding on the fight

840
00:56:04,412 --> 00:56:08,526
You'll have to find a
way to keep a good man down

841
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,527
He'll take the challenge
on with all his might

842
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,390
Though a little part
is burning in his soul

843
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,644
The thought of it is
heavy on your mind

844
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,868
- Pick it up.

845
00:56:34,873 --> 00:56:36,484
- Why didn't you tell me about Tommy?

846
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,349
This is how you deal
with people, Mr. Couzo.

847
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,280
- What are you talking about?

848
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,260
- You know what I'm talking about.

849
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,596
I've just seen the videotape.

850
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:44,672
- So?

851
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:45,974
- So?

852
00:56:45,978 --> 00:56:48,251
How could you send him
to the ring with Dae Han?

853
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:49,678
- Because Tommy's the
only fighter on this team

854
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:51,917
who has a chance against
him and you know it.

855
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:54,185
- So it's only about
winning then, is that it?

856
00:56:54,183 --> 00:56:56,111
Win at any cost, right coach?

857
00:56:56,116 --> 00:56:57,296
- Back off, Wade.

858
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,251
I don't have to listen to this.

859
00:56:58,254 --> 00:56:59,299
- Yes you do, Frank.

860
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:00,928
If you pull one more
stunt like you just pulled

861
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:02,305
with Tommy, you won't
have to get on a plane

862
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:05,508
because I will personally kick
your ass from here to Korea.

863
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,998
None of this had to happen, Frank.

864
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:14,145
Did you ever stop to think
what it might be like

865
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,365
if you cared as much about these guys

866
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:18,307
as you do about winning?

867
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,999
- This has nothing to do with winning.

868
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:24,280
If those boys do their best and fail,

869
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:26,204
I'll still be proud.

870
00:57:26,507 --> 00:57:28,080
But if they don't give me their all

871
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:30,134
and if I don't give them mine,

872
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:33,619
that is my failure and my disgrace.

873
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,957
Matter of fact, that's
exactly what happened

874
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,526
to Tommy's brother.

875
00:57:39,528 --> 00:57:41,533
You saw that tape.

876
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,871
I was the coach of that team, Miss Wade.

877
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,349
I carried the burden of
his death for 15 years.

878
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:51,149
Those boys didn't know what
they were getting into.

879
00:57:51,157 --> 00:57:52,547
I did.

880
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:55,344
It was all just a game to them.

881
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,980
I didn't know enough
then to give them rules,

882
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:01,034
to drive them to the edge,
to the breaking point,

883
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:02,908
to where they hated my guts.

884
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:06,848
Tommy's brother died because I failed.

885
00:58:07,728 --> 00:58:09,972
He was not prepared.

886
00:58:10,643 --> 00:58:14,969
And I will never let
that happen again, ever.

887
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:36,688
- Coach.

888
00:58:37,474 --> 00:58:40,121
We, um, we need to talk to you.

889
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,204
- I'm listening.

890
00:58:45,985 --> 00:58:50,147
- Coach, um, we all thought that...

891
00:58:50,146 --> 00:58:51,997
- What is it, Grasso?

892
00:58:52,355 --> 00:58:54,417
- Well, we uh...

893
00:58:54,422 --> 00:58:56,810
- We hope you change your mind about Alex.

894
00:58:56,805 --> 00:58:57,898
- Since when did you give a rat's ass

895
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,550
about anybody but you?

896
00:58:59,547 --> 00:59:01,052
- Since now.

897
00:59:02,994 --> 00:59:05,458
Coach, we need Alex

898
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:08,975
and we need Tommy to win.

899
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:12,104
- That all?

900
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,702
- Yes sir.

901
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:17,739
- Plane leaves tomorrow, 2000 hours.

902
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:28,564
I'll be damned.

903
00:59:38,835 --> 00:59:40,408
- May I come in?

904
00:59:40,563 --> 00:59:42,078
Mr. Jennings, if you're going to fire me,

905
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,305
then damn it, fire me.

906
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:44,954
- Nobody's firing you yet.

907
00:59:45,824 --> 00:59:47,781
- Until I am relieved of my duties,

908
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,972
I'll continue to make all decisions

909
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:53,033
concerning the conduct of
this team as I see fit.

910
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:58,265
- Great, you're back!

911
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,173
- That includes the
participation of Alex Grady.

912
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:04,942
I have a lot to do before we leave, so

913
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:06,634
if you don't mind.

914
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,165
- Come on, boys, hop in.

915
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,536
- You, Coach.

916
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:15,897
- Tickets.

917
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,142
- This way.

918
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:18,776
Travis.

919
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:19,940
Where's Virgil?

920
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:21,421
- He's in the bathroom.

921
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:24,400
- Hey, what do you think?

922
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:25,611
- About what?

923
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:27,412
- He shaved his beard.

924
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,259
- It'll make me faster, don't you think?

925
01:01:29,528 --> 01:01:31,168
- Yeah.

926
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,450
- Tommy!

927
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:41,863
- Coach, I, uh...

928
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:44,355
- No apologies offered or accepted.

929
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:46,728
Welcome back.

930
01:01:49,675 --> 01:01:51,650
- Thank you, sir.

931
01:01:51,996 --> 01:01:53,262
Yeah!

932
01:01:53,664 --> 01:01:54,642
Hey, Virgil.

933
01:01:54,646 --> 01:01:55,615
- I'm all right.

934
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:56,442
- I'm glad you're all right.

935
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,578
- You kick hard.

936
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:00,285
- Hey buddy, how you doing?

937
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,750
- Here's your coat.

938
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:04,315
- I owe you one.

939
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:05,253
- Yeah you do.

940
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:06,366
- Yeah.

941
01:02:07,637 --> 01:02:08,749
- It's good to have you back.

942
01:02:08,752 --> 01:02:10,114
- Good to be here.

943
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,172
Sonny, Miss Wade.

944
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:15,610
Travis.

945
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,060
- Hello everybody, I'm
Ahmad Rashad and welcome

946
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,757
to Seoul, Korea and the Jamsil gymnasium

947
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:50,260
for an invitation tournament between the

948
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:52,204
national teams of the Republic of Korea

949
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,658
and the United States.

950
01:02:53,664 --> 01:02:55,802
This afternoon we'll be
watching the United States

951
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:59,081
team under the leadership
of Coach Frank Couzo,

952
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:01,166
himself a veteran of
this often perilous sport

953
01:03:01,162 --> 01:03:03,415
leading his youthful warriors
in a sport traditionally

954
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:06,049
dominated by Asian powerhouses.

955
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:24,138
- You've worked
very hard, all of you.

956
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,460
You've grown as athletes and individuals.

957
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:30,557
You've learned a lot.

958
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:33,154
We've all learned a lot.

959
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:36,132
As Catherine might say, the teacher also

960
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,024
learns from the students.

961
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,224
Today you have a chance to be the best

962
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:43,626
martial artists in the world.

963
01:03:44,206 --> 01:03:45,769
It's up to you.

964
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:52,201
If you give everything
you've got, everything

965
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:55,879
with all your heart, you'll be winners.

966
01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:58,388
That I promise you.

967
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:02,420
You can be the best of the best.

968
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:14,791
- A capacity
crowd of 15,000 spectators

969
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:17,371
has jammed Jamsil arena
for this traditional

970
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:20,198
sporting event which is
held every three years.

971
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,535
The pageantry you are witnessing shows the

972
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:24,808
importance of Tae Kwon
Do to Korean heritage.

973
01:04:24,806 --> 01:04:27,904
They are as passionate
and wild about Tae Kwon Do

974
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:30,168
as the Americans are about baseball.

975
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,486
- And here they come
now, the United States

976
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:56,116
national team, Coach
Couzo and the assistant

977
01:04:56,117 --> 01:04:58,505
coaches Catherine Wade and Don Peterson.

978
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,873
- Grandma, I see him!

979
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,786
- And now the Korean national team

980
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,204
makes its entrance.

981
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:16,381
- For you viewers new to the sport,

982
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:18,111
this is a full contact match,

983
01:07:18,104 --> 01:07:19,993
the object of which is to win points or

984
01:07:19,996 --> 01:07:21,578
knock out your opponent.

985
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:23,941
Styles include a
combination of Tae Kwon Do,

986
01:07:23,935 --> 01:07:26,332
Karate, Judo, and kickboxing.

987
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:28,525
Each match consists of
three two minute rounds

988
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:31,558
with accumulated points
added to both side's totals.

989
01:07:32,691 --> 01:07:34,091
- Hey Coach Wade.

990
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:36,844
What's my son doing here?

991
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:41,801
Thank you.

992
01:07:45,048 --> 01:07:46,880
- We now direct your
attention to center stage

993
01:07:46,879 --> 01:07:48,883
for the first match of the afternoon.

994
01:07:48,883 --> 01:07:51,683
Yung Kim of Korea versus Sonny Grasso, a

995
01:07:51,686 --> 01:07:54,669
second degree black belt
hailing from Detroit, Michigan.

996
01:07:54,826 --> 01:07:57,473
Our referee is Mr. Chang
Park Kim, a veteran of the

997
01:07:57,476 --> 01:07:59,835
Korean Tae Kwon Do Association.

998
01:08:09,454 --> 01:08:11,210
And it looks like we're
about to get underway.

999
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,410
The Americans heavy
underdogs against their

1000
01:08:13,403 --> 01:08:15,283
Asian counterparts.

1001
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:23,414
- Come on, Sonny.

1002
01:08:23,417 --> 01:08:24,002
- Come on, Sonny.

1003
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,998
- Come on!

1004
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:33,985
- Power counter!

1005
01:08:38,605 --> 01:08:40,072
- Point good!

1006
01:08:42,635 --> 01:08:43,968
- Here in the
third and final round,

1007
01:08:43,975 --> 01:08:47,121
Grasso is beginning to
fade, Yung Kim relentless.

1008
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:50,529
He lands with a vicious
jump spinning back kick!

1009
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:57,643
Grasso is down.

1010
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:09,665
Korea takes the first match.

1011
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,950
The score stands Korea 11,
the United States seven.

1012
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,718
Here in round three,
Virgil Keller capitalizing

1013
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,931
on his speed and scores with
a spinning roundhouse kick.

1014
01:09:44,634 --> 01:09:47,205
An elbow to the spine
and Keller is down again.

1015
01:09:47,202 --> 01:09:48,890
- Come on, Virgil!

1016
01:09:49,514 --> 01:09:51,403
- He appears to be dazed.

1017
01:09:51,631 --> 01:09:54,201
- Stay focused, stay focused!

1018
01:10:02,054 --> 01:10:04,116
- That is the
end of the second match.

1019
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,826
The winner, Han Cho, giving
the Republic of Korea

1020
01:10:06,822 --> 01:10:10,658
a total of 20 points
against nine for the USA.

1021
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,695
It's not a pretty sight,
ladies and gentlemen.

1022
01:10:13,695 --> 01:10:14,980
Both fighters bloody.

1023
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:16,595
Travis Brickley of the
United States going on

1024
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,700
every last ounce of strength as he fights

1025
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,578
blow for blow with a seemingly exhausted

1026
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:22,114
Tung Sung Moon.

1027
01:10:33,765 --> 01:10:35,482
- Come on, come on!

1028
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:36,352
Come on!

1029
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:42,888
- This partisan
crowd showing disapproval

1030
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:44,602
of Brickley's conduct.

1031
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:49,667
- Travis, behave yourself!

1032
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:52,341
- It's a full count, kimchi, and I'm going

1033
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:53,871
to hit home run on your fase, boy.

1034
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:55,473
- This might be exactly
what Brickley needed

1035
01:10:55,473 --> 01:10:56,691
to fire him up.

1036
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,522
He scores heavily with a quick and sending

1037
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,806
Moon to the canvas.

1038
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,411
It should be a score.

1039
01:11:01,415 --> 01:11:03,285
Yes, it's all time of the three piece.

1040
01:11:03,278 --> 01:11:04,956
An incredible comeback from Brickley.

1041
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:06,835
- USA!

1042
01:11:12,698 --> 01:11:14,453
- A demonstration of
strength will determine the

1043
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:17,604
winner of the Travis Brickley,
Tung Sung Moon match.

1044
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:19,296
The fighter breaking
the most bricks will be

1045
01:11:19,296 --> 01:11:21,358
declared the victor.

1046
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,622
- It appears as
though Tung Sung Moon

1047
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:01,013
is using a very unorthodox technique,

1048
01:12:01,019 --> 01:12:03,109
something called the ridge hand.

1049
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:28,959
- What are you counting them for?

1050
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,576
- Only one
concrete block separates

1051
01:12:32,576 --> 01:12:34,647
the fate of Brickley and Moon.

1052
01:12:35,072 --> 01:12:35,983
- Tung.

1053
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:37,948
- But the match
goes to Tung Sung Moon.

1054
01:12:37,946 --> 01:12:40,277
Now remember, this is a team competition

1055
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:42,398
where total points rather than individual

1056
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:45,302
match scores decide the overall winner.

1057
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,347
Coming up next, another
long shot, the veteran

1058
01:12:48,339 --> 01:12:52,166
fighter on the team from
Portland, Oregon, Alex Grady.

1059
01:12:56,798 --> 01:13:00,203
- Alex, it's up to you and me.

1060
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:01,908
You and me.

1061
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,694
- We're taking home the gold, Tommy.

1062
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:06,572
Yeah!

1063
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:07,959
- Do it!

1064
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:09,570
- This is a
real test for Alex Grady

1065
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:11,358
after a three year layoff
from the tournament

1066
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:13,245
circuit he makes his comeback against

1067
01:13:13,237 --> 01:13:15,616
Sae Jin Kwon, considered to be the top

1068
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,999
ranking fighter in his weight class.

1069
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:20,831
- Watch the shoulder.

1070
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:21,834
You can take him, Alex.

1071
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:22,788
You've got the tools.

1072
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:23,482
- Yes sir.

1073
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,944
- Go get 'em.

1074
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,018
- This crowd is
really into this one,

1075
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:34,332
anticipating a major
battle between these two

1076
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,054
tough competitors.

1077
01:13:39,094 --> 01:13:41,578
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

1078
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:51,649
- And here we go.

1079
01:13:51,648 --> 01:13:53,288
Alex Grady measuring.

1080
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:56,056
Sae Jin Kwon attacks,
Grady counters with a down

1081
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,457
and scores.

1082
01:13:57,571 --> 01:13:59,182
- Down, down, down!

1083
01:13:59,177 --> 01:14:00,702
- For you, Travis.

1084
01:14:00,844 --> 01:14:01,995
- Take that.

1085
01:14:04,043 --> 01:14:06,393
- The Korean bounces right back.

1086
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:09,749
A point for the Korean team.

1087
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:17,577
In the earlier matches
today, the Koreans have

1088
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:20,171
built up a wide lead, but
because of this outstanding

1089
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,290
performance by Alex Grady, the Americans

1090
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,775
are closing the gap.

1091
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:29,807
But it is way too early
to write off Sae Jin Kwon.

1092
01:14:41,908 --> 01:14:43,577
As we approach the end of round two,

1093
01:14:43,575 --> 01:14:46,030
this match is really starting to heat up.

1094
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:48,826
Ooh, Sae Jin Kwon explodes with a vicious

1095
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,501
aerial back knuckle.

1096
01:14:52,352 --> 01:14:54,471
As if this physical
confrontation weren't enough,

1097
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,963
he seems to be taunting Grady.

1098
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,028
- You're mine.

1099
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:20,342
- No, no!

1100
01:15:27,614 --> 01:15:30,040
- The athletes are
starting to lose their composure.

1101
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:32,359
Clearly both teams are
more determined to win,

1102
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,094
but that determination
doesn't affect the score.

1103
01:15:35,122 --> 01:15:37,395
Alex Grady has thus far
defied the odds and is

1104
01:15:37,393 --> 01:15:39,187
leading in the second
heaviest weight class

1105
01:15:39,192 --> 01:15:40,736
of the competition.

1106
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:47,676
- Alex, when he comes in,

1107
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,422
side step and use your ridge hand.

1108
01:15:50,748 --> 01:15:52,647
You're going to use your distance.

1109
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,597
Set him up and sweep him.

1110
01:15:54,686 --> 01:15:55,511
- Yes sir.

1111
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:56,147
- Take it to him.

1112
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,194
- Yes sir.

1113
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,892
I'm gonna take your head off.

1114
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:24,873
Thank you, folks.

1115
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:30,197
- With one minute remaining in the

1116
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:32,288
third round, both
athletes are landing some

1117
01:16:32,294 --> 01:16:34,566
incredible combinations,
although neither fighter

1118
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:37,048
seems able to seize the advantage.

1119
01:16:46,983 --> 01:16:48,719
Grady is down.

1120
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,736
He's hurt.

1121
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:56,246
An injured shoulder forced Grady into

1122
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,526
retirement three years ago.

1123
01:16:57,519 --> 01:17:00,732
It now appears he's re-injured
that very same shoulder.

1124
01:17:03,442 --> 01:17:05,399
What a blow for the Americans.

1125
01:17:05,396 --> 01:17:07,026
Alex Grady, hurt.

1126
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,362
If he can't continue,
the match will be forfeit

1127
01:17:09,364 --> 01:17:11,292
and the American team
will lose the valuable

1128
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:13,590
points that Grady's earned so far.

1129
01:17:13,702 --> 01:17:15,064
- You want to quit now?

1130
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:16,376
- No, I don't know.

1131
01:17:16,372 --> 01:17:17,705
- Two minutes.

1132
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:18,824
Two minutes.

1133
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:21,099
- Pop it, pop it, pop it.

1134
01:17:21,097 --> 01:17:22,881
- Listen here, Alexander,
we can't let you go on.

1135
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:23,903
Your shoulder's dislocated.

1136
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,349
We're going to have to stop
this thing, right coach?

1137
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:26,359
- You did your best, Alex.

1138
01:17:26,356 --> 01:17:27,439
Catherine, take him to medical.

1139
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,398
- No!

1140
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:29,332
Pop it, Tommy.

1141
01:17:29,332 --> 01:17:30,847
Shit, Tommy, pop it!

1142
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,428
- Forget it, Alex, it's over.

1143
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:35,232
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

1144
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:42,825
- Grandma!

1145
01:17:42,835 --> 01:17:44,053
- God damn it!

1146
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:45,433
Tape it up, tape it up.

1147
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:47,073
If I'm out, it's over.

1148
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,422
I can hold him off or 30 seconds.

1149
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:50,759
God damn it, I said tape it up!

1150
01:17:50,803 --> 01:17:52,002
- Ladies and
gentlemen, I've just been

1151
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,333
informed that there will
be a two minute injury

1152
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,083
time out to determine if
Alex Grady can continue.

1153
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:57,932
Now there's just 30
seconds left on the clock.

1154
01:17:57,933 --> 01:17:59,909
If he can hold on, he keeps the points

1155
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:02,036
and the Americans are still in it.

1156
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:04,339
- Put your mind somewhere else.

1157
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:06,207
Let the pain go.

1158
01:18:06,209 --> 01:18:08,050
There is no pain.

1159
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:10,728
There is no pain.

1160
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,729
- You got 30 seconds to go, Alex.

1161
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,824
You go out and do it.

1162
01:18:15,448 --> 01:18:16,666
Let's get up.

1163
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:21,728
- Yeah!

1164
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:23,110
- This is unbelievable.

1165
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,510
What a show of courage.

1166
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,544
Alex Grady has reentered the ring.

1167
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,934
He intends to finish this fight.

1168
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,976
And Kwon immediately
attacks the left shoulder.

1169
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,840
Alex bravely pairing with his left hand,

1170
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:44,539
trying to keep Kwon at bay.

1171
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,082
Kwon attacks, Grady counters and scores.

1172
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,568
Oh, and Grady catches him with a jumping

1173
01:18:51,567 --> 01:18:53,543
front kick that knocks Kwon!

1174
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,825
- Yes sir!

1175
01:18:58,184 --> 01:18:59,402
- Yeah!

1176
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:01,302
- The buzzers sound.

1177
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,953
That is the end of the match.

1178
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:05,329
Alex Grady, injured shoulder and all,

1179
01:19:05,334 --> 01:19:07,588
has defeated Sae Jin Kwon and managed

1180
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:09,665
to keep the American hopes alive.

1181
01:19:11,225 --> 01:19:13,248
Ladies and gentlemen,
we direct your attention

1182
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:16,109
to center ring for the final
match of the afternoon.

1183
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:20,000
Representing Korea at 175
pounds, the winner of the

1184
01:19:19,992 --> 01:19:22,879
gold medals at the 1984 through the 1988

1185
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:25,918
world games, Dae Han Park.

1186
01:19:26,713 --> 01:19:30,127
For the United States team at 167 pounds,

1187
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,834
winner of a gold medal
at the 1988 invitational

1188
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:36,955
championship, from Fresno,
California, Tommy Lee.

1189
01:19:40,387 --> 01:19:41,653
- Tommy.

1190
01:19:43,756 --> 01:19:44,917
- Yes sir?

1191
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:47,009
- Don't hold back.

1192
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,292
You can do it.

1193
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,636
- Yes sir.

1194
01:19:57,879 --> 01:19:59,433
- And there's Dae
Han, the all time gold

1195
01:19:59,435 --> 01:20:02,417
medal winner and heart and
soul of the Korean team.

1196
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,275
If you had any doubt
about why he's the most

1197
01:20:04,273 --> 01:20:07,083
feared fighter in the sport
today, just take a look.

1198
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,045
We're just about ready.

1199
01:20:23,043 --> 01:20:25,614
America's hopes rest on Tommy Lee.

1200
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,169
Dae Han opens up quickly with a right to

1201
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,687
Tommy Lee's head.

1202
01:20:58,618 --> 01:21:01,716
That is three unanswered
points by Dae Han.

1203
01:21:01,738 --> 01:21:03,685
This does not look like the same Tommy Lee

1204
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:06,338
that we saw in the North
American championships.

1205
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:12,784
Tommy Lee now on the attack, the veteran

1206
01:21:12,775 --> 01:21:14,310
Dae Han countering.

1207
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:20,949
This spectacular aerial
display is the trademark

1208
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:22,866
of classical Tae Kwon Do.

1209
01:21:24,518 --> 01:21:26,628
Score, Tommy Lee with
an inside crescent kick.

1210
01:21:26,624 --> 01:21:27,861
- All right!

1211
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:37,113
- Lee again with a
beautiful spinning heel kick.

1212
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:38,509
- Tommy, yeah!

1213
01:21:40,587 --> 01:21:42,936
- Folks, this Tommy
Lee is some kind of fighter.

1214
01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:45,125
But the Americans may be
too far behind against

1215
01:21:45,129 --> 01:21:47,267
a master like Dae Han.

1216
01:22:17,952 --> 01:22:18,968
- Yeah!

1217
01:22:18,974 --> 01:22:21,084
Drop it like a toilet seat, Tommy!

1218
01:22:27,086 --> 01:22:29,550
- Illegal hit, illegal hit!

1219
01:22:29,551 --> 01:22:31,201
- Dae Han with
a kick to the groin.

1220
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:34,209
An illegal move even
in full contact karate.

1221
01:22:38,973 --> 01:22:40,124
And there it is.

1222
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:42,669
The referee is giving Dae Han a warning.

1223
01:22:42,747 --> 01:22:44,032
Illegal hit.

1224
01:22:54,101 --> 01:22:56,901
- Coach, how many points to win?

1225
01:22:56,904 --> 01:22:59,330
- Six or knockout.

1226
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:01,396
- Or a knockout.

1227
01:23:01,578 --> 01:23:02,825
If he doesn't knock me out first.

1228
01:23:02,827 --> 01:23:04,122
- You can do it.

1229
01:23:24,277 --> 01:23:25,927
- Korean crowd is coming alive.

1230
01:23:25,925 --> 01:23:28,082
Young support trying to bring Dae Han

1231
01:23:28,082 --> 01:23:29,866
back into this match and crush any hope

1232
01:23:29,862 --> 01:23:31,685
of an American upset.

1233
01:23:33,402 --> 01:23:34,400
- Illegal hit, again!

1234
01:23:34,874 --> 01:23:37,224
- It's another
illegal blow by Dae Han,

1235
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:39,011
but the referee didn't see it.

1236
01:23:51,642 --> 01:23:52,966
What a move!

1237
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:54,841
A crushing blow by Tommy Lee to Dae Han.

1238
01:23:54,843 --> 01:23:56,224
Is it possible?

1239
01:23:56,224 --> 01:23:58,381
Can 26 year old Tommy Lee
bring the American team

1240
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:01,009
back from a seven point deficit?

1241
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:02,758
Score, Tommy Lee.

1242
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,038
With a minute and a
half left on the clock,

1243
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:08,062
Tommy Lee has clearly taken
control of this fight.

1244
01:24:08,468 --> 01:24:10,204
With the American team
trailing, the question now

1245
01:24:10,206 --> 01:24:12,633
is there time for Lee
to score enough points

1246
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,875
for an American team victory?

1247
01:24:34,723 --> 01:24:36,478
This could be it.

1248
01:24:36,483 --> 01:24:37,778
This could be it!

1249
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:40,218
If he doesn't get up,
it's a technical knockout.

1250
01:24:40,217 --> 01:24:42,758
The American team will
win this tournament!

1251
01:25:29,941 --> 01:25:31,389
- No.

1252
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,650
- No, Tommy, no.

1253
01:25:35,955 --> 01:25:38,286
Tommy, no, no!

1254
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:41,385
Coach, coach, he's gonna kill him!

1255
01:25:41,385 --> 01:25:42,853
- No!

1256
01:25:47,848 --> 01:25:49,296
- Why doesn't Lee finish him?

1257
01:25:49,301 --> 01:25:50,874
A knockout would end it.

1258
01:25:50,876 --> 01:25:52,046
What is going on?

1259
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,102
Dae Han is completely helpless and the

1260
01:25:54,106 --> 01:25:56,216
American will not finish him off.

1261
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:58,023
- You won that match.

1262
01:26:58,919 --> 01:27:01,278
Don't ever forget that.

1263
01:28:01,654 --> 01:28:03,035
- Just a minute,
ladies and gentlemen,

1264
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:04,723
there is something going on here.

1265
01:28:04,723 --> 01:28:06,795
Dae Han is making some sort of gesture

1266
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,507
to the American team.

1267
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,800
- To save a life in defeat

1268
01:28:23,115 --> 01:28:27,910
is to earn victory and honor within.

1269
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:35,306
Your brother too was a great fighter.

1270
01:28:36,772 --> 01:28:41,567
I deeply regret your loss

1271
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:45,670
and I offer myself

1272
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:49,142
as your brother.

1273
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:45,489
- Alexander Grady, Portland, Oregan.

1274
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:53,121
I know everything about you.

1275
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:15,082
- Sae Jin Kwon, Seoul, Korea,

1276
01:30:15,882 --> 01:30:18,615
I know all I ever want to know about you.

1277
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:17,471
We started off heading for the top

1278
01:31:17,856 --> 01:31:21,184
and set our sights on the sun

1279
01:31:22,755 --> 01:31:26,620
There's no more tears,
now we're standing here

1280
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:30,813
and the morning light has begun.

1281
01:31:32,064 --> 01:31:35,737
They said that you'll expire

1282
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:39,661
You're wasting your time to try

1283
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:45,943
But inside a heart of fire
is a force you can't deny

1284
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:55,067
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

1285
01:31:59,581 --> 01:32:04,031
Something so strong, born of the sun

1286
01:32:04,388 --> 01:32:09,184
Like a fire burns inside me so strong

1287
01:32:16,909 --> 01:32:20,841
We live in hope, waiting for the day

1288
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,227
When all our dreams can begin

1289
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:29,575
The time it takes for the rain to fall

1290
01:32:29,849 --> 01:32:33,954
Is the time it takes to give in

1291
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:38,968
They said that you'll expire

1292
01:32:39,045 --> 01:32:42,728
You're wasting your time to try

1293
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:48,495
Inside a heart of fire
is a force you can't deny

1294
01:32:53,566 --> 01:32:58,361
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

1295
01:33:02,557 --> 01:33:07,093
Something so strong, born of the sun

1296
01:33:07,779 --> 01:33:12,574
Like a fire, sea of fire,
burns inside me so strong
