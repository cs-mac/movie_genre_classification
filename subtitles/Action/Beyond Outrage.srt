1
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,946
We're done here.

2
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,514
Goodbye, sir.

3
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,534
Ikemoto...

4
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,625
Sir?

5
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,411
I hear you're working closely
with the Murase Family lately.

6
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:14,091
When Mr. Murase and l
were in prison together,

7
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,992
we made a pact over sake.

8
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,243
I understand.

9
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,318
Please give my regards to Mr. Chairman.

10
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,525
Don't make any suspicious moves.

11
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,760
Respect your brother,

12
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,458
but a sworn father is more important.

13
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,958
I think we're in a bit of trouble.

14
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,618
What?

15
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,895
Mr. Chairman is upset
about my connections to Murase.

16
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,538
I need some help from your family.

17
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,037
Let's talk inside the car.

18
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,245
Good afternoon, sir.

19
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,733
Has Ikemoto left?

20
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:36,935
Yes.

21
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,474
He'd better not be allowing drugs
onto his own turf.

22
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,520
He's making a goddamn fool out of us.

23
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,416
Can't you see that?

24
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,757
Kato!

25
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,823
I'm talking to you!

26
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,488
Mr. Chairman suspects Murase and l
are plotting something.

27
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,193
Murase isn't Sanno-kai Family.

28
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,633
You want me to fire shots
at Murase's office?

29
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,866
But I'm his sworn brother.

30
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,499
Make it like
we're having a minor dispute.

31
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,443
Open an office on his turf.

32
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,783
Champ, that's like waging war
against the Murase Family.

33
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,057
That's exactly what they're doing.

34
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,122
I'm now with
the Organized Crime Dept.

35
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,994
I can't keep calling you Champ.

36
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,024
Why not?

37
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,794
Then here's your money.

38
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,637
Now get the hell out!

39
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,604
By the way, get a new car for your lady.

40
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,910
Switch cars again, we know about you.

41
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,978
Fuck off, asshole.

42
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,489
Was he a good boxer in school?

43
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,757
I never saw him win.

44
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,858
What a smart-ass!

45
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,583
Right over there.

46
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,085
Our nightclub gets high-class girls
due to the recession.

47
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,415
Really?

48
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,649
It's cozy and reasonably priced.

49
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,622
You like young girls?

50
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,591
Of course!

51
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,496
What in the hell?

52
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,501
600,000 yen?

53
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,474
Our girls had a lot to drink.

54
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,412
It's still too high
for that cheap liquor.

55
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,449
Refusing to pay?

56
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,383
And who are you?

57
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,785
Dumb bastard.
Who do you think owns this place?

58
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,222
Pay up, asshole!

59
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,059
I don't have that kind of cash.

60
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,654
We take credit cards.

61
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,160
Or try a quick loan outlet.

62
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,530
Just pay up.

63
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,096
My office is close by.

64
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,368
Someone could accompany me.

65
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,039
I can pay there.

66
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,369
Let's go.

67
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,378
I'm going.

68
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,321
Thanks so much for coming.

69
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,298
After you!

70
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,970
It's me.

71
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,105
Listen, I'm on my way back.

72
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,381
Can you prepare one million in cash?

73
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,154
Well, the thing is...

74
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,489
I ended up in a yakuza bar.

75
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,959
Unbelievable!

76
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,155
Yes, please.

77
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,228
Let's go.

78
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,301
Are we there yet?

79
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,902
Sorry, we're almost there.

80
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,852
Over there.

81
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,112
There?

82
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,354
Otomo Consulting Co.

83
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,989
Come in, please.

84
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,807
The Otomo Family,
affiliate of the Ikemoto Family.

85
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,378
The Ikemoto Family?

86
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,488
One million yen?

87
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,521
Take it!

88
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,997
No, thank you.

89
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,468
What do you mean?

90
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,707
I didn't know he was with Ikemoto Family.

91
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,173
So it's free if he's with the Ikemoto?

92
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,411
You came for money.
There it is.

93
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,449
Take the money and go.

94
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,751
Don't fuck with me!

95
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,599
He cheated one of Ikemoto's men
out of money.

96
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,341
Why, moron?

97
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,375
Kimura...

98
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,314
Sir?

99
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,051
Bring them money
and his finger to apologize.

100
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,079
Dumb-ass!

101
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,105
Brother, what's happening?

102
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,148
Need anything?

103
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,547
No!

104
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,243
Otomo?

105
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,117
Wasn't he your protégé?

106
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,920
Well, I told my men
to send you an apology.

107
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,990
Could you do that?

108
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,800
Thanks.

109
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,559
Hey, no parking here!

110
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,752
It's front of our office.

111
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,352
Move it!

112
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,403
Mr. Otomo...

113
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,182
We're very sorry
that our man made such a mess.

114
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,044
Please accept these as our apology.

115
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,521
Shouldn't Murase be here?

116
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,060
You call petty cash
and a punk's finger an apology?

117
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,754
Our boss is busy.

118
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,456
So you're standing in?

119
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,066
I'm the family underboss.

120
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,529
Help me save face. Take the money.

121
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,266
What are you saying?

122
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,138
It's your responsibility now.
Cut off your finger!

123
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,734
I'm not chopping my finger
over something small.

124
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,576
You think this is small?

125
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,981
Picking a fight
with the Ikemoto Family is small?

126
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,677
Don't fuck with us!

127
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,221
- I didn't mean that.
- That's what you said!

128
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,051
I apologize.

129
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,920
Then give us your finger!

130
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,357
Don't mess with us!

131
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,920
Are you too afraid?

132
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,864
Alright, bring me something!

133
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,600
That will do fine for you!

134
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,264
I don't take orders from you!

135
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,931
That shit won't cut!

136
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,738
You mean you can't do it?

137
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,540
Not with that, asshole!
I want proper tools.

138
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,547
What tools, arrogant prick?

139
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,241
Use this!

140
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,546
Fine, I will.

141
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,759
Can't you do it?

142
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,136
If not for the pact
between our bosses,

143
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,504
we would crush your lousy little family.

144
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,136
The Murase Family
bigger than the Sanno-kai?

145
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,880
Are you fucking crazy?

146
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,973
If anybody is crazy, it's you.

147
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,348
Stop acting like a big shot, punk!

148
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,195
Take that scumbag with you.

149
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,142
You really got suckered, didn't you?

150
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,254
No, I didn't.

151
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,920
Everybody is so dumb.

152
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,096
We should have given more.
Our return will be doubled anyway.

153
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:00,305
This car is so boring.
Why did you change?

154
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,176
I like the previous one better.

155
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,182
Shut up.

156
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,882
You want to die?

157
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,751
What?

158
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,590
I'm so scared!

159
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,396
You look like shit.

160
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,933
The finger was supposed
to express our apology.

161
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,567
How humiliating!

162
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,479
I'll talk it over with Ikemoto.

163
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,153
You guys stay put.

164
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,788
I see.

165
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,103
He says it's only
an adult entertainment company.

166
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,102
You're overreacting.

167
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,779
If you say so.

168
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,982
My men did start all this mess...

169
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,849
You should have told me
about that new office!

170
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,321
I almost got the wrong idea.

171
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,389
Tricky Ikemoto!

172
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,429
He played dumb in front of Murase.

173
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,989
But he gave the orders.

174
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,504
What's the point of making trouble
with a sworn brother?

175
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,067
He skims the Murase drug money.

176
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,668
The head family
is not willing to make a pact.

177
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,243
They only want Murase turf.

178
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,317
It will be war if he finds out.

179
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,590
That's where we come in, right?

180
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,827
We always get the dirty work.

181
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,490
Brother...

182
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:06,731
Let's put an end to this.

183
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,210
By the way,

184
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,104
any progress on the pact
with Mr. Chairman?

185
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,882
About that...

186
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,549
He complained
about the last payment.

187
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,587
He wants at least half
of your drug money.

188
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,288
That wasn't the deal!

189
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,988
Take it or leave it.

190
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,566
He's a very busy man.

191
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,532
I won't snitch
about your drug sideline.

192
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,764
Money talks if you want his consent.

193
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,768
Damn it!

194
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,337
He won't meet with me!

195
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,611
He might...
if you brought money.

196
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,621
He calls himself a brother...

197
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,819
Always ripping me off!

198
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,461
I shouldn't have
made a pact with him.

199
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,624
Leave it!

200
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,646
Sorry about the other day.

201
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,853
Drink up!

202
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,191
It's on the house.

203
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,565
Aren't there any pretty girls?

204
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,798
Only ugly cows here.

205
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,603
Sorry about that.

206
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,004
Where's that punk?

207
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,510
On suspension.

208
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,478
Kimura, too?

209
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,004
Yes.

210
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,221
Thanks for the refreshments.

211
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,696
Get out the way!

212
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,705
He opened the door
and saw the family crest on the wall.

213
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,474
That punk freaked and ran!

214
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:36,521
Then their underboss came in.
And that's what happened!

215
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:42,192
I went back to the bar
with that guy today...

216
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,752
Everything's on the house!

217
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,059
Isn't that funny?

218
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,270
So you got suckered?

219
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,695
No way!

220
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,264
You could have, because
you don't look like a yakuza.

221
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,204
Is that a compliment?

222
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,281
Hell no!

223
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,746
Dumb-ass!

224
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,287
Did you call me a dumb-ass?

225
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,417
So who mooches off a dumb-ass?

226
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,228
Who are you talking to?

227
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,297
To you!

228
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,490
Outside, now!

229
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,567
Bring it on!

230
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,813
Welcome!

231
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,080
- Take this seat?
- No, moron.

232
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,011
Sorry about that.

233
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,793
I'm sorry...

234
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,869
It's taken, moron.

235
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,869
Should I say it again?

236
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,483
Enough!

237
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,888
Where's Otomo?

238
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,958
We want his address.

239
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,265
Where the fuck is he?

240
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,025
I don't know.

241
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,173
Move!

242
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,484
One of your men is dead...
You're doing nothing?

243
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,720
Is that brother so special?

244
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:30,954
No, sir.

245
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,294
Are you letting him shit on me?

246
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,756
No sir, not at all.

247
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,128
Tell that Otomo to take
responsibility for his actions!

248
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,599
I'm sorry.

249
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,940
And you...

250
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:51,480
Can't you instruct them about our rules?

251
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,059
Mr. Chairman was furious
with Ikemoto and l.

252
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,428
What are you gonna do?

253
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,502
Answer me!

254
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,299
I know what to do.

255
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,037
I'll take care of everything.

256
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,940
You were there!

257
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,713
See what happened?

258
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,048
Hey!

259
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,760
That's enough.

260
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,039
So?

261
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,108
He said he'll take care of it.

262
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,362
Where's the money I stashed?

263
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,305
I don't know.

264
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,404
You don't know?

265
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,035
You took it without telling me.

266
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,116
Give me the credit cards.

267
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,144
Where the fuck is that punk?

268
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,651
I don't know!

269
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,047
- You'd better fucking tell me.
- Well...

270
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,728
He went back home to Aomori.

271
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,728
Where's Kimura then?

272
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,901
You should know!

273
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,106
It makes no difference
if you rat on one more guy.

274
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,936
I really don't know.

275
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,638
How do we settle this?

276
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,840
How should I know?

277
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,740
Your men brought on all this mess.

278
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,677
That's not fair!

279
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,218
We lost one of our men.

280
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,883
So we're even.

281
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,319
Let's go and apologize
to Mr. Chairman.

282
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,951
That will settle things.

283
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,225
I'm counting on you, brother.

284
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,202
Come here.

285
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,771
Let's finish the bottle.

286
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,379
Boss...

287
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,149
How much should we bring
to the head family?

288
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,816
I don't know.

289
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,991
Murase should bring money.

290
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,063
I'll make sure
this won't happen again.

291
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,135
I am truly sorry.

292
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,467
Terribly sorry.

293
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,339
No problem. In this case...

294
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,972
You're both to blame.

295
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,783
You two are brothers.

296
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,178
Stick together.

297
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,276
We will.

298
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,520
Thanks for making the trip.

299
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,656
I'll go now.

300
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:52,102
You'd like to call a truce
and make it 50-50?

301
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,014
Mr. Chairman
is only acting calm and collected.

302
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:04,253
You're wrong if you think
killing one punk can end this.

303
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,250
What?

304
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,362
You want us to rough up Murase?

305
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,158
He's your sworn brother.

306
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,700
Are you sure?

307
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,401
Our pact is just a formality.

308
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,101
I only want you
to rough him up a little.

309
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,792
Murase...

310
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,463
You dared to kill one of my men?

311
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:26,202
I've already smoothed things over
with Mr. Chairman.

312
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,068
What about smoothing things over
with me?

313
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm telling you...

314
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,138
They did it without my permission.

315
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,838
That's no excuse, asshole!

316
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,244
Open up!

317
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,145
I'll fix you up.

318
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,864
Ikemoto never listens to Mr. Chairman.

319
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,474
Go see Ikemoto and apologize.

320
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,768
Pretend that you're retiring.

321
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,811
Just formality.

322
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,077
Regular payments will avoid problems.

323
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,186
I'll convince Mr. Chairman.

324
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,277
Make yourself at home and eat.

325
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,006
You haven't touched anything.

326
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,014
Brother, what about you?

327
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,641
Oh, you can't!

328
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:55,015
Mr. Murase says that he'll retire
and leave his turf to us.

329
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,157
We only need to pay a cut, right?

330
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,630
That'll be all then.

331
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,180
That old loser!

332
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,044
How dare he call a truce!

333
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,277
They'll take over and finish us.

334
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,118
Murase is finally retiring...

335
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,560
I guess he got old and soft.

336
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,459
Thanks for your work.

337
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,329
About Kimura?

338
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:18,101
He is turning civilian.
So leave him alone.

339
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,412
Otomo...

340
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,249
We should push Ikemoto to retire.

341
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,588
Then I'd be the boss
and you'd be the underboss.

342
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,406
That's Otomo's car.

343
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,333
Follow it.

344
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,697
There's a car behind us.

345
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,864
It's following us.

346
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,208
Get out!

347
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,020
Kimura.

348
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,305
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's nothing.

349
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,739
Thanks.

350
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,712
I'll call you if necessary.

351
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,283
Understood.

352
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,479
I made a deal with the police.
Otomo will be brought in.

353
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,809
Good.

354
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,679
How about...

355
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,247
the turf we took from Murase?

356
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,281
Once things settle down,

357
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,326
we'll kick Ikemoto out.

358
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,117
Then you take charge.

359
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,871
I hear Murase retired.

360
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:17,074
Why is Ikemoto expanding
on his turf instead of Kimura?

361
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,310
It makes no sense!

362
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,653
Didn't you kill Kimura as well?

363
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,982
Did you?

364
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,182
Sneaky old yakuza!

365
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,219
Your men do the dirty work
and you pretend to know nothing.

366
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,760
Don't fuck with me!

367
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,527
Mr. Kataoka!

368
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,665
Don't get carried away.

369
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,738
You won't get away with it!

370
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,601
Say something!

371
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,071
Hey, Kataoka!

372
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,633
Take a break.

373
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,737
Let's get some tea.

374
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,692
Sorry about that, Champ.

375
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,894
You act real tough around here.

376
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,301
You always were a lousy boxer.

377
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,601
But you're good at mooching off yakuza.

378
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,008
It must be nice being a cop.

379
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:45,495
Even rich housewives like her
come here for drugs.

380
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,128
A real moneymaker.

381
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,181
Take him away.

382
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,096
My name is Sayama.

383
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,698
This area is now Ikemoto Family turf.

384
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,109
You'll give us
what you paid Murase.

385
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,313
Did you hear him?

386
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,144
Yes.

387
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,320
I want your cell phone.

388
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,449
Cut me some slack.

389
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,584
Your impossible demands
will put me out of business.

390
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:30,829
I could provide
useful information in return.

391
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,767
He invites clients to his embassy
and lets them do drugs.

392
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,810
Cops can't do anything because
embassies are exempt from jurisdiction.

393
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,139
I see.

394
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,574
Then let him run a casino.
That's more profitable.

395
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,212
Casino?
I can 't run a casino.

396
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,445
You ' I l make more money.

397
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,746
This place is too small for a casino.

398
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,517
So move the embassy.

399
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,651
We'll find a new location.

400
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,974
Think carefully before you choose.

401
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,641
For your own good.

402
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,420
Is everybody here?

403
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,655
Yes.

404
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,231
Where are the guys?

405
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,458
Oh.

406
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,128
That's not an answer.

407
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,431
Ishihara,
how can you be always dense?

408
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,712
It's Jun.

409
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,450
Someone is asking for you.

410
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:00,856
No complaints.
He just wants to see you.

411
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,172
What are you waiting for?
Take control.

412
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,579
The Murase Family is over.

413
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,555
The Otomo Family now runs this turf.

414
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,759
Tell us how many girls
and how much you make.

415
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,364
No business without our permission.

416
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,665
Say yes!

417
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,030
Yes.

418
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,985
Where's your room?

419
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,083
Over there.

420
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,392
Too far, too far!

421
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,187
Just a little bit.

422
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,751
I'd like to shower first.

423
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,658
Yes, yes, yes.

424
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,384
Not so fast. Wait...

425
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,618
Here's a drink while you wait.

426
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,695
I won't be long.

427
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,478
We'll clean up the mess.
You go.

428
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,194
For Rent

429
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,627
What? Is this the new embassy?

430
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,534
It's much more spacious.

431
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,904
- It's storage space!
- Shut up and go inside.

432
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,447
So?

433
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,889
Not bad, huh?

434
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,359
It's completely exposed.

435
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,023
Not with the curtains drawn.

436
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,628
Brother...

437
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,598
Mr. Ikemoto is inside.

438
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,010
Good evening, sir.

439
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:39,487
You guys set up
a very prosperous business!

440
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,417
Money must be rolling in.

441
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,584
Give me some chips.

442
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,426
Can l?

443
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,632
Listen...

444
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,000
We need to discuss the casino.

445
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,542
Tell Otomo to call me.

446
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,668
Yes, sir.

447
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,701
Who the hell is he?

448
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,872
That dirty dealer has been cheating.

449
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,312
So I broke his arm.

450
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,947
Take him away.

451
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,644
Get up.

452
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,925
How's the casino?

453
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,326
Mr. Ikemoto goes too often.
He's mooching off us.

454
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,062
Can you do something about him?

455
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,510
It's from Mr. Ikemoto.

456
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,477
Thanks.

457
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,709
I heard you've gone
into the casino business.

458
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,313
I'd like to introduce someone to you.

459
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,019
Ishihara from the Otomo Family.
He runs the casino.

460
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,026
I see.

461
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,793
Kato, take good care of him.

462
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:45,943
I'd appreciate your
continued support to our family.

463
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,211
Ozawa...

464
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,219
Ozawa...

465
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,828
How long have you been working
as the underboss for Ikemoto?

466
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,364
About 20 years.

467
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,933
I see.

468
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,234
Sometime soon...

469
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,898
Have Ikemoto retire.

470
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,533
Then inherit the family.

471
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,702
I'd make a pact with you.

472
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,876
That dirty bastard...

473
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:23,149
Always hanging out
with drug-dealing mobsters.

474
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,983
He sets a bad example.

475
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,659
Keep this between us.

476
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:49,945
Is Otomo here yet?

477
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,243
He'll be here soon.

478
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,045
I don't want you to park here.

479
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,675
Move it when he arrives.

480
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:57,912
Yes, sir.

481
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,226
He comes here everyday.

482
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,459
He's here now.

483
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,141
He makes the other players uncomfortable.

484
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,554
Got a minute, boss?

485
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,684
Sure.

486
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,828
Boss, you're coming around too often.

487
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:42,920
What?

488
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,158
You're bothering the customers.

489
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,203
Are you lecturing me?

490
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,506
Our profits are shrinking.

491
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,738
That's what we yakuza do!

492
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,127
We're coming in.

493
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,030
Today's revenue, for your approval.

494
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,579
I want to quit this business.

495
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:34,511
The risk is too big...
and the pay is small!

496
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,645
You get 30% off the profits.

497
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,654
Isn't that enough?

498
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,657
What's the budget
of your entire country?

499
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,706
What are you babbling in English?

500
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,937
Speak Japanese!

501
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,759
Snake! Snake!

502
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,400
What? I don't understand.

503
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,954
Brother...

504
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,254
How much does the ambassador really get?

505
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,734
None of your business, asshole.

506
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,810
I hear that profits are dropping.

507
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,737
Iranian dealers have been moving out.

508
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,443
Income has decreased.

509
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,382
But you're the drug supplier!

510
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,984
Another yakuza has started
supplying drugs to them.

511
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,891
I've been making payments
exactly as you instructed.

512
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,223
Right, Mr. Ishihara?

513
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,599
What's your problem?

514
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,505
When we say more, we mean more!

515
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,408
Cut your bullshit!

516
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,829
That's the place.

517
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,917
That's the bitch we saw the other day.

518
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,732
Good afternoon. What can I get you?

519
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,504
Get us the owner.

520
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,334
- What can I get you?
- We don't need anything.

521
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,239
Get us the goddamn owner!

522
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,169
One moment please.

523
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,847
Sir.

524
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,177
What?

525
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:08,978
There's someone...

526
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,211
What do I owe?

527
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,048
700 yen.

528
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,917
Thank you very much.

529
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,325
Welcome.

530
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:29,668
What can I get you?

531
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:31,305
Veggie noodles.

532
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,806
One Veggie noodles!

533
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:51,187
Where the fuck is your boss?

534
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,058
He's busy at the moment.

535
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,324
What did you say?

536
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,304
You're pushing narco here.

537
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,636
What the hell?

538
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,145
You're pushing narco here.

539
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,313
Narco? What is narco?

540
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,648
- Drugs.
- What?

541
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,187
- Speed.
- What?

542
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,256
Speed.

543
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

544
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,451
Are your ears clogged?

545
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,233
Where do you get the stuff?

546
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,596
Who's your boss?

547
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,697
Tell me!

548
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,673
Give me your hand.

549
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,816
It's Murase! Murase!

550
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,448
That old bastard.

551
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,216
He hasn't retired after all.

552
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,693
Bring it to him!

553
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,600
Your order, sir.

554
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,879
Let's finish off Murase.

555
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,512
He's totally useless.

556
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,851
He might jeopardize my career.

557
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,594
You can't use my men anymore.

558
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,429
Then you do it.

559
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,564
I'm your sworn father.

560
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,910
This office is a wreck.

561
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,147
Get a new one!

562
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,627
Got a light?

563
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,131
Who the fuck are you?

564
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,697
I said I need a light.

565
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,375
Which family are you from?

566
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,270
None of your business.

567
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,972
Asshole!

568
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:27,910
Get out!

569
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:15,586
Show me the damn evidence!

570
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,251
Several witnesses saw your men.

571
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,021
So arrest them!

572
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,619
You gave the orders.

573
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,561
I don't know anything.

574
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,293
You two-bit yakuza!

575
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,165
Mind your business, asshole!

576
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,705
What are you doing?

577
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,842
You can't smoke here.

578
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,848
Pick it up.

579
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,389
Pick it up.

580
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,350
I said pick it up!

581
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,604
They released Otomo
on lack of evidence.

582
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:42,370
Then we have to get Ikemoto
to banish Otomo.

583
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,609
What about Ikemoto?

584
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,473
Didn't you hear me?

585
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,149
Forget about Ikemoto.

586
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,319
Murase's men or Otomo...

587
01:09:54,423 --> 01:10:00,623
They'll try to settle their grudge
against him no matter what.

588
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,127
Banished?

589
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,801
Why am I being banished?

590
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,068
It's Mr. Chairman.

591
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,269
He won't tolerate someone killing
his father's brother.

592
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,243
You told me to do it!

593
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,215
I know. This is just formality.

594
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:25,481
When things calm down,
I'll ask him to pardon you.

595
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,386
So you know...

596
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:34,490
Ozawa will take over your turf.

597
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,495
Get out.

598
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,498
Son of a bitch!

599
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,366
I risked my life for you!
Now you take my turf?

600
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:47,169
I know you're upset
but it's the head family's decision.

601
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,766
I don't give a shit!

602
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,606
Fuck you!

603
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,246
I'm going to see Mr. Chairman.

604
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,656
Give me a knife and some string.

605
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,321
Boss...

606
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,756
Nothing else to do but chop it.

607
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,158
I've been banished.

608
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,940
That should be enough.

609
01:11:55,678 --> 01:12:00,911
What makes you think you can
go over Ikemoto to see Mr. Chairman?

610
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,506
Don't you know anything?

611
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,108
Sorry.

612
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,088
Small-time punks don't sit there.

613
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:24,263
Your old-fashioned
finger chopping is worthless.

614
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,736
Kato...

615
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,645
Excuse us for a moment.

616
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,617
Your banishment...

617
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,725
was not my idea.

618
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,090
Ikemoto made
the decision on his own.

619
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,366
How could I ever do such a thing?

620
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:02,374
Ikemoto's time will be over soon.

621
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:06,972
It will be your turn
to heighten the family's prosperity.

622
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:11,849
When things settle down,
I'll make a pact.

623
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:17,119
Whether Ikemoto lives or dies,

624
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,421
is no concern of mine.

625
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:25,830
What was his name? Ozawa?

626
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:29,631
You can let him live
and make him your flunky.

627
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,382
You could use a little money. Take it.

628
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,359
I expect a return double-fold.

629
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,845
Give me more.

630
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,849
I'm not winning much.

631
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,615
Aren't you cheating?

632
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:23,555
Give me some goddamn chips.

633
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,220
You mother-fucker!

634
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,356
Take him away!

635
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,733
Mr. Ozawa...

636
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,241
If you could let it pass,

637
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,834
I promise I'll make it up to you.

638
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,685
How can you come here
after banishing me?

639
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,418
I'll fucking kill you!

640
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,153
Hold on.

641
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,255
Ozawa!

642
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,124
He's gone, you shithole.

643
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,560
Listen, guys...

644
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,466
I'll take it back.

645
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:13,666
What?

646
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,640
I'll reverse the banishment.

647
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,237
You banish me, then reverse it?

648
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,508
How many tongues do you have?

649
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:21,814
What?

650
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,181
How many tongues?

651
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,386
One, of course.

652
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,012
One tongue?

653
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,318
More like two or three.

654
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,893
I have only one tongue!

655
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,160
Open your mouth.

656
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,565
Stick out your tongue.

657
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,199
What?

658
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,530
Stick it out!

659
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,798
More!

660
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,239
More, you fucker!

661
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,613
Give me the gun.

662
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:18,971
Why should I help dump the body?
I'll get in trouble.

663
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,905
Shut up and stay put, idiot.

664
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:25,605
But I'll be an accomplice to murder.

665
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,941
Your second.

666
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,115
Him and that girl.

667
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,617
What? She's alive.

668
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,381
I saw her.

669
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,413
I agreed to help run a casino...

670
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,084
Not to help you with murder.

671
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,993
With your involvements
in gambling, drug dealing,

672
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,157
and murder, all hell will break loose.

673
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,063
I will be deported.

674
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,569
I won't be able to stay in Japan.

675
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,138
You idiot.

676
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,207
You'll get the death penalty.

677
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,673
Death penalty?

678
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,425
Where are you going?

679
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,640
You can't speak Japanese?

680
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,049
An embassy vehicle.

681
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,785
Open the trunk please.

682
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,158
Are we done yet?

683
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:52,392
We're in a hurry.

684
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:53,598
Okay, done.

685
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,033
You can go now.

686
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,265
They won't find the body here.

687
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,803
Take care of the rest.

688
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,395
What are you saying?

689
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,599
I can't go back home if I'm caught.

690
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,076
Shut the fuck up!

691
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:40,146
Here's your shovel.

692
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,771
Ikemoto is dead.

693
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:49,249
So you'll be inheriting control
of the family?

694
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,249
Yes.

695
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,012
If that pleases you, Mr. Chairman.

696
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,679
But you wouldn't want...

697
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,582
to inherit without doing
something to earn it.

698
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,520
Dispose of Otomo first,

699
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,324
then avenge your boss's death
before taking over.

700
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,328
Yes, sir.

701
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,302
I should go.

702
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,273
As I told you...

703
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,476
Otomo took care of Ikemoto.

704
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,415
Seeing ahead is necessary to...

705
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:26,586
be at the top!

706
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,549
Understood?

707
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:33,352
Next, help Ozawa...

708
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,119
to get rid of Otomo.

709
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,088
Yes.

710
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,178
Driver's here.

711
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,479
I'll take a look outside.

712
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,038
What?

713
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,541
Excuse me, there's no parking here.

714
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,545
May I see your driver's license?

715
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:31,944
Here.

716
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,188
And your registration.

717
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,717
Registration?

718
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,562
Registration...

719
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:01,376
Think Ozawa did it?

720
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,818
Probably because I killed Ikemoto.

721
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,886
Didn't you talk with Mr. Chairman?

722
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,323
Mizuno.

723
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,654
You have to lie low.

724
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,224
One of us must survive,

725
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,769
to see who will win.

726
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,946
I'm going now,
back home for a visit.

727
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,746
Call me when you can.

728
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,388
Don't jinx me.

729
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,752
You're dressed for a funeral.

730
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,359
Don't say that.

731
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,195
Have you talked to Mr. Chairman?

732
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,561
I can't reach him.

733
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,830
Ozawa inherited the Ikemoto Family.

734
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:01,375
Mr. Chairman told me I would take over.

735
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:07,214
He tricked you into killing Ikemoto.

736
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,983
It's naive to take him for his word.

737
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:12,409
He probably told Ozawa the same.

738
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,156
That son of a bitch!

739
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,919
I'm going out.

740
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,450
Come on.

741
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:33,174
Where's Mizuno?

742
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,973
He ran away already?

743
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:42,842
Champ...

744
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,611
surrender before you get killed.

745
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,857
Surrender?

746
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,793
Who do you think I am, asshole?

747
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,196
A yakuza on the downfall.

748
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:57,730
What did you say?

749
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,196
What's your problem?

750
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,765
I'll arrest you all!

751
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,227
Two of them are heading for
the head compound.

752
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,099
Otomo is inside.

753
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:47,638
Throw this in the building.

754
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,645
- Know how to use it?
- Yes.

755
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,439
Who the fuck are you?

756
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,144
Call the office.

757
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,274
No answer.

758
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,409
It's over.

759
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,550
Got a gun?

760
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:31,807
No.

761
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,083
Here.

762
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,158
Run.

763
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,185
Run!

764
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,656
Hurry!

765
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,590
Bodyguards are everywhere.

766
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,220
What if Mr. Chairman isn't here?

767
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,588
We'll die for nothing.

768
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,630
You're right.

769
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:22,260
Die for nothing.

770
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:53,357
Freeze!

771
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:55,496
Hands behind your back!

772
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,564
Who the fuck are you?

773
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,140
Let's go for a ride.

774
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:13,547
Why drag me out so far?

775
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:15,417
Just do it already.

776
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:16,387
Shut up.

777
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,651
I told you it's just a ride.

778
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,053
What are you going to do?

779
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:54,354
I said, shut the fuck up.

780
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,130
Stop moving!

781
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,030
Ishihara says hello.

782
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,035
What did you say?

783
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,132
Okay.

784
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,668
Behind the gym?

785
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:07,674
You didn't sell me out to Mr. Chairman.

786
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:09,874
Why would I do that, Champ?

787
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,449
How is everybody?

788
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,020
Everybody's dead.

789
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:17,053
Mizuno too?

790
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:20,290
In the worst way.

791
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,792
Almost decapitated.

792
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:25,926
Champ.

793
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:28,201
It's about time to surrender.

794
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:30,630
Asshole!

795
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,797
How could I live with myself?

796
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:38,135
The days are gone for old-time yakuzas.

797
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,404
Living long is the best revenge.

798
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:44,076
How old do you think I am?

799
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:47,015
Going to jail would be the end of me.

800
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:49,419
Champ...

801
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,017
It's better to lose technically
than to be knocked out, right?

802
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,765
Losing is losing, asshole.

803
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:10,872
I'll find a way
to shorten your jail time.

804
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:35,362
You didn't think I'd come alone?

805
01:39:36,904 --> 01:39:40,499
Career is more important
than money these days.

806
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:07,325
More food!

807
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,495
But this bottle is all mine!

808
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:15,072
Here's more meat.

809
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:20,442
So it's all settled?

810
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:22,174
Good job.

811
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:26,743
I'll make a pact with you soon.

812
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:29,880
You'll get the Ikemoto Family.

813
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:31,956
Thank you, sir.

814
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:33,815
Kato.

815
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:38,996
Take him down to the beach
to celebrate.

816
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,097
Let's go this way.

817
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,204
Ozawa.

818
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:13,325
What was that?

819
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:14,401
Don't know.

820
01:42:17,564 --> 01:42:18,588
Mr. Chairman!

821
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:29,742
That son of a bitch shot him!

822
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:31,601
Mr. Chairman!

823
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:31,098
Brother.

824
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:32,396
I've been waiting for you.

825
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,708
Kimura!

826
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:04,960
Mr. Chairman.

827
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:08,474
Otomo was killed in prison.

828
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:10,473
Killed?

829
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,677
Who did it?

830
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:15,577
Kimura from the Murase Family.

831
01:44:18,352 --> 01:44:20,115
Did you plot all that?

832
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:22,647
How could l?

833
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:26,257
Look who's here!

834
01:44:26,793 --> 01:44:29,956
Mr. Ishihara, the treasure keeper
of the Sanno-kai Clan!

835
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:31,425
Not really.

836
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:35,091
From drug dealing to illegal gambling,

837
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:37,536
and finally the stock market.

838
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:41,134
All unimaginable
with the former chairman.

839
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:45,744
By the way,
I was promoted the other day.

840
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:48,277
He will take over my position.

841
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:52,912
Moving up. Good for you.

842
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,778
- Your support is always appreciated.
- Very much so.

843
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:08,459
Mr. Chairman...

844
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:10,166
Where's my envelope?

845
01:45:10,704 --> 01:45:12,194
Asshole.

846
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:12,535
