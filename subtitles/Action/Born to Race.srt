2
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:57,163
Turbokit a GT35,
XMotor an intercooler ...

3
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:00,583
XCS and an exhaust system.
- Nice.

4
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:10,008
Look, it's the ESX car.

5
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,515
He does everything legally,
sponsors and all the trimmings.

6
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,018
What's next, Krueger?

7
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:22,311
I want the first gemporteerde
race driver in Topfuel.

8
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,149
I can now better your autograph and
EBay to sell when you become famous.

9
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,320
Come on, you know you're not
here should be that.

10
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,613
Quiet, Mikey. I'm here
but a visit.

11
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:37,409
If ESX find out that you just
are visiting, you can leave.

12
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,162
Look who show up here.
Will you show respect for your king?

13
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,291
Tony, if I beat you again, you
a complaint against abuse.

14
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,087
Nobody beats my new material
more. You're not a big man anymore.

15
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,797
Do not listen to him, you know
he is challenging you.

16
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:55,217
I will come back with my slow
car, is it fair.

17
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:00,054
You know what?
It does not matter what you drive.

18
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:03,099
Come forward or shut up.

19
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,269
Not tonight.
- Yes, forget it.

20
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,606
What now?
Come show off what you just now?

21
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:15,694
Go ahead. Stand there like a sissy
and show it next to show car.

22
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:23,367
Say what you want, Krueger. But if
I went to the ring, I get to boxing.

23
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:29,039
Okay, come on over.

24
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,750
Let's go.

25
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:38,465
Walk away from it.
- I let this kid not to embarrass myself.

26
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,842
Who cares what they think?
They just want to see a race.

27
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:49,808
Attention all units, we have called
of an illegal street race in downtown.

28
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,747
I just heard on the scanner, they come.
- Start the race.

29
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,290
I do not, this is stupid.

30
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,792
Just do it.
It's over within 10 seconds.

31
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,556
Are you okay?
- Yes.

32
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,558
Well, put your hands up.
You're under arrest.

33
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:34,362
I left you only race for them because I
thought you would stay out of trouble.

34
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,741
You finally do something productive.
I've had enough.

35
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,665
My goodness.
How bad is it this time?

36
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:06,475
I do not think we should do.

37
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:21,280
Mr. Ashtar.

38
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,951
I'm so sorry, I can explain ...
- What part do you explain?

39
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,497
The part where you have a car of $ 100,000
bring to an illegal street race?

40
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,791
Or how you managed to get
against a police car to crash?

41
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,752
You are lucky that no one
injured. - I know, I made a mistake ...

42
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:39,422
What you did was stupid.
This is a disaster.

43
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,424
You're done, Krueger.

44
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,301
I will repay ...
- You're done.

45
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:46,345
Come on, Danny. We go.
Sorry, Mr.. Ashtar.

46
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:08,198
I had to listen to you.
- You're like a bull ...

47
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,325
if you see red, go for it.

48
00:08:10,993 --> 00:08:12,577
No matter what anyone says.

49
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:14,746
Yes.

50
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,208
Keep your head up,
it'll be fine.

51
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,218
What?

52
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,975
We're trying to help
really, it just ...

53
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,354
We will send you to your father to live there.
- What?

54
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,856
You need a clean slate
this all behind you.

55
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,858
When did you talk to him?
- This morning.

56
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,069
He set up for this, right?

57
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,613
No, Joe has nothing to do.

58
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:54,116
Every time there is a problem,
it is worse than the last.

59
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,035
Fines speed, street racing
and now an accident.

60
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:59,621
I would not even think about it
what next is going to be.

61
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:02,999
So you will send me to a guy
I have not seen in five years?

62
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:06,001
He is a drunkard.
- No, Danny, he's not drunk.

63
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,586
Yes, no more.

64
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,257
I did everything I could think of
and I do not know what else to do.

65
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:17,804
I'm not.
My whole life is here.

66
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:20,264
There is no ...
- No, you have no choice.

67
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,683
You go. End of story.

68
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:28,369
Hi, Lisa.
- Hello, Frank.

69
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:34,332
You look good.
- You too.

70
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,183
Hello, boy.
- Hello, Frank.

71
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,692
Do you want to load or not?

72
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:05,082
Nice car you got there. And in 2003?
- 2004.

73
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:10,254
Converted itself?
- Me and my friend Mikey.

74
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:12,756
Beautiful, it looks expensive.

75
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,800
What a guy, who stepfather of yours.

76
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,343
I bought it myself.

77
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,055
We can chitchat
keep to a minimum?

78
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:31,106
That's your plan, ignoring me.
- Until I'm 18, yes.

79
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,740
Why wait, tough guy?
Come on.

80
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,535
Get out.
Go hiking.

81
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,414
You can catch me so much
if you want, but ...

82
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,499
does not change that we
bragged to each other down.

83
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,668
Do you understand?

84
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:01,092
I'm not a popularity contest
win or your best friend ...

85
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:06,555
or lost time. I am here because
your mother no more.

86
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,099
Do you understand?
Got it?

87
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:20,777
Done with it.
- Yes? What about me?

88
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,696
What about you?

89
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,279
So this is home.

90
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:30,215
Do you have that thing?
- Yes.

91
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:33,176
I bet it's bad driving.

92
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:48,482
Well, my humble stulpje.

93
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:54,446
So, now that you live with me ...

94
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:58,867
there are a few rules to follow.
There is no girl, well after yourself.

95
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:02,995
You make your own food, you do your
own dishes, you can do your laundry there.

96
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:06,040
Your room.

97
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,548
Any questions?

98
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:18,134
We can now unload my car? - Why
in such a hurry? You should not be driving.

99
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,928
My license has limitations,
I may ride to school and work.

100
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,016
And nowhere else, right?
Ok.

101
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,768
Pack your stuff out.

102
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,420
I take it this is about.

103
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:04,093
What does it need?
- I work on a turbo upgrade, nothing special.

104
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,014
So you think you know anything about engines?
- Probably better than you.

105
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,979
Fantastic, I always wanted half
mechanic, but I could never pay.

106
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:20,817
You go to your expertise
show every day after school.

107
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,735
No free rides.

108
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,313
Okay, look after the fuel cards.

109
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,358
If the air-fuel ratio somewhere
comes close to 11.5 / 1, we work it out.

110
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,986
That is not cool, we would
The rich have to test.

111
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,154
Dude, I want a 12.5 / 1.

112
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,616
Ok, if the pistons will give,
is it for you. - Whatever.

113
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:23,332
Also check the DGT.
- Yes, master.

114
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,835
You'll see, baby.

115
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,215
H Max, how does the schrootbak?

116
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:33,925
Pretty good, we have
worked there all summer.

117
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,886
Want to see whether all the hard work yields something?

118
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:43,392
Yes.
- It's much faster with the turbo.

119
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:45,478
We leave him a poopy smell.

120
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,440
We can not do this, please.

121
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:52,359
Jake, do not.

122
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,701
Jake, stop.

123
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:05,329
Ok, we got it.

124
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,010
Keep it up.
- Jake.

125
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:27,641
You're such an idiot.

126
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:36,775
Come on.

127
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:43,990
Shake and bake, baby.

128
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,836
What's wrong with you?
They could get hurt.

129
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,380
All is well with them.

130
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,144
Come on.
Are you still mad?

131
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:02,950
Quite a price, h?
- Yes.

132
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,286
The best school there is.

133
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:08,372
All race teams look for their new pilots there.

134
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,707
You need a fast car
have to win it.

135
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:13,460
I have covered.
- That sounds familiar.

136
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:16,796
Are you here?
- No.

137
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,928
Another thing to hope for.
- It's cruel that they hang the posters there.

138
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:28,265
Let them think they have a chance.
- Max H, exciting race this morning.

139
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:50,160
I am Mr. Briggs, I'm going
now say this ...

140
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:54,039
No lesson is that you do not
just to succeed.

141
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,501
I give a serious lesson.
Jake.

142
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,587
I'm talking to you.
- Against me?

143
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,799
Yeah, you.
It does not matter who I think you are ...

144
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,761
but in my teaching, you
carefully and do it.

145
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,013
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

146
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,683
Ok.
Now you are in a good mood, you Jake ...

147
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:18,603
Why do you tell the class is not
what a variable magnetic field?

148
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:21,564
What did you say?

149
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:27,403
You.
Explain.

150
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,115
Well, it varies
time of the intake ...

151
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:35,327
using energy-coupling
the camshaft to rotate.

152
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:39,372
I am not aware
of the import tuning magazine.

153
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:43,668
Actually, the variable CTH
Timing is used ...

154
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:46,045
in domestic vehicles,
like the new Mustang.

155
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,213
Drive a car you not?

156
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,010
Not bad.
What is your name?

157
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:55,887
Danny.

158
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,390
Do you have a last name, Danny?
- Krueger.

159
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:04,311
Are you Frank's son?
He said you were coming.

160
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,605
He also said that you have a bad
attendance file.

161
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:08,649
I'm still no problems
have with you ...

162
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,234
Danny?
- No.

163
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,277
Well.

164
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:19,534
Frank Krueger's your father? Another reason
not to step on the racetrack to set.

165
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:32,838
How do I register for the race?

166
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,839
Already 18?

167
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:43,180
Let your dad drawing and bring it back to me.
At the latest within two weeks.

168
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,433
Danny ...

169
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:53,899
Ignore them.
Your father was a great race driver.

170
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,746
Ok, for all the new faces,
I want to welcome you into the drama class.

171
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,498
I am Ms.. Parker.

172
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:16,336
I would like to start each new class
an exercise which I call "first impression" call.

173
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:18,796
So, how many of you want first?

174
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,677
Ok. You, in the back.

175
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,972
What is your name?
- Danny.

176
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:36,604
Danny, come stand over here. Who wants
their first impression of Danny?

177
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:41,484
Jessica.
You seem a lot to say today.

178
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,570
Why not say what you see?

179
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:51,576
He's definitely a transition student.
- Okay, interesting. Go on.

180
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:55,997
Probably only in the drama lesson
because that was all that was still free.

181
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:00,126
Why do you say?
- He does not seem like Shakespeare-type.

182
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,213
Do not you, Ms. Popularity,
with your $ 400 jeans.

183
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,506
Name one character from n
of his plays?

184
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,425
I can not even mention two,
Romeo and Juliet.

185
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:13,430
Please, everyone knows that.
- You said "any character". Your turn.

186
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,226
This is difficult, there are so many good.

187
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,480
Like Macbeth, Shila, Mr.. Mona,
Affello and Hamlet.

188
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:28,610
Your turn.
- Are they all characters?

189
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,321
You did well.

190
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,578
Pock.
- Excuse me?

191
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,330
Pock, A Midsummer Night's Dream?

192
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,291
The mischief maker, the night elf.

193
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,378
Someone googled Shakespeare after class.

194
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:52,299
How did you know I stuck
Sat with drama class?

195
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,259
It happened to me
when I was transferred.

196
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,844
You were also transferred?

197
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,179
When was that?
- Last year, from Tampa.

198
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:00,390
And you?
- Insino.

199
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:02,725
A valley-boy, h?
- Yes.

200
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,311
So a huge culture shock Bradford?

201
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,399
It sucks here.

202
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,236
Things are getting better.

203
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:15,987
I hope so.

204
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:21,576
I like a "back to school
party "tonight. You should come.

205
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:24,495
I do not know.

206
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,498
Not a social type?

207
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:33,086
Here's the address.
In case you could get bored.

208
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:56,316
You're late. I have 3 cars that have a turn
needed 15 minutes ago.

209
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,623
Faster, you must still
two do next.

210
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:15,625
I'm not used to
working with antiques.

211
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:21,047
Antiques.
Do you know the world is?

212
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:23,883
What I know are programmable
engine management systems ...

213
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,093
no carbs and mechanical inflammation.

214
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,721
Try the fuel valve once,
that will help.

215
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:49,823
Where do you keep this stupid thing?
- I do not know, I've never needed.

216
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,123
Write it down.

217
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:15,680
I'm just in the restaurant,
do you want to go?

218
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,223
I already ate.

219
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,562
Or not.

220
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,175
H, Danny.

221
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,226
Now I know where I know you.
- Put that away, that's history.

222
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:08,145
History is our favorite subject.

223
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:13,024
I'm Max, this is Harry.
What does a superstar like you in Bradford?

224
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,778
Do you know the girl who gives this party?

225
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:18,321
Yeah, sure.
- A little.

226
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,161
Do you mind if we go with you?
- No.

227
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:33,835
There's the pool.
I had to bring a swimsuit.

228
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,629
Let's go get some beer.
Would you also one?

229
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:38,923
No, thank you.

230
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:52,436
Nice turnout, Jessica.
Where's Jake?

231
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:56,356
Come on, Rachel. We have been the worst
dates had, I've had enough.

232
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:58,441
Yes, but look what he has
done for you ...

233
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,610
social life. This feast
belongs to the top.

234
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:05,239
My God, that's the boy
the drama class. Danny Krueger.

235
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:09,243
And?
- Have you invited him?

236
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:12,662
I thought it would be a good opportunity
for him to get to know new people.

237
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,833
Well, he has been a good start
continue to raise the nerds.

238
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,128
Have you invited them?
- They do no harm?

239
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,392
Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:37,060
I did not think you were coming.

241
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,937
As the hostess me
VIP invitation gave ...

242
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,481
I thought, I turn over the work
and go there. - And she appreciates that.

243
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:44,942
That's good, because my boss is hard.

244
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:09,173
It is good to have you here instead
always in that garage of yours.

245
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,717
It's my turn.
- Frank Krueger, is that you?

246
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:16,096
I did not recognize you because you are right.
You know that they serve no whiskey.

247
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:19,432
I have been sober since October, Jimmy.

248
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:29,775
A new car in your collection?
- What are you talking about?

249
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:31,902
I've always had this.

250
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:41,077
Now I recognize it, I just
but still ...

251
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:43,371
seen in educating
my rearview mirror.

252
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,834
You're a funny man.

253
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:58,468
Jake, you okay?
How are you?

254
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:01,304
Can your parents every time
come in and shut down this party?

255
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,597
Are you kidding? I had never
such a celebration ...

256
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,683
My stepfather had to
began to fraternize.

257
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,851
Mine could not wait
to get rid of me.

258
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:11,188
Have you seen Jessica somewhere?
- That guy is good at Krueger.

259
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:14,316
Is that how you ended up in Bradford?
- Approximately, yes.

260
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:17,026
My father lives here.
I do not know why.

261
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:22,949
Come on, it's not so bad?
- It gets better.

262
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:29,997
Jake.
- What are you doing with this idiot?

263
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:32,874
We talk.
- If you leave it at that.

264
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:36,044
Do not pretend you're my boyfriend, Jake
Because you're not.

265
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:39,839
I know we had a little fight
But we must get to know each other.

266
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,552
Really? How? The only thing you're talking about,
about yourself and your car.

267
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,554
What's wrong with that?

268
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:53,560
Bitches. They never know what they want.
- Okay, there's no reason to do common.

269
00:32:54,186 --> 00:32:58,690
Will you do something about it?
- Easy, right? Nobody wants trouble.

270
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,233
Too late.

271
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:07,656
Are you tired of your life?
Want more?

272
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,335
Is that all you got?

273
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:24,088
Come on.

274
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,485
Danny, stop.
- He is like a superhero.

275
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,550
Jake, do not.

276
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:46,163
Damn.
- He is going down.

277
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:47,706
Come on.

278
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:54,963
Come on.

279
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:43,841
That is,
We have a straight, guys.

280
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,725
Why do we get him in?
- Because you two idiots sitting in the car.

281
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,062
No police.

282
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:03,901
I'm impressed. You begin at last
your temper under control.

283
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:07,821
It is not easy with that
uittest child every day.

284
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:11,700
He is as bad as I was.
- You were worse, and you know it.

285
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:17,622
He looks like a good boy,
give him some time.

286
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:20,458
I only hope that I
can keep out of trouble.

287
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:30,592
You do good work so far.

288
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,321
Out of my way.

289
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:58,743
Come on Krueger,
We only want to talk.

290
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:05,666
Go.

291
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:28,812
Come on.
We got him.

292
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,233
Here we go.

293
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,740
Come on, Krueger.
- Come on.

294
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,786
We got him, boys.

295
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:00,383
He is going down.

296
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:45,966
You better leave, you'll be late ...
- My car has problems, give you a ride?

297
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:48,844
Driving too fast?

298
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:54,891
I find my own ride back.

299
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:11,740
H guy, is it true that you
Jake's Mustang have preserved?

300
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,618
What do you have under your hood?

301
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:37,430
Krueger, you'd better sit down.

302
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:47,606
Ok, we start with a test
on air-fuel ratios.

303
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:56,740
Dude, you were faster than Jake.
- That's what everyone at the restaurant said.

304
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,866
He had two people in his car,
So I had ...

305
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,660
advantage. I did it
reasonably well, why?

306
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,913
He is the fastest in the province. Nobody
can beat him in the street races.

307
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:07,583
His father is the owner of Kendall Performances
He's got a lot to store his disposal.

308
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,918
Yes? - Jake's car is
this school on the map.

309
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,796
Our football team is rotslecht.
- You will participate in the race, right?

310
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:15,090
Yes, but I must first have
some work on my car.

311
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,927
You do not know what you have started.

312
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:22,597
Stop it.
There is no fighting in my classroom.

313
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:25,224
Not if you want
participate in the race.

314
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,768
And if you have a problem with each other,
Will you arrange it on the racetrack.

315
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,853
And stop racing on the street.

316
00:40:31,063 --> 00:40:33,482
See you after school.

317
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,782
See you after school?
- Yeah, okay.

318
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:49,496
Danny.

319
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,421
Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:02,091
How's the lip?
- Good.

321
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,764
So, how does it feel to be the most
discussed guy at school?

322
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:11,767
I liked it better when
No one knew my name.

323
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:14,895
Thanks.

324
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:18,606
Well, I liked the way
He did not speak to you ok.

325
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:21,192
It was very chivalrous.

326
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:24,403
That's something good, right?
- Yes.

327
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:28,866
Go out with me.

328
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,542
I shall think about it.
- But my car is broken, so you should drive.

329
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,920
The car everyone is talking about?
- Yes, but do not go.

330
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:52,846
It's the end of the month.
- You keep kidding, right?

331
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:57,725
First prize is a full scholarship to
The NHA racing school, that's what everyone ...

332
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,853
Yes, I think you temporarily
The racing should stay away.

333
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:04,106
I knew you would do about this stupid.
- Watch your language.

334
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:08,527
Especially if you ask for favors.
- I have not asked for 7 years.

335
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,614
All I want is your signature.
- Do you want my autograph?

336
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:15,033
Then I best not again
caught in a street race.

337
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:20,496
I have not done that.
- Who do you think you have it?

338
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:06,664
You keep kidding.
- You are not the only one with a fast car.

339
00:43:13,712 --> 00:43:17,799
And a gear too.
- What is the use of a Porsche with automatic transmission?

340
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:21,052
You make me very hard
about you now not to like.

341
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:22,929
Seat belt.

342
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:27,308
Where are we?
- To Chuck E 'Cheese.

343
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:30,060
Chuck E 'Cheese, which is fun.
- Have you ever been?

344
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,603
No.

345
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,902
Who taught you driving?
You're right.

346
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:43,698
Not like most girls?
- You said, I do not.

347
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:46,283
That is the car where
I learned to drive.

348
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:50,787
Mine was an old Honda Civic.
- He's my father.

349
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:54,249
The day he came home with it,
he was a small child.

350
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:58,711
He saved it for years to purchase,
My mother was so angry.

351
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,548
She calls it his convertible with my princess.

352
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:08,721
I remember the feeling of
doctrine when it was new, and that smell.

353
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:12,307
He always said that the Porsche
learn a unique smell.

354
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:18,146
And I do not want to leave. So I'm driving
it only on special occasions.

355
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,065
Or if I have a lot to think.

356
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:28,781
How long is he gone?
- Three years.

357
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:36,830
I'm sorry.
- For what?

358
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,836
I heard a rumor that you
father once drove for NASCAR.

359
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:47,131
150km per hour until he against a wall
and drove his foot crushed.

360
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,217
Ouch.
- Yes.

361
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:54,429
He was never the same afterwards.
It was like living with a ghost.

362
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:58,850
You knew he was there, but did
just as he wants for it.

363
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,854
But you still closer to him now, right?
- From a geographic standpoint it.

364
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:09,443
But, I do not know. It's weird.
- What is it weird?

365
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:11,486
Trying to communicate.

366
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:19,869
There is too much to say.
- That's not bad, trust me.

367
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:26,542
Want a ride to make?
- Yes.

368
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,250
Good night.
- Good night.

369
00:46:31,393 --> 00:46:36,564
What is it?
- Can you look at my car?

370
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:42,028
Maybe this weekend, I must first
the head gasket replaced urgently.

371
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:48,325
Forget it, I go at it myself.

372
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,792
What is the problem?

373
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:03,547
He gets fuel, ignition, pipes
are good, there's nothing broken.

374
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:08,761
I do not understand. Normally I would Mickey's
Laptop at release, but that's not now.

375
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:18,519
Try it now.

376
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:23,274
Start him now but.

377
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,241
You forgot the crankshaft sensor
turn, so he was not.

378
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:36,161
And those links are
definitely loose vibrated.

379
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:40,331
I have not even thought of as
control.

380
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:43,376
It's a 2.5, right?
- Yes.

381
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:49,339
If you link to that little injectors
your turbo, then he is even harder.

382
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:53,802
He was certainly in the last red.
- I think he can be even harder.

383
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:59,140
Anyway, now that it works,
you need to get parts for me.

384
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,349
Where to?

385
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:08,690
Candles.
- Buy items in the rival?

386
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,445
Competitors? I am lucky
that the case was still running.

387
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:17,490
You're welcome.

388
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:20,952
Thanks.

389
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,753
If your gas pedal,
make sure that nobody sees.

390
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:44,362
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

391
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,741
It is built with 1 / 16 racing gas
and lost 3% of it each time.

392
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:50,325
This baby is ready.

393
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:53,662
I hope so.
I race against the college boy tonight.

394
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:57,916
You beat them well.
Better be, or you get a name.

395
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:10,052
H, you. It is still
by at 7:30, right?

396
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:16,141
Actually, I do not make it.
I have to work overtime.

397
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,065
I'm sorry, Jess.
Can we do it tomorrow?

398
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:28,944
Yes.
- Thank you, you're wonderful.

399
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:32,572
Talk to you later, okay?
- Bye.

400
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,431
Harder, old man.

401
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:10,899
Are you crazy? When Jake and his boys
You see, they destroy you.

402
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:12,901
Quiet, I'm just some reconnaissance.

403
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,945
Ok.

404
00:51:51,186 --> 00:51:53,188
Come on, Jake.

405
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,942
You will be defeated, college boy.

406
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,468
It seems that his college boy
handbrake had forgotten to turn off.

407
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,303
Too bad.

408
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:38,313
Hi, Rachel.

409
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:41,607
I thought you and the newcomer
going out tonight?

410
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,984
Yes, but he canceled
because he had to work late.

411
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:47,446
No, he's in street racing.
I'm looking at him.

412
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:51,825
He finished in the top 4, so
probably about 120 miles / h.

413
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:57,205
If he can beat him on the
racetrack, he must sit around ten.

414
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:00,291
Okay, I'll see you later.

415
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,460
What have we here?

416
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:05,546
Do not be shy, Krueger.
Come say days.

417
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:13,136
Krueger, I'm glad you stop by.

418
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,388
I think we are wrong foot.

419
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:19,142
I did not know I was in the presence
was a celebrity.

420
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:22,478
I did some research and apparently
were you a big man in LA.

421
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:26,106
Not that that means much if your opponent
China has a rommelbak.

422
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:32,195
But you did get a good sponsor ...

423
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:37,575
that surprised me, because I thought ...
This is the son of that loser, Frank Krueger.

424
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,285
Shut up, Jake.

425
00:53:39,827 --> 00:53:44,373
And then I found out that you
You sponsor race car driving piece.

426
00:53:44,582 --> 00:53:47,835
And then I thought, you see,
He is an Krueger.

427
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:58,219
And now everybody thinks you are quick.

428
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:00,555
Maybe faster than me.

429
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:03,849
Let's fix this.

430
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,187
You did not even close last night.

431
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:11,189
I had three people in my car.
- And I did not drive at full speed.

432
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,191
Let's settle it now.

433
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,615
You still have a few
hours before the cafÃ©s close ...

434
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:22,950
your father to the floor there to pick up.

435
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,914
That's why you moved over here?
Your personal assistant to his father.

436
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,462
That was low, you're right. I had
Your father should not offend.

437
00:54:35,462 --> 00:54:37,297
My gardener says
He delivered a good job.

438
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:40,425
Would you like racing?

439
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:43,260
Come on, let's go.

440
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:45,387
Quiet, Danny.

441
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:51,852
It appears that Krueger goes down.

442
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:24,757
Here we go.

443
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:49,613
Come on.

444
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:59,080
No.

445
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:03,668
Damn.

446
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,212
That's it.

447
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:30,108
That's what happens when you choose Japanese.

448
00:56:30,108 --> 00:56:33,111
I almost had you and you know it.
- Almost does not count.

449
00:56:33,111 --> 00:56:37,282
Now is a good time to leave
for yourself even more ridiculous.

450
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:52,963
Damn.

451
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:06,642
I think we lost.

452
00:57:13,273 --> 00:57:14,816
How many did you beat him?

453
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:18,027
Not enough.

454
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:22,823
I was almost defeated and you know it.
- Almost does not count.

455
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,336
Krueger, Kendall, follow me.

456
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:39,589
Be sure the car has a relationship
has 8 / 71. Come on.

457
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:47,805
What were you thinking?
- I do not know.

458
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:52,100
I want you to keep track of.
Now I call your father.

459
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,395
Mine almost gave a party
because I've defeated Krueger.

460
00:57:55,395 --> 00:57:58,856
I'll still talk to him,
go back to class.

461
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:06,280
You put me in a bad position, Danny,
you know?

462
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:08,949
I thought you were smarter.

463
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,307
What does it need?
- I'm sorry.

464
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:38,977
What does it need?

465
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:42,188
Because I think now, maybe
I let him race.

466
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:46,191
He does his homework, it is timely
I may have less severe.

467
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:52,531
Give me your keys. You are nothing more than
an irresponsible, spoiled little child.

468
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:56,868
Give me a lesson about responsibility.
You left your wife and child behind.

469
00:58:56,868 --> 00:59:00,163
You're 17, you remember
nothing about life.

470
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:02,832
You do not know what it is
if your father left behind.

471
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:04,667
I was ten.

472
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:08,921
Come once again talking like 15 years of
hard work explodes in your face by a mistake.

473
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,380
Maybe you better
concentrate on what you had ...

474
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,382
rather than obsess about what you lost.

475
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,093
Enough now, give me your keys.
Gone away.

476
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,761
You know what I think?

477
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,513
I think you're jealous.

478
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:22,016
Because I have a real chance
to do what you never could.

479
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,810
Give me your keys.

480
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:53,211
Hello.

481
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,589
Jessica is at home?

482
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,676
What do you, Danny?

483
01:00:03,971 --> 01:00:07,057
I screwed up, but I'm not
went over there to race.

484
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:08,642
Why were you there?

485
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,852
I wanted to see where I compared
come to stand in the race.

486
01:00:10,852 --> 01:00:13,355
Why did not you just?
- I do not know.

487
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:22,405
In LA I had a sponsor.
A very big.

488
01:00:22,405 --> 01:00:25,449
And that I lost.
- How?

489
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:27,242
It does not matter why.

490
01:00:27,785 --> 01:00:32,789
When I heard of the race, I thought,
This is my chance, you know?

491
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:34,124
My second chance.

492
01:00:34,124 --> 01:00:38,628
So I'm just a little time to spend
until you have the opportunity to get out of here?

493
01:00:38,628 --> 01:00:40,213
No, not at all.

494
01:00:40,213 --> 01:00:43,341
Have you ever thought that there
more important things than racing?

495
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:46,802
I came here to apologize.
Why are you so difficult?

496
01:00:46,802 --> 01:00:50,764
If that's how you feel,
you'd better go.

497
01:00:51,973 --> 01:00:54,601
Are you serious?
- Now.

498
01:02:29,563 --> 01:02:31,690
Yes.
- Dad?

499
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,441
I need your help.

500
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,028
Where are you?

501
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:52,918
Are you okay?
- Yes.

502
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:57,297
Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

503
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:07,264
What happened?

504
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:09,892
Someone tampered with my brakes.

505
01:03:17,273 --> 01:03:19,734
You must have driven fast
in order to end up.

506
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,403
I'm telling you,
someone messed with my car.

507
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:26,282
It's always someone
different from their mistake with you.

508
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:31,745
You could be dead. You do not think.

509
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:34,623
What's wrong with you?

510
01:03:45,174 --> 01:03:46,884
Help me with the pull cord.

511
01:04:00,354 --> 01:04:01,898
Hello.

512
01:04:02,607 --> 01:04:05,818
Mommy?
- Danny.

513
01:04:07,194 --> 01:04:08,987
Can I come home?

514
01:04:10,072 --> 01:04:11,823
Danny anyway.

515
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:21,832
If I did not think this is the best
was for you, I get you right.

516
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:29,214
He hates me. He wants me here.
He never wanted.

517
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:34,219
No, that's not true. It was his idea
for you to come there.

518
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:39,057
Danny, talk to him.
He loves you.

519
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,893
Maybe it's time to forgive him.

520
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,855
I'm sorry, Mom.

521
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,108
I know.

522
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,944
I love you.

523
01:04:53,737 --> 01:04:55,322
I love you.

524
01:05:24,723 --> 01:05:26,308
Why did you leave?

525
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,153
I could not take it anymore.

526
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:42,448
I ruined everything by
possible path to follow ...

527
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:45,409
instead of finishing second and
a family and career to have.

528
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,299
Remember when I
came to collect from school?

529
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:06,971
Just before I left?
- No.

530
01:06:07,554 --> 01:06:10,766
You had 39 degrees fever.

531
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:13,810
The school nurse called
for you to collect.

532
01:06:14,477 --> 01:06:18,189
Mum was at work and
I had no job because I ...

533
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:22,610
When I got there ...

534
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:27,990
They did not give me.

535
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:33,411
It was not yet half past nine
Morning and I was already drunk.

536
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,664
I remember no more.

537
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:44,630
You know what I did remember?

538
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:48,967
The first time you took me
for a ride in this beast.

539
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:52,929
I had the whole trip butterflies in my stomach.

540
01:06:53,346 --> 01:06:56,433
That feeling of acceleration was so intense.

541
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,601
I was very scared before.

542
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:01,020
Then I felt safe.

543
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:04,899
Because I knew you behind the wheel.

544
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:20,121
How hard it is to hear, I am happy.

545
01:07:20,705 --> 01:07:24,417
It was better that I have in recent years
was not, it was not a pretty picture.

546
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:27,419
Then just hated me more.
- I hated you.

547
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,630
I never hated.

548
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:36,386
An occasional visit would have been nice.

549
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:42,433
Yes. I should have been there.

550
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:06,497
Thanks, I ask later
get a ride to Max.

551
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:15,547
Hello, Krueger, where is your car?

552
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:19,592
He gets new tires?
- Yes, guys. I do not anymore.

553
01:08:24,638 --> 01:08:26,432
Where's Fernando?

554
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,143
He would normally have to play Ben.
I Am a need.

555
01:08:29,143 --> 01:08:32,729
He sits on the toilet.
- Do you kidding me?

556
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:34,314
I'll do it.

557
01:08:40,778 --> 01:08:43,447
Nice that you want to do, Danny.

558
01:08:46,242 --> 01:08:49,161
Ok, before you start ...

559
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:53,957
I want you in your own words say what
Do you think Claire wants to say.

560
01:08:57,585 --> 01:09:00,213
Okay, just keep in mind
he is a compulsive gambler and ...

561
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:04,133
He just bet all his money on it wrong
horse, now he must answer.

562
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,177
I think he wants to offer his apologies.

563
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:08,762
Excuses?

564
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:13,808
He wagered just her wedding ring.
You will have to do better as "I'm sorry".

565
01:09:17,103 --> 01:09:18,980
He would say he was stupid.

566
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,775
Him and that his addiction was just too much.

567
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:25,402
Well. What else?

568
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:29,198
He would say he should have listened
to her when she wanted to help him.

569
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,366
And he would say, thank you.

570
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:33,827
You're welcome.

571
01:10:00,393 --> 01:10:04,480
This is a familiar face. Long ago
I have seen you again driving that thing.

572
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,649
I thought I'd dust it off and apply today
my son with them to school.

573
01:10:07,858 --> 01:10:10,819
I think you've heard that our
boys had a collision last night ...

574
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:14,030
as we used to.
Kendall only won it once.

575
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:25,457
It's good for business if he wins.

576
01:10:25,624 --> 01:10:27,793
Other children will then
along and give all their money.

577
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:35,467
I'm not sure if your son
future in racing.

578
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:40,430
But you can always name your
case change in Krueger and son.

579
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:44,767
You know what, Jimmy?

580
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:50,272
It's one thing to know how the
components of your car can change.

581
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:59,405
It's another thing to know
how they all work together.

582
01:12:15,892 --> 01:12:18,853
Hello, boy.
- What is it?

583
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:22,690
Remember that today is the last day to
toestemmingsbewijsjes you to bring.

584
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,275
So give them away if you have them.

585
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,541
I'm glad you're participating.

586
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,551
Will you be part
from my pit crew?

587
01:12:52,592 --> 01:12:54,177
Absolutely.

588
01:12:56,971 --> 01:13:01,851
We have three days, guys, so let
the front strip, stripping everything.

589
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:04,061
Can you still use a few hands?

590
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,234
Thanks.

591
01:13:11,234 --> 01:13:13,612
Protectors, the front cross member,
radiator support ...

592
01:13:13,612 --> 01:13:17,991
2 arms, intercooler,
the large air intake and total ...

593
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:22,954
We do not get that, it's too much.

594
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,838
Tomorrow at school, everyone goes home.

595
01:13:33,004 --> 01:13:35,298
We come together again tomorrow.

596
01:13:57,443 --> 01:14:00,822
Hi, Randy.
Same for you.

597
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:04,075
Do you still interested in my Buick?

598
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:28,263
I'm Greg, hello.
Long ago.

599
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:30,140
What can I do for you?

600
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:36,604
I want you to make a price,
it is for my son.

601
01:14:39,232 --> 01:14:41,317
He participates in the school race.

602
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:09,635
Have you sold the Buick?
- Yes.

603
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:15,515
There should be enough to
for the rest of your stuff.

604
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,727
But he needs you
your first trophy worried.

605
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:24,857
Time to leave the past and
to concentrate on what's coming.

606
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:28,986
Thanks, Dad.

607
01:15:29,903 --> 01:15:31,697
That's the least I could do.

608
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,451
Help me now to unload this stuff.

609
01:15:40,246 --> 01:15:43,999
The right button makes your car is ready
and the left button makes the nitro finished.

610
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,752
Kendall has a heavier
engine and a supercharger ...

611
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:48,837
and you have 200 units of nitrogen under your thumb.

612
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:53,091
If the light turns green, hit it.
Keep it pressed all the time.

613
01:15:56,594 --> 01:16:01,682
Yes, a GT-40 Mansfield. Is that the
best price you can give me?

614
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,483
The rocket fuel.

615
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,130
How does it feel?

616
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:37,257
Feels good and sounds good.

617
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:40,593
I have a little surprise.

618
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:44,597
I do not like surprises.

619
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,149
That's good advertising for the garage.

620
01:16:56,316 --> 01:16:59,068
You would think there is need to
here to change to an import dealer.

621
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,322
Ok, good work everyone.
We go racing tomorrow.

622
01:17:26,468 --> 01:17:30,597
Welcome everyone, to the NHRA racing school.

623
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:36,478
With over 65 students and 32 schools,
this is the biggest event ever.

624
01:17:39,814 --> 01:17:45,402
Look out for the home favorite and Jake Kendall
the whole team of Kendall Performance Centers.

625
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:48,363
And newcomer Danny Krueger this year ...

626
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:52,784
that drives a 2.5 liter, four cylinder,
four-wheel drive Subaru STI.

627
01:17:52,784 --> 01:17:58,164
It is one of the few four-cylinder
and that goes against all these big V8's.

628
01:17:58,164 --> 01:18:00,958
Let's see if this Subaru
There has to cope.

629
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:03,461
We would like to thank all our sponsors ...

630
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:09,132
You load it, I'm going to register us.

631
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:22,228
Next to the warm up lap
Miguel Sanchez ...

632
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,772
with its classical turbo diesel
truck, "Little Red".

633
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:50,754
11.22 and 11.41. I have these two
see all the faster cars go so ...

634
01:18:50,754 --> 01:18:53,215
I do not think they have given everything.

635
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:56,968
You go down, Krueger.

636
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:59,554
It is hereditary.

637
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:01,764
Like father, like son.

638
01:19:03,557 --> 01:19:05,893
It seems that you
have chosen the wrong team, Jess.

639
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,145
It seems that I
have chosen the wrong girlfriend.

640
01:19:09,521 --> 01:19:12,691
Ignore them,
You need to stay focused.

641
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:14,442
Here.

642
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:17,862
We are ready to go.
- Fantastic.

643
01:19:17,862 --> 01:19:21,866
Let's us be at the start,
The formation lap is almost over.

644
01:19:21,866 --> 01:19:25,244
The first round we must provide
we end up under 13 seconds.

645
01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:26,620
That would not be a problem.

646
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:37,672
This is the last race in the warm up lap
Danny Krueger in STI.

647
01:19:37,755 --> 01:19:39,340
His opponent was Alex Dod ...

648
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,717
with the classic Mustang
Washington secondary.

649
01:19:46,597 --> 01:19:48,307
Look at the burn-out.

650
01:19:48,432 --> 01:19:53,019
Dod make the tires nice and sticky so
he maximum grip on the starting line.

651
01:19:53,228 --> 01:19:57,690
It is not necessary to warm up your tires
if you have a four-wheel-drive Subaru.

652
01:20:12,537 --> 01:20:15,790
Krueger had some problems with the
starting line and the Mustang was gone.

653
01:20:15,874 --> 01:20:17,834
Let's see if he can overtake Krueger.

654
01:20:33,557 --> 01:20:38,102
It failed.
Alex comes in at 12.29 ...

655
01:20:38,102 --> 01:20:42,273
Danny Krueger, there is only
correct with his 12.98.

656
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:47,152
The race has been won.

657
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:52,240
I know.
- Come on, man.

658
01:20:52,282 --> 01:20:54,701
The circuit is thicker than the street,
I did not expect that.

659
01:20:54,701 --> 01:20:58,496
And the strength ...
- Each round Now you have time drop.

660
01:20:58,538 --> 01:21:00,081
You would have to have around 11.

661
01:21:00,081 --> 01:21:03,793
If you lose a race,
is done. Concentrate.

662
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:07,296
To all our racers,
we go to round n.

663
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:13,218
Now the starting line, Grant Warner
with his 1969 Oldsmobile 442.

664
01:21:13,218 --> 01:21:14,803
Grant is quite the summer practicing ...

665
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:18,139
and let me say this,
wheeler that bars are not just for luck.

666
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:24,228
The opponent, Jake Kendall,
with his 2011 Mustang GT.

667
01:21:24,228 --> 01:21:28,232
These are our fastest racers
who compete against each other.

668
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:49,084
And take a look at Jake, who thumb
down is for Grant.

669
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,503
Jake is confident.

670
01:22:26,201 --> 01:22:29,913
It seems that Grant
fast car has to go ...

671
01:22:29,913 --> 01:22:31,998
who goes on the trailer home.

672
01:22:31,998 --> 01:22:36,461
Jake Kendall won with a time
of 10.98 and went 127 miles per hour.

673
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:52,767
As next, Danny Krueger
STI against his ...

674
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,520
Kevin Bakar and his 1970 Chevy Nova.

675
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:58,648
Let's see if Danny
This leaves more time.

676
01:23:02,652 --> 01:23:05,696
A good start for Danny,
He stands for the Nova.

677
01:23:14,913 --> 01:23:18,750
And he did it.
Danny Krueger goes to the next round ...

678
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,627
with a time of 11.40 and 121 miles per hour.

679
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:24,505
That was a tough ride.

680
01:23:25,548 --> 01:23:28,550
It is difficult to Andrea Faust and her hot,
Dodge rose about to overlook.

681
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:33,180
This girl racing all her life.

682
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,682
She knows how the boys
to give a firm ride.

683
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:38,434
They sure like to see her race.

684
01:23:50,779 --> 01:23:53,323
Andrea Faust goes to the next round.

685
01:23:53,323 --> 01:23:57,327
There is some competition between these young
and they're certainly not done.

686
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:58,870
Let's see what they can do.

687
01:24:00,788 --> 01:24:02,999
H, how are you?

688
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:05,084
How are you?
- Good to see you.

689
01:24:05,084 --> 01:24:07,169
You too.
Do you too?

690
01:24:07,294 --> 01:24:10,505
No, we belong to Danny Krueger.
- With the Subaru.

691
01:24:10,589 --> 01:24:12,841
He looks good.

692
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,759
As a birthday cake.

693
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:18,221
In the quarterfinals are still
Kendall Performance a racer ...

694
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:22,391
Bradford for the secondary,
Clint Johnson with his 1969 Chevy Chevelle ...

695
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:25,936
which takes on Danny Krueger in his
Corvaille from The Fast And The Furious.

696
01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:42,743
The winner goes to the semifinals.

697
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:22,071
An easy victory for Krueger
with 11.17 against 11.88 of Johnson.

698
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:24,115
Yes, successfully.

699
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:31,997
In the first semifinal
Andrea Faust, we ...

700
01:25:31,997 --> 01:25:34,833
with her beautiful brown hair
From the Patriot secondary ...

701
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:38,336
by Jake Kendall with
Mustang is from Bradford.

702
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:22,710
Jake Kendall goes to the final.

703
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,795
This is the fastest ride today.

704
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:26,964
For the next semi-final ...

705
01:26:27,089 --> 01:26:29,049
We Miguel Sanchez
with his Dodge truck ...

706
01:26:29,174 --> 01:26:31,301
against Krueger in STI.

707
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,679
Hi, Tom.
- Neil, how are you?

708
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,806
Karl, Tom Bricks.
- How are you?

709
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:38,349
Well.

710
01:26:38,349 --> 01:26:42,019
You have three of your students there.
Impressive.

711
01:26:43,229 --> 01:26:45,064
A guess who will win?

712
01:26:47,232 --> 01:26:49,109
Is that what you are going to give me?

713
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,321
The liquids are ok.
Everything checked? Ready to go?

714
01:27:01,662 --> 01:27:03,581
What an idiot.

715
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:10,671
That thing has a lot of torque,
He will beat you to the starting line ...

716
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:14,841
no doubt. Let him not be distracted.
Stay focused on maximum torque.

717
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:18,636
You get him in the end,
then you have won.

718
01:27:45,536 --> 01:27:48,247
Fun, h?
- Yes.

719
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:25,823
Danny Krueger gets him on the last.

720
01:28:25,948 --> 01:28:29,368
Ladies and gentlemen, Danny Krueger continues.
He took it just in time.

721
01:28:29,368 --> 01:28:30,952
What?

722
01:28:31,203 --> 01:28:32,787
He did it.

723
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,584
An unexpected victory.

724
01:28:38,668 --> 01:28:42,380
I can not believe this little Subaru
has made it to the final.

725
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,590
But Krueger's work is not over.

726
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:49,803
Jake Kendall has been faster rounds
Danny Krueger traveled than ever.

727
01:28:49,803 --> 01:28:54,015
Danny must hope for a miracle.
Or at least a few more cylinders.

728
01:28:54,224 --> 01:28:56,893
What do you mean?
- The thrust increase ...

729
01:28:57,018 --> 01:28:59,228
otherwise I think I better not
can do more than my last trip.

730
01:28:59,228 --> 01:29:01,689
Danny, what are you doing?

731
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:04,191
Your turbo is running at maximum,
you will blow up your engine.

732
01:29:04,191 --> 01:29:06,652
It is only at 23 bar
it is a bit higher.

733
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:08,403
I do a benefit show.

734
01:29:08,529 --> 01:29:10,322
Do you know how a few
seconds of your time can do?

735
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:12,032
How?

736
01:29:12,407 --> 01:29:14,034
Powershift with this ride.

737
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,786
Is not that just as dangerous?
- Not unless you screwed up.

738
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:18,871
Make us proud.

739
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,504
I do not want to embarrass us Krueger.
That would be very bad, you know?

740
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,214
Yes, sir.

741
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,051
Is it almost done?

742
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:36,179
Yes, the new tires are on it
and the dampers are off.

743
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:38,973
You would have to go faster now,
but not too fast.

744
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,516
Yeah, okay.

745
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:50,776
Here we are,
the final of the NHRA racing school.

746
01:29:57,198 --> 01:29:58,950
What is power shifting?

747
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:01,077
It's off without
accelerator release.

748
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:03,120
In turbo cars keeps the engine ...

749
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,581
at full speed between two
gears for maximum acceleration.

750
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,291
You need fast
for it to be.

751
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:10,043
There is no room for
errors or otherwise 'boom'.

752
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:40,613
RICE DID YOU?

753
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:14,894
Go.

754
01:34:49,174 --> 01:34:51,176
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor ...

755
01:34:51,176 --> 01:34:56,598
Danny Krueger for this year to call
as the winner of the NHRA racing school.

756
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:03,187
Congratulations, you have talent.
See you next summer.

757
01:35:03,187 --> 01:35:04,772
Thank you.

758
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,739
Maybe your idea is not so bad.

759
01:35:14,739 --> 01:35:16,324
Any idea?

760
01:35:16,324 --> 01:35:18,201
In order to transform my garage
to import a race shop.

761
01:35:18,242 --> 01:35:21,329
