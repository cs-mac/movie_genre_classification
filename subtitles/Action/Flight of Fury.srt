1
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:06,844
Please restrain the patient.

2
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,049
Prepare for memory wipe.

3
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:28,386
Transport coming in.

4
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:58,410
Clear. Move along.

5
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:32,773
Call in the doctor.
Patient now prepared for procedure.

6
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,624
- He's all yours, doc.
- Thank you.

7
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:49,644
This won't hurt a bit.

8
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:52,544
In fact, you won't remember
a goddamn thing.

9
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,450
Yes. Now, then.

10
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:05,868
Do you mind, boss?

11
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,240
Good job. You know what to do.

12
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,525
You owe me, cabrón.

13
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:46,746
All clear, move it out.

14
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:43,713
You're clean, move out.

15
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:14,067
Code four, code four,
security breach.

16
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,803
We have a prisoner escape.

17
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,072
Open up.

18
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:20,051
Copy that. We're in pursuit
of the prisoner. We're in pursuit.

19
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,215
Nothing in here.

20
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:16,017
- All right, secure this area.
- Yeah, the truck is secured.

21
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,954
- That's clean.
- Okay.

22
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,396
- Just the one vehicle?
- It's all clear.

23
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:49,576
So, Ratcher, looks like
I'm you're wingman today.

24
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:52,420
You better be sharp up there,
Jannick.

25
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:55,495
The old man wants me to go full-bore,
I hope you can keep up.

26
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,100
- Hey, I'll be right on your ass.
- Yeah?

27
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,328
We'll see about that.

28
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:03,843
You know, you're a fortunate man,
getting to fly the new X-77.

29
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,945
I wish it was me up in that cockpit,
instead of flying the chase plane.

30
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:11,386
Luck of the draw.

31
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,325
Yeah, well, someday I'll get my shot.

32
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:14,624
You good to go?

33
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,527
See you at 20,000 feet.

34
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:34,395
Colonel Ratcher?
General Barnes would like to see you.

35
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:42,314
- The X-77 is ready to fly, general.
- Good.

36
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:45,249
I wanna be sure the active stealth
system is fully functional.

37
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,687
The shakedown isn't until next week.
Why are we--?

38
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,385
Insurance.

39
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:54,129
This little rehearsal will see me retire
with a third star on my shoulder.

40
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:55,933
Now, listen...

41
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,579
...this flight is off the record.

42
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:01,378
I want you to put that plane
through its paces, Ratcher.

43
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,785
We'll be tracking your progress
from Command Ops.

44
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,688
Mission countdown
in 20 minutes, sir.

45
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:09,123
Oh, and don't let me down, Ratcher.

46
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:12,136
I wanna see that plane disappear
as promised.

47
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,740
You got my word on that, sir.

48
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:06,569
One minute to countdown.
One minute to countdown.

49
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,242
You're clear for a runway.

50
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:31,577
This is Jannick.

51
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,381
F*16 ready for takeoff.

52
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,150
Ready for takeoff.

53
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,348
X-77 to Control,
reaching cruising altitude.

54
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:54,098
F-16 confirming position of X-77.
I have visual contact.

55
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:00,369
Request permission
to engage active stealth.

56
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:05,212
Okay, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

57
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,000
Control, confirming active stealth,
operational.

58
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:19,446
It's amazing, she's just gone.

59
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:23,251
Great. Good job, guys.

60
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:26,224
Okay, Ratcher,
disengage active stealth.

61
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,058
Disengaging.

62
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:33,602
All right,
let's move to the next phase.

63
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:37,244
Ratcher, take her to the second floor
and reengage.

64
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,783
Roger.

65
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:55,411
Ratcher, you're just having
too much fun out there.

66
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,346
You better believe it, baby.

67
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:06,031
All right, Jannick, war games
commencing. Try and catch me now.

68
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,370
Ratcher, I'm right on your tail.

69
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:27,674
Tracking target.

70
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,446
Got a lock.

71
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,116
Engaging active stealth.

72
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:51,781
Disengaging.

73
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,816
Coming around.

74
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,023
Target locked.

75
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,169
This is Jannick. I've been tagged.

76
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,941
He just came out of nowhere,
I couldn't even see him.

77
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,782
Good, shut her down
and bring her home.

78
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,964
Ratcher?

79
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:49,989
Jannick, do you have a visual?

80
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,157
Negative, sir, still no contact.

81
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,360
X-77, come in.

82
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:58,029
Come in, X-77.

83
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,581
X-77, report to Mission Control.

84
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,276
X-77, come in.

85
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,424
Jannick, abort your mission
and return to base.

86
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:12,103
What the hell happened up there?
We just lost a $75-million plane.

87
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,717
Nothing happened up there, sir.
She just disappeared.

88
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,116
I was just following orders.

89
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:22,259
At least we know she works right.

90
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,097
We've gotta get it back.

91
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,740
And there's only one man I know
who can do that.

92
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,444
- That'll be $2.10.
- There you go.

93
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:35,781
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

94
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,686
See you later.

95
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,602
Hand over the fucking money.

96
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:13,681
Give me the money!

97
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,023
Freeze, put your hands up.

98
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:59,237
He's the only one alive.

99
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,545
Okay, play back the security tape.

100
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:07,447
You'll see it was self-defense.

101
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,989
Let's go.

102
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,738
- What is that stuff?
- Look at that guy.

103
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,609
- That's awesome.
- He's kicking ass.

104
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:45,152
- Sorry, guys.
- Fine, you guys, let's take a break.

105
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,154
All right, let's get out of here, guys.

106
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,425
You get me some coffee.

107
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,295
Saunders,
get your fat ass into a cruiser.

108
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,533
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you get out of the car...

109
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,406
...once in a while?
Walk the streets...

110
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,484
...and maybe assholes like this
won't get all the press, we will.

111
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:02,623
What do we got?

112
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:06,525
Can't get no prints off this guy.
He's not in any of our data banks.

113
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:10,399
And to make things worse,
he ain't exactly talking.

114
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,214
Then we have nothing.

115
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,885
Well, we could book him
for stealing a car.

116
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:22,193
Come on, man,
it's not about stealing a car.

117
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,359
He was not involved in that robbery.

118
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,002
It was just self-defense.

119
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,575
So that's it, he walks?

120
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,235
We can hold him for 24 hours.

121
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,179
Here.

122
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,023
Get this over to the feds.

123
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:44,463
This guy is extraordinary.
He's unlike anything I've ever seen.

124
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,705
We may not know who he is,
but I bet they do.

125
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,281
Your coffee, sir.

126
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:54,111
I don't drink coffee.

127
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,553
Colonel Ratcher requesting
permission to enter airspace.

128
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,867
Sir.

129
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,809
Well?

130
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,479
What do you think?

131
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,647
Bring it to the barn.

132
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,168
So who are you?

133
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,567
You're not gonna talk to us?

134
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,902
- No, no, you know, I'm happy to talk.
- Then tell us.

135
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:07,210
Just a country boy.

136
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:08,787
Who's your employer?

137
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:11,188
I'm self-employed right now.

138
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,389
So, what is it you do?

139
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:17,131
Well, I--

140
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:20,904
- I travel a lot.
- I've seen you fighting, John.

141
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,571
That's no ordinary fighting.

142
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,743
- I grew up in a bad neighborhood.
- Sure.

143
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,791
There used to be something
called self-defense...

144
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,953
...but seems like
when you defend yourself...

145
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,568
...if you do it too good,
you get into trouble.

146
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,570
Tell me why we have no proof
that you're an active military.

147
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:40,406
Let's just see what the feds
have to say about that.

148
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,986
I'm in a talkative mood, so I'd love
to meet the feds and talk to them.

149
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:46,853
Let's just see what General Barnes
has to say about that.

150
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:49,462
General Barnes, Lord have mercy,
he's coming here?

151
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:51,534
Is he a friend of yours, John?

152
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:55,767
Well, I wouldn't say he was a friend
of mine, but I met him once.

153
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,503
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

154
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:00,177
You know?

155
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,029
Get the SEAL team in the air.
I want ground support...

156
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:10,534
- ...for the Stealth retrieval mission.
- This is Ranger team, Baker One.

157
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:14,404
C*130 prepped
and ready for takeoff.

158
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:29,102
C*130 airborne, on course to target.
E TA, three hours.

159
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,373
General, I wasn't expecting
this kind of response.

160
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,073
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

161
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,767
- John.
- Long time no see.

162
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,407
Thank you, detective.

163
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,856
We still have no proof
that he's active military.

164
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,561
Oh, I don't think
you need to worry about that.

165
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,162
I'll give you plenty of proof.

166
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,827
Another day,
another fucking surprise.

167
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:30,616
John, I had no part
in what they tried to do.

168
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:34,418
It was stupid.
You were right to do what you did.

169
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:37,119
I don't take kindly
to having my memory wiped.

170
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,391
I don't know if it was right or not...

171
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,127
...but all I did was follow orders.

172
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:43,967
It's bizarre to get punished
for shit like that, ain't it?

173
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,740
Yeah, but you know a lot of things
that make a lot of people nervous.

174
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:51,451
I'm not the only one.

175
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:54,720
What do you wanna do?

176
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,960
One of our test pilots stole a plane...

177
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:01,368
...and it's got technology
that scares even the shit out of us.

178
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,272
You get it back for us...

179
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:05,607
...and I guarantee
you'll be a free man.

180
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:08,783
And I'm supposed to believe that?

181
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,554
- John, it's me.
- It's not really you I'm worried about...

182
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,791
- ...it's kind of the people you work for.
- Don't worry about that.

183
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,529
- I'll take care of them.
- I will be worried about it...

184
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:21,074
...but I suppose
I don't have much of a choice, so...

185
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,377
...let's give it a shot.

186
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:34,293
Navy SEAL team on course.
We have a lock on Stealth position.

187
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,131
E TA, two hours.

188
00:23:36,572 --> 00:23:39,805
Ground support for air mission
will be in place.

189
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:41,675
We've got your backs.

190
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:44,349
Okay, John, here's the deal.

191
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,186
The X-77 is a top-secret
experimental aircraft...

192
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:52,027
...based on the F-117
Stealth Fighter.

193
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:53,828
Stealth was achieved by shrinking...

194
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,996
...the geometric cross section
of the plane...

195
00:23:56,174 --> 00:24:00,013
...and adding radar-absorbing
materials to cut down reflectivity.

196
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:03,017
The X-77 adds something new.

197
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:05,488
An active stealth system.

198
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:07,993
It's done
with an electromagnetic pulse...

199
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,067
...that effectively blankets the plane.

200
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:13,970
- It's a completely invisible aircraft.
- That's amazing.

201
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,372
What's even more amazing
is who took it.

202
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,706
We lost it to Ratcher.

203
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,175
He stole the plane.

204
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:22,186
I don't know who paid him...

205
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:25,760
...but whatever they paid him,
it will be a dump truck full of cash.

206
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,662
I don't know what to say, sir.

207
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,933
I know you two go back
a long way together, and next to you...

208
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:35,444
...Ratcher is probably
the best Stealth pilot in the world.

209
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:38,084
Well, as you know, him and I
go way back, I trained him.

210
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,049
- Yes.
- We've both flown Stealth...

211
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,591
- ...extensively, so--
- He's in Afghanistan.

212
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,630
We'll have a six-man team
on the ground to back you up.

213
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,668
But you've got to get in there and
you've got to get me that plane back.

214
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:54,940
- Hell, yeah.
- Once you get it up in the sky...

215
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:56,916
...you know
they'll be shooting at you...

216
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,853
...and you're gonna have to do
some fancy dancing.

217
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:02,018
Get me briefed
and I'll get up and get going.

218
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:03,631
Okay.

219
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:07,963
The X-77 can fly into enemy airspace
at supersonic speeds...

220
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,940
...drop missiles and smart bombs
with pinpoint accuracy...

221
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:13,514
...and come out
completely undetected.

222
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:14,947
It's the ultimate weapon.

223
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:20,322
But active stealth is a huge drain
on the 77's power supply.

224
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:21,589
So, Ratcher would have...

225
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:25,135
...had to turn off the active stealth
and return to passive stealth.

226
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:26,673
That's how we spotted him.

227
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,618
Satellite picked him up here,
over the Bonin Islands...

228
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:35,587
...heading due west
at 28 degrees north latitude.

229
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:39,959
He maintained that heading
until the satellite orbited out of range.

230
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:44,802
- Where exactly is the bird now?
- Satellite picked him up right here...

231
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:45,966
...this morning.

232
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,410
That's not gonna be fun
to get in and out of there.

233
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:51,347
- You got 72 hours.
- Seventy-two hours?

234
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:55,517
I couldn't pick my men, plan the op--
I couldn't even get in there.

235
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:59,195
You can in a Blackbird.
Now, I got a wizo...

236
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:01,531
...who knows
the Blackbird inside and out.

237
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:04,371
This kid is one of the hottest pilots
I've ever seen.

238
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:07,380
- Who's that, sir?
- Name's Rick Jannick.

239
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,011
He's your backup.

240
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:12,124
If it's okay with you, sir,
I'd rather not fly with him.

241
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,786
He's a little bit of an acrobat
and a showman...

242
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:16,865
...but no combat experience.

243
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,700
John, I got you out of jail because
I thought you were the best shot...

244
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,538
...we had at getting this plane back.

245
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:25,376
- Yeah, but--
- I don't give a damn what you think.

246
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,288
Jannick's my choice for backup.

247
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,013
He's on the mission.

248
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,489
Understood?

249
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:33,789
Yes, sir.

250
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:38,472
C*130 on course and on schedule.

251
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:40,770
- Position, 38 degrees west...
- There you go.

252
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:43,177
- ...twenty-seven degrees north.
- Thank you, sir.

253
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,220
Navy SEALs are locked and loaded,
and ready to jump.

254
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:50,695
So when are wheels up?

255
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,599
I don't know. I gotta get up
in the sky with this guy?

256
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,603
You've gotta be kidding.

257
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:01,147
- How old are you now?
- Oh, I'm drinking age, sir.

258
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,184
Drinking age, sir.

259
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:06,881
Okay, guys, let's go.

260
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,965
You'll fly into a friendly base
100 miles south...

261
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:15,198
...of where they stashed the 77.

262
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:18,437
There, you'll be met by a couple
of SF folks, who will provide you...

263
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:21,415
- ...with a ride, weapons and intel.
- Any assets on the ground?

264
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,612
We've got the colonel's asset,
Jessica.

265
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,194
She'll join you for the push
into the terrorist compound.

266
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:29,356
There, you'll grab the 77
and jump up.

267
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:33,235
If you can't jump up, you blow it up
and everybody who's seen it.

268
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,241
You have my word on that, sir.

269
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,438
Okay, guys.

270
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,613
Let's suit up.

271
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:09,736
SR-71, you're clear for a runway.

272
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,741
Let's find this thing
and blast it, John.

273
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,946
Just remember one thing,
my life is in your hands, son.

274
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,920
Yeah, and mine's in yours.

275
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,108
Take her up to 80,000 feet.

276
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,016
And stay off everybody's radar.

277
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,446
Roger that, sir.

278
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,828
Are you picking up any activity
on the radar? Big Bird, come in.

279
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:34,871
Any activity on the radar?

280
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,708
No radar signal,
we're clearing this bird.

281
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,183
Entering Chinese airspace.

282
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,760
We will keep in contact
and update progress.

283
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:59,484
We got radar tracking us over China.
Bearing needs to change.

284
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:10,736
Big Bird,
watch out for radar activity.

285
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:13,674
Radar activity, watch out, Big Bird.

286
00:31:13,847 --> 00:31:16,819
Roger that, Control.
John, take us up 10 angles.

287
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:18,648
Taking us up 10 angles.

288
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,367
You brought my plane.

289
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,141
You bring my money?

290
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,738
A man with priorities. I like that.

291
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,076
A little spending cash.

292
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:56,851
A hundred million will be sent
to your numbered account.

293
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,026
- Well--
- You wanna double that?

294
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:05,742
What you got in mind?

295
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,301
This is Navy SEAL team,
Baker One, target in sight.

296
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,005
It's now or never. Ready to deploy.

297
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,483
Okay, SEALs,
you're go for insertion.

298
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,082
Over target zone now.

299
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:50,245
Go, go, go.

300
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:36,740
Target approaching.

301
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,740
I can see hostiles on the ground.

302
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,176
Better watch your step.

303
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,186
This is Ranger team Baker One.
Secure on the ground...

304
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,461
- ...and waiting for SR-71.
- SR-71, this is Control.

305
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,537
Refuel at heading 0.02.

306
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:56,741
SR-71 going in for refueling.

307
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:32,503
Sir, Alpers, Fielding and Patterson
didn't make it.

308
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,114
I saw the militia take them out.

309
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,551
There's too much activity outside,
we'll hole up here.

310
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:57,482
Any activity on the radar?

311
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,419
Negative,
we're not on anyone's radar for now.

312
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:03,198
Take us directly
over North Korea and Vietnam.

313
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:07,875
Taking us
over North Korean airspace.

314
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,870
- Here they come.
- Coming in, coming in.

315
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:00,100
Okay, I got the landing strip.
Take us 270 degrees...

316
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,833
...and drop to 30 angles.

317
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:06,713
Taking to 270 and drop to 30.

318
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,336
And we're clear.

319
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:19,065
Nothing moving on the infrared.

320
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:20,632
Copy that.

321
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:24,215
Sir, intel reports heavy troop activity
in that region.

322
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,302
John, you'll have to set down
and abandon the plane.

323
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:20,017
We've got a jeep
waiting for you in a hangar.

324
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,180
It's all fueled up and ready to go.

325
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,459
Roger that.

326
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:28,760
Jannick's your partner
on this one, John.

327
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:30,496
He drives in with you...

328
00:37:30,673 --> 00:37:32,574
...he's your backup...

329
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:35,681
...and if needed,
he's your replacement.

330
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,120
If you fail,
I want another pilot standing by.

331
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,988
Roger that.

332
00:38:02,265 --> 00:38:07,037
Flanders, get me Admiral Pendelton
on the Crateon Davies.

333
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,055
Sir, we have a secure call coming in
from a General Barnes.

334
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,264
Patch him through.

335
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:24,234
What's the occasion, Tom?

336
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm sending a couple of guys
into bandit country.

337
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:30,813
You owe me a bottle of Scotch
from the last game of golf we played.

338
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:33,250
Can I get an assist
from the fourth fleet?

339
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:36,554
I've received no intel
about an operation.

340
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,365
One of my planes is missing.

341
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:43,669
- Where?
- Northern Afghanistan.

342
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:46,905
Jesus Christ, Tom.

343
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:48,776
That's a shooting gallery up there.

344
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,786
I mean, we'd--
We'd have to skirt the no-fly zone.

345
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:56,527
That's worth at least two bottles
of Scotch, and make it single malt.

346
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:00,935
Help me get my plane back and
I'll buy you a whole goddamn case.

347
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:03,273
Copy that.

348
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:07,116
Have Commander Jackson
air group report to me.

349
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:08,617
Yes, sir.

350
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,026
Where's my SEAL team?

351
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:20,402
I got no communication,
I'm starting to get hinky.

352
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:24,910
John, Admiral Pendelton
is assembling a strike force to assist.

353
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,046
That won't be necessary.
We're on the ground.

354
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:31,252
We got orders
and we're gonna follow them.

355
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,866
We're working on a tight
decision cycle here, John.

356
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:36,937
If you can't get that plane out
in 24 hours, we're gonna go in...

357
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,941
- ...and dust down the entire area.
- I know, I got 24 hours...

358
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,709
...and 47 minutes
before you send in the strike team.

359
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:45,787
I understand that, and believe me,
we'll have to pop your friend.

360
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:48,517
- Okay, guys, good luck.
- We're moving.

361
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,207
Sir, do you want to explore
more options?

362
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:04,720
If we wait longer than 24 hours,
they're liable to mount a first strike.

363
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:09,399
Look, the X-77
throws the ball in their court.

364
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:34,677
Rojar, did anyone see you?

365
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:39,117
- Me? I was careful not to be followed.
- You shouldn't have done that.

366
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:41,914
- We're being watched.
- I had to come.

367
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:44,062
- I have some very bad news.
- What?

368
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:47,868
- The American soldiers--
- Yeah, the Navy SEAL?

369
00:40:48,304 --> 00:40:49,738
Dead.

370
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:51,570
- Shit.
- Every single one of them.

371
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,682
Ambushed in the night
by Eliana's soldiers.

372
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:58,055
Well, what about John and Jannick?

373
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,390
I don't know. No news.
If they are safe, nobody's with them...

374
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:04,692
- ...they are all alone.
- No, they have us.

375
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:09,842
You want me to go
to the rendezvous point?

376
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,537
No, it's too dangerous.

377
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:15,186
Look, John knows
where to find me, okay?

378
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:34,649
According to the agency...

379
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:39,093
...this region over here is run
by the Black Sunday terrorist group.

380
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:42,235
With a weapon like this
in their hands...

381
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:46,399
Okay, I want everything
the agency's got on these bastards.

382
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:48,376
Yes, sir.

383
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,811
Pull up here, check the map...

384
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,882
...and stash the vehicle.

385
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:18,033
Okay, sir. Overhead shots.

386
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,371
That's the landing strip
and a small village.

387
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:23,911
And we're here.

388
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:27,382
All right, why don't you hide this jeep
and I'm gonna see if I can find...

389
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,716
- ...any sign of the SEAL team.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:08,190
Our scouts reported movement
somewhere around here.

391
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:10,195
You three stay here.

392
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,326
Anything?

393
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:31,599
Not a fucking thing.

394
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:36,241
All right, we're gonna head over
to my asset.

395
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:38,246
If we get split up...

396
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:40,511
...let's meet at the hangar.

397
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:05,926
Fan out. The plane landed nearby.
Look for a vehicle.

398
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:15,807
There's a vehicle hidden here.

399
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,499
I found a jeep. Looks abandoned.

400
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,937
I want you to block him off.

401
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:24,310
Take this, and get up and go.

402
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:31,795
Gotcha.

403
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,762
- Go and check on the others.
- Okay.

404
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:51,036
What do we have here?

405
00:46:51,473 --> 00:46:52,736
Looks like a pilot.

406
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:56,642
Captain Richard Jannick,
United States Air Force.

407
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,946
691495213.

408
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,181
Why don't you just tell me
where your plane is?

409
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:04,328
Why don't you kiss my ass?

410
00:47:04,496 --> 00:47:06,363
I'll kill you.

411
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:09,598
What are you waiting for?

412
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:12,643
Move!

413
00:47:13,212 --> 00:47:15,044
Go on!

414
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:21,355
- Sir, for you.
- Eliana.

415
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:23,793
We found a pilot, an American.

416
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:25,967
Another man escaped.

417
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:30,600
Bring me the pilot.

418
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:42,893
Don't say a fucking word.

419
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:50,240
- No response from radio calls?
- None at all, sir.

420
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:53,452
Get me Barnes at Edwards.

421
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:57,115
Go ahead, sir.

422
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:00,290
This is Admiral Pendelton,
U.S. Navy.

423
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:02,992
I'll inform General Barnes.

424
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:07,068
Sir, we've lost radio contact
with them.

425
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:10,341
Well, do something else.
Try something, try Morse code.

426
00:48:10,517 --> 00:48:14,651
Send up smoke signals.
I don't care, do something.

427
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,200
Good afternoon.

428
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:59,036
So glad you could make it.

429
00:49:06,854 --> 00:49:09,154
My name is Stone. And you are?

430
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:11,887
Screw you.

431
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:24,249
Your identification tags say
you are Richard Jannick.

432
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,584
A captain
in the United States Air Force.

433
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:30,591
Yeah, you got my name,
my rank, my ID number.

434
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:33,099
There's nothing else I can tell you.

435
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:39,005
Are there any more
surprise guests coming?

436
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:40,376
Yeah.

437
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,018
The Air Force.

438
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:45,056
Delivering a half-ton of ordinance
on this hellhole.

439
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,218
Have you seen
what the new smart bombs can do?

440
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:50,900
Yes, I have. Quite impressive.

441
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:53,402
In fact, I'd like to use
this plane of yours...

442
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,337
...to help deliver
a couple of smart bombs of our own.

443
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:58,106
But first...

444
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:00,082
...I have one more question
to ask you...

445
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,350
...about this other pilot.

446
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,420
Who is he?

447
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:26,493
Tell me
when you're ready to answer.

448
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:40,757
Or maybe we should do this
in a more civilized manner.

449
00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:00,560
- What do you think, sir?
- He's not gonna give him up.

450
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,324
Probably right.

451
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:06,066
- I'll put base on high alert.
- Go ahead.

452
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:14,184
You wanted to see me, admiral?

453
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:17,624
Budd, I want you to ready
a squadron, long-range op.

454
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:19,891
- Another training exercise?
- I'm afraid not.

455
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:22,798
This might be the real thing.
Who you got?

456
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:25,603
Well, I can have Hinkle and his team
on standby.

457
00:51:25,776 --> 00:51:27,803
Where are they flying, sir?

458
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:37,922
That's restricted airspace.

459
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,661
- What's it all about?
- Need-to-know basis, commander.

460
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:44,436
I can't tell you this time, Budd.

461
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,879
- You'll get your orders in due course.
- With all due respect, admiral...

462
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,387
...you can drive this flattop
any way you please...

463
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:54,860
...but once those aircraft leave
the deck, they're my responsibility.

464
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:58,697
I'm not gonna put my pilots
in harm's way without written orders.

465
00:52:01,442 --> 00:52:03,709
You'll have your written orders,
commander.

466
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:21,835
All right, gentlemen,
let's break it up.

467
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:18,951
Still fine as hell, ain't you now?

468
00:53:19,353 --> 00:53:23,291
Jesus, John.
I was expecting you a little later.

469
00:53:26,232 --> 00:53:29,260
- God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

470
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:31,669
Let me sit down.

471
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,418
Right about now, I'd love
to be doing something fun with you...

472
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:42,556
...but shit's a little bit sideways
around here. What do you know?

473
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:46,435
John, I have some bad news.

474
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:51,768
Over there.

475
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:59,587
Sir.

476
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,491
We've got a problem.

477
00:54:01,796 --> 00:54:03,959
One of my men
has been taken down.

478
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:07,669
I'm gonna need some help
searching the village.

479
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:09,675
It's gotta be him.

480
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,179
I'll take care of it.

481
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:24,069
What the fuck?

482
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:28,204
- Police.
- Wait a minute, let me dress.

483
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:32,211
- Open the door.
- Wait.

484
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:36,256
I said, open the door now.

485
00:54:41,537 --> 00:54:43,565
What do you want?

486
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:46,143
I'm looking for an American.

487
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,813
Captured one already.

488
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:55,526
- He killed a member of my patrol.
- I find that hard to believe.

489
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:58,767
We suspect...

490
00:54:59,235 --> 00:55:01,398
...he's an American spy.

491
00:55:01,573 --> 00:55:02,564
He's not here.

492
00:55:02,743 --> 00:55:05,544
You've had men here before,
haven't you?

493
00:55:11,258 --> 00:55:13,320
Tell me
what you're really looking for.

494
00:55:17,603 --> 00:55:18,593
Go on, get out.

495
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,523
Is this what you want?

496
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,650
I'll remember that.

497
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,227
I bet you will.

498
00:57:12,147 --> 00:57:14,777
- Keep an eye on her.
- That was quick.

499
00:57:14,952 --> 00:57:16,854
Fuck you.

500
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:24,833
Eleven hours and 52 minutes left.

501
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,564
- They should be back by now.
- Sir...

502
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:32,514
...are we really going to destroy
a $75-million war plane if John fails?

503
00:57:32,685 --> 00:57:34,314
We have no choice.

504
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:39,229
General Barnes for you, sir.

505
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:42,693
Secure the line,
don't patch this through.

506
00:57:45,176 --> 00:57:47,168
- Yes, Tom.
- Frank, have you been able...

507
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,145
...to reestablish radio contact
with my guys yet?

508
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:52,879
Nothing. It's been 12 hours.

509
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:56,187
I can have a squadron from the carrier
do a fly-over.

510
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:58,595
No. If we have to send in
search and rescue...

511
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:01,532
...we'll have to tell them
about the plane. I can't risk that.

512
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:02,799
I understand.

513
00:58:02,974 --> 00:58:07,414
And I'm not spooking the terrorists
into moving the plane either.

514
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:11,078
If my guys can't get it,
we're gonna have to destroy it...

515
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:13,556
...and everything in the region.

516
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:31,384
Taking out the garbage, huh?

517
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:39,440
Still no radio contact?

518
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:41,408
None, sir.

519
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:43,842
Peter Stone.

520
00:58:44,016 --> 00:58:47,215
British father, Muslim mother, spent
his childhood in the Middle East...

521
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:48,982
...but educated at Oxford.

522
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,687
Mother was killed in a U.S. attack
during Desert Storm...

523
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:54,700
...and as a result,
he started financing terrorist groups...

524
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,772
...and later formed
the Black Sunday group.

525
00:58:56,941 --> 00:58:59,878
Which brings us to Eliana Reed.

526
00:59:00,046 --> 00:59:01,639
Second in command
of Black Sunday.

527
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:04,343
She trains with various
guerilla groups in the region...

528
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,083
...giving Stone
the foundation he needs.

529
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:10,230
Three years ago, Stone negotiated
his way into a major arms deal...

530
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:12,163
...which was brokered by Ms. Reed.

531
00:59:14,406 --> 00:59:16,239
You're wasting your time.

532
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,944
I ain't talking.

533
00:59:20,616 --> 00:59:24,283
See, the funny thing
about biological warfare...

534
00:59:24,624 --> 00:59:28,530
...is you don't really know
what's hit you until it's too late.

535
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:30,429
Can you imagine?

536
00:59:32,272 --> 00:59:33,638
Football pitches.

537
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:35,299
Rock concerts.

538
00:59:35,478 --> 00:59:38,541
Playgrounds, schoolyards,
all those people.

539
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:40,619
Imagine how quickly
that would spread.

540
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:44,585
At first, you would probably think
it was just food poisoning.

541
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:46,457
Within 12 hours, they'll all be dead.

542
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:50,700
Think how much damage
one bomb could do.

543
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,076
And I've got two.

544
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:55,676
One for Europe.

545
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:59,515
And one
for the United States of America.

546
01:00:00,023 --> 01:00:02,789
And your plane to deliver them
undetected.

547
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:07,364
Well, who's gonna fly for you, huh?

548
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,653
Hey, Rick.

549
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,992
How's my old buddy, John?

550
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:26,166
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Hey.

551
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:28,303
The price was right.

552
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,288
We fly at dawn, fuel the planes.

553
01:01:16,763 --> 01:01:18,130
So, what's the bad news?

554
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,237
The SEAL team's been taken out
and they got Jannick.

555
01:01:21,405 --> 01:01:22,739
Holy shit.

556
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:27,514
Home base is gonna ask me
to abort the op and call me back.

557
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,312
So, what do we do?

558
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:33,620
Over here. These are the aerial
photographs of the airstrip, okay?

559
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:37,093
In this hangar over here
is where they're hiding the bitch.

560
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:44,145
I think I could steal her. I really do.

561
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:47,619
What's security like there?

562
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:51,353
Well, there's 60 multinational
mercenaries, heavily armed.

563
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:04,081
Okay, well,
I see you got my tools here.

564
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:06,848
If we get into the hangar
we won't be able to use any guns.

565
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,691
Perimeter looks like about 250 feet out
right here with these outbuildings.

566
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,992
This is definitely
the point of least resistance.

567
01:02:13,168 --> 01:02:14,431
Definitely.

568
01:02:14,603 --> 01:02:19,135
If we get inside this hangar
where she is, we can't use any guns.

569
01:02:19,313 --> 01:02:22,046
Only knives.
We all know how to use knives.

570
01:02:22,586 --> 01:02:25,557
Take everybody out there.
Jump in the bitch and fly her out, man.

571
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:31,029
It's possible. If we can't do that,
we blow her up and get out.

572
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:34,563
- Rojar, you'll lead us in.
- Okay, I'll pick you up at dawn.

573
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,006
But once we get within one mile
of the perimeter...

574
01:02:37,178 --> 01:02:40,811
...we have to be on high alert. That is
where there may be some checkpoints.

575
01:02:40,986 --> 01:02:43,422
So, what do we do
when we do get to a checkpoint?

576
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:46,327
We cut off their testicles.

577
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,001
Or we teach them
how to sing soprano.

578
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:59,113
- Admiral.
- Commander.

579
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:02,922
We just had confirmation
from our eye in the sky.

580
01:03:03,094 --> 01:03:05,963
The SEAL team they sent down
didn't make it.

581
01:03:06,132 --> 01:03:08,830
One hundred percent casualties.

582
01:03:09,004 --> 01:03:10,131
Oh, God.

583
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:13,038
It's time we let some hellfire
loose on these bastards.

584
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,910
No, no, no, not yet,
we still have people on the ground.

585
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,452
They've been out of radio contact
for 22 hours.

586
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:21,358
- They've probably bought it too.
- We don't know that.

587
01:03:21,527 --> 01:03:23,291
We can't jeopardize them...

588
01:03:23,463 --> 01:03:25,456
...and the chance
to get this damn plane back.

589
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:27,501
What, two guys
against a whole army?

590
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:32,237
- The odds are stacked against them.
- Maybe so, but I still have my orders.

591
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,378
We gotta give it our last shot.

592
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,646
I don't mean to second-guess you,
admiral...

593
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,849
...but we know
where that plane is right now.

594
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:41,522
I say we cut our losses
and take it out.

595
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:45,433
Once it's on the move again, we've got
no way of tracking it. Game over.

596
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,242
No, no, we wait.

597
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,533
Over there.

598
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:28,879
- Loaded and ready for delivery.
- When can you be up in the air?

599
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,612
Couple hours. Program
the coordinates into the computer...

600
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:33,589
...and set up the GPS
with the waypoints.

601
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,821
Good. Do it.

602
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,541
Boss.

603
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:51,556
You're going to have to pull over soon.
We're going to be there very shortly.

604
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:09,380
Stop. Get out of the car.

605
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:11,518
Your papers, please.

606
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,700
I know, you want my papers, right?

607
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:38,874
Fuck.

608
01:07:06,709 --> 01:07:10,808
Go, boss. Go, go. Move.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

609
01:07:18,029 --> 01:07:20,898
We're getting very close now.
You're going to have to pull over.

610
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:23,333
We're going to have to finish this
on foot.

611
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,738
I don't know what's up,
but if this goes wrong...

612
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:29,144
...both of our asses are on the line.

613
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:31,183
You wanna level with me?

614
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:33,482
Fair enough.

615
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,184
An Air Force plane
has gone missing.

616
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:40,166
- Stolen by one of their own jet jocks.
- So let the Air Force get it back.

617
01:07:40,337 --> 01:07:42,637
This isn't just any ordinary plane,
Budd.

618
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,440
It's the next-generation Stealth.
Now, that technology...

619
01:07:46,615 --> 01:07:49,883
- ...falls into the wrong hands we have--
- Looks like it already did.

620
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:53,160
I've never known you to back out
of a good fight, Budd.

621
01:07:55,297 --> 01:07:56,856
Let's throw
the damn rulebook away.

622
01:07:58,804 --> 01:08:00,831
Oh, what the hell.

623
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:04,410
You've got four planes up
on the flight deck. Fueled, armed...

624
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:06,316
...ready to go.

625
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:08,819
Outstanding, commander.

626
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:19,405
Less than two hours
left on the clock, sir.

627
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:22,206
Is the Crateon Davies in position
and the strike team ready?

628
01:08:22,381 --> 01:08:25,580
Admiral Pendelton is giving
the wing commander his final briefing.

629
01:08:25,754 --> 01:08:27,120
Okay.

630
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,193
- Captain Hinkle reporting, sir.
- Squadron ready, admiral.

631
01:08:30,363 --> 01:08:32,456
Locked and loaded.
What's the mission?

632
01:08:32,867 --> 01:08:35,201
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

633
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:40,603
Oh, shit.

634
01:08:40,781 --> 01:08:43,445
You're to hit that with every piece
of ordinance you have.

635
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,988
- Burn it all.
- Take out the hangar...

636
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:49,358
...the landing strip,
the goddamn outhouse.

637
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:52,592
There better not be a rat left crawling
when you've finished.

638
01:08:55,408 --> 01:08:57,970
- Aye, sir.
- Dismissed.

639
01:09:02,153 --> 01:09:03,143
All clear.

640
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,886
Everything all right here?

641
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,680
What if John and Jannick are still in
the area when the strike team arrives?

642
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:40,153
If they get my plane back,
I'll call off the strike.

643
01:09:40,324 --> 01:09:42,260
And what if they don't?

644
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:50,004
Sir.

645
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,221
Americans
are entering our airspace.

646
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:19,997
For now, the system is disabled.

647
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:41,002
The X-77 must be in that hangar
over there.

648
01:10:47,881 --> 01:10:49,544
Shit.

649
01:10:49,718 --> 01:10:53,624
- There is an F-16 there too.
- We can't fly them both out of here.

650
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:56,229
No, we don't care
about the other plane.

651
01:10:56,698 --> 01:10:58,691
Jannick's in that hangar
right up in there.

652
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:02,604
- You need him to fly the other plane?
- I don't care about the other plane.

653
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:06,077
- I just can't leave him behind.
- So in other words, he's your friend?

654
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:08,309
Yeah, but he's an asshole.

655
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:10,819
Three diversions, simultaneous,
three diversions.

656
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,927
You got it, boss.

657
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:14,530
Let's party.

658
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:16,030
Babe, let me come with you.

659
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,397
- Like I told you, west side.
- Okay.

660
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:42,775
Right. We've got company.

661
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:45,250
- You two stay here.
- Yes, sir.

662
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:01,815
Sir.

663
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,346
There's been a security breach...

664
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:07,459
...on the south side
of the perimeter fence.

665
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:10,526
Someone's cut a bloody hole in it.

666
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:14,103
- Get on to it.
- I'm on it.

667
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:30,600
Perimeter's semi-clear.

668
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:32,741
Jannick's in that building right there.

669
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:36,814
I'm gonna get him, get in that plane
and get out of here, are you ready?

670
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:38,849
Yeah, I got your back.

671
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,402
Don't move.

672
01:12:55,183 --> 01:12:56,550
Come here.

673
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:15,119
Don't move, motherfucker,
don't move.

674
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:29,578
You didn't have to come back, John.

675
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:35,044
- You should have just taken the plane.
- Not my style to leave people behind.

676
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:36,815
Grab the 47 and watch the door.

677
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:39,189
Listen, I need cover fire,
can you fly?

678
01:13:39,364 --> 01:13:41,026
- Shit, yeah.
- You can fly.

679
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,637
I need some cover fire,
and then you get up and help.

680
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:45,901
John, Ratcher's one of them.

681
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:47,840
Yeah, I know.

682
01:14:09,086 --> 01:14:12,616
All right, you go find Ratcher.
Her and I will get the plane...

683
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:14,454
...meet you in the hangar.

684
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:22,479
Shit.

685
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:54,366
Jessica.

686
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,114
What the fuck was that?

687
01:17:09,818 --> 01:17:11,343
Eliana.

688
01:17:12,354 --> 01:17:13,824
Eliana?

689
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:16,493
You better get on that plane.

690
01:17:16,964 --> 01:17:18,831
Not without my money.

691
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,437
Fine. Let's settle this.

692
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:23,934
Make sure there's no gunfire
around the plane.

693
01:17:47,686 --> 01:17:48,813
Is that all of it?

694
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:51,393
- For now, yes, it is.
- You sure?

695
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:54,158
I've initiated the wire transfer.
Fly the goddamn--

696
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,266
Plane.

697
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:15,068
Come on.

698
01:18:43,322 --> 01:18:44,654
Shit, shit, shit.

699
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:29,502
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

700
01:19:30,677 --> 01:19:33,512
Shit, shit, shit.

701
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:19,458
Oh, Jesus.

702
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:22,931
- You guys just don't quit, do you?
- What the hell are you doing here?

703
01:20:23,408 --> 01:20:26,675
I'm getting rich. You know
how much I'm getting paid for this?

704
01:20:26,847 --> 01:20:29,079
Two hundred million dollars,
free and clear.

705
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:34,525
- But this is treason.
- Treason? Open your eyes.

706
01:20:34,695 --> 01:20:37,529
You've been brainwashed
by those flag wavers at the Air Force.

707
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:41,034
Making money is the American way.

708
01:20:41,207 --> 01:20:42,369
Bullshit.

709
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,076
- It's all bullshit.
- But that's not how it works...

710
01:20:45,248 --> 01:20:46,511
...you know that.

711
01:20:47,485 --> 01:20:48,884
Drop it.

712
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:21,449
A lot of people looked up to you,
Ratcher, including me.

713
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:24,425
Who asked you? I didn't.

714
01:22:24,965 --> 01:22:25,989
Fuck you.

715
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:39,748
Kiss my big fat Arab ass!

716
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,227
Don't try anything. Move.

717
01:23:03,168 --> 01:23:06,833
How long before Pendelton's planes
arrive over the target?

718
01:23:08,845 --> 01:23:12,045
Strike force, this is Edwards,
what is your ETA?

719
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:16,748
ETA to target
is less than five minutes.

720
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:20,025
Less than five minutes, sir.

721
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:32,110
Hey, John.

722
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:35,616
Long time no see.

723
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:38,864
You know,
I would be ashamed of you...

724
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:41,797
...but I don't think
you deserve my shame.

725
01:23:41,972 --> 01:23:45,604
- But I trained you for this, man?
- Shit.

726
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:48,410
I could train you. I got the skills.

727
01:23:51,022 --> 01:23:54,154
Was this about money? Uncle Sam
didn't give you enough money?

728
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,092
Your mama
didn't give you enough money?

729
01:23:57,267 --> 01:23:59,066
Oh, look around you, John.

730
01:23:59,405 --> 01:24:03,936
We got French, Italians, Russians.

731
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:08,179
We're just a bunch of fucking
mercenaries out to make a big hit.

732
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:11,592
Unfortunately,
you ain't gonna get no big hit.

733
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:14,561
I wish I had the time to whoop your ass
and then shoot you...

734
01:24:14,733 --> 01:24:15,860
...but I got to go.

735
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:20,443
Make him fly in the plane.
If he makes one false move, shoot him.

736
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:24,547
When you shoot him, don't ruin your
own plane, so you can get back home.

737
01:24:24,718 --> 01:24:27,450
Open his door, make him lie down.

738
01:24:44,521 --> 01:24:45,819
Captain Hinkle.

739
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,551
- Proceed with your bombing mission.
- Copy that.

740
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:55,272
Have him dust the bastards down.

741
01:25:23,358 --> 01:25:25,157
Baby, you all right back there?

742
01:25:25,863 --> 01:25:27,561
Time for rodeo, buckle up.

743
01:26:08,509 --> 01:26:10,034
Move your ass.

744
01:26:11,014 --> 01:26:13,576
They're gonna carpet bomb this area
any minute now.

745
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,186
I'll take my chances.

746
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,420
Get in the fucking plane!

747
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:37,295
John. John, come in, John.

748
01:26:38,096 --> 01:26:42,195
- This is John. Go ahead, Jannick.
- I'm sorry, buddy...

749
01:26:43,607 --> 01:26:44,905
...but I didn't make it.

750
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,441
- Where is Ratcher?
- He's in the F-16.

751
01:26:50,921 --> 01:26:53,720
Don't worry about him,
I'll take care of him.

752
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,229
You go get him for me.

753
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:02,766
Roger that, brother.

754
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:29,856
Lock onto the Stealth plane!
Fire missile!

755
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,295
Locked-on missile sighted.

756
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:52,394
This is Hinkle,
making final bombing approach.

757
01:28:29,268 --> 01:28:31,033
Base, this is Bad Mojo.

758
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,937
Base, this is Bad Mojo, come in.

759
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:36,376
Base, this is Bad Mojo.

760
01:28:36,547 --> 01:28:37,675
Yes, John.

761
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:39,376
We've got the package, sir.

762
01:28:40,088 --> 01:28:41,819
What took you so long?

763
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:44,018
Had to jump-start my camel, sir.

764
01:28:44,196 --> 01:28:46,859
We've got some hazardous material
on the plane.

765
01:28:47,034 --> 01:28:49,596
It's an NBC bomb,
we're gonna have to be very careful.

766
01:28:50,306 --> 01:28:52,572
Can you fly the plane
safely back to Edwards...

767
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,610
...so we can disarm the bombs?

768
01:28:54,781 --> 01:28:56,149
Yes, sir.

769
01:28:56,319 --> 01:28:57,844
How's Jannick?

770
01:28:58,455 --> 01:29:00,925
Jannick is no longer with us.

771
01:29:01,694 --> 01:29:03,288
Damn.

772
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:05,160
I'm sorry to hear that.

773
01:29:05,568 --> 01:29:06,627
Roger that, sir.

774
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:11,508
So who's flying the 16?

775
01:29:11,678 --> 01:29:15,140
- It's Ratcher.
- Son of a bitch.

776
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:17,813
Request permission
to deal with that, sir.

777
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:20,388
I don't give a damn
what you want, John.

778
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:23,728
But if he shoots you down, it will be
the same as dropping the bombs.

779
01:29:23,902 --> 01:29:25,598
Roger that, sir.

780
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:40,388
Try to lock onto this.

781
01:29:49,448 --> 01:29:50,974
I'm right behind you, Ratcher.

782
01:30:01,471 --> 01:30:06,174
If the X-77 is shot down over Europe,
the disease will spread like this:

783
01:30:06,346 --> 01:30:07,507
Twelve hours.

784
01:30:08,516 --> 01:30:10,349
Twenty-four hours.

785
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,955
Thirty-six hours.

786
01:30:12,726 --> 01:30:14,661
Forty-eight hours.

787
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:20,370
Holy shit.

788
01:30:21,073 --> 01:30:23,134
That's what we're up against.

789
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:26,043
This is no naval or air force matter.

790
01:30:26,217 --> 01:30:28,152
This is global.

791
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:32,116
Whole damn kit and caboodle.

792
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:44,850
Tricks, John. That's all they are.

793
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:47,412
I could outfly you in a school bus.

794
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:51,894
I've still got a few up my sleeve.
You might learn something yet.

795
01:30:58,443 --> 01:31:00,913
Why fly against each other
when we can fly together?

796
01:31:02,216 --> 01:31:06,087
Come on, John,
we're talking millions of dollars here.

797
01:31:06,256 --> 01:31:08,350
What do you care about
those people down there?

798
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:10,019
From up here, they're nothing.

799
01:31:15,874 --> 01:31:17,069
Sorry, no deal.

800
01:31:17,443 --> 01:31:18,707
I'm the one who's sorry.

801
01:31:27,764 --> 01:31:29,790
We could have shared the money.

802
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:31,561
I'm not for sale.

803
01:31:33,975 --> 01:31:35,740
Engaging active stealth.

804
01:31:45,662 --> 01:31:48,133
I don't have to see you, John.

805
01:31:48,868 --> 01:31:51,338
I just have to predict
where you'll go.

806
01:31:56,616 --> 01:32:00,315
That ram skin on your wings
is pretty fragile stuff.

807
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:03,984
One well-placed hit
might bring the whole plane down.

808
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,940
Coming around.

809
01:32:48,511 --> 01:32:50,071
Got a lock.

810
01:32:57,827 --> 01:32:58,920
Oh, shit.

811
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:07,936
Bingo.

812
01:33:12,121 --> 01:33:13,384
Sayonara.

813
01:33:15,728 --> 01:33:18,962
Home base, this is Bad Mojo.
Home base, come in.

814
01:33:20,202 --> 01:33:21,295
Yes, John?

815
01:33:21,504 --> 01:33:22,530
Mission accomplished.

816
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,678
On the way in.

817
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:27,542
What about the bombs?

818
01:33:28,118 --> 01:33:30,954
Yes, sir. We've got the package, sir.

819
01:33:32,058 --> 01:33:33,720
Copy that.

820
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,800
Okay, guys, great work.

821
01:33:38,269 --> 01:33:40,239
Let's bring him home.

822
01:33:43,412 --> 01:33:45,177
Well done, everybody.

823
01:33:45,349 --> 01:33:46,978
Mission accomplished.

824
01:33:47,153 --> 01:33:48,485
Go, Navy.

825
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:50,320
Yeah.

826
01:33:51,428 --> 01:33:53,454
Right, back to your posts.

827
01:33:53,631 --> 01:33:56,227
Thanks for putting yourself
out on a limb for me, Budd.

828
01:33:56,403 --> 01:33:58,464
Well, you had it pegged right,
admiral.

829
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,702
About saving the human race
from destruction?

830
01:34:00,879 --> 01:34:01,869
Hell, no.

831
01:34:02,048 --> 01:34:06,111
About my not being able to resist
the chance to kick some ass.

832
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,123
Get me Barnes.

833
01:34:10,162 --> 01:34:15,126
I wonder if this would have anything
to do with a case of whiskey, sir?

834
01:34:15,304 --> 01:34:17,535
What's that to you, lieutenant?

835
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:19,338
Yes, sir.

836
01:34:46,329 --> 01:34:48,093
Good to see you back
in one piece, John.

837
01:34:48,298 --> 01:34:51,098
Now that I'm not in the military,
I don't have to salute you.

838
01:34:51,637 --> 01:34:55,441
I won't miss your salute, colonel,
but I'll miss you, John.

839
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:56,602
All right.

840
01:34:56,781 --> 01:34:58,375
Let's go.

841
01:35:01,556 --> 01:36:11,085
THE END
