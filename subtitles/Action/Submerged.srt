1
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:40,044
Imagine if you could sear images
straight into the brain's neocortex.

2
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:43,581
Imagine if you could sear images
straight into the brain's neocortex.

3
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,742
You'd only process incoming
information...

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,285
...the way I programmed you.

5
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,650
You'd only process
incoming information...

6
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:54,158
...the way I programmed you.
I speak, you listen. I order...

7
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,126
...you obey.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,125
Mind control.

9
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,134
How about some doughnuts?

10
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,737
If you buy, I'll have
two glazed and a jelly roll.

11
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,407
Ambassador, first images
are in from the Predator...

12
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,476
...at the Calderón Vilas Naval Base
on the Atlantic coast.

13
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,580
Got any confirmation on the presence
of an underground lab?

14
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:29,547
Halt!

15
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,586
Halt! Stop it.

16
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:37,458
Halt.

17
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:44,496
Stay inside.
The Americans are watching.

18
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,232
Don't presume to give me orders.

19
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:52,240
Predator detects subterranean
venting either side of this entrance.

20
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,347
The catchment dam
must be their cover.

21
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:56,608
Somewhere under there is our lab.

22
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:10,721
Fire. Fire. Fire!

23
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,770
What's going on in there?

24
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:23,775
This guy may be able to tell us.
He showed up a few months ago.

25
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,505
That's the best angle
we've been able to get on him.

26
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:29,478
And those who have power
give orders.

27
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,242
You sought my protection.

28
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,753
So never forget that you
answer to me now. Okay?

29
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:39,086
Oh, I think of very little else.

30
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:41,958
Fucker.

31
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,226
I mean, Hilan is just
an old-school warlord...

32
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,235
...overthrowing governments,
setting up firing squads.

33
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:55,899
So, what does this mystery guy offer
Hilan that he can't do for himself?

34
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:52,332
I need to tell the director something.

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,297
Maybe it's a local drug cartel.

36
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:59,405
All right. So the local drug cartel
bribes three Secret Service agents...

37
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,632
...to murder the ambassador?

38
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,369
- And then they shoot each other.
- No one bribed them.

39
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:09,540
They didn't have to. Autopsies
just came in. We got trouble.

40
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,818
Your mind processes information
in a descending order.

41
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,148
Sound and image
are at the head of the line.

42
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:19,390
Now, imagine if you could sear images
straight into the brain's neocortex.

43
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:23,757
Once these relays are triggered...
Maybe a code word or even a sound.

44
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:27,633
- You'd process incoming information
the way I programmed you to.

45
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:32,367
- I'm not getting this.
- Mind control, Mick.

46
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,744
Hey, dumb-ass, I think
we'd all appreciate it...

47
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,352
...if you kept your hands
away from the explosives.

48
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,921
- What do you say there, champ?
- Keeping it warm for you, Plowden.

49
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,899
- Hey, Hammond.
- Yeah, buddy?

50
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,369
- Keep an eye on friendly fire, will you?
- Sure thing.

51
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,466
Thanks, man.

52
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,177
How are you
holding up there, colonel?

53
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:16,172
I'm good.

54
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,723
Hey, Plowden.

55
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,489
I got a shitty feeling
about this one, man.

56
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,624
Well, that puts me
at ease, John. Jesus.

57
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,630
Come on.
We've been over this.

58
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,064
All right?
You checked it out. We're cool.

59
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:38,636
Look, I'm just missing my boy.

60
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,904
I know you are.

61
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:47,707
But listen, he's at home, safe and
sound, waiting for you to get back.

62
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,840
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,416
What about you? You get in touch
with Kathy before we took off?

64
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,113
Yeah.

65
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,623
Yeah, I tried calling,
but she didn't pick up.

66
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,490
I don't know.
Probably at her mother's.

67
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,097
- Or banging the neighbor.
- Or banging the neighbor.

68
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,599
Hey.

69
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,534
Come on, we're going in clean.
You know this.

70
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,768
No personals. All right?

71
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,820
Delta, ready to go.

72
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,752
Take care of this for me, please.

73
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:38,629
Jack Lord, come in.

74
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,456
Come in.

75
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,067
- Yo.
- Are we cleared for landing?

76
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:53,374
Red Leader, everything is clear.
Come join the party.

77
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:54,639
Roger that.

78
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:09,590
Lock and load, boys. We're on.

79
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,335
All right, let's move. Let's move.
Let's move. Go! Go! Go!

80
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,563
Where the hell
is our ground contact?

81
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,145
A civilian approaching,
100 meters, sir.

82
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:02,610
We've been compromised.

83
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:07,217
Should we call the helo back?

84
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,084
Colonel Sharpe,
what are your orders, sir?

85
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,629
Colonel, your orders.

86
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:27,300
Colonel Sharpe, I need your orders,
sir. She's approaching, sir.

87
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,808
Colonel Sharpe, I repeat,
I need the orders, sir.

88
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,090
Hold it, guys, she's packing.

89
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,891
Sir, she's packing.
Sir, I repeat, she's packing.

90
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,965
I'm taking her out, sir.

91
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,036
- Moss, cover me.
- No, Plowden!

92
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,638
Cease fire. That's an order!

93
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,836
Everybody cease fire.
Put your guns down.

94
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:42,248
- Guns down.
- Get down. Get down.

95
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,710
Get down.

96
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,589
There you go.

97
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,127
Can you see her, Plowden?

98
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,097
Yeah.

99
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,865
It's your wife.

100
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,502
On the edge of the cliff.

101
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,067
She needs your help, Plowden.

102
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:44,901
Do you wanna save her life?

103
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,405
No matter what it takes?

104
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:52,946
Then you have to remember
this moment when we speak next.

105
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,525
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

106
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:00,954
Very good.

107
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,092
This is three-five-niner
from Rieback Naval Prison.

108
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,166
Requesting permission to land.

109
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,792
What's the matter, Cody?
You forget how to salute?

110
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:38,624
Well, that's kind of frowned on where
I come from, down in the stockades.

111
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,934
You got mail.

112
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,940
We need it to disappear.

113
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,442
Oh, I see.

114
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,612
Let me ask you a question.

115
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,983
What kind of damn fool
do you think I am? I'm still in prison...

116
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:03,281
...for doing the same thing you're
about to ask me to do again.

117
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:07,160
You really wanna spend the rest
of your life in jail?

118
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,129
What about your family?

119
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,357
They're gone.

120
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,303
And your crew?

121
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,900
What about my crew?

122
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:22,701
I have the authority
to grant all of you a full pardon.

123
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,908
- Full pardon?
- A full pardon.

124
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,547
- And 100,000 a piece.
- All right, 100 grand each.

125
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:32,349
Covers crimes and back taxes.

126
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,747
- Who this?
- Target of interest.

127
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:40,257
Someone who we need
terminated on sight.

128
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:44,158
That's just terrible. I don't do things
like that. What if he not there?

129
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:47,391
Oh, he's there.
Along with five prisoners.

130
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:50,230
We need them brought back
for debriefing.

131
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,497
- Why?
- Because they might turn out...

132
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:57,269
...like some of your boys, Cody.
Thorns in America's side.

133
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,906
Who the fuck is this?

134
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,243
Agent Fletcher. He's along
for the ride, but you're in charge.

135
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,784
I'm tagging along to make sure you
get coffee and a change of clothes.

136
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,553
Where my crew?

137
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:07,346
Long time, sir.

138
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,940
I see you're not
wearing any handcuffs.

139
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,643
Yeah, well, I don't want you
to make any assumption...

140
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,153
...on what I've done
to get out of the handcuffs.

141
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,017
Is this gonna be like old times?

142
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,356
You gotta live
to talk about old times.

143
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,424
So why is the president giving us
our freedom and a Colt.45?

144
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,032
You wanna stay in jail
and be buttfucked?

145
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,703
When I'm out of these shackles,
you'll be buttfucked...

146
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,771
...you cocksucking
wop motherfucker.

147
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:37,468
Listen, Uncle Sam needs us.

148
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:42,812
What that means is, he got something
sensitive that has to be done.

149
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:47,317
And if we do it right,
we're all free and a lot richer.

150
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,889
If we do it wrong,
ain't nobody know nothing.

151
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,957
And we're supposed
to trust you again?

152
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,029
Look, it's easy, you know.
You can come with me...

153
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,495
...we do it right,
we get out, we're free.

154
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,403
Or you could stay in jail
and get romantic with your boyfriend.

155
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,497
And what if we just take off?

156
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,474
- Yeah, what about that?
- What, and you gonna miss the party?

157
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,775
Come on.

158
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:25,080
Colonel Cody, I'm Dr. Susan Chappell.
I'm with the psychological unit.

159
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,816
Orders are to grab what's
useful from Lehder's lab...

160
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,259
...and destroy everything else.
- Big orders.

161
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,557
Well, she's your problem now.

162
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:38,560
Shouldn't you warn Cody's men about
what happened to the first team?

163
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:40,206
They're expendable.

164
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,605
And in case the agency
didn't let you know, so are we.

165
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:45,106
You ready?

166
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:48,577
- Let's go kill somebody.
- Okay. Let's boogie.

167
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,614
Nice uniform, Cody.

168
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,482
- What's in the bag?
- Apart from my condoms...

169
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:32,284
...probably enough explosives to blow
that dam from here to kingdom come.

170
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,996
All right, steady it down there,
right there.

171
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:48,403
The Clinton's gonna wait
for us outside territorial waters.

172
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,169
If the mission gets compromised,
we're on our own.

173
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:56,178
Well, I'm used to that.
I ain't relying on them, anyway.

174
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:03,486
All right, let's go.

175
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,957
Let's go!

176
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,927
Clear. Come on!

177
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,697
Where are you going?

178
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,903
I thought you wasn't
gonna leave no man behind.

179
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,613
The saying goes, "I don't leave no
man behind that I give a shit about."

180
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:33,309
Damn, Cody. What if there
was an ambush down there...

181
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,785
...and Fletcher isn't a double agent?

182
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,488
We'll never know, will we?

183
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:44,686
Give me Lehder. We got trouble.

184
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:57,335
We've got new coordinates for the
new landing zone closer to the coast.

185
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,708
And it's gonna be right about here.

186
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,367
Take them off.

187
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,508
Come on.

188
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:39,884
Don't worry, you'll get your chance.

189
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,890
Hey, you out on parole
or on the run?

190
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,053
Well, that's decision pending.

191
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:53,727
Are you feeling vengeful, girl?

192
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:55,933
Always.

193
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:58,401
Our new landing zone
should read "Starry Night."

194
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,430
You hear? Starry Night.
You copy that?

195
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:05,273
Yeah, I copy. I'll be there.

196
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,788
Sir, it's from the Hawk.

197
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,295
It's coded.

198
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,062
Who the hell picked
a new landing zone? Harding.

199
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,831
We don't know yet, sir.
Had to be Cody or Fletcher.

200
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,008
- Admiral, are you aware of these?
- Of course I'm aware of them.

201
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,167
They're Cody's old
hard-assed Navy buddies.

202
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,313
That's who Cody wanted,
that's who we gave him.

203
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,781
The same team
he was in prison with.

204
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,082
- He was in prison?
- The Damascus?

205
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,691
We put Cody and his team
onto an allied sub...

206
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,829
...in order to board the
Damascus and to negotiate.

207
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:00,694
The Damascus was loaded with
explosives, enough to take out Oahu.

208
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:03,960
Another 9/11, except at sea.

209
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,163
Then Cody forced the captain
of the sub to torpedo the tanker.

210
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:11,606
- So he disobeyed orders.
- He disobeyed nothing.

211
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,645
Passengers or no passengers,
that tanker was lethal.

212
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,839
And he knew that before any of us.

213
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,678
Then the U.N. Got involved. They
raised the roof, called it a travesty.

214
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:24,585
Cody and his team were put away.
All political bullshit.

215
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,495
Now the question remains is,
what the hell is he up to now?

216
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:54,853
Gentlemen, this is Damita, one
of the best field ops in the business.

217
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:58,718
- Hey, girl, how are you doing?
- Been a long time, Cody. Too long.

218
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,901
You said the Americans
wouldn't send in another team.

219
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:15,405
And killing their ambassador
was your stupid idea!

220
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,271
Product tested.

221
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:25,343
The only gratification
a scientist ever receives.

222
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,253
Now another team
of Americans has landed.

223
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:35,017
I don't know where,
but they'll be coming here.

224
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,161
For that.

225
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,658
Our devices are portable...

226
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,529
...if you travel with the blueprints.

227
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,573
And they'll be coming here for you.

228
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:51,876
Plowden...

229
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,879
...I'm feeling threatened.

230
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,557
You know what happens
to you if I die?

231
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,424
Can't say I'm not curious.

232
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:13,730
How about you, Plowden?

233
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:19,129
Are you gonna let this man
push your family over the edge?

234
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,471
I'm not the war criminal here.

235
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:26,340
No, you're just an old soldier
who wants to rule his country.

236
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:32,810
And needs me to make sure
somebody somewhere is listening.

237
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,814
By the way...

238
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,919
...how much is America
offering for your head?

239
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:43,862
A little too late for that,
don't you think?

240
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,721
Considering my value now.

241
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,169
Oh, and if you're looking
for Americans, general...

242
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,370
...try walking the corridors.

243
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,532
At ease, soldier.

244
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:18,895
Cab's outside.

245
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:21,327
A little late, don't you think?

246
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,866
What about Sharpe
and the other prisoners?

247
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:27,564
Don't worry about them.
They're my Trojan horse.

248
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,238
Three men running a submarine?

249
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,271
You said you could
run this on your own.

250
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,910
- O'Hearn, engine room.
- I know, I know.

251
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:43,616
Jesus, this is all in Spanish.

252
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,410
Welcome to my world, ése.

253
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,784
In case Cody's team turns up,
I've arranged for Hilan's army...

254
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,552
...to give them a welcome,
South American style.

255
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,221
She's got him.

256
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,057
All right, no noise or we're gonna have
2000 soldiers crawling up our ass.

257
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,445
The heat from the flames
sears their throats closed.

258
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,172
They can't even scream.

259
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:02,050
Fucking sorry about the splashes.

260
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,988
Alligator, I see some people change
in prison, but I don't think you do.

261
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,562
Sometimes change isn't
such a good thing, Cody.

262
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:14,497
Well, that's true.

263
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,632
Let's take this place.

264
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:49,786
O'Hearn, what's going on
down there? I need some power.

265
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,954
Okay, well, it's a fucking antique.

266
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,876
There's some sick shit
up in here, Alligator.

267
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:15,346
Come on, hurry up.

268
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,499
Cody, we got trouble.
There's a fucking army coming at us.

269
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,832
All right, Alligator, get
the prisoners out the cages.

270
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,200
- Get them in the sub.
- You got it.

271
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,072
You got 10 minutes, then get your
white ass out of here, you hear me?

272
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,411
Get these men down from here.

273
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:49,414
Good idea. Did you even think
they might be terrorists?

274
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,054
Just do it.

275
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,942
Doc, we need you in here right away.

276
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,220
Shit.

277
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:30,092
- I guess Lehder got away, huh?
- Get these men down from here.

278
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,199
Hilan.

279
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,072
Double-crossing son of a bitch.

280
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,838
- Help me.
- Fucking hell.

281
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:21,536
Tell me you're Father Christmas.

282
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:26,016
- Help me.
- Shit.

283
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,263
Now I want some answers.

284
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:48,073
Hurry up, they're breaking through.

285
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:59,776
Go, go. Come on.
Move. Let's go.

286
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,983
Motherfucker!

287
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:21,737
Fuck them.

288
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,875
Damita.

289
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:36,080
Here, catch.

290
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,821
Come on.

291
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,295
You all right?

292
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:21,050
Come on,
I ain't no fucking babysitter.

293
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:43,509
- We're submerged.
- So are they.

294
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,865
Keys.

295
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,672
Who the fuck are these guys?

296
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,537
Henry, tell my boys to turn in their
weapons to the armory, you hear?

297
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,875
Okay. Yes, Lu.

298
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,846
You're not in South Central now.

299
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,354
Yours, please, Chief.

300
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:32,125
Chappell. Cheers.
You too, John Wayne.

301
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,193
Yes, sir.

302
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,036
- Thank you.
- O'Hearn, give me flank speed.

303
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,732
We need to get this tub moving.

304
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,638
Cody, I need to talk to you.

305
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:51,908
Yes, ma'am. Chief?

306
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:53,881
Point this bitch to international.

307
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,082
So tell me, what do you got?

308
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,723
You know what
our orders were, Cody.

309
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:06,056
Yes. And as far as I'm concerned,
it was mission accomplished.

310
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,393
We went in there, destroyed the base,
and took all the prisoners.

311
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:13,170
No, you didn't.
Lehder's still on the loose.

312
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:16,101
Well, that's no business of mine.

313
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,635
Well, it should be.

314
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:23,109
This is the reason
they wanted me to tag along.

315
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:25,806
Lucky Hilan wasn't the friend
Lehder thought he was.

316
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,316
What's on this?

317
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,977
It contains all the files
related to Lehder's work.

318
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:33,488
Take a look at it, see if you can
access it. It might explain a lot.

319
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,594
Don't lose it, it may be
the only thing that keeps you alive.

320
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,429
Then let's just hope
this don't kill both of us.

321
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,295
Just keep the data disk safe.

322
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,664
I wouldn't count on that pardon
if you lose it.

323
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,931
You ain't lying about that.

324
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,802
Hey, Luis.

325
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,502
Float that radio buoy.

326
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:18,460
On a ship full of scary guys, I think
us girls should be comparing notes.

327
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:21,731
- Ain't that right, Henry?
- Whatever.

328
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:31,010
Chance of a threesome, girls?

329
00:38:34,753 --> 00:38:36,618
So, what are you really doing here?

330
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:39,681
That's classified information.

331
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:48,031
- You ever killed anyone?
- The day ain't over yet.

332
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:50,835
What, so you think you know how?

333
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:55,169
No. But I'm sure
you're gonna show me.

334
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,898
Well, here's my knife.

335
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:02,441
So why don't you try and stab me,
then we'll take turns.

336
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,058
Lesson one: I don't like secrets.

337
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,233
Lesson two:
I've known Cody a long time.

338
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,909
My turn now.

339
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:47,581
Lesson three:
Don't judge a book by its cover.

340
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,822
And five years in the Marine Corps
doesn't hurt either.

341
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:07,078
Sir, sonar's picking up
sub movement.

342
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:11,273
Oberon class, twin screws...

343
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,509
...front and rear tubes, 25 clicks.

344
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,783
Let me guess. Point of departure,
drop point Bravo.

345
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,516
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,464
How is he?

347
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,166
If you need help,
I'll be in the engine room.

348
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,776
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:45,935
- Something's not right.
- I know.

350
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:49,176
The drill is, it's not over
until they say so.

351
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,841
I wrote that book,
y'all stealing my copy.

352
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:57,419
Well, I'll be babysitting the guns
if you want me, okay?

353
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:28,385
Is there a problem?

354
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,249
Well, yeah, kind of.

355
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:37,293
Tell me. Tell me, tell me.
Why do I feel so strange?

356
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:39,591
What do you know
about Kelin Dyle...

357
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:43,165
...and what's that got to do with
the terrorists we've got on this sub?

358
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,495
The guys in sick bay
aren't terrorists.

359
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,929
They were the first strike team
sent to get Lehder.

360
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:51,499
They were soldiers. Just like you.

361
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:53,775
Good soldiers.

362
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,442
These are our guys?

363
00:42:57,816 --> 00:43:01,183
Tell me. Why am I
chaining up good soldiers?

364
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,752
Because they're not. Not anymore.

365
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,446
You can do it.

366
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:09,889
- Lehder's brainwashed them.
- Come on. Come on, now.

367
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:13,963
They're the enemy now.
And there's no going back.

368
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,409
Why didn't you tell us?
It was all about brainwashing?

369
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:31,447
- Need-to-know basis.
- You know the sick part about that is?

370
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:34,108
I need to know.
I needed to know a long time ago.

371
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,970
Find my boys, bring them down here.
I have to brief everybody.

372
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,502
Fine.

373
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:55,371
You done?

374
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,877
Let's sink this sub.

375
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:15,683
You trust this putita?

376
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:20,058
O'Hearn, what's going on?
We're still not running on full power.

377
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:23,029
I'm going upstairs
to check the ballast.

378
00:44:25,504 --> 00:44:26,766
O'Hearn.

379
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,008
O'Hearn.

380
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,168
I don't understand. If they're not
terrorists, why didn't they tell us?

381
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:37,975
I think we're all expendable.
Just like the first boys that came in.

382
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:39,514
O'Hearn.

383
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:44,585
O'Hearn.

384
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,685
I'm thinking about taking
that A-team group...

385
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,489
...throwing them in the Zodiac,
and pointing them towards the Clinton.

386
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,440
I think we're gonna have to
get off this sub.

387
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:11,905
Get the boys, bring them all here,
we'll take a vote.

388
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,779
You got my vote.

389
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,463
Fuck. We're all gonna drown
on this piece of shit.

390
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,081
What are you, fucking lost?

391
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:30,291
Don't you move.
Don't you fucking move.

392
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,381
Cocksucker motherfucker.

393
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,029
I'm taking over this sub.

394
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,761
Well, then you just
gonna have to kill me, I guess.

395
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,597
What a shame.

396
00:48:33,618 --> 00:48:35,449
Use it or lose it.

397
00:48:35,654 --> 00:48:37,849
U.S.S. Clinton, U.S.S. Clinton,
do you hear me?

398
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:40,080
Change the course. Bring us down.

399
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,027
- You heard him.
- I ain't no fucking brave guy.

400
00:48:44,262 --> 00:48:45,957
Why, you fucking pricks.

401
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:48,928
U.S.S. Clinton, this is Alcatraz.
Do you copy me?

402
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,467
Lehder's men are on the loose and
in control of this sub. Do you copy?

403
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:55,231
Do you think you know how
to steer a submarine?

404
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,043
Can she?

405
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:04,738
Now. Submerge this fucking sub.

406
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:22,856
U.S.S. Clinton, do you copy?

407
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:27,129
Operation Alcatraz, please stand by.
We're locking into your coordinates.

408
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:40,079
Cody.

409
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:46,915
I radioed the Clinton.
I told them about Lehder's men.

410
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:48,656
You did what?

411
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,193
You might've just signed
our death certificate.

412
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:56,231
Cody or no Cody,
Lehder's men must not dock that sub.

413
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:58,868
If it surfaces, launch.

414
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,354
Alcatraz, do you copy?

415
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,188
- No response, sir.
- Oh, shit.

416
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,091
Get back.

417
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,528
Bring her up. Save the sub.

418
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,434
Do it now.

419
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:41,744
Elvis, that's the last man
you'll ever fucking kill.

420
00:50:41,947 --> 00:50:43,437
- He's moving the sub.
- What are you doing?

421
00:50:43,615 --> 00:50:46,049
Nothing. The poor guy's dying.
I'm trying to help.

422
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,082
Get away from there.

423
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,886
Why are we going up?

424
00:50:57,762 --> 00:50:59,320
Nine hundred feet and rising.

425
00:50:59,497 --> 00:51:03,433
- Submarine is beginning to surface.
- Prepare to lock and launch.

426
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:08,497
I said, take her down.

427
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,307
Do it or you'll all die.

428
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:29,519
Prepare to launch.

429
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,398
I'll go get a lifeboat.

430
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:54,908
- Alligator, we got three minutes.
- Aye, aye, sir.

431
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:57,945
Do it.

432
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:23,811
Two minutes.

433
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:01,076
Oh, man.

434
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:04,551
Well, I suppose it's better
than rotting in prison.

435
00:53:04,756 --> 00:53:06,621
Well...

436
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:09,559
...I guess there's three of them
buried out at sea.

437
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,636
Inform the White House.
Situation contained.

438
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:25,708
Yes, sir.

439
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:34,045
- So where's my money?
- Money?

440
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:36,915
Yeah, what we agreed on
for my cooperation.

441
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,717
Half now,
half on achieving your objective.

442
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:44,623
We'll discuss it when we get inside.

443
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:12,253
Who do you think assigns what those
satellites see? Nobody's watching us.

444
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:17,326
- Maybe you forgot, Ari. You're dead.
- I didn't forget.

445
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,187
Hope they don't.

446
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:23,863
So if you're dead...

447
00:54:24,502 --> 00:54:26,993
...I'll show you around.

448
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:28,866
So thanks for the ride.

449
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,472
There's one for take.

450
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:45,148
That pressure on your neck,
from here on in...

451
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,952
...that'll be your new boss, Sandrow,
tugging on your chain.

452
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:51,823
Oh, you're not important.
Why doesn't that surprise me?

453
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:53,827
I'm just a scout poaching the talent.

454
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:55,329
- Fletcher.
- What?

455
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:57,398
Guess who just showed up
at El-Diablo.

456
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:59,068
- Cody?
- Yes, sir.

457
00:54:59,237 --> 00:55:02,695
- Oh, Jesus.
- A tug on your chain, Fletcher?

458
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:04,841
Except he doesn't just tug.

459
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:10,978
There's a demonstration at the plaza.

460
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,583
I'll make sure our driver makes
a detour right into the middle of it.

461
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:17,744
Can you get someone to meet them
when they get there?

462
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:21,085
That's why I get the big bucks.

463
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:24,387
I love working with professionals.

464
00:55:26,164 --> 00:55:28,155
On that disk,
I saw the name of a company.

465
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,392
- Kelin Dyle in Montevideo.
- So what?

466
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:35,129
Let me tell you something.
When he finds out we got the disk...

467
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,275
...he's gonna come hunting for us.

468
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:42,504
- So where are we going?
- Hunting for him.

469
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,245
Are you ready
to dance with the devil?

470
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,543
Already have,
on too many occasions.

471
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:26,617
Dr. Adrian Lehder, allow me to present
Señor Albertos Sandrow.

472
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:30,191
Dr. Lehder,
welcome to Fantasy Island.

473
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:33,421
I hope everything
is to your satisfaction.

474
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,624
We carried out your instructions
to the letter.

475
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:44,939
Your living quarters are down the hall.
I trust you will find them comfortable.

476
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:50,513
You know, that is
what the general said to me...

477
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:53,980
...just before America
blew that dam over my head.

478
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,112
Well, governments tend to
overreact to risk.

479
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:02,953
Corporations, we see
potential earnings.

480
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:05,095
Even when they're from
the same country?

481
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,289
I don't vote.

482
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:10,364
Officially.

483
00:57:10,935 --> 00:57:12,994
And that's the problem.

484
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:18,199
Because our newly elected president
is no friend of big business.

485
00:57:18,376 --> 00:57:22,142
This young lady
is a very valuable commodity.

486
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,372
She's engaged to el presidente.

487
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:28,881
- We need her back within the hour.
- Enjoy, doctor.

488
00:57:31,022 --> 00:57:33,115
Get her on the machine.

489
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,908
This Lehder. What do you think?
Is he a man we can trust?

490
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:59,009
Absolutely not.

491
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:02,812
He won't take orders.
We need someone more pliable.

492
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:04,318
Someone we can work with.

493
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:09,688
I think Cody and his crew surviving
may have just solved our problem.

494
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,920
- I don't understand.
- Leave him to me.

495
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:15,088
I need you
to bring in Susan Chappell.

496
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:16,857
Alive.

497
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,373
So, what's that?

498
00:58:56,541 --> 00:59:01,740
It's a derivative of scopolamine.
Nazis used it as a truth serum.

499
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:06,873
It causes disorientation.
Paralysis at very high dosage.

500
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,953
I use it as a primer before subjects
are prepped for mind conditioning.

501
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:15,058
Slow it down. Sandrow told me
to take down detailed notes.

502
00:59:15,226 --> 00:59:16,853
- Sure, go ahead.
- Okay.

503
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:20,362
But I doubt you'll remember it.

504
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:42,249
You know, I kind of like
that we're walking into a full-scale riot.

505
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,878
Kind of gives us a distraction, don't it?
They're beating on each other.

506
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,149
Just like a real
English soccer match, huh?

507
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:51,122
I don't know. I never seen
any English soccer match...

508
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:54,264
...but you can bet your life
there's somebody close to us...

509
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:56,127
...orchestrating this whole thing.

510
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:57,801
And I'm just willing to bet...

511
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,700
...some of Lehder's men are waiting
for us somewhere around this plaza.

512
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:07,433
- So, what you got in mind now, Cody?
- You know something, Henry...

513
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,512
...it's either, let them come for us
or we go for them.

514
01:00:10,681 --> 01:00:14,208
They already took their shot.
I say we go for them.

515
01:00:14,418 --> 01:00:17,819
- I second that.
- But I'll tell you one thing:

516
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:22,216
If you wanna catch some catfish,
you gonna have to have some bait.

517
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:07,031
I got him. First floor, 12 o'clock.

518
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:10,370
- You see that?
- Got him.

519
01:01:11,475 --> 01:01:13,739
- Do your thing.
- Okay.

520
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:26,583
Lehder.

521
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,387
It's your boy Plowden at the hotel.

522
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,689
He has Cody in his sights. He won't
listen to me. Deal with him.

523
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:37,129
- Is this transmission fully encrypted?
- It's a satellite telephone.

524
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:40,998
Of course it's encrypted.
Just give the fucking order.

525
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:52,078
Listen to me, Plowden.

526
01:01:52,283 --> 01:01:55,013
Do you wanna help your wife
on the cliff edge?

527
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:59,912
- What do you want me to do?
- You have to take out this Cody.

528
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:02,523
You got it.

529
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:13,297
- Happy?
- I will be when Cody's dead.

530
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:16,440
You let me know
as soon as that goes down.

531
01:02:19,744 --> 01:02:21,302
I can see the woman.

532
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:28,947
You're coming with us. Understand?

533
01:02:29,153 --> 01:02:31,314
Hey. What are you doing?

534
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:33,923
Hey. Hey!

535
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:36,988
Everybody stand down, stand down.

536
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,596
Safe house, 1300.

537
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:06,215
I'm guessing you're not room service.

538
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,018
So you also have brains.

539
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,288
What's gonna be
your next move, soldier?

540
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:18,958
Do you think I'm here
to play fucking chess?

541
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,070
Finish this.

542
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,777
Check-fucking-mate.

543
01:04:16,927 --> 01:04:18,292
How's everybody doing?

544
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:23,062
Don't worry about Chappell.
The U.S. Will take care of her.

545
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:25,565
Fletcher's been showing interest
in Kelin Dyle.

546
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,931
- Kelin Dyle?
- A local technology-based company.

547
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:31,165
Owned by a guy called Sandrow.

548
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:34,367
Damn. That name just won't quit.

549
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:36,569
What's a private company
want with Lehder?

550
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,043
What do we care?

551
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,309
We care because we don't know
who Lehder might've got to.

552
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:44,453
We have to finish this ourselves.
We already know too much.

553
01:04:44,688 --> 01:04:47,384
They're not gonna stop
till we've been terminated.

554
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:48,582
Terminated?

555
01:04:54,632 --> 01:04:55,929
I know that knock.

556
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:00,570
- What'd I miss?
- Trouble.

557
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:03,934
Thought you might like this.

558
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,633
In case you need to reach out
and touch someone.

559
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:08,108
We may have to do that.

560
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:11,907
Luis, think you can decode
this satellite phone?

561
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:15,118
A beer, sweetheart. I'm spitting
fucking feathers over here.

562
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:17,651
- Get it yourself.
- Have you met Cat?

563
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:20,653
She's one of our operatives.

564
01:05:21,225 --> 01:05:23,022
So, what do you mean,
we got trouble?

565
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,023
This here's an intel report.

566
01:05:25,262 --> 01:05:28,254
Fletcher's already made contact
with the new ambassador.

567
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,763
Ain't that a bitch?

568
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,525
So, what can we do?

569
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:34,101
Well, I got a little idea.
It's not much, but...

570
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,535
I'll pay the ambassador a visit.
Let's hope...

571
01:05:36,774 --> 01:05:39,436
...Fletcher hasn't introduced him
to Lehder yet.

572
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,009
And if he has?

573
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:28,291
You have a visitor.

574
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:41,696
Dr. Chappell,
my name is Ron Higgins.

575
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,601
I'm the new U.S. Ambassador.

576
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,837
Posted here after that incident
at the embassy.

577
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:52,812
- Is there somewhere we can talk?
- Yes, there is. My car's outside.

578
01:07:13,604 --> 01:07:15,128
I have Cody in my sights.

579
01:07:15,372 --> 01:07:17,704
What do you want me to do?

580
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,239
Lehder, it's for you.

581
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:20,774
Hang up!

582
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,746
Fool.

583
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,975
What the hell are you doing?

584
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:31,783
Admiral Burgess got
an EP-3 spy plane circling in the sky.

585
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:34,253
Who do you think
he's just picked up on radar?

586
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:38,458
Lehder.

587
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:42,121
First you better tell the admiral
that Agent Fletcher's a traitor.

588
01:07:42,766 --> 01:07:44,734
And that Adrian Lehder's
on the loose.

589
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:46,761
Thank you.

590
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:51,673
Actually, Lehder's pretty tied up
right now.

591
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:55,941
And "traitor" is a little harsh.

592
01:07:56,146 --> 01:07:59,912
- Where was the signal pinned to?
- A security-compound office-complex.

593
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,245
- Right here, sir.
- We have satellite overview?

594
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:06,082
It's not on the grid. It's been classified
off-limits by Agent Fletcher.

595
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,587
Fletcher.

596
01:08:08,826 --> 01:08:12,762
You didn't kill the ambassador for
taking those surveillance photographs.

597
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,128
No, we had to kill her...

598
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,427
...because she didn't understand
how we do business down here.

599
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:20,133
Business?

600
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,135
You're staying alive, doctor.

601
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:26,299
My way, you can let us know
how Lehder's doing his job properly.

602
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,809
Their way, it's a shovel
and bag of lime outside town.

603
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:32,005
You think about it.

604
01:08:39,723 --> 01:08:42,021
Ambassador, do you know
who owns that building?

605
01:08:42,192 --> 01:08:45,457
I don't know what company owns
the compound you're talking about.

606
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:48,621
You want me to wake the president
and ask him?

607
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,131
No. Do nothing until I call you back.

608
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:55,164
How do you like my new office?

609
01:08:55,372 --> 01:08:56,703
Spending taxpayers' money?

610
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:59,809
Don't worry, they won't miss it.
Please, after you.

611
01:08:59,977 --> 01:09:03,174
So you're gonna hand-feed Lehder.

612
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:07,909
That's what you sold them on,
Fletcher? Damn, you're good.

613
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:10,553
Don't worry, guys.
I'll take it from here.

614
01:09:35,112 --> 01:09:37,979
Mr. Ambassador, I'm Cody.
I think you've been expecting me.

615
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:39,740
- Yeah, you're late.
- Yeah.

616
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:42,511
I just hit country
and got kind of busy.

617
01:09:42,686 --> 01:09:45,382
But you might wanna
give me a minute of your time.

618
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:47,113
Sorry, we're late for the opera.

619
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:50,383
What I have to say is a little more
important than the opera.

620
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:52,562
- Excuse me.
- Does the name Kelin Dyle...

621
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,755
...mean anything to you?

622
01:09:56,934 --> 01:09:58,401
Okay.

623
01:09:58,802 --> 01:10:03,569
You don't sell big business,
you excite them.

624
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,770
Mind control.
Hell, they were salivating.

625
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:10,946
- You should've seen the retainer.
- Kind of Ionely being dead, though.

626
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,878
You know, if I had the option...

627
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,917
What did I just say about a hard sell?

628
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:20,823
If it excites you.

629
01:10:21,225 --> 01:10:24,717
Yeah, the thought of you
excites me, only...

630
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:29,660
...you never know what you might've
picked up on that submarine.

631
01:10:32,803 --> 01:10:36,136
We have reason to believe you've
been exposed to certain information.

632
01:10:36,306 --> 01:10:39,241
If you were in contact with Fletcher,
a known double agent...

633
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:41,900
...they probably will remove you
from your post.

634
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,272
I appreciate the heads-up.

635
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:46,915
What do you want me to do?

636
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,177
I need to take your place
at the opera beside Sandrow.

637
01:10:51,555 --> 01:10:55,423
If there's anything else I can do,
just let me know.

638
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:56,957
There might be something.

639
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,168
Welcome to Hollywood Squares.
After you, doctor.

640
01:11:11,008 --> 01:11:12,703
Brought you a present, Lehder.

641
01:11:12,943 --> 01:11:16,106
She's a fan. Been studying your work
since boot camp.

642
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,216
Thought you might be able to
persuade her to join our happy team.

643
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:23,442
You want me to train
my own replacement?

644
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:27,654
What, is my job being outsourced?

645
01:11:27,858 --> 01:11:30,656
Looks like you've been busy, doctor.

646
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,626
You really underestimate me, Fletcher.

647
01:11:53,717 --> 01:11:57,414
So tell me, Henry. We get given
money to go shopping, yet...

648
01:11:57,654 --> 01:12:01,317
...you decide to dress down like
a homeless man to get into the opera.

649
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:03,686
- And that's your plan.
- Listen, my friend.

650
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:06,886
Only queers and penguins
go to watch the fucking opera.

651
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:11,528
If you need to fucking dress up
as a penguin to get in, that's fine.

652
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,229
I got a reputation to think of,
so I'll stick to the back door, all right?

653
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,873
I know your reputation, ése.

654
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:21,374
- You're a back-door man.
- Come on, fellas. We're late already.

655
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,376
Hey, step on it.

656
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,249
I'm in.

657
01:12:32,422 --> 01:12:35,448
I've got into the Kelin Dyle
business account.

658
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:40,756
There's upward of
250 million dollars.

659
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:45,265
Think of the research I could fund
with that money.

660
01:12:45,435 --> 01:12:49,633
Bad news, Lehder.
Cody has the data disk.

661
01:12:49,806 --> 01:12:53,264
All your files, your little experiments.

662
01:12:53,443 --> 01:12:55,968
Looks like the hunt's gonna continue.

663
01:12:56,179 --> 01:12:59,114
That's why I decided to retire.

664
01:12:59,283 --> 01:13:02,309
Sandrow thinks I'm taking care
of his little political problems.

665
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:03,919
That's just a diversion.

666
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,063
Are you ready
to transfer those funds?

667
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:18,792
Yes, I'm on it.

668
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:22,961
Cody's missing, but his team is still
with our man, heading for the opera.

669
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:28,635
- So take care of it.
- Pulling on your chain now, doctor.

670
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:31,076
He's always been two steps behind.

671
01:13:31,248 --> 01:13:34,979
By the time the fat lady sings,
I'll be long gone.

672
01:13:35,152 --> 01:13:37,950
And what if Cody gets to Sandrow
before you do?

673
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:43,081
What? You think he's gonna waltz in
through the front door?

674
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,439
Mr. Ambassador. I'm so glad
you could make it tonight.

675
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,105
Madam.

676
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:24,830
Mr. President.

677
01:14:42,486 --> 01:14:43,510
Mr. President.

678
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:47,088
- Ambassador Higgins.
- Honored to be here this afternoon.

679
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,315
Madam.

680
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:54,291
I understand you are working
with some of our big corporations.

681
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:55,931
Oh, you mean like Kelin Dyle.

682
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,365
That planned expansion
is troublesome.

683
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:04,803
You're sitting in the same box
with Sandrow, the owner.

684
01:15:06,076 --> 01:15:07,236
Tell him...

685
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:13,449
...I will discuss the ethics of this
with him later.

686
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:24,051
What the fuck is he doing?

687
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:29,889
- Shit.
- We're being fucked.

688
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,695
Get off of the fucking steering wheel.
Go, get over there with him.

689
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,735
We're being fucked here.

690
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:40,137
Luis, get it.

691
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:47,605
Just relax.

692
01:16:52,215 --> 01:16:53,512
Get it.

693
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,819
Get us out of here!

694
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:10,959
Luis, get us out of here.

695
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,933
Fuck, there!

696
01:17:45,602 --> 01:17:48,662
- Who are you?
- A friend of a couple of your friends.

697
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:52,000
I was wondering if we could have
a frank discussion for a moment.

698
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:53,840
By all means.

699
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:58,104
I was wondering
what a man like you...

700
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:02,783
...would be doing getting into business
with a man like Lehder.

701
01:18:03,987 --> 01:18:06,114
Isn't that kind of dangerous for you?

702
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:08,257
We all woke up in a world...

703
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:13,025
...where it was more cost-effective...

704
01:18:13,196 --> 01:18:18,429
...to control public opinion
rather than cater to it.

705
01:18:19,102 --> 01:18:20,763
That's a good answer.

706
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:26,267
I, too, have always been impressed
with the mind-control program, but...

707
01:18:26,443 --> 01:18:29,640
...what's much worse is when
private enterprise gets involved...

708
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:32,782
...and uses this kind of thing
for their own agenda.

709
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,056
That's when I get called in.

710
01:18:41,124 --> 01:18:42,785
You've now become poison.

711
01:18:43,293 --> 01:18:46,023
That's why I've been hired.
I'm the antidote.

712
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:01,843
Come on, we gotta watch
Cody's back.

713
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:08,107
Luis. Okay, you're a good boy.

714
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:39,113
Do you think you could call back
a little later?

715
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,284
I need the access codes...

716
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:44,317
...to transfer company funds
into my own account.

717
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:47,820
And I have very limited time
for your response.

718
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:50,956
Look up to your right.

719
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:03,239
- The account code is Alpha 8.
- Alpha 8.

720
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,810
- Delta 6.
- Delta 6.

721
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,376
- One...
- One...

722
01:20:09,612 --> 01:20:11,910
Excuse me just one second.

723
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:15,379
Lehder, why is it that everything
has to be about money?

724
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,919
I'm very disappointed in you.

725
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:34,662
I'll get that money.

726
01:20:36,506 --> 01:20:39,703
The world is full of people
who wanna fund my kind of work.

727
01:20:55,191 --> 01:20:57,284
Ticket, señor.

728
01:20:58,161 --> 01:21:01,153
Here's my fucking ticket.

729
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:40,453
Where's my chopper?

730
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:42,858
Hey, what about the opera?
Call off the drones.

731
01:22:43,032 --> 01:22:44,556
There's no point anymore.

732
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:51,700
No point?

733
01:22:52,308 --> 01:22:55,675
It'll look great on my résumé.

734
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:41,452
I'm one of the good guys.

735
01:24:58,768 --> 01:25:00,395
Come with me.

736
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:13,309
You and I are gonna walk out of here
nice, easy, like we're friends.

737
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:26,324
The chopper is waiting.

738
01:25:27,964 --> 01:25:29,864
Bring her along for the ride.

739
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:31,898
Who knows,
she could come in useful.

740
01:25:32,068 --> 01:25:34,400
Lehder. You can't leave me here.

741
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:37,061
They're gonna blow
this place sky high.

742
01:25:37,306 --> 01:25:39,467
Then let me make this
painless for you.

743
01:25:39,642 --> 01:25:41,633
Set this to overload.

744
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:46,680
You know, I've only had this car
a couple of weeks, you know?

745
01:25:50,553 --> 01:25:52,316
I'll kill you, Lehder.

746
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,198
Come on, move. Move.

747
01:26:20,616 --> 01:26:23,983
You... You can pull up at
the guard station. I'Il... I'll get you in.

748
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:29,551
Stop.

749
01:26:45,641 --> 01:26:48,371
Come on. Where's the girl?
Go get her. Hurry!

750
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,273
Okay, okay.

751
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:56,304
Go on, get out of the car, slick.
Come on, now. You're too slow.

752
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:05,011
No! Stop. Oh, my God. I'm your boss.
I paid your wages.

753
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,466
Come on.

754
01:30:13,115 --> 01:30:15,481
Oh, fuck.

755
01:31:05,034 --> 01:31:08,060
"I don't know, man. These taste
kind of like rabbit poop to me."

756
01:31:08,304 --> 01:31:11,137
And he said, "See, you getting
smart already."

757
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,639
I'd like to make a toast
to our brothers and sisters...

758
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:19,371
...who died like warriors.

759
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,317
Chin-chin.

760
01:31:22,985 --> 01:31:25,647
Luis, tell everybody how long
you were in prison for...

761
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,050
...and what kind of activity
you had in prison.

762
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:30,988
- Bubba? They want a Bubba story?
- Tell them what happened.

763
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,560
You have a
life-changing experience, Luis?

764
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:35,094
Let me just put it like this:

765
01:31:35,297 --> 01:31:38,027
Bubba will never ever
try that again to anybody.

766
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,531
But you know what?

767
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:42,728
How you think he got all that fancy
highfalutin clothes, man?

768
01:31:42,905 --> 01:31:45,499
How you think he got all that money?
