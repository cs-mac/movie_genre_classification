1
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,058
You have reached Gold Coast
Savings and Loan.

2
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:20,396
If you're calling about
a checking account, press one.

3
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,606
Come on, come on.

4
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,908
-You still on hold?
-20 minutes.

5
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,744
lt a felony to shoot a computer?

6
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,909
Only in California.

7
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,373
We show it still
in the computer, sir.

8
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,827
You're telling me some TRW computer
says l bounced a check for $26...

9
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,754
...seven years ago, and now
you won't give me the loan?

10
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:48,005
This is actually stopping me
from getting my condo.

11
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:51,049
-It's marked unpaid.
-l paid the check.

12
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,349
l don't believe it.

13
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,101
They put me on hold.

14
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,266
Cheer up.

15
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,516
You have a visitor.

16
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:00,346
Rita.

17
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:10,063
This is your mail because
it's got your name on it.

18
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,650
My mail is addressed to "occupant"...

19
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,995
...because, Max, l am the
fucking occupant of my place.

20
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:21,160
You, on the other hand,
are no longer an occupant.

21
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:22,875
ls this sinking in?

22
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:26,247
Get your shit out of my place.

23
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,082
Don't do this to me here.

24
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,873
Excuse me, Max.

25
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,132
Sorry if l am disturbing you guys...

26
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,589
...but do l look like a warehouse?

27
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,678
Because this guy thinks l do.

28
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:45,180
He won't get his stuff out,
and you should see what he holds onto.

29
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,226
What?

30
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:47,974
Come here.

31
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,775
Give me a break.

32
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,185
Cut me some slack
on some storage space.

33
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,822
You're out of slacks.
No more slacks for you.

34
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,446
Hey, don't you--

35
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,117
l am not one of your goddamn buddies.

36
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:05,788
l am sick of this.

37
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,704
Gun.

38
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,666
Don't move.
Put the gun down, or he's dead.

39
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,457
Put the gun down.

40
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,048
Don't be a hero.

41
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:24,763
Put that gun down.

42
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,135
Get out of the way.

43
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:29,803
Take it easy.

44
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,478
l am trying to resolve a problem
with my girlfriend...

45
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:34,767
...and you're interrupting.

46
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,096
Ex-girlfriend.

47
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:40,225
So why don't you take the .357,
shove it up your ass...

48
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,028
...and blow your brains out.

49
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:43,648
What you talking about?

50
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:52,742
Motherfucker.

51
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,995
That was probably stupid.

52
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:01,035
Somebody had to get the gun out
of the schmuck's ear, didn't they?

53
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,004
Computer is good for something.

54
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,094
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me.

55
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:23,059
l don't need this shit
in my life, you know?

56
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,561
You know, Max...

57
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,942
...it's really beautiful the way
you two have stayed so close.

58
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:34,906
Next time, shoot him.

59
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:39,114
The next detective who allows
an armed bail bondsman in here...

60
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,913
...does traffic for two months.

61
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:43,247
l am dead serious.

62
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,037
Way to go, Sly.

63
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:50,170
Now that you're all warmed up,
how about room four?

64
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,040
She's a jogger.

65
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:55,003
She caught a stray bullet
on Ocean Drive.

66
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,333
Ocean Drive?

67
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:58,510
Nobody gets shot there.
Too ritzy.

68
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:00,384
You caught me.

69
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:02,590
l am lying.
l like to make shit up.

70
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,100
Come on. Room four.
She's waiting.

71
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,473
Whatever you do, do not
let Hollenbach out of that office.

72
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,065
Order him something to eat.

73
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,766
He'd stay in a burning
building for a free meal.

74
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,227
l will be back in about 30 minutes.

75
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:20,860
l have to go.

76
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,233
Miss McQuean?

77
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,537
Why don't you take a seat.

78
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,738
l am Detective Kirkpatrick.

79
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,042
l need to ask you a few questions
about the shooting.

80
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:38,126
l'd like to help, but l can't
even say if there was a shooting.

81
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:45,007
Kirkpatrick.

82
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,258
Hold on, please.

83
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,265
-lt's for you.
-Thanks.

84
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:58,355
l need my notes on the Juantorena
settlement typed up for my meeting.

85
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,687
You did it already?
You're a lifesaver.

86
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,315
Can you hold on?

87
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,607
Would you mind not smoking?

88
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,815
Sure.

89
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,442
Thanks.

90
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,872
Can you send them over?
l will proof them here.

91
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:22,784
So, Miss McQuean,
l am a little confused.

92
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,838
My report indicates
there were several witnesses--

93
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,084
All l know is a window broke
and l got cut by glass.

94
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,135
l saw a car zoom away,
if that's any help.

95
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,971
Who's on this line?

96
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,096
-Who's this?
-Records. Can you get off the line?

97
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,232
lt's the fax machine.

98
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,106
Thanks.

99
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,982
Sorry for the interruptions.

100
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:56,735
Phones ringing. Faxes coming in.

101
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:01,283
lt's...

102
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:02,903
...for you...

103
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,036
...again.

104
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,083
Can l borrow your pen?

105
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,870
What'd you do, move in?

106
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,416
l have been waiting an hour.

107
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:17,046
l can't stop my life
for your red tape.

108
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,426
My red tape? That's a laugh.

109
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,261
Considering your people
invented red tape.

110
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:26,798
My people?

111
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,015
You're a lawyer, right?

112
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,678
ls that a problem?

113
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,680
Only if you like seeing
criminals put behind bars.

114
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,020
You're right.

115
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,689
lt'd be much easier if we could
just lock people up without a trial.

116
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:42,771
Did l say that?

117
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,072
You people all say that.

118
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,691
Because you people
work for the bad guys.

119
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,695
l do civil law, not criminal law.

120
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:54,532
But if you're looking for bad guys,
you could start right here.

121
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,031
What's that supposed to mean?

122
00:09:56,294 --> 00:10:00,587
Florida law enforcement has set a world
record in bribery and corruption.

123
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:02,413
A world record?

124
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,625
What's a Florida cop
in a three-piece suit?

125
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,130
What?

126
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,174
The defendant.

127
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,632
What do you call 50 lawyers
at the bottom of the ocean?

128
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:14,846
A good start.

129
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:16,516
You know it.

130
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,724
lf you're done, can l go now?

131
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,396
Stay one more minute,
l will charge you rent.

132
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,693
lf you keep me another minute...

133
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,152
...l will bill you for my time.

134
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,240
Wouldn't surprise me.

135
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,878
Hello, is Kate still there?

136
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,505
She's not here.

137
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,209
Do you know where she went?

138
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,132
Try the bottom of the ocean.

139
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,223
Maria, l will be with you soon.

140
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,056
Good morning, Lisa.

141
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:06,392
How are you?

142
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,141
Made some friends today?

143
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,312
Good.

144
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:13,943
-Messages?
-Hollenbach's in your office.

145
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,856
Counselor. lt's about time.

146
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:21,199
l had to cancel lunch
with Donny Trump.

147
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,529
Sorry. l got hung up at
police headquarters for two hours.

148
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,904
Two hours?
Why don't you do what l do?

149
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,620
Plead the Fifth,
you're out in five minutes.

150
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,495
Thanks for the tip.

151
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:33,330
No charge.

152
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:38,371
Counselor, why are we confining
ourselves to this stuffy office?

153
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,964
We could be at the beach
in our bikinis.

154
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,135
Or in your case, a thong.

155
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,556
We wrapped up the
Juantorena case weeks ago.

156
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,847
lt just got unwrapped...

157
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,269
...last week...

158
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:56,477
...when l learned you helped your
client hide community property that...

159
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,233
...l can claim for my client.

160
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,150
What are you referring to?

161
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:04,310
l am talking about the ski house
you hid with your client's brother...

162
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,821
...the condo you hid
with his sister...

163
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,026
...and the plane you hid
with his mother.

164
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:15,493
Counselor, there is no ski house...

165
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,332
...there is no condo...

166
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,701
...and his mother borrowed the plane.

167
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,118
His mother's senile.

168
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,996
That's it.
She forgot to come back.

169
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:29,675
These charges are
scurrilous and baseless.

170
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,591
And may l say between us,
tête-à-tête...

171
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:35,848
...that this would take,
minimum, two years to prove.

172
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,632
He'd transfer title to new relatives.

173
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:43,852
As far as this humble counselor is
concerned, the most l would get is...

174
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,142
...a $200 slap on the wrist.

175
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,189
You're right.

176
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,435
l won't waste our time
in family court.

177
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:54,860
That's ridiculous.

178
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,492
But maritime court...

179
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:59,324
...federal maritime court...

180
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,778
...that's different.

181
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:04,615
Maritime court has something
to do with cruise ships, right?

182
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,164
Actually...

183
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,251
...it has to do with all ships.

184
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,463
Like this one.

185
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:22,890
Never heard of the Tortuga.

186
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,965
l didn't say the name.

187
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:25,973
Lucky guess?

188
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:30,563
Listen, Hollenbach, the law of the sea
is simple and federal.

189
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:34,018
l don't care if you hid the vessel
registry in Panama or Podunk.

190
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:37,562
l want the title signed over
to my client in 48 hours...

191
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,986
...or you will end up in a federal prison.

192
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,237
By the time you get out, you will need
a walker to chase ambulances.

193
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:45,865
Are we clear?

194
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,371
You know...

195
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,624
...you're very unattractive
when you're threatening.

196
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,516
Gotcha.

197
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,394
What's our status?

198
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:29,648
We crossed the underwater cable line.

199
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,196
How long?

200
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:32,982
Hard to say.

201
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,446
Thirty-six hours, maybe 48.

202
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:38,570
Now we search for
a junction box down there.

203
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,458
What about our Miami problem?

204
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,793
l will take care of it myself.

205
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,582
Oh, yes, Colonel Kazak...

206
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,091
...the mighty KGB who missed a hit
on a divorce lawyer.

207
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,211
No wonder your country folded.

208
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:58,258
l will show you how it's done.
Get out of the way.

209
00:14:58,767 --> 00:14:59,716
Go, go, go.

210
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,268
Let someone who doesn't eat borscht
show you how to use a computer.

211
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,816
Give me the grid.

212
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:11,105
Take it down. Dade County.

213
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:15,613
Search for target.

214
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,448
There, you see?
She will be dead by dinner.

215
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,748
There's something l really
think you should see.

216
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:37,756
What's going on?

217
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:40,210
Make a hole. Let him in.

218
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:43,133
There you go. Take a peek.

219
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:46,672
ls that your stuff?

220
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,013
l guess so.

221
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:51,354
l think you pissed her off.

222
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,233
Definitely pissed her off.

223
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,706
lt amazes me how much shit
a man can accumulate. You fucked up.

224
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:07,000
Thanks. Rub it in, why don't you?

225
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,417
Not that.

226
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:11,585
The lawyer didn't sign her statement.
She left her pager too.

227
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,170
Come on, l am off duty.

228
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:16,801
This job is like a toilet: lt ain't
over till the paperwork's done.

229
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,755
Boss, please. l have dealt
with enough crazy women today.

230
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:24,260
You have got me confused with
someone who gives a rat's ass.

231
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,432
Signed statement
on my desk by tonight.

232
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,546
want to watch Headline News ?

233
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:48,624
lt won't kill you.

234
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:15,732
Oh, my God.

235
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,341
Out of my way. Move.

236
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,339
lt's okay. l got you.

237
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,098
l got you.

238
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,892
l want it straight.

239
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,639
-The girl is still alive.
-She's alive?

240
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,022
You sure?

241
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,903
ldiot.

242
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,189
So, Juantorena,
Miss McQuean is still alive.

243
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,734
l am getting a little bored...

244
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:08,740
...with your petty incompetence.

245
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:10,118
Fuck what you think.

246
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,869
You tap phones for a living.
l tap banks.

247
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:17,917
Without me, you'd still be in Havana
pulling bananas out of your ass.

248
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:21,965
You think you can do this alone?

249
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,334
What are you going to do, shoot me?

250
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:29,848
Hey, you.

251
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,387
Do you know how to do
everything he did?

252
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:36,768
Good.

253
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:43,026
l want the land team
ready to go in 10 minutes.

254
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,066
Yes, sir.

255
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,366
lt's Nancy. Forensics.

256
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:53,817
What do you got?

257
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:58,160
So far, all l got is a blast pattern
and a strong smell of marzipan.

258
00:20:58,374 --> 00:20:59,916
Marzipan? Jesus.

259
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:01,581
Semtex?

260
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,033
Or C4.

261
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:08,045
The blast was shaped in a military
configuration to kill all in its path.

262
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,334
These guys are not fooling around.

263
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,440
-Who'd we draw for detail?
-You got B and G.

264
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:28,687
Good.

265
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,236
Go back to the station
and see what's going on.

266
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:37,400
-Boys.
-Hi, Max.

267
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:43,032
You smell like you fell in a sewer.

268
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:46,792
-You check it out yet?
-No. We just got here.

269
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:50,792
Top of the stairs, on the right.
Keep her away from the windows.

270
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:53,453
l will stash the jeep
and check the back door.

271
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:55,167
Come this way, ma'am.

272
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:57,215
Be back in a minute.

273
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:51,507
Have you downloaded the background
information of the target?

274
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:54,558
l can tell you what size
pantyhose she wears.

275
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,312
We know more about her than she does.

276
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:06,524
Any food?

277
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:08,777
Pop-Tarts and beef jerky.

278
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:12,357
-lt's Max's fault we got night duty.
-That's right.

279
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,950
He springs for Domino's.

280
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,657
-He's springing. l am not.
-l am busted.

281
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,821
-l got $10 to my name--
-Hey, guys?

282
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,578
l will buy the pizza.

283
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,241
Call Caffe Romano.
l have an account there.

284
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,333
Why not?

285
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:30,128
All right, you two, l need two eyes
on the front. You in back, Bean.

286
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,873
Light's out in the back porch,
so get one from the hallway.

287
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:36,842
How do you feel?

288
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,595
Like my life just exploded.

289
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,597
What is this place? Motel hell?

290
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:48,683
lt was a crack house
until the county took it over.

291
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:52,399
-We use it for witness protection.
-You mean targets.

292
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:56,605
-l didn't say that.
-Forensics did, on the radio.

293
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,198
What is Semtex?

294
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,490
lt's a plastic explosive...

295
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:04,903
...used mostly by the military...

296
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:07,202
...and terrorists.

297
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,079
l will tell you this, Kate:
Whoever's after you...

298
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:13,162
...they're real pros.

299
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:16,419
l should take that as a compliment.

300
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:19,967
lt would be embarrassing
to be killed by an amateur.

301
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:28,381
l got you some dry clothes.

302
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:34,222
Shower's right behind you,
if you want to clean up.

303
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,893
You get some rest.

304
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:40,057
What happens in the morning?

305
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,612
Figure out who's trying to kill you.

306
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,284
Twenty minutes, okay?

307
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,452
To go. Pepperonis with everything.

308
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,290
Extra cheese, four times.

309
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,420
Under Kate McQuean account.

310
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:03,998
How does she eat so much
and stay so skinny?

311
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:16,340
Colonel, we have got her.
She just used her credit card.

312
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,432
lt's a delivery going to....

313
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,583
Move your car.
My pizzas are getting cold.

314
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:57,212
Yeah, and so are you.

315
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,428
Hey, babe, if it were Domino's,
l'd get a discount.

316
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,973
lf l were Domino's,
you'd still be alive.

317
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:08,362
Door's open. How many in there?

318
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,151
Three more targets.

319
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:15,197
One on the ground floor at the back.

320
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,912
One on the second.

321
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,456
And one at the end of the hall.

322
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:26,629
Where's target one?

323
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,500
ln a room by the stairs.

324
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:32,171
Now would be a good time
to catch him.

325
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,139
That's better.

326
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:45,852
What did you do?

327
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,271
To the heat sensor? Nothing.

328
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:50,896
One just disappeared.

329
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,942
Okay, you mook. You better not
be touching my pizza.

330
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,065
Oh, shit.

331
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,711
Wait. Target three is moving.

332
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,384
Bean, G, talk to me.

333
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:27,721
G, answer me.

334
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:29,932
What the hell is going on?

335
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:31,428
Shit.

336
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:54,659
Where's the target?

337
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,412
Stand by. I am scanning.

338
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,126
Where is he?

339
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,168
Wait.

340
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:04,378
He's in front of you.

341
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,301
Shit.

342
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,096
Let's go.

343
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,817
Come on, quick.

344
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,162
Come back. The police
will be here any minute.

345
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,591
-They're out of there.
-They?

346
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,676
When did she become a "they"?

347
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:41,891
She's with a cop. And he's good.
He killed our whole goddamn team.

348
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:51,608
Stop.

349
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:54,111
Police cars.
We will be safe with them.

350
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:58,737
That was supposed to be a safe house
back there. Only cops know of it.

351
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:00,282
We can't trust the cops?

352
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:02,868
l only trust the cops that l know.

353
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:05,282
Right now, l don't know
how many are alive.

354
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:12,420
Kirkpatrick. Line two.

355
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,131
l got it.

356
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,802
Tell me you have got her.

357
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,557
What's going on?

358
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,718
What's going on?
Bean and G are dead.

359
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:28,224
-That's what's going on.
-God.

360
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,345
Where are you?

361
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,437
Not on the phone.
Not the way it went down.

362
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,520
What are you saying?

363
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:35,230
Somebody knows every move we make.

364
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:38,279
l ain't saying shit
until l know who l can trust.

365
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:41,987
l have lost two men. l am not
fucking around. Bring her in now.

366
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,694
You should call the suits.

367
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,985
We don't need the goddamn suits.

368
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:47,033
Got it.

369
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:48,402
Kirkpatrick.

370
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,994
Nice lrish name for our cop.

371
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,322
Let's see what he's made of.

372
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:58,545
Here we go.

373
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,214
One life about to end.

374
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,458
lf anybody's dirty,
we need to call the Feds.

375
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,548
Wait. Who said anything
about dirty cops?

376
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,466
Give us an hour.

377
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:10,881
Where?

378
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:14,512
Where l used to go on Friday nights.

379
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,436
This is bullshit.

380
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:19,772
You live through this,
you're fucking fired.

381
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:22,943
You just make sure
you bring the Feds, understand?

382
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:24,944
Don't worry.

383
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,276
Watch your six.

384
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,818
How long to police headquarters?

385
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,577
Five minutes. Go south.

386
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:49,004
-Forensics.
-Jodi, it's Max.

387
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,583
Hey, Don fucking Johnson.

388
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:53,380
l need a favor.

389
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:57,047
-I never lend money to family.
-l need a make on a shell.

390
00:33:57,391 --> 00:34:00,557
Yeah, like l need my beauty sleep.
What do you got?

391
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,055
It's a center-fire shell...

392
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,721
...copper wash with a brass primer
and a red surround.

393
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:08,651
lt looks like a 12-gauge,
but it's marked 33.

394
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:10,229
Ever heard of a 33?

395
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:13,113
No such number.
There's no such zone.

396
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,736
You got a phantom cartridge there.

397
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:18,783
Phantom cartridges blew away
two of my crew.

398
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:21,987
l am sorry.

399
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:28,156
The arms world is like the Jersey shore.
lt throws up new shit every day.

400
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:31,330
I will run it right now.
Can you call me in an hour?

401
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,381
Where are you taking me?

402
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,014
My partner used to moonlight here
as a security guard.

403
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,347
Don't worry,
everything will be all right.

404
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:52,555
l wish l could believe that.

405
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:02,441
Lieutenant Meyerson.

406
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:04,572
Baker. FBl.

407
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:06,485
Congratulations.

408
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:09,530
Detective Aragon will take you
to the pickup point.

409
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:25,587
Come on.

410
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:29,256
The word for tonight
is "inconspicuous," all right?

411
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:37,890
Where the hell are you taking us?

412
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:40,684
l will tell you when we get there.

413
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,195
-You okay?
-This the guy?

414
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,355
Agent Baker.
Where's the woman?

415
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:51,778
Show me your l.D.

416
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:56,076
You all don't have to screw with me.
Your partner's done that.

417
00:35:57,037 --> 00:35:58,318
Let me see the badge.

418
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,377
Where is she?

419
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:18,261
Cruise the perimeter. Make sure
this is the only way in and out.

420
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:32,814
Howdy, ma'am.

421
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,394
Are you okay?
l am with the FBl.

422
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,268
You're safe now.

423
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,028
lt's okay.

424
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,453
Why don't you ride in the other car?

425
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:48,945
l will be right behind you.

426
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,009
Why don't you put that out?

427
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,304
Seat belt for safety.

428
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,474
Right.

429
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:32,488
Hold the wheel, will you?

430
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,546
Come on. Let's go.

431
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:40,346
Come on, come on.

432
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:47,301
Stay down.

433
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,786
lf it wasn't for you,
l'd remember where l parked the car.

434
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:25,094
What happened?

435
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,337
l got my best friend killed.

436
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,337
How?

437
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:32,215
l was the one who called the FBl.
That wasn't the FBl.

438
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:34,261
-Who were they?
-l don't know.

439
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,639
l did everything l was supposed to do.
l checked their l.D.

440
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,106
These guys are perfect.

441
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:52,616
lf you fail again, l will kill you myself.
Now get in.

442
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,327
You got any cash?

443
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,991
l have a credit card.

444
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:05,122
This is a good place to hole up.

445
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,089
Looks big and busy,
and they won't remember faces.

446
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:30,933
Stay right here.

447
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:42,367
ldiots.

448
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:46,323
They use a credit card again.
Typical Americans.

449
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,288
Got them?

450
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:51,874
Raleigh Hotel, 1775 Collins Avenue.

451
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,585
Ten minutes from here, colonel.

452
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,294
-Forensic.
-It's me. Listen....

453
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:03,129
-What if this 33 isn't numbers?
-Go on.

454
00:41:03,347 --> 00:41:06,597
What if it's letters from
a Greek or Hebrew alphabet?

455
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:09,894
You're not as stupid as you look.
Give me some time.

456
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,269
l will call you back.

457
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,501
Great. Someone gave us
the wrong goddamn key.

458
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:40,872
lt doesn't need brawn.

459
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,748
Finesse.

460
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:55,976
Oh, no, you don't.

461
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,601
No time for rest.

462
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,890
l need some answers.

463
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,069
Did you hear me? Get up.
l need your help.

464
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:07,855
We got to figure this out.

465
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,860
You're a lawyer, right?

466
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:19,703
That's a perfect place to start.
You got a lot of clients and cases?

467
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,408
This has to be connected
to one of your cases, right?

468
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:24,825
lt's possible.

469
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:27,910
You sent someone away,
now they want revenge?

470
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:31,457
l don't do criminal law,
l do civil law.

471
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,713
Small claims, green cards,
mom-and-pop grocery stores.

472
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,430
Nobody gets killed over that.

473
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,970
Oh, no?

474
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,847
Three of my friends
were just killed over that.

475
00:42:46,354 --> 00:42:49,141
Three families wake up
tomorrow without a father.

476
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,017
l have to live with that.

477
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,851
So do l.

478
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:16,040
So, genius...

479
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:18,129
...did you ever piss off the KGB?

480
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:19,290
KGB?

481
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:22,959
The Russian letter for "Z"
looks like a three.

482
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:26,927
So "33" is "ZZ,"
which means Zapadny Zavod...

483
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,924
..."Death to the West." They were
based in Cuba to strike Western targets.

484
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:34,393
-"They" being KGB away teams.
-Go on.

485
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:38,353
They were the Navy Seals of the spy
world: wet works, black-bag jobs...

486
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,939
...electronic surveillance.
Very versatile.

487
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:43,317
lf it was bad, they did it.

488
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,732
Fuck "did." They're doing.
They're on my ass.

489
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,736
Avoid anything that leaves
electronic footprints.

490
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,365
They can enter your home
and pick your nose.

491
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,790
Remember the Russian spy ships
we read about?

492
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:57,872
Well, these guys worked on them.

493
00:43:58,084 --> 00:43:59,993
They're into
electronic surveillance.

494
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:03,211
-That's why their l.D.s were perfect.
-What?

495
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:08,090
-They did it with computers.
-Never mind. You got family here.

496
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:11,961
lf you need a hand, most of us
are armed and dangerous.

497
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:13,680
Thanks, cuz.

498
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:16,175
You're a lifesaver...

499
00:44:16,976 --> 00:44:19,098
...even without the artillery.

500
00:44:24,774 --> 00:44:26,316
KGB...

501
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:28,729
...computers.

502
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:33,691
They found the safe house.
How did they find the safe house?

503
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:41,069
The phone lines.

504
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:50,957
Quarter of a million...

505
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:52,620
...cash.

506
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:53,754
What?

507
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:55,461
For the girl.

508
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,540
Never fucking happen.

509
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,345
Half a million.

510
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,423
Just walk away.

511
00:45:03,808 --> 00:45:07,259
We got to get moving.
These bastards are on the phone lines.

512
00:45:08,604 --> 00:45:10,015
Phone lines.

513
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:15,192
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

514
00:45:16,653 --> 00:45:18,978
Let's see if you have
your ears on now.

515
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:22,316
He's using the phone.
l will trace it to the other party.

516
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:26,783
Stop-n-Shop.

517
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:30,371
l know you're out there
listening, you motherfucker.

518
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,700
Fuck you calling "motherfucker."

519
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:35,290
You're never going to get the girl.

520
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:37,329
l already got your girl, Earl.

521
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:39,746
l fucked her last night.

522
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:41,086
And she was good.

523
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:44,340
Big mistake killing my crew.

524
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,337
Big fucking mistake.

525
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,757
Want to know why?

526
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:52,970
Because l am going to get
every last one of you.

527
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,896
That's an empty threat,
Mr. Kirkpatrick.

528
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:59,354
You have no idea who we are.

529
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,980
Why don't you drop
the American accent?

530
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:04,480
l beg your pardon?

531
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:09,487
Fuck you, fuck whoever else
on the line. Bring your ass here.

532
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,200
Dasvidaniya, asshole.

533
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,607
Dasvi what?

534
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:15,401
"Dasvidaniya, asshole"?

535
00:46:15,663 --> 00:46:17,620
Man, fuck you.

536
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:20,449
Clever bastard.
You in?

537
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,909
l have isolated the floor,
not the room.

538
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:24,586
Do them all.

539
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:31,795
Let's go.

540
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,470
What's going on?

541
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,557
Get back. Fuck finesse.

542
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,350
Two more blocks.

543
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:04,575
-He said, "Dasvidaniya, asshole."
-He knows of the Russian connection.

544
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:08,698
l wonder what else the scumbag knows.
Locate that woman.

545
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:29,976
What's that smell?

546
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:34,604
Pig shit.
Trailer over there is hauling hogs.

547
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:38,772
Be right back.

548
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,329
They have activated their cell phone.

549
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:01,956
lmbeciles.

550
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:05,418
lt's like painting
a bull's-eye on their ass.

551
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:08,130
l have got their position.

552
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:10,845
They're heading north.

553
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,675
We will have them by midnight.

554
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,512
Pig shit's sure going to hit the fan.

555
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:34,066
You have been looking out for me,
and somehow l forgot to say thanks.

556
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,079
So, thank you.

557
00:48:52,134 --> 00:48:54,292
All right, Gomer, wake up.

558
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:56,291
Open the truck.

559
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:57,929
Hurry up. Let's go.

560
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:01,631
All right, okay. Don't push.
Hello, pigs.

561
00:49:06,062 --> 00:49:07,687
Where the hell are they?

562
00:49:08,314 --> 00:49:11,101
-Where the hell are who?
-The cop and the girl.

563
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,308
Good morning.

564
00:50:09,618 --> 00:50:11,943
-How'd you sleep?
-Never better.

565
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:14,238
Do you have any Russian clients?

566
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:15,327
Why?

567
00:50:15,707 --> 00:50:17,498
This is a Russian shell.

568
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,244
You got any Russian cases?

569
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:21,747
Cuban, Hispanic....

570
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:23,709
Cuban sounds Russian.

571
00:50:24,423 --> 00:50:26,878
l'd have to run a list of names
on my office PC.

572
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:29,256
Forget it.
We're not going to Miami.

573
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:31,709
Maybe we don't have to.

574
00:50:41,229 --> 00:50:42,308
We hit the jackpot.

575
00:50:42,564 --> 00:50:45,648
Kirkpatrick's a satisfied customer
of Car-Trac, U.S.A.

576
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:47,349
Car-Trac?

577
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:51,861
A vehicle tracking system. The police
use it to locate missing cars.

578
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:52,944
Can we access it?

579
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:56,073
Yes, but it's an encrypted system
on a satellite.

580
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:57,981
lt will take a while.

581
00:50:58,202 --> 00:50:59,447
Then do it.

582
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:12,215
You got five minutes,
then we're out of here.

583
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,384
You moved the lBMs.

584
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:18,253
l thought there was....

585
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:21,963
You're not paid to think.
You're paid to do what l say.

586
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:30,055
-May l help you?
-Actually, l was in yesterday.

587
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,897
-And Adam was helping me.
-l was?

588
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,477
l will be over in the diner, Adam.

589
00:51:44,952 --> 00:51:47,621
l thought l'd be
in better hands with you.

590
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,953
-So what are you doing?
-Nothing.

591
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,706
Just fiddling with my joystick.

592
00:51:54,961 --> 00:51:57,036
Fiddling with your joystick?

593
00:52:04,677 --> 00:52:07,429
Do any of these have
a communications package?

594
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:11,970
This unit here has
a Hayes-compatible...

595
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,930
...28-baud fax to something or....

596
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:21,596
Are you more interested in hardware
or is it more software?

597
00:52:22,234 --> 00:52:23,314
Hardware.

598
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:28,481
l was hoping to demo your unit.

599
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:39,072
l'd have to boot up first.

600
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,489
Why don't you?

601
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:25,034
We have located the junction box.
The divers are in the water.

602
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,417
With luck, by tonight, the targets
will be dead and we will be rich.

603
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:35,169
She's using a modem
to download files from her office.

604
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:38,466
lf she stays on,
l can trace it back to her location.

605
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:48,007
You're not going to buy
anything here, are you?

606
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:51,061
No, l am sorry.
l am just using you.

607
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,020
That's okay.

608
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,765
-We got to go.
-One more minute.

609
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:56,813
Got anything?

610
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,399
Do you?

611
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,982
No, no.

612
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,742
Wait a minute.

613
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,241
This could be it.

614
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,448
This guy, Emilio Juantorena.

615
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:14,662
This thing fax?

616
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,245
You bet.

617
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:20,418
Jodi can run this name
to see if he's got a rap sheet.

618
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:22,963
Come on. We're out of here.

619
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:25,128
Thanks, Adam.

620
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:27,962
You're the best.

621
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:38,180
Who's this Cuban guy?

622
00:54:38,396 --> 00:54:42,309
He slammed his wife into a wall
and kept a dentist busy for a year.

623
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:44,772
-He get charged?
-Yes, but he's bargaining.

624
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:45,767
With what?

625
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,441
The S & L he owned
ran a major wire fraud.

626
00:54:48,696 --> 00:54:51,780
He and his lawyer took
immunity from prosecution.

627
00:54:52,032 --> 00:54:53,277
What's his beef with you?

628
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:56,784
He didn't buy immunity from
divorce or property settlement.

629
00:54:56,995 --> 00:54:58,988
lt's in a boat
l am trying to repossess.

630
00:54:59,205 --> 00:55:00,071
What's it worth?

631
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,332
$200,000. Why?

632
00:55:04,877 --> 00:55:05,956
Why, Max?

633
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,297
The guy on the phone at the hotel
offered me $500,000 to give you up.

634
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:37,693
lt was him.

635
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:46,996
Speak.

636
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:52,705
-What the hell is that?
-Shit, the radiator. Great.

637
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:59,585
l believe we have found the bastard...

638
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:04,794
...who's been helping those idiots
put two and two together.

639
00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:07,680
lt's the radiator.

640
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:11,882
lt must have overheated.
Could you come right now and check it?

641
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:16,433
You will get an extra $50
if you get here sooner.

642
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,268
l am into the Car-Trac system.

643
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:35,827
Got him.

644
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,039
They're on the inland waterway.

645
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,918
Thank you, Car-Trac.

646
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,958
We will split up. Get after them.

647
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,873
Take them out.

648
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:48,090
l have my own little subtraction to do.

649
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:52,293
Pull over.

650
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:54,263
We're splitting up.

651
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:58,092
Tow truck's coming.

652
00:56:59,978 --> 00:57:00,808
ls this you?

653
00:57:04,941 --> 00:57:06,269
Yes, that's me.

654
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:08,684
The one with the funny haircut.

655
00:57:08,902 --> 00:57:12,022
lf you need a clean T-shirt,
you'd better do it now.

656
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:18,283
You look like juvenile delinquents.

657
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:19,907
We were 17.

658
00:57:20,788 --> 00:57:22,246
Kids. New Jersey.

659
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:25,622
You got that much testosterone...

660
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:30,246
...and no idea what to do with it...

661
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:33,294
...looking like a hood works.

662
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:36,218
How'd you get from there
to being a cop?

663
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:40,134
My father was a cop,
brother-in-law's a cop...

664
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,466
...my cousin Jodi's a cop.

665
00:57:43,558 --> 00:57:45,182
Family business.

666
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:25,208
-Forensic.
-Internal Affairs. Open the door.

667
00:58:25,553 --> 00:58:26,383
What's the problem?

668
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:28,303
Open the door, detective.

669
00:58:35,103 --> 00:58:37,772
Something punctured your radiator.

670
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:42,264
What the--?

671
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:45,063
Oh, shit.

672
00:58:47,864 --> 00:58:50,153
They could have been
using Car-Trac to catch us.

673
00:58:50,366 --> 00:58:52,608
We got to go. Come on.
Let's go.

674
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:55,318
-$100. Pay up front.
-Just fucking drive.

675
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:57,744
l am serious.
$100. Pay up front.

676
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,667
$50. Pay later.

677
00:59:04,379 --> 00:59:05,541
Drive.

678
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:07,547
l always hated stick shift.

679
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,970
Faster.

680
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:27,941
Keep your head down.
Let him get even, we're dead.

681
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,275
Faster.

682
00:59:57,217 --> 00:59:58,248
Shoot him.

683
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:00,584
What are you doing?

684
01:00:00,803 --> 01:00:03,211
l am losing the Jeep.
lt's slowing us down.

685
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:04,628
Shoot him.

686
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,315
They zig, you zag.

687
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:17,600
Don't let them get ahead of us.

688
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,573
Look out.

689
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:49,673
lt's just a woman driving.
Shoot her.

690
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:57,718
They're behind you.

691
01:01:36,387 --> 01:01:38,047
Floor it.
lt's going to blow.

692
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:43,767
Get ahead of them.

693
01:01:46,438 --> 01:01:47,718
Cut them off.

694
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:52,473
Nail the brakes on three.

695
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,398
Hit it.

696
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:22,420
Jesus Christ.

697
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:26,924
lt worked.

698
01:02:32,478 --> 01:02:35,229
-Where are you going?
-Away. Out.

699
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:36,553
Gone. l am gone.

700
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:39,229
-l am going to get away from this.
-No, we stay together.

701
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:41,316
Remember, we stay calm.

702
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:44,436
There's no "we" here, okay?

703
01:02:44,697 --> 01:02:46,191
lt's me they want.

704
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:48,902
See this car? Get in.

705
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:51,236
-You can't make me.
-Watch me.

706
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:55,365
You happy? Get in the car.

707
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:57,702
You're stealing a car.

708
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,084
Would you shut up?

709
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:02,622
Take these things off.

710
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,828
l am calm now.

711
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:06,924
l'd love to, but the key
is on the key ring.

712
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:08,966
l left the key in the ignition.

713
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:10,719
Of the Wagoneer?

714
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:27,098
Shit.

715
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:32,898
What are you doing?

716
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,522
Don't be so stubborn.
Let me go.

717
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:11,199
What are you doing?

718
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,788
You will hit the pole.

719
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,286
You will be killed.

720
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:57,361
That was dumb.

721
01:05:57,574 --> 01:06:00,065
No, you running off alone was dumber.

722
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,200
Who elected you
my knight in shining armor?

723
01:06:02,454 --> 01:06:05,490
The same person who made you
a royal pain in the ass.

724
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:07,410
-Back up.
-Or what?

725
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:09,748
-l will take your head off.
-Bullshit.

726
01:06:13,672 --> 01:06:14,502
Good right.

727
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,175
Had enough?

728
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:23,882
Give me your best shot.

729
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:25,254
l am waiting.

730
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,567
They're not on the interstate.

731
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:42,395
They took the coast road or
ditched the car and jumped the train.

732
01:06:42,614 --> 01:06:43,527
What train?

733
01:08:26,747 --> 01:08:28,289
l have got a thermal reading.

734
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:03,309
Rosa and l will work
toward the center.

735
01:09:03,946 --> 01:09:05,855
You go back there.

736
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,526
Stay down.

737
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,204
l see them.

738
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:57,122
-Move, move, move.
-Let me go.

739
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,173
Let's go, let's go.

740
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:26,856
Kazak to away team.
Report in now.

741
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:28,938
We got the girl.

742
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,858
What about the cop?

743
01:11:31,075 --> 01:11:33,317
He fell off. He's probably dead.

744
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:37,742
Whatever you do,
don't harm her for now.

745
01:11:37,956 --> 01:11:39,616
I need to interrogate her...

746
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:43,457
...to find out if anyone else knows.
Bring her to me.

747
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:45,620
Where are you relative to Tortuga ?

748
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,964
About 40 minutes due east of Downs Bay.

749
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:51,049
Good, you will be back shortly.

750
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:19,280
You're coming with me.

751
01:12:37,175 --> 01:12:41,635
You have reached Detective
Kirkpatrick's meddling relative.

752
01:12:41,887 --> 01:12:44,757
Cousin Jodi can't come
to the phone right now...

753
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:49,226
...but if you'd like to leave
a message, contact a psychic.

754
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,141
Dasvidaniya to you, asshole.

755
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:24,965
We haven't been formally introduced.
Welcome to the Tortuga.

756
01:13:36,227 --> 01:13:38,385
When l ran the KGB out of Cuba...

757
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:41,889
...l helped some very politically
incorrect characters...

758
01:13:43,274 --> 01:13:45,516
...hide billions of dollars...

759
01:13:45,777 --> 01:13:48,694
...in various free-world banks.

760
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:52,697
But l kept the account numbers.

761
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:55,281
Magic numbers.

762
01:13:56,077 --> 01:13:57,240
All l had to do...

763
01:13:57,662 --> 01:14:01,196
...was break the bank codes
used for wire transfers...

764
01:14:01,457 --> 01:14:03,663
...and help myself.

765
01:14:14,385 --> 01:14:15,879
Downs Bay.

766
01:14:20,015 --> 01:14:24,012
Numbers are so beautiful.
Don't you think so, Miss McQuean?

767
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:28,640
Your client's husband, may he
rest in peace, knew about banks.

768
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:34,308
l know about tapping into
the secrets of phone lines.

769
01:14:34,695 --> 01:14:37,565
A match made in heaven.

770
01:14:37,822 --> 01:14:41,107
Unfortunately, you came along
and fucked it up.

771
01:14:41,325 --> 01:14:43,650
l don't give a shit
about you or the money.

772
01:14:44,662 --> 01:14:45,990
l only wanted the boat.

773
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:49,705
But you'd have brought a marshall
with repossession orders.

774
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,531
l couldn't afford the intrusion.
But don't worry...

775
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:57,119
...you can have the boat,
only it will be in little pieces...

776
01:14:57,339 --> 01:14:59,462
...with yourself in it.

777
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:08,380
We're in.

778
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,140
Final decryption in process.

779
01:15:11,352 --> 01:15:12,596
Good.

780
01:15:12,853 --> 01:15:14,976
Start transferring the money.

781
01:15:16,606 --> 01:15:19,358
This is the Cayman Islands
International Bank.

782
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:21,020
To deposit funds, press one.

783
01:15:21,277 --> 01:15:24,231
Enter your international
secured PIN number now.

784
01:15:36,123 --> 01:15:38,448
This is like taking candy
from a baby...

785
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,126
...only less screaming.

786
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:45,877
Hey, Kazak, you listening?

787
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:47,205
lt's the cop.

788
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:48,498
I know what you're doing.

789
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:50,463
l doubt it.

790
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,546
How tough could it be to figure out?

791
01:15:52,805 --> 01:15:53,884
The Tortuga...

792
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:56,464
...Emilio Juantorena, the Cubans....

793
01:15:57,517 --> 01:15:58,382
I know it all.

794
01:15:58,643 --> 01:16:00,885
-Who have you told?
-Nobody yet.

795
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:02,479
I just want the girl.

796
01:16:02,772 --> 01:16:05,689
-Why not trade her for me.
-But I don't want you.

797
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:10,766
Stay out of my business
for the next four hours...

798
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,021
...and l will leave her where she is.

799
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,699
l don't believe that.

800
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:17,658
l am a businessman.

801
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,986
My word is my bond.

802
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:28,078
How do we find him?

803
01:16:28,336 --> 01:16:30,375
These radios have a 10-mile range.

804
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,546
The only land mass
within that radius...

805
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:35,671
...is Downs Bay.

806
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:38,589
Take the Zodiac and get rid of him.

807
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:47,954
That hurt?

808
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:49,917
Poor little baby.

809
01:18:50,877 --> 01:18:53,582
Let Mommy kick it
and make it better.

810
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:00,970
This is the Cayman Islands
International Bank.

811
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:03,603
We are now processing your transaction.

812
01:20:03,858 --> 01:20:04,937
You are withdrawing...

813
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:07,566
...957 million...

814

...150 dollars...

816
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:15,982
...and 0 cents.

817
01:20:30,632 --> 01:20:32,375
Help them with the boat.

818
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:35,129
l will call and tell Kazak
he can kill the woman.

819
01:20:43,935 --> 01:20:44,765
Get the fucker?

820
01:21:18,924 --> 01:21:20,833

-Obviously.

Go get him.

822
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:48,862
You killed my crew, my partner?

823
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:50,316
Sorry.

824
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:53,992
You have no fucking conscience.

825
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:56,572
l can't afford
the luxury of a conscience.

826
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:00,406
Kill him.

827
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,282
Your withdrawal will be complete...

828
01:22:37,493 --> 01:22:40,659
...when you enter
the appropriate currency.

829
01:22:57,594 --> 01:22:59,503
For British pounds, press one.

830
01:23:10,021 --> 01:23:12,097
For French francs--

831
01:23:24,909 --> 01:23:25,905
For American dollars--

832
01:23:26,786 --> 01:23:30,237
Please wait for the
first available operator.

833
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:55,613
lt's all right.

834
01:24:57,074 --> 01:24:58,188
lt's over.

835
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:03,029
Not quite, officer.

836
01:25:04,413 --> 01:25:06,322
You just sank my client's boat.

837
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:09,157
There's going to be
one hell of a lawsuit.

838
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:10,663
Sounds terrible.

839
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,252
What do l have to do
to get out of it?
