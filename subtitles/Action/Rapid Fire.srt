Hold it

2
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,100
Hey!

3
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,341
What the fuck you're doing?
Disturbing our guests?

4
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,929
You make us look bad.

5
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:46,069
Ming, you get that fucker to the
back row and keep an eye on him

00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,070
Your old man's death had ...

8
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,508
nothing to do with the revolution
My old man died for nothing

9
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,446
I have a little gift for you

10
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,547
Thanks

11
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:41,567
Just look after my things around here

12
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:23,204
Fucking asshole, Gwai-Lo ( foreigner)

13
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:26,770
You want me to do the translation?

14
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:29,971
Yeah, just answer him for me

15
01:11:36,153 --> 01:11:38,847
Wait! Whose family you're with?

16
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:42,164
I'm Gum Wong, Kim Wong's brother.
Wang Cho gave me this job, and he...

17
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,446
Please, big brother, please

18
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:48,489
Shut up.  Go to work.

19
01:12:00,693 --> 01:12:04,527
Hey, homie, this ain't your post
Go back and get another cart

20
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:07,846
Go back and get another cart
Don't you hear me?

21
01:14:14,053 --> 01:14:16,544
Move the stuff, and remember...

22
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,455
Come

23
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:42,256
Everyone stays alert

24
01:16:04,613 --> 01:16:06,804
Over here, take care of them, hurry

25
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,872
<i>(Tau) Junior, take care of them!</i>

26
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:34,384
Hurry, burn down the factory
Hey, remember, don't leave a thing behind

27
01:17:50,213 --> 01:17:52,265
Watch it, coming from the right

28
01:17:52,566 --> 01:17:53,766
Hit him!
