1
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,517
Apúrense, cabrones! Rápido!

2
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,236
Pásale! Pásale! Échale!

3
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,314
Órale! Échale! Échale!

4
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,395
Órale, muchachos!

5
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,390
Apúrense, muchachos.

6
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,113
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.

7
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,357
You are all under arrest
for horse stealing. Drop your guns.

8
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,677
Échale con tu chingada madre, cabrón!

9
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,677
You gonna steal these horses
back from me? Huh? Policeman?

10
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,678
These are my horses!

11
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,759
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...

12
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,233
Órale!

13
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,797
You'll never get away with this. You can't
kill a policeman. They'll hunt you down.

14
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,150
Hijo de perra!

15
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,238
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

16
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,713
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

17
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,714
Some of these guys
are a lot taller than me.

18
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,114
A whole head taller.

19
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,228
Pues de la chingada!
Qué está pasando?

20
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,150
Hey, you, cabrón! You're hurting my cars,
pendejo! Why you do that?

21
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,511
This is JJ McQuade, Texas Ranger.

22
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,559
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,830
Put 'em down.

24
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,789
- Do not move.
- "Do not move."

25
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,399
Hey, you. Stand up like a man
so I can see you.

26
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,594
Puta!

27
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,870
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

28
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,518
There! You think I care
about your pinche friend now?

29
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,438
Put down your weapon
or I'll shoot this man!

30
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,597
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!

31
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,197
Better listen to me, cabrón!

32
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,118
Right now! Come down!

33
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,233
Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! Qué quieres?

34
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,148
Ain't no one ever killed no Texas Ranger
and lived to tell it.

35
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,549
He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honoured guest some respect.

36
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,757
Echa, hijo puta!

37
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,717
I've never seen
a Texas Ranger up close before.

38
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,432
You know,

39
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,633
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

40
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,513
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

41
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,675
Don't shoot me.

42
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,196
Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

43
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,357
Like father, like son.

44
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,277
Come on.

45
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,239
Get back, kid.
Stay there and I'll cut you loose.

46
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,353
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.

47
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,951
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.

48
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,753
Chinga a tu madre, puto.

49
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,314
Come on. I'm gonna fix your teeth.

50
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,755
We present to you, Dakota Brown...

51
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,395
For 38 years of unrivalled performance
as a Texas Ranger...

52
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,313
for over 2,000 felony arrests...

53
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,278
For serving the great state of Texas
with fearless devotion...

54
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,474
this gold watch...

55
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,758
and honorary plaque.

56
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,874
Hey, how about that?
How about that? Ain't that somethin'?

57
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,956
Dakota.

58
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,229
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

59
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,555
It's a real honour.

60
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,558
Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.

61
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,195
Thank you, folks. Drive careful
goin' home now, you hear me?

62
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,270
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?

63
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,358
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.

64
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,153
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.

65
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,078
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?

66
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,510
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.

67
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,996
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.

68
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,998
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?

69
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,873
My office in ten minutes.

70
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,838
"And you, McQuade..."

71
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,836
Hey, McQuade.

72
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,516
Hi, there.

73
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,193
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.

74
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,229
You think you're pretty damn good,
don't you, McQuade?

75
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,434
In case you didn't know it there's more to
being a Texas Ranger than making busts.

76
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,677
You gotta look good doing it.

77
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,756
Style.

78
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,873
The best always have style.

79
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,676
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.

80
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,629
Now, in terms of
unassisted felony arrests,

81
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,672
I admit your record is unrivalled.

82
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,989
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.

83
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,716
He lives clean
and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.

84
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,195
Read it.

85
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,673
It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

86
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,315
I quote: "Ranger JJ McQuade
is a walking symbol

87
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,468
of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete and
discriminatory nature of Rangers today."

88
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,079
Unquote.

89
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,557
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude
is gonna change.

90
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,676
You're going to start cooperating with the
state and federal agencies. Understand?

91
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,916
Come in.

92
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,554
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.

93
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,389
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.

94
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,876
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.

95
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,399
You gotta be kidding.

96
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,238
- It'll be an honour workin' with you.
- Forget it, kid. I work alone.

97
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,476
Where'd you get that piece?

98
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,558
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?

99
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,238
Stay with it, son.

100
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,399
Our Russian friends have failed us. We
will have to finance the coup ourselves.

101
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,593
The shipment has to be in Havana
before Wednesday.

102
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,676
Splendid.

103
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,555
Would you like to count it, Senor Wilkes?

104
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,070
Trust is the most important thing
in our business.

105
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,350
Of course it is.

106
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,473
Now, have the plane loaded at once.

107
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,036
I am in a hurry
to get back to Havana, Senor Wilkes.

108
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,752
Quickly, now.

109
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,354
That quick enough?

110
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,476
Bury them.

111
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,072
Ranger?

112
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,312
Ranger?

113
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,554
Good dog. Good wolf.

114
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,200
Good boy. Good wolf.

115
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,758
Chingao.

116
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,713
What a pisshouse.

117
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,672
Ranger?

118
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,239
What are you doing here?

119
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,911
I came to wake you up.
I'm your new partner, remember?

120
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.

121
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,831
But Captain Tyler...

122
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,599
Tell Tyler to shove it!

123
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,551
Chinga a su madre!

124
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,796
Holy shit.

125
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,440
Hey, Ranger, I'd like to apologise.

126
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,473
I didn't mean to barge in on you
this morning.

127
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,715
You can't outrun me. I got superchargers.

128
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,796
Oh, yeah?

129
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,275
Supercharge this.

130
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,512
Damn!

131
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,596
Oh, piss.

132
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,673
Dammit, Ranger!

133
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,753
Aaah! Oh, sh... Aaargh!

134
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
La pura pinche madre!

135
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,995
Pinche cabrón, Ranger.

136
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,033
Daddy!

137
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,720
- Daddy, hey!
- Hey, sugar.

138
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,879
Hey, what's this, huh?

139
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,595
- About time you stopped by.
- I thought you might like to go riding.

140
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,790
- You mean it?
- I'm takin' the day off.

141
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,751
All right!

142
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,189
- I didn't know you took days off.
- Hi, Molly.

143
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,915
- Where have you been, stranger?
- I've been real busy.

144
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,635
- Oh, boy. Same old trouble?
- My kinda trouble doesn't take vacations.

145
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,912
- Aren't you gonna tell Dad the big news?
- Oh, honey.

146
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,632
Mom, I...

147
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,399
What news?

148
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,071
- Jim, I got a real good job in Las Cruces.
- Las Cruces?

149
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,589
We're gonna move there in two weeks.

150
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,158
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.

151
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,431
I'm an independent woman now
and I got my own life to live.

152
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,279
I know, but you can
make your life right here.

153
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,198
Oh, Jim.

154
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,598
One day you're gonna meet some real
nice gal who won't mind sitting up nights,

155
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,759
waitin' to see if you're
gonna come home in one piece.

156
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,395
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's a nice town, it'll be good for Sally.

157
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,674
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.

158
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,516
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Bobby Drew.

159
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,959
Boyfriend?

160
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,030
I heard a lot about you. You were in the
Marines, won a Silver Star and everything.

161
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,749
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

162
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,590
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope
you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?

163
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,631
Uh, yeah, sure.

164
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,593
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

165
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,960
Bye. See you later.

166
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,876
Bye, Mom! See ya!

167
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,115
I'm ready to take Foxy out now.

168
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,277
- Just be patient.
- OK.

169
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,152
All right. I'm ready to go.

170
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,431
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

171
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,711
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

172
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,638
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

173
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,030
Hey. How'd you like to
bite that in the butt,

174
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,196
develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?

175
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,118
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

176
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,912
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

177
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,679
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

178
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,920
just before he got himself squashed
in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

179
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,828
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

180
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,951
But nobody can prove it.

181
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,471
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.

182
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,558
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

183
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,910
- Sally!
- Foxy!

184
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,879
- Sally!
- Help me!

185
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,675
Help!

186
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,833
It's all right. It's OK.

187
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,913
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

188
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,471
Thank you.

189
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,194
- What's your name?
- Sally.

190
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,471
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

191
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,993
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

192
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,430
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

193
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,718
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

194
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,718
And now you're my partner.

195
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,593
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

196
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,836
Pretty good.

197
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,633
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

198
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,149
Is that right?

199
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,035
Ranger Brown. Sally.

200
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,118
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

201
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,275
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

202
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,916
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

203
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,352
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

204
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,755
Good.

205
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,676
Hey, Foxy.

206
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,909
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

207
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,556
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

208
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,830
Gallop. Let's go.

209
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,518
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

210
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,070
But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see

211
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,270
There's a woman from El Paso and I
know she will be comin' here this evening

212
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,590
She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'

213
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,158
There's another girl from Dallas...

214
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,470
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

215
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,556
Forget it.

216
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,751
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

217
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,357
It's Rawley showing off.

218
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,310
This should be very interesting.

219
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,510
I see we are graced with the presence
of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.

220
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,876
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

221
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,396
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

222
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,475
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.

223
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,034
You are a greaser, aren't you?

224
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,236
Excuse me a minute.

225
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,992
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

226
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,111
Let me show you.

227
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,196
Come on, tough guy.

228
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,839
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

229
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,633
Do you wanna join the fun?

230
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,993
This is not my idea of fun!

231
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,473
Please let me apologise. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

232
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,558
Maybe you need some new friends.

233
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,031
Music! Play!

234
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,878
This was my party.

235
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,835
We should have booked those bastards.

236
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,557
If I locked up every guy who took a swing
at me, half the county'd be behind bars.

237
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,912
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

238
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,113
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

239
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,879
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

240
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,597
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

241
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,556
I'll drive.

242
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,953
Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.

243
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,230
Not too popular, are you?

244
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,635
They understand me.

245
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,479
Por favor.

246
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,957
Una botella de mezcal, dos limones
y si me puede limpiar la mesa. Gracias.

247
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,548
- Mezcal?
- Yes.

248
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,114
How about a kiss, baby?

249
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,276
Excuse me.

250
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,875
Time to leave.

251
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,518
Watch out!

252
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,873
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.

253
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,075
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.

254
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,794
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.

255
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,117
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.

256
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,549
OK.

257
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,113
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!

258
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,198
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.

259
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,279
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.

260
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,277
Stay here.

261
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,356
Bobby?

262
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,430
Holy shit.

263
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,916
Let's get out of here.

264
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,756
Get down.

265
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,431
What do you guys want?

266
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,872
No!

267
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,560
Bobby! No!

268
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,755
See you around.

269
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,671
Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?

270
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,115
- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, 6R1.

271
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,518
We've got a multiple fatality and injury
on I-10 south of Estelline.

272
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,676
I'm going home. Is there anyone closer?

273
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,952
Negative. You'd better go. We've been
notified that your daughter's involved.

274
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,036
My daughter?

275
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,515
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.

276
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,676
Ranger! Wait!

277
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,110
Please. She needs rest.

278
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,549
She was very lucky.

279
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,199
Bobby...

280
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,756
Bueno.

281
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,519
Howdy, Ranger.

282
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
The feds. They've taken over.

283
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,948
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.

284
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,674
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.

285
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,872
I'm sorry about your daughter,
but this is a federal case.

286
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,195
From now on, it's out of your jurisdiction.

287
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,073
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.

288
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,269
Excuse me. Get it to the lab. I want a
ballistics report. Let's see what we got.

289
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,119
I guess this is his show.

290
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,870
There were pages blowin'
all over the place when I got here.

291
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,753
I kept this one.

292
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,599
It's a logbook page from an army convoy.

293
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,676
Fort Nelson.

294
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,595
Ranger?

295
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,470
- Hello. Lieutenant Dade, Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.

296
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,118
I'm calling to verify that shipment
number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

297
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,798
Yes, sir, it certainly did.

298
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,674
- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.

299
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,791
- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.

300
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,036
- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.

301
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,197
- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?

302
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,153
- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?

303
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,430
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?

304
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,154
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?

305
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,272
I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.

306
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,278
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

307
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,439
Follow me.

308
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,430
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

309
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,552
- Who?
- The military central computer.

310
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,832
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

311
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,835
- Shit. - If you get it figured
out, kid, let me know.

312
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,999
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

313
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,755
I got it.

314
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,473
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

315
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,589
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

316
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,193
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

317
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,238
Here's our little Judas goat.

318
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,508
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

319
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,949
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

320
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,629
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

321
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,073
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

322
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,033
Let's go.

323
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,798
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

324
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,399
What?

325
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,914
You're learning, kid.

326
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,475
I see I got a lot more to learn.

327
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,319
Come on, kid.

328
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,396
Son of a bitch.

329
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,156
Whoops.

330
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,313
Senora?

331
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,876
Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?

332
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,196
Gracias.

333
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,032
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

334
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,230
Watch it!

335
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,388
Round the front.

336
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,512
Muchas gracias.

337
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,275
Goddammit! Shit!

338
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,272
Don't!

339
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,198
- No! No!
- Come on!

340
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,113
Come on.

341
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,357
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

342
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,917
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

343
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,754
You're gettin' more slippery all the time,
ain't you?

344
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,919
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

345
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,439
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

346
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,198
You son of a bitch!

347
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,436
Can I borrow that contraption?

348
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,999
Sure.

349
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,913
What are you gonna do?

350
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,912
Stop! Wait!

351
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,550
Got something to say, pissant?

352
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,434
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

353
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,073
Emilio Falcon?

354
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,237
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

355
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,796
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

356
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,516
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

357
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,157
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico, to
Central America, to terrorists and stuff!

358
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,589
All over the place.

359
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,597
I don't know.

360
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,952
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

361
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,714
Please? Please?

362
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,593
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

363
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:31,477
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

364
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,750
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.

365
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,474
It has been my pleasure, JJ.

366
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,915
Hang onto him till I get back.

367
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,430
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Senor Falcon.

368
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,314
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

369
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,396
Bueno.

370
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,559
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

371
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,595
What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.

372
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,911
What the hell...?

373
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,996
Damn!

374
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,749
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

375
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,668
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

376
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,193
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

377
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,231
What's this?

378
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,316
Vitamins.

379
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,710
Where's my beer?

380
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,395
In the garbage.

381
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,911
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

382
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,876
Lady...

383
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,437
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

384
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,557
Fine. That's just fine.

385
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,636
Adios.

386
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,232
Shit.

387
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,798
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

388
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,396
Look, uh...

389
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,638
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

390
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,635
What I mean is...

391
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,315
Lola, I...

392
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,636
I'm sorry.

393
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,036
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

394
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,996
Yeah, I know.

395
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,595
Hey! I'm not the trash.

396
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,039
OK, you're asking for it.

397
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,717
OK. Here.

398
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,396
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

399
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,272
Hey.

400
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,430
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

401
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,710
As you can see, mine's bigger.

402
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,274
Mine's loaded.

403
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,076
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

404
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,111
Damn!

405
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,196
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

406
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,791
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

407
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,595
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

408
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,518
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

409
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,870
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.

410
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,630
However the certain party who is stealing
the guns was once a close friend of mine.

411
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,877
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

412
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,072
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...

413
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,832
Why am I telling you this? You will find
these things out for yourself in good time.

414
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,590
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.

415
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,999
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

416
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:30,070
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having
a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.

417
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,517
Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.

418
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,270
I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now.

419
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,839
- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.

420
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,032
That line's been reported out of order.

421
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,798
Mm-hm.

422
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,196
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

423
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,278
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

424
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,916
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

425
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,430
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

426
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,686
You didn't win here. I'm gonna
take a little bit of your money.

427
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:14,396
How much this time?

428
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,399
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.

429
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,829
Sit still, boy!

430
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,512
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.

431
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,003
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly

432
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:30,839
inferior to mine, but
you're going to like it.

433
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,238
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

434
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,033
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

435
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,869
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

436
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,438
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

437
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,030
You don't play cards, you play people.

438
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,549
Loose lips sink ships.

439
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,830
You understand?

440
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,633
I thought you would.

441
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,957
I just play the cards good and tight.

442
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,674
Oh, fuck!

443
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,879
No! Don't kill me!

444
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,754
Dakota! You all right?

445
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,952
Dakota! Answer me!

446
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,988
Kayo.

447
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,752
Kayo?

448
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,236
It's OK, kid.

449
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,397
Captain.

450
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,432
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

451
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,432
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

452
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,793
- Feds.
- You better read this.

453
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,909
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

454
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,749
You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

455
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,998
They provide every damn terrorist
organisation in the world with our guns.

456
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,793
I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.

457
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,710
You withheld evidence, harboured
a key witness in a federal investigation,

458
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,709
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

459
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,070
I've no choice but to put you on probation.

460
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,716
You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

461
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,876
You want my star, Captain?

462
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,072
That won't be necessary. Not yet.

463
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,360
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?

464
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,592
Jim...

465
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,556
What's wrong?

466
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,513
Nothing worth talking about.

467
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,751
Hey.

468
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,189
Hey.

469
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,470
Are you OK?

470
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,155
Yeah, I'm OK.

471
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,555
Lola!

472
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,039
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.

473
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,992
Damn.

474
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,792
Jim?

475
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,954
Come on. Let's go home.

476
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,952
I'll see you soon, honey.

477
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,039
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.

478
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,115
I don't wanna leave you.

479
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,078
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

480
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,514
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

481
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,916
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

482
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,953
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

483
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,788
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

484
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,708
Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

485
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,799
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

486
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,119
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

487
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,313
See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

488
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,350
Get to the point.

489
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,598
I know they got a drop-off point
somewhere between here and Big Bend.

490
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,157
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.

491
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,990
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

492
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,153
There are no roads up here.

493
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,478
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.

494
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,433
We'd better turn back.

495
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,876
See somethin'?

496
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,031
Take us down over there.

497
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,715
There's been some activity here. Pretty
well-organised for the middle of nowhere.

498
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,991
There's nothing
indicated here on the map.

499
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,552
What's goin' on?

500
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,231
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

501
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,878
Well, Ranger, how does it feel
to be baby-sitting Burnside?

502
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,468
Candy-ass feds.

503
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,510
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

504
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,952
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine
by me. - Who the hell does he think he is?

505
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,200
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

506
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,437
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?

507
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,319
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

508
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,871
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

509
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,477
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

510
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,591
What the hell...?

511
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,675
Hang on.

512
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,749
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

513
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,040
Let's go.

514
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,674
A real pretty setup, huh?

515
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,400
It's been too easy.

516
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,876
Let's check around
before we make a move.

517
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,198
Burnside, hold it.

518
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,992
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

519
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,839
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

520
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,837
Get down!

521
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,559
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

522
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,753
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

523
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,275
You son of a bitch!

524
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,676
Now this is my idea of fun.

525
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,351
Rawley, that's enough!

526
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:58,349
Look, darling. I have a surprise for you.
One of your new friends.

527
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,549
Rawley, please! Rawley!

528
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,240
I waited a long time for this.

529
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,636
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

530
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,709
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

531
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,270
Get her out of here.

532
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,675
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

533
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,399
Pick him up.

534
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,915
Put him in it.

535
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,829
Something to remember you by.

536
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,552
Adios.

537
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,395
Freeze, assholes!

538
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,433
Ranger!

539
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,755
You son of a bitch!

540
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,636
Ranger!

541
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,638
Ranger?

542
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,197
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!

543
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,395
Get me a beer, kid.

544
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,876
Yes, sir!

545
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,593
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?

546
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,593
Whose idea was this, anyway?

547
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,399
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

548
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,638
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.

549
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,038
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

550
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,798
Oh, Jim.

551
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,473
I'll take care of this.

552
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,154
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr" McQuade?
May I come in, please?

553
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,556
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.

554
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:44,789
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.

555
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,391
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.

556
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,035
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!

557
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,391
It's his way of saying
he would enjoy your company again.

558
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,511
I want my daughter back, Falcon.

559
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,116
Please, please. I'm more than willing
to help you retrieve your loved one,

560
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,959
providing, of course,
that you return the favour.

561
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,355
What's your deal?

562
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,473
I will tell you precisely where
you can find Mr Wilkes and your daughter.

563
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,469
However, in return I would like
certain assets of mine protected.

564
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,512
I wish to claim what is mine.

565
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,957
Jim...

566
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,355
Anything. Please.

567
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,831
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.

568
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,952
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.

569
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,436
- Hold on. I'm comin'.
- It's not your fight.

570
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,515
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!

571
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,709
Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.

572
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,391
Gracias. Muchas gracias.

573
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,795
- Se lo lleno, senor?
- Sí.

574
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,232
Vaya con Dios. God protect you.

575
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,636
Senor?

576
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,433
They are wishing you well.

577
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:49,311
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?

578
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,470
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.

579
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,475
You gotta be kidding.

580
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,317
Hey. You guys remember me?

581
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,352
How we gonna
smuggle him back to Texas?

582
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,833
That's your problem.

583
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,638
Can you make it?

584
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,833
I didn't come this far
just to drop dead on the trail, did I?

585
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,918
It's all downhill from here on.

586
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,710
OK!

587
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,390
We split up from here. Stick to the plan.

588
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,715
- Right.
- Good luck.

589
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,796
Hello, Sally. How you doing?

590
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:49,199
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?

591
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,275
Rawley...

592
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,235
Daddy! Daddy!

593
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,152
Jim...

594
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,433
I'm so happy you're alive.

595
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,598
Where do you think you're going, dude?

596
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,798
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough
round here. - McQuade.

597
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,515
Get that crap off.

598
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,509
Let's get out of here.

599
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,119
Sally! Sally!

600
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,355
Remember me, greaser?

601
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,358
Yeah. I never forget an asshole.

602
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,874
Stay here.

603
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,355
Oh, shit.

604
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,038
Dammit.

605
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,995
Agh!

606
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,039
Come on. Come on.

607
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,552
Damn! I knew I forgot something.

608
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,314
Welcome to my hacienda, Mr McQuade.

609
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,793
How nice of you to pay a social visit.

610
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,838
Daddy!

611
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,472
Daddy!

612
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,751
Come on.

613
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,870
- Daddy!
- No! Sally! Sally!

614
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,911
No! Stop it!

615
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,834
Sally! Sally...

616
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,719
Are you all right, honey?

617
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,875
Gimme that gun.

618
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,117
- McQuade!
- Rawley! No!

619
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,476
Come on.

620
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,476
Jim...

621
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,034
I didn't betray you.

622
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:23,639
Rawley killed my husband
and forced me to be his partner.

623
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,196
I had no choice. He would have killed me.

624
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,879
I love you.

625
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,078
Hey, McQuade!

626
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,672
Daddy...

627
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:59,559
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?

628
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,389
Don't move, don't talk,
and everything will be just fine.

629
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,874
We made a deal, McQuade.

630
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,833
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.

631
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,194
You wanna try for three?

632
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,032
McQuade, wait. Wait!

633
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:24,197
You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?

634
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,269
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.

635
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,233
You can't leave me! McQuade!

636
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,839
McQuade!

637
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,837
Wait! McQuade!

638
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,350
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!

639
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,950
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!

640
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,598
Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

641
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,439
And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

642
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,233
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

643
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,955
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

644
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,509
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

645
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:23,031
I feel responsible for every move he's
made. After all, I taught him all he knows.

646
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,596
- He has style. The best always have style.
- Bullshit.

647
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,676
Daddy!

648
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,189
- Dad!
- That's my girl.

649
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,791
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

650
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,433
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

651
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,870
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

652
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,436
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

653
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:51,033
Oh, boy. Here we go.

654
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:02,399
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

655
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,592
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

656
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,030
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

657
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,636
Daddy?

658
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,795
Hostages?

659
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,712
Daddy?

660
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,796
Are you comin'?

661
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,870
See you later. Let's go.

662
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,673
JJ McQuade, you'll never change!

663
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,555
Oh, hell.

664
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,591
