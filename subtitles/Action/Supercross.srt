K.C. drive on security.

11
00:01: 19,680 -->00:01: 21,306
The old school.

12
00:01: 28,161 -->00:01: 30,767
The big dream is
Supercrossmästerskapet.

13
00:01: 31,392 -->00:01: 33,611
Indoor, outdoors…

14
00:01: 34,560 -->00:01: 35,977
Everything.

15
00:01: 39,008 -->00:01: 42,107
It was our father's dream,
now is the our.

16
00:01: 42,709 -->00:01: 47,708
My ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Supercross!

17
00:03: 17,312 -->00:03: 20,956
Over the handle-bar!
It must hurt!

18
00:04: 56,607 -->00:05: 00,698
What holds you on with?
Lower the volume!

19
00:05: 05,247 -->00:05: 06,246
Trip…

20
00:05: 09,771 -->00:05: 12,214
- what is it?
- is you efterbliven?

21
00:05: 12,319 -->00:05: 14,392
- up from the pool!
- jump in, the brother.

22
00:05: 14,495 -->00:05: 17,015
You are an idiot.

23
00:05: 21,407 -->00:05: 24,847
It sucks to last shortly.

24
00:05: 25,311 -->00:05: 27,580
It is not across wrong that
your head is so big!

25
00:05: 27,679 -->00:05: 30,614
You have snot over the entire nose!
Tune me clear it at you!

26
00:05: 30,719 -->00:05: 32,796
Tickles?

27
00:05: 36,863 -->00:05: 39,474
Has you dropped håven, K.C.,
or has you entirely simple party?

28
00:05: 41,375 -->00:05: 43,006
You may cope with yourself.

29
00:05: 43,999 -->00:05: 46,268
Wait!
How could the last my error?

30
00:05: 46,367 -->00:05: 48,538
- you jumped in the pool!
- you jumped in far too after!

31
00:05: 48,639 -->00:05: 53,014
We do not have councils to lose the jobs!
We have to lease. We have hojarna.

32
00:05: 53,120 -->00:05: 54,908
You take kåI on me.

33
00:05: 55,007 -->00:05: 56,106
I mean seriousness, Trip.

34
00:05: 56,927 -->00:06: 00,058
I would become disappointed about
your attitude acts about the job.

35
00:06: 00,158 -->00:06: 02,297
But it does not do it.
It acts about the bride.

36
00:06: 02,399 -->00:06: 04,309
- it does not act about the bride!
- it does it certain. She reminds you.

37
00:06: 15,774 -->00:06: 19,046
Good lord! What is you cautious for?
Can you small her?

38
00:06: 19,327 -->00:06: 22,589
You know where she lives.
She stays overnight longly my class.

39
00:06: 22,687 -->00:06: 24,988
It is as racing.
Without danger, no award.

40
00:06: 25,087 -->00:06: 28,022
You set yourself always for danger.
Each is your awards?

41
00:06: 29,100 -->00:06: 29,981
See on me.

42
00:06: 31,839 -->00:06: 33,661
Come again, K.C.
Cowardly not from.

43
00:06: 33,759 -->00:06: 35,478
You have searched in each other
in several weeks.

44
00:06: 35,513 -->00:06: 37,220
Take the first stage.

45
00:06: 37,854 -->00:06: 40,506
And I say you, she sitter
home and waits the wide telephone.

46
00:06: 40,608 -->00:06: 43,990
But you your coward dials not even.
I take a shower, OK?

47
00:06: 44,095 -->00:06: 47,652
Take while it it now. Chuy and cataract comes
here and chatters motorcycle konvertering.

48
00:06: 47,840 -->00:06: 49,503
Supermoto!

49
00:06: 50,430 -->00:06: 52,819
First place wins 1000 dollars,
and we need the money.

50
00:06: 52,927 -->00:06: 56,339
It is one Supermoto competition.
I know not even each I will begin.

51
00:06: 56,575 -->00:06: 58,991
I would begin with frambromsen.

52
00:07: 00,159 -->00:07: 03,225
The clevis are OK. You come
away without hijacking down them.

53
00:07: 03,327 -->00:07: 05,214
In shallow and bottom
acts everything about this.

54
00:07: 05,311 -->00:07: 07,416
Everything you need is 17 " and
racing slicks.

55
00:07: 07,519 -->00:07: 10,957
- ÄIskling, licking costs approximately 50 each.
- and?

56
00:07: 10,992 -->00:07: 14,395
- you can use second-hand.
- which second-hand?

57
00:07: 14,495 -->00:07: 16,645
They that you leave here
each time you go to banana.

58
00:07: 17,439 -->00:07: 20,781
- the problem loose.
- I perhaps saves those decks.

59
00:07: 21,502 -->00:07: 24,256
I see? I can save
in a pair months.

60
00:07: 26,559 -->00:07: 30,160
Hello, Zoe.
Do you come to mind me? K.C.

61
00:07: 30,719 -->00:07: 35,836
I slided around in the area and intended
that I would look in… Good lord.

62
00:07: 38,207 -->00:07: 40,030
Sons of a bitch.

63
00:07: 45,215 -->00:07: 46,960
- hello.
- hello.

64
00:07: 47,134 -->00:07: 48,509
What does you here?

65
00:07: 49,663 -->00:07: 51,312
I would only…

66
00:07: 51,711 -->00:07: 54,710
- persecutes you me?
- no, no.

67
00:07: 56,479 -->00:08: 00,340
I intended to put it
here in your mailbox.

68
00:08: 00,447 -->00:08: 03,414
My brother and I will
last with in a competition.

69
00:08: 03,518 -->00:08: 05,491
If you want to that I will come,
why not only question?

70
00:08: 05,599 -->00:08: 08,046
Because you are
quite intimidating.

71
00:08: 09,726 -->00:08: 11,262
Wait only until I
has passed the obstacle.

72
00:08: 38,079 -->00:08: 41,041
You have treated that
the knee since others heatet.

73
00:08: 41,375 -->00:08: 42,864
How bad is it?

74
00:08: 43,295 -->00:08: 46,394
As about someone driven one nåI through it.
Which time is the final?

75
00:08: 46,494 -->00:08: 48,119
We have to 17:00 on ourselves.

76
00:08: 53,439 -->00:08: 55,675
Hallo? Hello.

77

But, come again.

88
00:09: 38,685 -->00:09: 42,002

00:09: 50,046 -->00:09: 52,314
Special not on one
scrap-heap that yours.

It is so getto. What is that?

00:09: 55,679 -->00:09: 58,493
Oops.

Who is that guy

00:10: 15,005 -->00:10: 17,788
I do not know. I have seen him

103
00:10: 17,886 -->00:10: 20,635
I have seen him also…

00:10: 20,734 -->00:10: 22,248
On one “efterlystaffisch”.

There, we hold to.

111
00:10: 54,077 -->00:10: 56,827
I know that it sees out as one pickup,
but it is actual our stable place.

112
00:10: 56,926 -->00:10: 57,901
Delicate.

- to lose before the girl.

119
00:11: 16,510 -->00:11: 19,062

Squeaks Cole on fourth place,
the only female driver on banana.

131
00:12: 10,654 -->00:12: 13,850

The brothers Carlyle on
others and third place.

135
00:12: 33,342 -->00:12: 35,862
Squeaks Cole choir good on fourth place.

139
00:12: 47,709 -->00:12: 49,466
If you believe that
Owen Cole cuts down…

140
00:12: 49,565 -->00:12: 51,387
It can you forget!

141
00:13: 02,269 -->00:13: 05,081
It is K.C. Carlyle.
Trip Carlyle lies now on trea.

142
00:13: 05,116 -->00:13: 07,893
He tries to take himself past his brother,

146
00:13: 20,957 -->00:13: 24,998
K.C. dives in on the inside of
Cole still once. He copes with it.

147
00:13: 27,298 -->00:13: 30,489

Neither brothers want to give itself.

150
00:13: 41,758 -->00:13: 45,238
It is Carlyle, Carlyle and Cole.
Trip leads.

151
00:13: 45,342 -->00:13: 48,571

258
00:22: 01,787 -->00:22: 04,216
Factory stable gives masses
of things to your drivers.

259
00:22: 04,507 -->00:22: 06,221
You perhaps can may little
of his rests.

Yes, I will intend on the thing.

269

You know, I would do it.

275
00:23: 25,051 -->00:23: 28,166
The problem is only…
that I do not tävla without reason.

276
00:23: 28,668 -->00:23: 30,133
50 dollars.

Why would I will
have such a scrap-heap?

282
00:23: 44,475 -->00:23: 46,726
But we say to sow here.
I can invest the car.

283
00:23: 49,851 -->00:23: 51,064

Come again, Trip!

286
00:24: 57,691 -->00:24: 59,513
Do you know what?
I have nothing more to say.

287
00:24: 59,611 -->00:25: 02,550
Good! I needed
not you to pay the castle.

288
00:25: 02,844 -->00:25: 04,353

It was something new.

00:25: 11,387 -->00:25: 13,523
Then, it is begun again.

292
00:25: 14,491 -->00:25: 16,080
You are better.

293
00:25: 16,667 -->00:25: 18,706

300
00:25: 36,027 -->00:25: 38,141
It is your life,
and you destroy it!

301
00:25: 40,795 -->00:25: 42,617
I as believed that you
did not have anything to say.

302
00:25: 45,339 -->00:25: 47,892
Is you so egoistic and oansvarig-

303
00:25: 47,995 -->00:25: 49,817
- that you do not see how
it influences me?

304
00:26: 06,759 -->00:26: 08,226
San Bernardino County.

305
00:26: 08,261 -->00:26: 11,219

Very high temperatures.

306
00:26: 41,722 -->00:26: 44,822
- sow?
- the hopes are bigger than what I believed.

307
00:26: 44,857 -->00:26: 46,251
Fjädringen hits through all the time.

308
00:26: 48,154 -->00:26: 51,023
Change spring. Unless it works,
so, we change valves, OK?

309
00:26: 51,130 -->00:26: 53,793
Take it to Archie for the valve byte.
I do not want to that you do it.

310
00:26: 53,828 -->00:26: 54,626
Come, Jeff.

316
00:27: 18,362 -->00:27: 20,784
The front wheel has got catch as
about a knife gone up on the crossway.

317
00:27: 20,890 -->00:27: 24,149
I flew over the handle-bar.
Landed with the head first.

355
00:29: 30,529 -->00:29: 32,374
Your father perhaps knows Earl.

00:29: 34,201 -->00:29: 37,016
Yes, it perhaps he did.
But he is dead so that…

357
00:29: 37,113 -->00:29: 41,008
Oh dear. I am sorry.

358
00:29: 41,614 -->00:29: 44,510
We are descended from to bode from
motorcycle kink takes assumes I.

359

Has you something towards to draw
of that leg?

360
00:29: 56,346 -->00:29: 57,111

Can you take it other also?

362
00:30: 06,585 -->00:30: 09,487
Do you want to be single-handed?
You know…

363
00:30: 09,594 -->00:30: 11,593
I can let you to be single-handed and…

364
00:30: 11,866 -->00:30: 15,500
If I would it,
do you believe that I would strippa then?

365
00:30: 17,721 -->00:30: 20,210
Probably not.
Probably not…

366
00:30: 20,313 -->00:30: 21,728
But I only…
Intended that I would ask.

367
00:30: 21,763 -->00:30: 26,111
Typical tickles. When it begins
happened things are they like “Huh”.

368
00:30: 29,817 -->00:30: 31,824
Robbie,
the shadows begin to become long här-

369
00:30: 31,930 -->00:30: 33,517
- this afternoon on
Glen Helen Raceway.

370
00:30: 33,615 -->00:30: 34,827
It has been a hot afternoon.

371
00:30: 34,862 -->00:30: 38,383
It we know is that Rowdy kick-sled's
is fast on itself Team Nami-maskin.

372
00:30: 38,490 -->00:30: 41,686
But check on his stable friend,
K.C. Carlyle, numbers 78, nicks in häl.

373
00:31: 17,561 -->00:31: 19,896
When we now looks out on
banana so sees we Pingree.

374
00:31: 19,993 -->00:31: 24,085
Pingree begins to come loose.
Him must one beonthepointof an eye.

375
00:31: 24,120 -->00:31: 27,696
It is his hemmabana. He wants to
impress on the fan that supports on him.

376
00:31: 27,801 -->00:31: 32,474
But Rowdy kick-sled's, numbers 7.
That 450 Namin stands in flames now.

377
00:31: 32,509 -->00:31: 34,772
Carlyle on other place.
Pingree on third.

378
00:31: 34,873 -->00:31: 36,952
Rowdy kick-sled's wonders what
as is taking place behind him.

379
00:31: 36,987 -->00:31: 38,994
He sees Carlyle and Pingree to fight.

380
00:31: 39,029 -->00:31: 42,103
Check, Pingree leans itself inwards.
He draws down him!

381
00:31: 42,138 -->00:31: 45,089
An elbow in the breast!
I think it seems självklart-

382
00:31: 45,124 -->00:31: 47,135
- what K.C. Carlyle information is.

383
00:31: 47,929 -->00:31: 50,804
MåIflaggan is taken forward
for Rowdy Sparks-

384
00:31: 50,839 -->00:31: 53,680
- when he takes one
profit to for the season.

385
00:31: 57,881 -->00:32: 01,066
K.C. Carlyle takes a report for
the team and ends on fourth place.

386
00:32: 01,593 -->00:32: 03,571
- fourth place.
- it is not bad.

387
00:32: 06,969 -->00:32: 09,030
Come again. He had it.
He could have won.

388
00:32: 14,648 -->00:32: 18,860
I love you, Rowdy.
K.C.

389
00:32: 21,337 -->00:32: 23,540
Wonderful, the guy.
You did exactly as we said.

390
00:32: 32,280 -->00:32: 33,856
In the middle of dot!

391
00:32: 34,361 -->00:32: 36,979
- know on it!
- check on everyone these things.

392
00:32: 37,080 -->00:32: 39,740
- it is ridiculous.
- good-looking, or how?

393
00:32: 40,920 -->00:32: 42,750
No…

394
00:32: 43,416 -->00:32: 45,218
Who believes they will see this?

395
00:32: 45,253 -->00:32: 46,985
You would become astonished.

396
00:32: 47,020 -->00:32: 51,445
You mean as they small Pamela Anderson
wannabes that hangs around your competitions?

397
00:32: 51,544 -->00:32: 54,163
No. They are only
interested of Rowdy.

398
00:32: 54,265 -->00:32: 56,739
I do not believe it lasts long to.

399
00:32: 57,209 -->00:32: 59,380
You should be careful,
for I have consulted att-

400
00:32: 59,481 -->00:33: 04,303

to reject Baywatch-blondiner.

401
00:33: 04,409 -->00:33: 07,224

- sow knows I not about I
has forces enough to stand towards.

403
00:33: 10,125 -->00:33: 11,599
Best for you that you stand towards.

404
00:33: 11,705 -->00:33: 13,639
I would not worry mig-

405
00:33: 13,905 -->00:33: 17,752
- for I begin to know taste for
the more delicate things here in the life.

406
00:33: 26,797 -->00:33: 27,961
Vakna!

407
00:33: 28,245 -->00:33: 31,755

411
00:33: 45,634 -->00:33: 48,622

412
00:33: 49,401 -->00:33: 51,168
When will you grow up?

413
00:33: 51,641 -->00:33: 55,283
När will you finished bait you that one
five-year old and begin to take little responsibility?

414
00:33: 55,318 -->00:33: 58,925
I skim still of pools
for the half hire. Do not forget it.

415
00:33: 58,960 -->00:34: 01,274
Do not care you about it,

416
00:34: 01,309 -->00:34: 04,127
- stop with that shit.
- I take hand about everything häromkring.

417
00:34: 04,162 -->00:34: 07,464
You are a factory driver, and you pay
the hire. Do you decide only for it?

418
00:34: 07,641 -->00:34: 10,739
Bullshit! I win over
you on banana anytime.

419
00:34: 10,841 -->00:34: 14,486
Take you your small superhjältekostym

421
00:35: 13,001 -->00:35: 14,632
The situation?

422
00:35: 15,384 -->00:35: 16,325
The situation?

423
00:36: 14,648 -->00:36: 16,005
It is a delicate big farm.

424
00:36: 16,568 -->00:36: 20,496
Take down that the rice mound
from the car now.

425
00:36: 20,600 -->00:36: 21,786
I will show you around.

426
00:37: 13,912 -->00:37: 17,664
Owen and I farmed to creep
in here on ours minicrossar.

427
00:37: 17,848 -->00:37: 19,888
We farmed to crawl during
the gate over there.

428
00:37: 19,992 -->00:37: 23,069
To ends, the farmer gave us a key.

429
00:37: 23,512 -->00:37: 25,479
He said that it went good,
only we did not break the back of the head.

430
00:37: 25,514 -->00:37: 27,000
Genial.

431
00:37: 27,363 -->00:37: 31,409
Since has we built
a mass hopes and gadgets.

432
00:37: 36,580 -->00:37: 38,005
You has never had a girlfriend.

433
00:37: 41,104 -->00:37: 43,753
- what?
- say that you have had a serious girlfriend.

434
00:37: 44,599 -->00:37: 47,644
I mean, come again. What is…
What means you with “serious girlfriend”?

435
00:37: 47,800 -->00:37: 49,807
- serious…
- one must ask…

436
00:37: 49,911 -->00:37: 52,532
- each wants to you to come?
- there.

437
00:37: 52,567 -->00:37: 55,423
I try to decide
if I only slösa time on you.

438
00:37: 56,152 -->00:37: 58,384
I do not want to to slösa someone's time.

439
00:38: 01,563 -->00:38: 03,083
It is good that you not
tävla såhär uncertain.

440
00:38: 03,118 -->00:38: 05,679
I do not follow you.

441
00:38: 05,783 -->00:38: 06,642
It means you not.

442
00:38: 22,712 -->00:38: 25,153
Good lord.

443
00:38: 33,495 -->00:38: 35,764
OK, each learnt you you that?

444
00:38: 35,864 -->00:38: 38,183
One must only faith itself
to submit itself at it.

445
00:38: 38,584 -->00:38: 40,788
Will it have some type's double sense?

446
00:38: 40,888 -->00:38: 41,767
Do you believe?

447
00:38: 57,431 -->00:38: 59,480
Is that your friend
from banana, squeaks?

448
00:38: 59,991 -->00:39: 02,090
- it was on the time that we might meet.
- yes.

449
00:39: 02,647 -->00:39: 05,626
It is Trip Carlyle.

They come from here.

460
00:39: 40,376 -->00:39: 42,996
We have the the best factory drivers
ready here today, Terry.

461
00:39: 43,927 -->00:39: 45,432
That is Tyler Evans.

462
00:39: 45,847 -->00:39: 47,712
He is one of they
osportsligaste within motocross.

463
00:39: 48,791 -->00:39: 50,511
Directions him out from me, OK?

464
00:39: 51,224 -->00:39: 52,988
It is your job today.

465
00:39: 53,687 -->00:39: 55,972
- OK?
- yes, then.

466
00:39: 56,644 -->00:39: 58,172
I take hand about him.

467
00:40: 02,679 -->00:40: 04,468
They line up now before
250-kubikstävlingen.

468
00:40: 04,567 -->00:40: 09,990
Numbers 7, Rowdy kick-sled's. His stable friend
K.C. Carlyle on the outside, numbers 78.

469
00:40: 10,025 -->00:40: 11,891
Check on Tyler Evans, numbers 58.

470
00:40: 11,926 -->00:40: 14,907
Remembered, it to finns no eroticism between
Evans and kick-sled's.

471
00:40: 14,942 -->00:40: 16,670
He costed him
mästerskapet the previous year.

472
00:40: 16,705 -->00:40: 18,238
Who belongs to you?

473
00:40: 20,310 -->00:40: 22,645
I dejtar actual K.C. Carlyle.

474
00:40: 22,743 -->00:40: 26,605
OK, you are such a there
“I do not belong to anyone” - girl.

475
00:40: 26,712 -->00:40: 27,797
Forgive?

476
00:40: 28,888 -->00:40: 30,862
Your shoes cost a lot,
but you are nevertheless one of us.

477
00:40: 30,966 -->00:40: 34,382
Within five seconds.
When the flag falls…

478
00:40: 34,488 -->00:40: 37,586
There, it came! Spärren comes
be expended and they drive away!

479
00:40: 37,686 -->00:40: 40,818
The most important part of
banana is the start.

480
00:40: 40,919 -->00:40: 44,235
- good hope of Rowdy kick-sled's.
- but check what as hands.

481
00:40: 44,343 -->00:40: 47,442
K.C. Carlyle begins meagre in on
numbers 58, Tyler Evans.

482
00:40: 47,543 -->00:40: 51,589
He blocks him!
58, Evans's gets a wretched start!

483
00:40: 51,991 -->00:40: 53,768
Evans lies at the end in the first curve.

484
00:40: 53,803 -->00:40: 58,379
Rowdy kick-sled's drives against what that can
become his first mästerskapstitel.

485
00:41: 11,128 -->00:41: 12,585
Good worked, weapon drawing clean.

486
00:41: 18,207 -->00:41: 20,655
Consult you rövhåI,
why did you block me in the start?

487
00:41: 20,759 -->00:41: 23,846
- I should flog you now direct.
- it is called racing, Tyler.

488
00:41: 25,278 -->00:41: 28,468
Forget him. He is only sour in order to
he may not take home pokalen.

489
00:41: 28,567 -->00:41: 29,324
Good worked.

490
00:41: 30,998 -->00:41: 32,603
Revenge is hard!

491
00:41: 34,326 -->00:41: 36,594
- is you OK?
- yes, it is lugnt.

492
00:41: 36,854 -->00:41: 39,122
- K.C.
- do not put you in, Zoe!

493
00:41: 39,703 -->00:41: 42,478
Good lord!
Give me little breathing-space.

494
00:41: 45,559 -->00:41: 47,056
How long has you driven?

495
00:41: 47,478 -->00:41: 50,959
- father began to learn us when we where five.
- has you something jobs?

496
00:41: 52,759 -->00:41: 53,793
I clean pools.

497
00:41: 54,194 -->00:41: 55,626
Are you good on it?

498
00:41: 58,167 -->00:42: 00,999
- no, not direct.
- become it then.

499
00:42: 01,048 -->00:42: 04,265
For it is only round 100 guys
in the world that lives on driving cross.

500
00:42: 06,007 -->00:42: 09,178
I have seen the figures.
They do not intimidate me.

501
00:42: 10,231 -->00:42: 12,053
You let as everyone other
private drivers I know.

502
00:42: 12,151 -->00:42: 14,573
Buy one hoj, be with in
a race and become a legend.

503
00:42: 14,679 -->00:42: 16,980
It is the levels.

504
00:42: 17,078 -->00:42: 18,704
A dream is what it is.

505
00:42: 18,807 -->00:42: 21,011
- you have fairly.
- it is a damn thing.

506
00:42: 21,111 -->00:42: 24,853
To drive against the factory stables can
last really intimidating.

507
00:42: 24,951 -->00:42: 27,188
They have more talang, better hojar.

508
00:42: 27,287 -->00:42: 29,228
While they accustom on
your private banor-

509
00:42: 29,335 -->00:42: 33,393
- is we up and choir our trucks until next
week's competition, and everything is paid from own pocket.

510
00:42: 33,494 -->00:42: 37,192
I do not know. You know,
Rick Ryan, Daytona, 1987.

511
00:42: 37,686 -->00:42: 40,885
Rick each one private driver, fighting,
evil about money, precise as us.

512
00:42: 41,239 -->00:42: 44,634
Apart from that day,
it rained before the first travel.

513
00:42: 44,982 -->00:42: 48,198
And it does a poor chute still poorer.

514
00:42: 48,233 -->00:42: 51,414
But Rick drives on and wins one heat.

515
00:42: 52,968 -->00:42: 55,367
Entire sudden tävla he against
the big guys.

516
00:42: 55,638 -->00:42: 59,476
But the problem on that time was
that the chutes were as swamps.

517
00:42: 59,574 -->00:43: 02,616
They went down for bill.
Yamaha, Honda. All crashed.

518
00:43: 03,062 -->00:43: 04,720
But Rick stood with it.

519
00:43: 06,134 -->00:43: 07,567
He won the entire shit.

520
00:43: 08,311 -->00:43: 13,477
That day so won a private driver
the world's toughest Supercrosstävling.

521
00:43: 14,326 -->00:43: 15,466
David hit Goliat.

522
00:43: 15,501 -->00:43: 18,373
Precise! It is the dream.

523
00:43: 18,839 -->00:43: 21,645
It is the dream.
And history repeats itself.

524
00:43: 21,846 -->00:43: 26,044
Trips father has been one Raven…
Up in Lancaster.

525
00:43: 26,050 -->00:43: 28,490
It is correct. Jack.

526
00:43: 29,271 -->00:43: 31,572
- Jack Carlyle.
- yes.

527
00:43: 31,671 -->00:43: 33,558
I remember old Jack Carlyle.

528
00:43: 33,974 -->00:43: 36,399
- we farmed to party with them precipices in one.
- I see?

529
00:43: 37,894 -->00:43: 39,191
Come here.

530
00:44: 01,526 -->00:44: 03,459
Tune us speak seriousness a while.

531
00:44: 05,271 -->00:44: 07,301
How will you clear it to Supercross?

532
00:44: 07,947 -->00:44: 09,046
I do not know.

533
00:44: 09,366 -->00:44: 11,902
Get my pro licence.
Take a travel in taken.

534
00:44: 12,278 -->00:44: 14,100
It can take a while.

535
00:44: 14,198 -->00:44: 17,321
Yes. Hurså?
Do you know a faster ways?

536
00:44: 23,606 -->00:44: 25,033
What?

537
00:44: 29,635 -->00:44: 32,501
This takes you in in the game.
How long you agree to it depends on yourself.

538
00:44: 34,742 -->00:44: 38,484
I borrow out it to you now,
on my conditions.

539
00:44: 39,926 -->00:44: 41,086
OK, what had you intended you?

540
00:44: 41,121 -->00:44: 45,143
When you are with me so tävla you on
Sundays, and is on gymmet on Mondays.

541
00:44: 45,178 -->00:44: 49,165
No spirits, no drugs. I provide you
with all motorcycle related.

542
00:44: 49,270 -->00:44: 51,092
We divide all profits 50-50.

543
00:44: 52,375 -->00:44: 55,244
The only other thing is:
cancel not your common jobs.

544
00:44: 58,200 -->00:44: 59,636
Decided.

545
00:45: 02,414 -->00:45: 03,445
Good lord.

546
00:45: 17,270 -->00:45: 19,519
It is a big evening here on
Team Namis mound blocks.

547
00:45: 19,554 -->00:45: 23,441
Sow big, the previous master Rick Johnson Johnson and
his Ijuvliga wife Stephanie is present.

548
00:45: 23,542 -->00:45: 25,462
It must feel as déjà vu for you.

549
00:45: 25,558 -->00:45: 27,828
A good stable, but a guy
drive against toppen-

550
00:45: 27,925 -->00:45: 29,497
- and it was you pursue ten years since.

551
00:45: 29,532 -->00:45: 34,451
- majority has compared you with Rowdy kick-sled's.
- yes, but he is slow.

552
00:45: 34,550 -->00:45: 35,725
- precise what I mean.
- oh!

553
00:45: 36,854 -->00:45: 38,515
Come here. Come here.
It is your boyfriend.

554
00:45: 38,646 -->00:45: 41,205
One cannot compare us.
He is old and slow.

555
00:45: 42,294 -->00:45: 45,246
My question is,
each is your invitation?

556
00:45: 45,270 -->00:45: 47,093
Ten years are a long time, hemmagrabben.

557
00:45: 47,190 -->00:45: 49,612
I perhaps will take out you and sensible
how the old school functions?

558
00:45: 49,718 -->00:45: 51,156
You must have hit in the head
a pair aisles.

559
00:45: 52,310 -->00:45: 55,572
Rowdy, very little esteem
there between your two tuffingar.

560
00:45: 56,303 -->00:45: 59,052
It is horrible.
I go and puts myself.

561
00:46: 02,710 -->00:46: 06,671
Florida brummar of
Supercross the series in stadion!

562
00:46: 06,773 -->00:46: 09,010
Trip Carlyle, 238,
Hog Heaven Honda-

563
00:46: 09,110 -->00:46: 11,755
- leads today's kvalheat.

564
00:46: 11,926 -->00:46: 13,478
Check what fast he is!

565
00:46: 14,645 -->00:46: 18,705
Tune me compare with some of they previous
training times thickset of the world stars.

566
00:46: 18,740 -->00:46: 22,736
Chad Reed drove on 59.8,
and Rowdy kick-sled's on 59.7.

567
00:46: 22,838 -->00:46: 25,451
Carlyle is a private driver.
He pays everything alone.

568
00:46: 25,486 -->00:46: 29,051
It eats his own money.
He does not be included in something stables.

569
00:46: 29,086 -->00:46: 32,617
When man pays from own pocket
so, each is counted varv.

570
00:46: 32,652 -->00:46: 36,071
And he can this chute.
See how there he is.

571
00:46: 41,685 -->00:46: 44,369
Trip impresses actually on me.
He is a guy from the desert.

572
00:46: 44,469 -->00:46: 47,371
He is used to wide loose concrete,
not so here hard packed.

573
00:46: 47,478 -->00:46: 50,707
- what became it?
- Earl, I might 59.3. What might you?

574
00:46: 53,397 -->00:46: 56,877
I got it to 59 blank.
The guy drives to sow it ryker.

575
00:46: 56,982 -->00:46: 58,805
59 seconds blank!

576
00:46: 58,903 -->00:47: 00,625
He drives as if he was included in a stable.

577
00:47: 00,725 -->00:47: 04,041
Trip Carlyle has actually one
future within this sport.

578
00:47: 04,150 -->00:47: 06,449
Did you consult about your brother?
He is clear to the central competition.

579
00:47: 07,061 -->00:47: 09,517
You joke?
I consulted that he kvalade-

580
00:47: 09,621 -->00:47: 12,611
- but not that he went on.
- today's quickest varv.

581
00:47: 16,565 -->00:47: 18,933
Hit the broken shit.
It has gone four hours, the entire day.

582
00:47: 19,029 -->00:47: 22,542
Come again, Chuy! It takes five
seconds to tighten the screw son of a bitch.

583
00:47: 22,645 -->00:47: 25,411
Squeaks, take your boyfriend
on a walk.

584
00:47: 26,710 -->00:47: 29,756
Come, Trip. We go a turn.

585
00:47: 30,409 -->00:47: 32,943
Rowdy kick-sled's, K.C. Carlyle-

586
00:47: 33,046 -->00:47: 35,893
- you have won three of five
competitions to Nami Racing.

587
00:47: 35,990 -->00:47: 39,050
- it goes as on rail for your.
- no hesitation. I drive really good now.

588
00:47: 39,085 -->00:47: 43,376
It is fantastic, K.C. For only two
months since so cleaned you pools.

589
00:47: 43,477 -->00:47: 45,746
Now, you drive pursue it best
the stable in motocross.

590
00:47: 45,845 -->00:47: 48,780
How safe is you on that you go on
to your first Supercrosstävling?

591
00:47: 48,885 -->00:47: 53,490
I am only fond that I have found
a home. The people on Nami…

592
00:47: 53,590 -->00:47: 57,790
Comes few all in America that
will buy one hoj as face.

593
00:47: 58,923 -->00:48: 00,983
Break.
Thanks, tickles.

594
00:48: 04,501 -->00:48: 07,698
Consults you, you believes that you deserved
that profit, nybörjarn?

595
00:48: 08,843 -->00:48: 10,458
Nami does it.

596
00:48: 10,677 -->00:48: 13,045
The stable does not protect you, the pal.

00:59: 20,198 -->00:59: 21,646
Check there.

747
00:59: 22,963 -->00:59: 27,534
- check now.
- .15.

748
00:59: 27,635 -->00:59: 29,725
What stands it?

749
00:59: 31,283 -->00:59: 34,251
- .25.
- at last!

750
00:59: 34,355 -->00:59: 38,097
Utloppsventilerna on these
450-kubikarna does not close really.

751
00:59: 43,163 -->00:59: 44,050
- what is it?
- nothing.

752
00:59: 44,147 -->00:59: 45,753
I did not believe only that I
would have one flickvän-

753
00:59: 45,788 -->00:59: 47,733
- that knew more about
motorcycles than what I do.

754
00:59: 50,034 -->00:59: 51,443
“girlfriend”?

755
00:59: 51,954 -->00:59: 53,640
Yes…

756
00:59: 56,314 -->00:59: 57,784
Or…?

757
01:00: 00,763 -->01:00: 01,729
Yes.

758
01:00: 31,538 -->01:00: 33,669
Still a delicate evening in Las Vegas.

759
01:00: 33,704 -->01:00: 37,661
Up 30 degrees hot.
People play die on Strippen.

760
01:00: 37,906 -->01:00: 41,107
It is what as hands behind
the wings on Supercross.

761
01:00: 41,363 -->01:00: 46,218
My ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Supercross!

762
01:00: 50,562 -->01:00: 52,231
They that risks
most is Team Nami-

763
01:00: 52,339 -->01:00: 54,378
- that hopes that they not
do away itself ikväll-

764
01:00: 54,483 -->01:00: 57,450
- since they dropped
itself försteblockerare, K.C. Carlyle-

765
01:00: 57,554 -->01:01: 00,489
- and has instead picked up one
new talang, 411, Jimmy Castillo.

766
01:01: 08,722 -->01:01: 14,222
The big question now: comes Team Nami
clear itself, or comes they to may to pay?

767
01:01: 14,322 -->01:01: 17,638
For more about this,
tune us abate to Erin Bates.

768
01:01: 17,747 -->01:01: 20,845
I stand the wide initial line there first
heatet goes of the pile within a minute.

769
01:01: 20,946 -->01:01: 23,564
It everyone spoken about today
has been K.C. Carlyle.

770
01:01: 26,963 -->01:01: 28,692
You take it!
Come again!

771
01:01: 29,330 -->01:01: 32,143
You take it, K.C.!
Hold you focused!

772
01:01: 32,243 -->01:01: 35,057
Who comes few last place
in 250-kubikskvalet?

773
01:01: 35,154 -->01:01: 38,253
Just it - the last two places
to do the central competition.

774
01:01: 38,355 -->01:01: 40,875
You perhaps drove a poor heat. It
plays no role. You can cope with it now.

775
01:01: 40,978 -->01:01: 42,801
Only two drivers go furthermore.

776
01:01: 42,898 -->01:01: 45,320
One of the on the initial line
is a new fast driver.

777
01:01: 45,426 -->01:01: 48,426
It others,
a private driver, K.C. Carlyle.

778
01:01: 59,186 -->01:02: 02,153
Through a colossal start
of Hog Heaven Hondan-

779
01:02: 02,259 -->01:02: 04,298
- sow does K.C. Carlyle what he must do.

780
01:02: 04,402 -->01:02: 06,474
Good!
He took the management.

781
01:02: 06,579 -->01:02: 09,121
One wonders,
looks Rowdy kick-sled's on this?

782
01:02: 09,156 -->01:02: 11,664
We abate to
Jamie Little down wide banana.

783
01:02: 11,762 -->01:02: 13,584
Presently, I believe that
Rowdy intends på-

784
01:02: 13,682 -->01:02: 16,016
-100000-dollarchecken
as winning clean får-

785
01:02: 16,113 -->01:02: 18,639
- and 250-kubiksmästerskapet
in Supercross.

786
01:02: 19,123 -->01:02: 21,130
- can someone speak with me.
- there.

787
01:02: 21,234 -->01:02: 24,944
Yours hoj works good, OK?
It is precise as when we tested it.

788
01:02: 25,042 -->01:02: 27,431
Take out it introduces 50000 spectators,
late can you say if it works good.

789
01:02: 27,537 -->01:02: 30,854
There, Rowdy.
Take him on a walk, Jeff.

790
01:02: 30,961 -->01:02: 34,226
- come. Come now.
- it sackar after, you must fix it.

791
01:02: 36,082 -->01:02: 37,969
A last curve for K.C. Carlyle-

792
01:02: 38,066 -->01:02: 41,416
- and it last kvalheatet is his!

793
01:02: 41,618 -->01:02: 44,553
And it is precise what
Team Nami did not want to would happen.

794
01:02: 44,658 -->01:02: 48,104
K.C. Carlyle in same central competition
as Rowdy kick-sled's.

795
01:02: 49,617 -->01:02: 53,360
MåIflagga!
K.C. Carlyle!

796
01:02: 55,059 -->01:02: 57,578
- how goes it?
- as an arrow.

797
01:02: 57,683 -->01:03: 00,529
- and the effect?
- “torques”, I love it. Do nothing change, OK?

798
01:03: 00,626 -->01:03: 03,081
Earl, I must only say…

799
01:03: 03,186 -->01:03: 07,409
You, idiot, it is best that you
holds the eyes open tonight.

800
01:03: 08,450 -->01:03: 10,889
Good-looking sweater, ass pouch.
Do they sell like that to men?

801
01:03: 14,161 -->01:03: 15,987
Do not worry you for him, Carlyle.

802
01:03: 16,401 -->01:03: 18,605
You sheep give him rod about five minutes.

803
01:03: 20,050 -->01:03: 22,482
You must protect Rowdy from the cluster.
Order yourself:

804
01:03: 22,578 -->01:03: 25,295
“what as than hands, sow will not one
son of a bitch come past me. “understood?

805
01:03: 25,394 -->01:03: 26,465
Yes, sir.

806
01:03: 28,650 -->01:03: 29,645
Then, we were igång igen-

807
01:03: 29,746 -->01:03: 31,851
- with lining up before
250-kubikstävlingen.

808
01:03: 31,954 -->01:03: 33,776
And I will say your who
as is eager to may to tävla.

809
01:03: 33,874 -->01:03: 36,939
It is tuffingen, numbers 58,
Tyler Evans.

810
01:03: 43,762 -->01:03: 48,114
Numbers 22, Chad Reed on itself Thornback
Yamaha is extra hungry tonight.

811
01:03: 48,149 -->01:03: 50,448
He wants to in and to tävla against Rowdy kick-sled's.

812
01:03: 59,793 -->01:04: 01,808
- where is he.
- he takes it.

813
01:04: 03,314 -->01:04: 06,478
You know that one says “it as hands
in Vegas stays in Vegas ".

814
01:04: 06,578 -->01:04: 10,091
I do not believe that this historien
stay here after 20 varv.

815
01:04: 20,314 -->01:04: 22,063
30-sekundersskylten is already up.

816
01:04: 22,162 -->01:04: 25,774
When the flag falls aside,
so can spärren be put down anytime.

817
01:04: 25,874 -->01:04: 28,175
They await it.
They begin to become nervous.

818
01:04: 30,322 -->01:04: 33,933
It falls! Everything acts
about the first curve.

819
01:04: 34,034 -->01:04: 36,401
Who that comes in and out from it first.

820
01:05: 02,001 -->01:05: 04,522
K.C. Carlyle may know
on little eroticism there.

821
01:05: 04,626 -->01:05: 07,211
Or will I say a lot
eroticism of Rowdy kick-sled's.

822
01:05: 07,313 -->01:05: 11,111
Kick-sled's prejade him almost of banana.
It submitted no place to Carlyle.

823
01:05: 11,218 -->01:05: 14,218
He could not alternate down sufficiently quickly.
He lies after the central cluster.

824
01:05: 14,321 -->01:05: 16,939
He lies after in the cluster.
He has a lot work before sig-

825
01:05: 17,041 -->01:05: 19,128
- but it is one 20-varvslopp.

826
01:05: 19,163 -->01:05: 20,546
Anything can happen.

827
01:05: 41,938 -->01:05: 45,004
Numbers 7, Rowdy kick-sled's,
lies still in the lead.

828
01:05: 45,106 -->01:05: 50,156
Drivers go down överallt,
and it helps actually K.C. Carlyle.

829
01:05: 50,257 -->01:05: 52,835
The big picture display says everything
- you must gasa on.

830
01:05: 52,870 -->01:05: 55,413
And it is precise what
K.C. Carlyle agreewith on.

831
01:06: 00,817 -->01:06: 04,844
13 drivers before Carlyle,
numbers 7, Rowdy kick-sled's.

832
01:06: 04,945 -->01:06: 06,920
He leads this competition.

833
01:06: 10,114 -->01:06: 13,289
Numbers 58, Tyler Evans.
He has it also tough.

834
01:06: 15,600 -->01:06: 19,398
Evans's drives as a madman.
He is a correct fighter.

835
01:06: 19,505 -->01:06: 21,927
He is not cautious for
to knock you neither…

836
01:06: 22,033 -->01:06: 24,041
He goes outside banana sometimes.

837
01:06: 24,145 -->01:06: 28,749
There, numbers are 411,
Team Namis new drivers, Jimmy Castillo.

838
01:06: 28,849 -->01:06: 30,704
We know that he is up
in order to block others.

839
01:06: 30,802 -->01:06: 32,689
But how good can he do it?

840
01:06: 58,077 -->01:07: 01,032
K.C. Carlyle blew past Tyler Evans.

841
01:07: 01,137 -->01:07: 04,039
- it will not do him fond.
- I spoke with Tyler Evans earlier.

842
01:07: 04,146 -->01:07: 07,920
He is not nervous over that not
win the travel. He is up after revenge.

843
01:07: 08,017 -->01:07: 09,905
Carlyle begins to come for near Rowdy.

844
01:07: 10,002 -->01:07: 11,976
You can last there?
Castillo holds him out.

845
01:07: 12,081 -->01:07: 14,732
Jimmy Castillo has not blocked
sow many ikväll-

846
01:07: 14,833 -->01:07: 17,567
- but it comes it to become change
on the future varven.

847
01:07: 25,745 -->01:07: 28,805
Check on Jimmy Castillo.
He looks over the arbor.

848
01:07: 28,840 -->01:07: 33,481
He knows that he must deserve his salary,
for here comes Carlyle and Evans.

849
01:07: 36,304 -->01:07: 38,094
Only check.
He has it during control.

850
01:07: 43,985 -->01:07: 46,887
Now drives Carlyle on the inside of Castillo.

851
01:07: 46,993 -->01:07: 48,781
Blockerarnas struggle.

852
01:08: 00,786 -->01:08: 02,957
Check on the determination.
Evans holds down the head.

853
01:08: 03,057 -->01:08: 05,775
He klänger itself permanent.
He aims against Carlyle.

854
01:08: 08,185 -->01:08: 12,316
Evans's aims on K.C. Carlyle,
but drives on Castillo instead.

855
01:08: 12,753 -->01:08: 17,761
Carlyle has now sight on Rowdy kick-sled's.
Team Nami cannot be fond over this.

856
01:08: 18,261 -->01:08: 21,927
Now, the two drivers apply.
Stables the driver, Rowdy Sparks-

857
01:08: 22,032 -->01:08: 24,880
- and private pursuing clean, K.C. Carlyle.

858
01:08: 24,977 -->01:08: 27,116
And I believe that
Rowdy kick-sled's is nervous.

859
01:08: 27,217 -->01:08: 29,231
See only on him,
he looks backward.

860
01:08: 37,265 -->01:08: 39,346
Come again. Come again! Drive!

861
01:08: 39,857 -->01:08: 42,759
Everything Carlyle needs to do
is to check innerspåret.

862
01:08: 42,865 -->01:08: 44,872
He is there. He takes the inside.
He takes over the management!

863
01:08: 46,864 -->01:08: 50,184
See up. Now comes Rowdy.
He lies on the outside.

864
01:09: 02,256 -->01:09: 04,558
The placard speaks for itself själv-

865
01:09: 04,657 -->01:09: 06,174
“drive hårt”, K.C. Carlyle.

866
01:09: 06,209 -->01:09: 08,876
It must happen now.
The time begins to run out.

867
01:09: 13,041 -->01:09: 16,205
They change sides all the time.
The inside, the outside. The outside, the inside.

868
01:09: 16,305 -->01:09: 18,410
Both tries to evoke a mistake.

869
01:09: 41,681 -->01:09: 44,942
K.C. Carlyle!
Entire fantasticly!

870
01:09: 45,040 -->01:09: 48,139
He handled hojen
as one BMX-cykel.

871
01:10: 22,319 -->01:10: 25,037
Kick-sled's drives of banana!

872
01:10: 25,136 -->01:10: 30,407
One wonderful inbromsning of Carlyle,
and kick-sled's is up from the game!

873
01:10: 38,896 -->01:10: 43,915
K.C. Carlyle wins
Supercross in Las Vegas!

874
01:11: 06,577 -->01:11: 09,446
About it was some competition you would
win, sow was it this, the guy.

875
01:11: 10,952 -->01:11: 12,684
Do you joke, the pal?

876
01:11: 12,785 -->01:11: 15,534
You did it, the brother!
You did it!

877
01:11: 15,631 -->01:11: 19,144
- we did it, I am obliged you one.
- no. Hold the jaw.

878
01:11: 19,249 -->01:11: 21,484
Up on the pinch stool now,
before they change one ' s mind

879
01:11: 21,584 -->01:11: 23,056
The pinch stool! Come again!

880
01:11: 32,081 -->01:11: 33,585
Do you know a thing?

881
01:11: 35,101 -->01:11: 36,163
What?

882
01:11: 36,656 -->01:11: 38,643
You deserve this.

883
01:11: 53,392 -->01:11: 55,431
I believe it is day's to become well-known.

884
01:12: 00,950 -->01:12: 03,332
Winning verge is K.C. Carlyle!

885
01:12: 06,097 -->01:12: 08,846
The dream went in meeting electricity to see
when K.C. flew in in måI…

886
01:12: 08,943 -->01:12: 10,312
- and he looked never backward.

887
01:12: 11,600 -->01:12: 15,212
We did it together.
Nobody wins single-handed.
