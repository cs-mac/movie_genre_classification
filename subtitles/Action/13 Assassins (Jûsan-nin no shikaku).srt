<i>As feudal Japan enjoys peace
the samurai era is waning.</i>

2
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:45,154
<i>However, this calm is threatened
by the growing power of Lord Naritsugu,</i>

3
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,234
<i>the shogun's sadistic younger brother.</i>

<i>Sir Doi realizes Naritsugu will ruin the shogunate
if he gains higher political standing.</i>

5
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:53,696
<i>Since Naritsugu's evil deeds
are being quickly hushed up,</i>

6
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:54,725
<i>Sir Doi must act.</i>

{\an8}<i>On 5 March of the first year of the Koka Era [1844],
Akashi Clan House Elder Mamiya Zusho commits harakiri.</i>

9
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:52,006
To the shogun,
Mamiya's harakiri was against Lord Naritsugu.

10
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:56,096
Lord Naritsugu was born with a vicious nature.

11
00:02:56,786 --> 00:03:01,436
His lust for flesh and
dishonorable conduct cannot be pardoned.

12
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,386
What should we do?

13
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:09,096
Shogun council elders, Sir Doi has returned.

14
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:33,266
The shogun orders us to settle
the matter of his half-brother quietly.

15

{\an8}<i><b>Sir Doi</b>
Shogun Councel Elder</i>

16
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:45,386
We blame those that named
Naritsugu an adopted Akashi son.

17
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:50,406
This dilemma drove Mamiya to harakiri.

18
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:53,263
His appeal to us for action...

19
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,019
I'm aware of that!

20
00:03:55,506 --> 00:04:00,876
But we must respect the shogun's rule.

21
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:05,786
His justice is sanctified by heaven's will.

22
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,086
Arguing is pointless!

23
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:43,586
Shimada Shinzaemon, I presume?

24
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:46,596

Perhaps you've heard about the outrage.

00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,626
So...

33
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,726
What do you make of Lord Naritsugu?

34
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,806
Forgive my frankness.

35
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,386
He is no worthy heir to the noble Akashi Clan.

36
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:58,886
With the shogun's consent,
I suggest Naritsugu steps down.

37
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,426
A more suitable heir is needed.

38
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,966
The shogun... will not grant it.

39
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:08,806
Why not?

40
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:18,036
He has appointed Naritsugu as his senior advisor,

00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,426
<i>effective on Naritsugu's next visit to Edo.</i>

43
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:34,046
Incidentally, I invited someone here.

44
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:36,796
<i>Speak with him.</i>

48
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:10,586
I heard about an incident last year
between the Akashi and Owari Clans.

49
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,196

<i>Kiso women are such mountain monkeys.</i>

<i>They defy me by scratching.</i>

00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,884
This is torture.

87
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:28,050
Rather than living in disgrace I ponder harakiri.

88
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:30,516
But I can't.

89
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,409
I remember the shame my Lord Owari has endured.

90
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,896
Mock me for grumbling.

91
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:46,946
I continue my worthless life...
solely to remain a living witness to this tragedy!

92
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:56,566
As the council elder enacting the shogun's justice,

93
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,726
some things I can do, others I cannot.

94
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:08,256
If I turn my back on the shogun,
and find fault with his lineage,

95
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:16,436
then his rule will spiral into chaos
and destroy years of peace.

96
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:25,306
As the shogun's senior advisor, I cannot do it.

97
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,516
Are you asking if... I can do something?

98

100
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,503
I have decided.

101
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,669
<i>It's you.</i>

102
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,486
Who's the woman?

103
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:25,296
<i>Akashi lands were once most fertile.</i>

104
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:31,816
<i>But Naritsugu's relentless land taxes</i>

105
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:36,186
<i>made starving peasants hunger for revolt.</i>

106
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:45,366
This woman is the daughter of the peasant leader.

107
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,676
<i>He did this.</i>

108
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:03,166
<i>He cut off her limbs.</i>

109
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:08,906
<i>And brought her to Edo as his plaything.</i>

110
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:16,286
But he grew bored with her and cast her out.

111
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,026
Is there no mercy?

112
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:37,326
Shinzaemon, I need not
mention my honor and position!

113

If this continues, chaos will ruin
our nation and the people will suffer.

114
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,129
Poor woman,

115

As a samurai in this era of peace,

120
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,606
I've been wishing for a noble death.

Now fate has called me here.

122
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,756

They won't stop trembling.

124
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:32,916

132
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,949
In the banquet hall.

133

I told you not to trouble the Mamiya family!

137
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,336
Yes, Hanbei?

Doi again. That grumbling shogun advisor.

00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,416
Lord Naritsugu!

142
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,939
Lord Naritsugu!

143
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:36,306
What makes a samurai warrior, Hanbei?

144
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,229
You men mindlessly chant: "Loyalty". "Duty".

145
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,940
Like a Buddhist prayer.

146
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:48,306
But if servants are spoiled,

147
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:52,086
then one day they forget their duty to serve.

148
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,866
Servants like Mamiya make light
of their master and revolt.

149
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,746
Punishing one's servants,
who are the shogun's certified property...

150
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,116
Punishment is a master's duty.

151
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,706
Dying for one's master is the way of the samurai.

152
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:22,272
Dying for one's husband...

153
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,089
<i>is the way of women.</i>

154
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:41,106
We must protect these ways, right, Hanbei?

155
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,456
Yes.

156
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:55,456
After debating for three days, the conclusion was:
"No punishment due to diminished responsibility."

157
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:01,616
I wish they would behead me.
I would like to experience that.

158
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,786
The Tokugawa rule won't be long
for this world, will it, Hanbei?

159
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:17,651
My lord!

160
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,329
Don't say such things!

161
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:27,216
You know, I will be the shogun's chief of staff.

162
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,476
<i>They won't let him get away with it.</i>

163
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:41,796
<i>Things worked out too easily
for our lord, don't you think?</i>

164
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:44,616
<i>He was given special treatment.</i>

165
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:50,586
<i>Though born of a different mother,
he is still the shogun's brother.</i>

166
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,416
So how will Sir Doi save face?

167
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:00,526
<i>As the man in charge of the nation's justice,</i>

168
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:08,076
<i>he must deliver a verdict to save
his honor in a scandal like this.</i>

169
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,816
So, Sir Doi is plotting something?

170
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,016
Who goes there!?

171
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:23,176
Attendant Deguchi, at your service.

172
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:29,646
<i>Gather men to spy on Sir Doi.</i>

173
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,596
Bribe the gatekeepers and servants.

174
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:39,616
Get his list of visitors since Mamiya's harakiri.

175
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,306
We protect our lord at all costs.

176
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,086
Such is our duty.

177
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:58,126
<i>This is not the one.</i>

178
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:02,586
Hyoudou Genba, The Office of Carpentry?

179
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,406
Makino Yukie of the Owari Clan?

180
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,636
Owari?

181
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:10,426
Makino?

182
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:15,426
The Owari Makino was present during our Kiso visit.

183
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:21,306
So Makino met with Shinzaemon.

184
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:25,746
<i>Do you know this Shinzaemon?</i>

185
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:28,999
<i>We attended the same school,</i>

186
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:32,489
even trained in the sword at the same dojo.

187
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:35,956
We were competitive classmates.

188
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:38,046
Is he that skilled?

189
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:43,126
He's not as shrewd, not as strong.

190
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,576
But he never gives up.

191
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:48,680
Backed into a corner he won't budge.

192
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,669
Won't overplay his hand.

193
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:55,906
He's a man who beats you in the end.

194
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,646
If Doi has picked him,

195
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:06,546
then we've drawn the worst luck.

196
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,256
Impressive as always, Hirayama.

197
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:43,806
I'm sorry for always borrowing
your dojo without permission.

198
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:50,236
You honor me by using it.
Your spirit keeps the dojo alive.

199
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:54,286
A match for old time's sake?

200
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:59,446
<i>Better to save our energy for bigger tasks, right?</i>

201
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:05,936
There are no big or small tasks.
All are equally important.

202
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,286
You follow me?

203
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:19,186
Guess you still lack training.

204
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,743
Since your teaching,

205
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:27,079
I have been on the path
of the sword for ten years.

206
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,076
As the months and seasons changed,

207
00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:35,946
I lived on the money you
gave me as a sword for hire,

208
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:41,916
knowing that, one day,
I'd surrender my life to you.

209
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:48,056
I thought a time would come when I could repay you.

210
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:54,066
Yet I have no choice but to regret

211
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:59,316
I have not been able to repay you, master.

212
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,606
Your appreciation...

213
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,476
My small contribution means so much?

214
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,046
I thank you.

215
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:19,436
What a rare samurai in these times!

216
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:21,546
Oh, Kuranaga.

217
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:28,646
Kuranaga Saheita, Team Leader,
from the Public Security Office.

218
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:32,976
I am closely connected
with Shinza in a fateful bond.

219
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:36,566
I have become a great fan of him. Just like you.

220
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,226
I am Hirayama.

221
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,706
<i>We can't waste his spirit.</i>

222
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:47,056
Have him join us!

223
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,204
I chose five of my men.

224
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:01,489
They await you inside.

225
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:11,126
Mitsuhashi, get acquainted with Hirayama.

226
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,576
I am Mitsuhashi, at your service.

227
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:26,626
I present my subordinates, Otake and Hioki.

228
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:31,856
And my men, Higuchi and Horii.

229
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,626
Hand-picked, from hundreds.

230
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:40,246
We are still so few.

231
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:46,216
<i>It's hard to find skilled samurai these days.</i>

232
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:51,836
<i>Others are samurai of little worth.</i>

233
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:58,866
Our five lives are in your hands, Sir Shinzaemon.

234
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:01,066
I see.

235
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:08,376
Then listen up. By private order of Sir Doi

236
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:15,366
we've been assigned to take the life
of Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi Clan.

237
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,570
<i>Next month Naritsugu will</i>

238
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:26,599
leave Edo for the Akashi domain.

239
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,846
If he enters Akashi land, we can't touch him.

240
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:34,576
So we strike en route?

241
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:36,336
That's the plan.

242
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,929
It's absurd with so little time and few men.

243
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:48,406
But these days, how many samurai
use their swords in actual battle?

244
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:52,956
Not them, not us. A real challenge.

245
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:58,136
He who values his life dies a dog's death.

246
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:02,686
You've entrusted me with your lives.

247
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:08,586
I'll spend them at my disposal.

248
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:16,166
Now, we are nine.

249
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:22,656
<i>How many other true samurai are left?</i>

250
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,636
I'll take my leave.

251
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:54,826
What was that meeting?

252
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,516
Akashi samurai?

253
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:00,926
Now you know.

254
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,906
How dare you point your sword at us, novice.

255
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,916
Who are you!? State your name!

256
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:28,966
Hirayama. I'm a ronin.

257
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:36,338
<i>He killed our sword masters...</i>

258
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:37,639
<i>in one slice.</i>

259
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:43,406
I won't permit such blatant moves again.

260
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:46,956
If Sir Doi decides to, the coals we once cooled

261
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:51,356
will ignite into a blaze burning down our clan!

262
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:53,976
Forgive me for my thoughtless act.

263
00:29:55,096 --> 00:30:00,506
Now it's clear. It is Shinzaemon.

264
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,116
<i>Place your bets!</i>

265
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,746
Odd or even?

266
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:20,636
Odd.

267
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,616
<i>Odd!</i>

268
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,976
Lady Luck is with you.

269
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,766
Don't talk to me.

270
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,316
What?

271
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,216
Luck leaves when unlucky men talk.

272
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,986
This isn't sake!

273
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,046
Shogun retainer Shimada's third son.

274
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,966
<i>You make a lot of money.</i>

275
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,926
I thought Mizuno's reforms were finished.

276
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,416
What a selfish jerk!

277
00:31:25,456 --> 00:31:27,166
Don't say such things.

278
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,546
Samurai are always asking to borrow money.

279
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:41,666
My shop is full of pawned swords!

280
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:43,339
These days,

281
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:47,030
swords are only good for cutting radishes.

282
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,836
Well, hello uncle!

283
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:09,146
Womanizing at your age is bad form,
don't you think?

284
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:18,096
Bravo nephew! You young rogue.

285
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:25,416
Sake bought with gambling money tastes best.

286
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:28,196
Spare me the irony.

287
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:33,346
Gambling is the only time I feel alive.

288
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:37,816
Samurai status doesn't suit me.

289
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:41,856
I too hated being a samurai but then I realized

290
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:47,096
I could never be a true player by playing around.

291
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,486
A true player doesn't try so hard.

292
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:55,396
I'm not trying too hard.

293
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,026
I wonder...

294
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:00,956
How's your girl?

295
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:05,086
Well...

296
00:33:07,806 --> 00:33:10,086
she hasn't kicked me out yet.

297
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:14,926
Be yourself. But don't overdo it!

298
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:23,626
Lords are making their annual trips home.

299
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:26,436
Shouldn't you be busy?

300
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:31,616
Work is my excuse to gamble too.

301
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:36,706
I'm on a mission, a long shot.

302
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:43,706
Will that gamble pay off?

303
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:45,086
Pay off?

304
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,186
It's like walking through the eye of a needle.

305
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:54,046
Quit while you're ahead.

306
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,756
You're clever.

307
00:33:57,426 --> 00:34:02,706
But your uncle is a born fool.
I go for broke and bet it all.

308
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,636
And if you win?

309
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:12,776
If by chance I win...

310
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:17,526
In time, someone might appreciate me.

311
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,446
Maybe!

312
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:29,396
Betting on yourself is true gambling.
Who's overdoing it now?

313
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,716
I'll say this, Shinrokuro:

314
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:44,806
My gamble is more exciting than yours,
and with the same odds.

315
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,926
Give us the money in your pocket.

316
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:25,466
I was hoping I'd met a ghost,
but you're just a robber.

317
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,206
Help!

318
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,766
Please!

319
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:08,776
Please!

320
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:16,616
Pathetic.

321
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:42,216
Shinrokuro! Shinrokuro, are you home!?

322
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:56,296
You tease. If you're here, say so.

323
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:02,826
<i>I'm neither here, nor there.</i>

324
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:07,896
No teasing. You're right here.

325
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,506
<i>I saw my uncle.</i>

326
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:18,456
Sir Shinzaemon?

327
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,686
<i>Yes.</i>

328
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:33,546
What's wrong? Did something happen?

329
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,166
Tsuya...

330
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,256
No.

331
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:55,766
Don't!

332
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,246
Shinrokuro...

333
00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:08,276
I'll be gone for a while.

334
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,326
When...

335
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,319
When will you return?

336
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:27,456
Soon. But if I'm late,

337
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:32,906
I'll be at the Festival of the Dead.

338
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,536
Burn an honorary torch and wait.

339
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:56,366
This is my one and only pupil.

340
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:59,376
Ogura at your service.

341
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:03,896
<i>Are your parents still alive?</i>

342
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,886
Father died two years ago.
Mother passed when I was five.

343
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:17,776
I come from a lowly family
serving a noble's concubine.

344
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:22,326
Since deciding to live for the sword,

345
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,819
I've waited for this day
to use my skills for society.

346
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:30,896
Allow me to join you!

347
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:33,141
<i>I, too,</i>

348
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,239
request that you take him.

349
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:38,416
But he's too young.

350
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:45,436
Shinzaemon, you're wrong. Devotion knows no age.

351
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,426
A samurai's life isn't measured in years, is it?

352
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,276
My logic was shallow.

353
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,546
May we ask your help?

354
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,226
Thank you very much!

355
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:05,986
I will surrender my life to serve you!

356
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:11,106
And who might you be?

357
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:15,716
Sahara, a lowly ronin

358
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:19,766
with no redeeming merit but my spear.

359
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:22,146
I vouch only for his skill.

360
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:25,776
Hirayama told me of your mission.

361
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:29,144
Fighting a larger enemy is admirable.

362
00:40:29,368 --> 00:40:31,919
I very much want to join but...

363
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:35,996
One small request.

364
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:37,876
Which is?

365
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:40,946
Pay me two hundred ryo up front.

366
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:44,546
You're only joining for the money?

367
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:45,943
Let me be clear:

368
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:49,459
My sympathy with your cause
has nothing to do with money.

369
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:55,876
With no relationship or debts to you,
do you expect me to work for free?

370
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:58,776
How will you use the money?

371
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,176
One hundred twenty ryo for lifelong debts.

372
00:41:03,486 --> 00:41:06,286
Plus something nice for my relatives.

373
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:10,956
Thirty ryo for a tomb for my wife,
who died from my hardships.

374
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:14,126
Twenty ryo for my preparations as well.

375
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,456
And the rest?

376
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:22,316
To experience the "luxuries"
I never had in this life.

377
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:30,716
My kind of man.
His spirit is a bargain at two hundred.

378
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:33,426
Now, we're eleven.

379
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:38,866
Our quality outshines our quantity.

380
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:43,826
Shinrokuro is here!

381
00:41:56,436 --> 00:42:00,236
I'll take the odds on your big gamble.

382
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,146
What do you wager?

383
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:05,386
If it's a true gamble,
there's only one thing I can bet.

384
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:18,756
If you refuse, start by killing me now.

385
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:33,916
And now, we're twelve!

386
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:56,009
No mercy!

387
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:59,879
There's no samurai code or fair play in battle!

388
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:10,586
No sword? Use a stick. No stick? Use a rock.

389
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:13,776
No rock? Use your fists and feet!

390
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:19,376
Lose your life. But make the enemy pay!

391
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:22,226
<i>Horii.</i>

392
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:25,536
<i>Higuchi.</i>

393
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:28,986
<i>Train in explosives.</i>

394
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,676
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

395
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,116
<i>I'll join you shortly.</i>

396
00:43:56,346 --> 00:44:01,546
<i>Hurry up with the preparations. We depart soon.</i>

397
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:22,556
Sir Kito!

398
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,176
The soldiers who can't get
home are starting to worry.

399
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:29,936
Leave them. This isn't the usual annual trip home.

400
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,856
The enemy will also be getting soldiers ready.

401
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:35,556
It's not easy to defend the road.

402
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,216
We can't take any that will hold the others back.

403
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,716
Use any means necessary.

404
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,186
Be prepared

405
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:44,655
<i>for the unexpected.</i>

406
00:44:46,296 --> 00:44:49,366
Lord Naritsugu departs tomorrow.

407
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:51,476
Finally, he makes a move.

408
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:55,706
So where's our best point of attack?

409
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:58,906
How about the Toda boat crossing?

410
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:02,456
They'll send half their men first.

411
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:06,456
The others will stand guard
while Naritsugu crosses.

412
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:11,186
Their troops split. Better to attack then.

413
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:14,216
No, they'll be on full alert.

414
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:16,166
Won't make any wrong moves.

415
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:22,156
Let's keep them anxious and running,
never knowing where we'll strike.

416
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:27,996
That's a good point to consider.

417
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:32,316
<i>Shinza! Shinza, you here!?</i>

418
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:35,476
It's Kito Hanbei of the Akashi Clan!

419
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,526
<i>Shinza!</i>

420
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:55,156
Hanbei. I knew you'd come.

421
00:45:57,386 --> 00:45:59,066
Glad to see you.

422
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:04,176
<i>I thought you'd left already.</i>

423
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,646
If we had time, I'd enjoy a match of go.

424
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,806
I still lead in wins.

425
00:46:12,376 --> 00:46:15,446
Leave our score aside until we meet again.

426
00:46:16,236 --> 00:46:17,486
Again?

427
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,836
For years I envied you:

428
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,846
A man from a good family, close to the shogun,
appointed to his elite guards.

429
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:32,716
After you moved up, I commanded the same post.

430
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:38,876
To catch up, I joined Lord Naritsugu.

431
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:45,686
He earned a fortune
when he was adopted by the Akashi.

432
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,426
That led me into this situation.

433
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:55,346
What an ill twist of fate.

434
00:46:57,226 --> 00:47:00,736
Perhaps we both embraced fate.

435
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:04,296
A samurai leads a helpless life.

436
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:11,426
Mamiya should've committed
harakiri in front of his lord.

437
00:47:13,176 --> 00:47:15,086
I once had that intention,

438
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:22,566
but I couldn't betray his father,
the former shogun.

439
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:28,266
I lost my chance to move ahead.

440
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:32,476
I regret not beating you.

441
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:36,906
I was unable to commit harakiri.

442
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:44,026
As a samurai I'll do what must be done...

443
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:45,198
<i>for the people.</i>

444
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:49,366
For the people!?

445
00:47:53,426 --> 00:47:59,776
A samurai must do but one thing:
serve his master, correct!?

446
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:11,916
What an ill twist of fate.

447
00:48:14,146 --> 00:48:17,756
It's a long road to the Akashi domain.

448
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,556
See you there.

449
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:22,786
Bet on it!

450
00:49:25,816 --> 00:49:28,336
Bring me two women tonight.

451
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:03,206
<b>EDO</b>

452
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:48,956
<i>Uncle, three days have passed
since Naritsugu left Edo.</i>

453
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:54,116
<i>Where do we make our stand?</i>

454
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:00,926
<i>How will Shinza make his move?</i>

455
00:51:28,876 --> 00:51:30,596
<i>We kept you waiting.</i>

456
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:38,386
It's been decided.
Brothers we take Lord Naritsugu at...

457
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:45,086
Ochiai in the Mino province.

458
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,936
<b>OCHIAI</b>

459
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:54,456
<i>Kiso is ruled by the Tenryo to the north
and the Owari to the south.</i>

460
00:51:55,926 --> 00:52:00,336
The border lies on this river,
between Fukushima and Kiso.

461
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:06,266
Naritsugu offended the Owari
by killing Makino's son in Kiso.

462
00:52:07,676 --> 00:52:12,856
We can enlist Makino's help at Kiso.

463
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:19,966
Ask him to sign a non-transit act using
Lord Owari's name to ban Naritsugu from passing.

464
00:52:20,996 --> 00:52:25,836
He'll join us due to the murder
of his son and daughter-in-law.

465
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:27,946
And then?

466
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:31,836
The entourage will stall at the border.

467
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:37,906
But stubborn Naritsugu won't dare return to Edo.

468
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:42,566
He'll avoid all Owari territories.

469
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:47,436
Sending his entourage through Owari land,

470
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:51,566
Naritsugu and bis bodyguards will take this route,

471
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:55,166
traveling south to Iida.

472
00:52:55,346 --> 00:53:01,646
From Iida to Okazaki, then boating up river

473
00:53:02,376 --> 00:53:05,406
and meeting up with his entourage here.

474
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:08,086
<i>Or so you would think!</i>

475
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:11,510
Don't overlook the Naegi Clan of Mino,

476
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,977
<i>positioned between the Owari lands.</i>

477
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:17,961
<i>Naritsugu has already</i>

478
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:21,569
sent word to all the clans along his route.

479
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:26,886
He'll be a laughing stock if he skips
the tiny Naegi Clan as if on the run.

480
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:30,755
Naritsugu's pride will be his downfall.

481
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:33,789
He'll take a boat up the Nakatsu River.

482
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:37,936
There are only two possible routes.

483
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:42,736
The Kiso Pass or the Kamizaka Pass.

484
00:53:43,696 --> 00:53:48,136
Either way, he must pass via Ochiai.

485
00:53:48,636 --> 00:53:49,586
We'll fortify

486
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,326
Ochiai and strike hard.

487
00:53:54,836 --> 00:54:00,356
What if they forgo appearances
and don't pay respect to the Naegi Clan?

488
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:04,926
There's a chance they may not stop.

489
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,796
But I wager they will.

490
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,806
<i>With twelve men challenging a bigger enemy,</i>

491
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:21,486
no matter how much we plan
we must have faith in luck.

492
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:24,686
We choose here, and risk it all!

493
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:32,616
With heaven's will, the dice say Ochiai!

494
00:54:38,156 --> 00:54:39,236
Interesting!

495
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:40,176
Kuranaga,

496
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,829
you're best suited to get Makino's assistance.

497
00:54:44,626 --> 00:54:48,916
Leave it to me. I'll get that road blocked.

498
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:50,254
Take Ishizuka with you.

499
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:51,299
I'm grateful.

500
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,746
Let's get moving.

501
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:55,476
Excuse us.

502
00:54:57,826 --> 00:54:59,656
Mitsuhashi, ready the horses.

503
00:54:59,766 --> 00:55:02,016
Ready and waiting, sir.

504
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:08,196
Go on ahead and negotiate with the Mayor of Ochiai.

505
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:13,226
Give him these orders from Sir Doi.

506
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:17,606
Understood. How should I proceed?

507
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:21,399
Ochiai has many inns.
Buy them out at fifty ryo each.

508
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:24,382
Three thousand seven hundred fifty ryo total.

509
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:25,976
Buy them all out.

510
00:55:27,996 --> 00:55:28,936
Yes, sir!

511
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:34,066
Get battle supplies for our plan as well.

512
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:39,586
I'll spend the money like there's no tomorrow.

513
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:43,656
See you there.

514
00:55:44,526 --> 00:55:46,126
I'll take Horii with me.

515
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:55,556
Let's ride!

516
00:55:57,066 --> 00:56:00,616
Fast and hard to pass the enemy!

517
00:57:01,406 --> 00:57:02,886
I'm hungry.

518
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:05,136
I want a bath.

519
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:07,326
I want a woman.

520
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:47,726
Are you Shimada Shinzaemon!?

521
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:50,146
In the flesh.

522
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:53,086
Are you Akashi henchmen?

523
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:53,766
Don't follow!

524
00:58:55,466 --> 00:58:56,296
Anyone hurt!?

525
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:04,186
That Hanbei, he drew first blood.

526
00:59:05,426 --> 00:59:08,886
Probably put coins in the
hands of these broke ronin.

527
00:59:09,386 --> 00:59:12,179
His aim was to break our strength.

528
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:14,089
<i>Not a real attack.</i>

529
00:59:21,616 --> 00:59:23,436
First time you killed as well?

530
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:27,436
I've fenced with real blades many times but...

531
00:59:28,746 --> 00:59:30,716
killing a man is a first.

532
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:41,836
There's only one road,
but we don't know where they'll strike.

533
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:45,916
If they attack harder next time, we could get hurt.

534
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:52,486
Let's accept Hanbei's welcome.

535
00:59:56,506 --> 01:00:00,796
And we'll vanish as well.

536
01:00:38,976 --> 01:00:42,036
Hioki's got some new friends!

537
01:00:45,826 --> 01:00:46,966
Disgusting!

538
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:16,396
<i>We'll travel northwest along the ridge,
then cut through the valley.</i>

539
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:20,656
<i>Over the mountain to Owari territory.</i>

540
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:26,676
I had strict monastic training
in the mountains when I was young.

541
01:01:27,636 --> 01:01:28,966
The mountain brings blessings

542
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:33,429
<i>but it's true nature is fear itself.</i>

543
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:36,996
I see.

544
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:48,051
We are...

545
01:01:49,275 --> 01:01:50,460
<i>Nobodies.</i>

546
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:55,664
He's right. No titles, no affiliations.

547
01:01:57,488 --> 01:01:58,690
<i>Nobodies.</i>

548
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:39,766
A buyout?

549
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:41,576
<i>That is our wish.</i>

550
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:46,636
I won't go against Sir Doi's orders.

551
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:51,456
But convincing the town will be hard.

552
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:08,496
Our deposit. Not enough?

553
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:19,726
The forest grows thicker!

554
01:03:20,846 --> 01:03:22,126
Hirayama...

555
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,989
We're lost.

556
01:03:25,986 --> 01:03:28,436
Perhaps we should've turned at that cliff?

557
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,662
That can't be.

558
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:30,719
But...

559
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:41,196
Who are you?

560
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:43,766
<i>A bandit!?</i>

561
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,249
Or a raccoon goblin!?

562
01:03:47,576 --> 01:03:48,816
Do I look like a raccoon?

563
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:03,266
<i>Couldn't lower me down...</i>

564
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:05,516
Idiot!

565
01:04:06,246 --> 01:04:07,836
At least thank me.

566
01:04:10,936 --> 01:04:13,076
Are you from these parts?

567
01:04:15,346 --> 01:04:16,442
Do I look like it?

568
01:04:16,466 --> 01:04:17,439
Insolence!

569
01:04:32,406 --> 01:04:35,866
I ain't no ghost. Or bandit.

570
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:40,976
I hunt beasts from mountain to mountain.

571
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:42,706
Any men with you?

572
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:47,896
Gone. 'Cause I laid my hands on Upashi.

573
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:49,996
Upashi?

574
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,976
The boss's woman.

575
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:59,976
So he punished you.
Fools are the same wherever you go.

576
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:02,216
Hold your tongue!

577
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:04,356
Got a name, son?

578
01:05:07,216 --> 01:05:08,566
Kiga Koyata.

579
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:12,156
My ancestors were defeated warriors,
legitimate samurai stock.

580
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:17,856
What's so funny!?

581
01:05:18,546 --> 01:05:22,676
The name's Shinzaemon and these are my men.

582
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,696
What are samurai doing out here?

583
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:31,116
A shortcut made us...

584
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:32,659
lose our way.

585
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:40,336
I'll be your guide, if you've got food.

586
01:05:42,426 --> 01:05:43,476
Deal?

587
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:46,796
Deal?

588
01:06:01,926 --> 01:06:03,216
What's that?

589
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,876
Don't like bugs? Watch.

590
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:13,856
Don't be a little girl!

591
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:16,176
What?

592
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:25,926
Let's go.

593
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:31,856
What now?

594
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:07,066
Leave the rabbit!

595
01:07:08,276 --> 01:07:09,856
<i>We have important work to do!</i>

596
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,376
More important than roast rabbit!?

597
01:07:18,136 --> 01:07:19,176
Sir Hanbei!

598
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:21,226
<i>What is it!?</i>

599
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:22,726
Emergency!

600
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:25,166
<i>Lord Naritsugu's passage is banned!</i>

601
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:27,616
<i>What!? His passage is banned!?</i>

602
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:35,766
<i>What's the matter?</i>

603
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:49,366
Will you fools stand idly by at this humiliation?

604
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:02,759
<i>Lord Owari is</i>

605
01:08:02,783 --> 01:08:04,409
from the top three clans.

606
01:08:04,966 --> 01:08:08,016
But I am the son of the former shogun,

607
01:08:09,146 --> 01:08:11,936
and brother to the current shogun.

608
01:08:13,096 --> 01:08:14,176
Cross over!

609
01:08:14,906 --> 01:08:16,406
Watch and learn.

610
01:08:16,456 --> 01:08:20,416
We must go through Owari land.
Can our lord swallow his pride?

611
01:08:20,636 --> 01:08:24,073
<i>Let's see if he gets his way,</i>

612
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:25,649
<i>as he usually does.</i>

613
01:08:30,526 --> 01:08:31,896
Who are you?

614
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:35,316
Identify yourself.

615
01:08:39,976 --> 01:08:40,956
Out of my way.

616
01:08:42,726 --> 01:08:44,686
Or I'll kill you without mercy.

617
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:52,356
Last April, in Kiso, you killed my son.

618
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:57,046
Makino Uneme and his wife. I am Makino Yukie.

619
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:03,476
Does daddy monkey have hard bones too?

620
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:07,786
<i>My lord!</i>

621
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,816
Hanbei?

622
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:16,996
Leave this.

623
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:19,926
Let's go back.

624
01:09:30,436 --> 01:09:33,116
Owari only banned Lord Naritsugu.

625
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:39,156
<i>His entourage can enter. They are Akashi members.</i>

626
01:09:39,746 --> 01:09:41,006
I see.

627
01:09:41,616 --> 01:09:43,446
The rest will guard our lord.

628
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:47,706
Skip the Naegi Clan visit and go to Okazaki.

629
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:49,266
Sir Kito!

630
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:53,486
If people hear Owari blocked us...

631
01:09:53,526 --> 01:09:56,696
If we don't visit the Naegi,
our lord will be ridiculed.

632
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:59,806
Let them laugh.

633
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:03,956
Within a year, our lord will be second-in-command.

634
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:10,666
You risk his life and the
Akashi Clan by visiting the Naegi.

635
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:16,866
You seem most afraid of Shinzaemon.

636
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:20,746
What can a weak shogun servant do?

637
01:10:21,406 --> 01:10:25,336
Since paying off the ronin, there's no sign of him.

638
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,815
Perhaps he fears our clan and ran?

639
01:10:29,316 --> 01:10:32,846
Don't you see?
He's the one who blocked our passage!

640
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:44,486
Do you cling to your life
to make me a laughing stock?

641
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,596
<i>Desperate times call for desperate measures!</i>

642
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:55,266
I hear any samurai would chose death
over making his lord a laughing stock.

643
01:11:07,516 --> 01:11:09,536
Choose the foolish path.

644
01:11:13,586 --> 01:11:15,426
It's more fun that way.

645
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:22,776
<i>Let's go, Hanbei.</i>

646
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:24,706
Move out!

647
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:34,246
Join up!

648
01:11:36,036 --> 01:11:36,926
Move out!

649
01:12:37,806 --> 01:12:39,556
We've had enough.

650
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:57,386
Oh, the road!

651
01:13:04,196 --> 01:13:05,046
The road!

652
01:13:06,826 --> 01:13:08,676
It's a straight run to Ochiai.

653
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:12,676
Fast work, Mountain Man.
Much faster than I predicted.

654
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:15,826
Koyata, thanks for leading the way.

655
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:20,186
This... is for your help.

656
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:32,856
I don't need anything,
but could you take me with you?

657
01:13:33,386 --> 01:13:34,496
<i>What?</i>

658
01:13:34,856 --> 01:13:38,116
You're not hiding. You're hunting, right?

659
01:13:38,806 --> 01:13:39,636
Hunting?

660
01:13:40,196 --> 01:13:41,256
Am I wrong?

661
01:13:41,406 --> 01:13:43,776
It's not hunting. It's battle!

662
01:13:45,256 --> 01:13:48,416
Battle? That's great!

663
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:49,456
Hey!

664
01:13:51,076 --> 01:13:52,156
What?

665
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:56,226
What?

666
01:13:58,226 --> 01:13:59,756
What do you want?

667
01:14:00,976 --> 01:14:01,966
Hey!

668
01:14:05,146 --> 01:14:06,106
What?

669
01:14:07,506 --> 01:14:09,416
He's tough as steel.

670
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:10,896
What do you want?

671
01:14:11,736 --> 01:14:16,776
He won't return to the hills.
How about getting his help?

672
01:14:18,206 --> 01:14:20,946
A man who has battled wild animals

673
01:14:21,406 --> 01:14:25,596
might be more useful than any unskilled samurai.

674
01:14:26,326 --> 01:14:27,626
I agree.

675
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:31,676
He's tougher and smarter than he looks.

676
01:14:31,826 --> 01:14:36,186
Without him, we might still be lost.

677
01:14:38,146 --> 01:14:39,966
Take me, boss!

678
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:45,406
I'm not the boss.

679
01:14:46,246 --> 01:14:47,826
Shall we take him?

680
01:14:48,516 --> 01:14:49,576
Wow, boss!

681
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:51,956
I said I'm not the boss.

682
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:07,556
Welcome. Been expecting you.

683
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:08,756
You've prepared well.

684
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:10,776
Progress couldn't be better.

685
01:15:11,486 --> 01:15:13,266
Did it work?

686
01:15:13,366 --> 01:15:19,616
Makino stopped them perfectly.
Naritsugu diverted his troops.

687
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:20,936
Well, well!

688
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:22,846
Our long shot paid off.

689
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:24,966
<i>How many men with Naritsugu?</i>

690
01:15:24,996 --> 01:15:26,136
<i>Seventy men.</i>

691
01:15:26,966 --> 01:15:28,906
<i>And Makino?</i>

692
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:31,296
<i>He left nothing to chance.</i>

693
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:35,349
<i>He chose the path of harakiri.</i>

694
01:15:36,816 --> 01:15:41,296
He took full blame, left no evidence behind.

695
01:15:42,426 --> 01:15:43,986
He was a mighty samurai.

696
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:51,836
We must achieve our mission for him.

697
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:55,546
<i>Hey!</i>

698
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:02,066
Got dinner!

699
01:16:02,356 --> 01:16:04,006
Who <i>is</i> he?

700
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:07,906
He dropped in when we entered the forest.

701
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:10,136
Dropped in?

702
01:16:23,986 --> 01:16:25,136
I'm...

703
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:28,366
Oh! Wrong side! Wrong side!

704
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:33,585
I'm Tokubei, the Mayor of Ochiai.

705
01:16:33,586 --> 01:16:35,066
Sorry for the trouble.

706
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:43,366
No trouble at all.
We're very blessed to be receiving such money.

707
01:16:43,436 --> 01:16:46,076
I guess money talks wherever you go.

708
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:50,716
Do as you please. Rip the town down.
Burn it. It matters not to me.

709
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:52,536
But then you can't live here.

710
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:56,656
Once you've finished your business,
you won't need the town.

711
01:16:56,796 --> 01:16:59,466
So we'll just rebuild.

712
01:17:01,136 --> 01:17:08,086
If you need anything in...
the female department, for an extra fee...

713
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:09,486
Enough!

714
01:17:09,996 --> 01:17:14,836
We're gambling our lives for the country,
doing important work.

715
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:17,426
Please mind your manners.

716
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:22,766
Me and my big mouth!
Forgive it as a rustic man's joke.

717
01:17:23,216 --> 01:17:26,996
We're only renting your inns.
Be gone when you're done.

718
01:17:28,496 --> 01:17:30,406
We don't require special attention.

719
01:17:32,616 --> 01:17:34,036
Men, rest up.

720
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:36,476
Show me around.

721
01:17:37,346 --> 01:17:39,986
Hiroyama. Shinrokuro. Follow me.

722
01:17:41,306 --> 01:17:43,986
Everyone, this way please!

723
01:17:44,476 --> 01:17:45,396
<i>Hey!</i>

724
01:17:50,526 --> 01:17:51,856
Any fine women?

725
01:17:51,886 --> 01:17:54,646
Very fine and young and...

726
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:59,836
Please come this way!

727
01:18:04,766 --> 01:18:08,856
Set a trap here using this rock wall.

728
01:18:15,846 --> 01:18:18,376
This alley is a hard nut to crack.

729
01:18:22,526 --> 01:18:24,666
Shinrokuro, what do you see?

730
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,726
Looks like an ordinary boarding town.

731
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:28,966
It is.

732
01:18:29,316 --> 01:18:34,176
So we'll transform it into a town of death.

733
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:37,296
Mitsuhashi, get busy with the preparations.

734
01:18:38,586 --> 01:18:41,226
Send Ishizuka to keep watch.

735
01:18:52,006 --> 01:18:53,276
Upashi.

736
01:19:18,896 --> 01:19:20,186
Miss home?

737
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:24,886
I miss Upashi.

738
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:28,126
Is she that fine?

739
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:35,326
Like no woman you've ever seen.

740
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:41,855
Soon, this quiet town will become

741
01:19:41,879 --> 01:19:43,349
<i>a bloodbath.</i>

742
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:46,876
<i>Go home alive while you can.</i>

743
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:50,756
I've got no home.

744
01:19:51,816 --> 01:19:55,506
This is our fight. You're not a samurai.

745
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:00,906
Don't trifle with your life.

746
01:20:01,266 --> 01:20:02,346
Got it?

747
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:08,446
Damn samurai!

748
01:20:09,496 --> 01:20:12,120
You and your honor!

749
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:13,739
<i>And causes!</i>

750
01:20:16,076 --> 01:20:17,966
I'll show you!

751
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:51,826
Otake.

752
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:53,946
This... this is hell.

753
01:20:54,536 --> 01:20:57,776
Otake! Otake! Hang in there!

754
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,519
Are you all right!?

755
01:20:59,716 --> 01:21:04,866
Hey, bring me another girl!
Get the money from Shinrokuro.

756
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:07,896
I beg your pardon but that's every girl here.

757
01:21:08,036 --> 01:21:10,166
You've wasted them all!

758
01:21:12,356 --> 01:21:16,956
Town girls are a bit soft.
They've got no endurance.

759
01:21:22,456 --> 01:21:24,406
Hey, you! One more time!

760
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:28,846
She's dead tired! Please stop!

761
01:21:36,996 --> 01:21:39,866
What a splendid member...

762
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,590
<i>How charming...</i>

763
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:15,636
Upashi!

764
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:28,036
Vanished?

765
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:32,016
Lord Naritsugu passed through
Komagane along the Ina Road.

766
01:22:32,716 --> 01:22:33,976
Then he vanished.

767
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:36,199
He just vanished!

768
01:22:36,896 --> 01:22:39,086
Back to Edo?

769
01:22:39,336 --> 01:22:41,946
Not possible with Naritsugu in control.

770
01:22:42,596 --> 01:22:47,336
I'm concerned he'll cut through
to the Sanshu Road and skip Iida.

771
01:22:48,026 --> 01:22:50,136
Without visiting the Naegi Clan?

772
01:22:52,786 --> 01:22:53,906
<i>Stand down.</i>

773
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,736
Now the playing field is level.

774
01:22:57,466 --> 01:22:59,718
Hanbei is trying to ascertain

775
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:01,129
<i>our next move.</i>

776
01:23:03,426 --> 01:23:05,996
<i>We wait here. Prepare for battle.</i>

777
01:23:12,156 --> 01:23:14,216
Batten down that side!

778
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:30,016
Yes! Put it there!

779
01:23:56,566 --> 01:24:01,206
<i>If they don't show today,
they must've gone to Okazaki.</i>

780
01:24:01,946 --> 01:24:03,486
Another route?

781
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:07,786
Waiting is killing our chances.

782
01:24:08,336 --> 01:24:11,406
Let's abandon Ochiai tonight.

783
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:14,796
We can cross the pass to the Sanshu Road.

784
01:24:16,656 --> 01:24:17,719
Shinzaemon!

785
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:19,969
It's time to decide!

786
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:21,696
Too soon.

787
01:24:21,726 --> 01:24:22,766
But...

788
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,476
Do you know the secret to fishing?

789
01:24:32,136 --> 01:24:35,416
Wait till the fish swallows the hook.

790
01:24:35,586 --> 01:24:37,746
Reel in when it swallows. It's simple.

791
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:39,422
But if you reel in too soon,

792
01:24:40,646 --> 01:24:46,049
<i>the fish will escape with the bait.</i>

793
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:51,926
So you're saying the Akashi are close?

794
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:58,006
With Hanbei at Naritsugu's side there's a chance

795
01:24:58,546 --> 01:25:00,686
they might skip the Naegi Clan visit.

796
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,446
<i>Their numbers are not like ours.</i>

797
01:25:04,076 --> 01:25:06,396
Even if they went off the road,

798
01:25:07,316 --> 01:25:12,796
seventy men cannot travel without being noticed.

799
01:25:15,546 --> 01:25:20,896
They must be in one place, awaiting our next move.

800
01:25:21,856 --> 01:25:24,136
And if this is so?

801
01:25:24,796 --> 01:25:28,226
They'll come if they think its safe.

802
01:25:29,806 --> 01:25:33,626
<i>We wait until the fish swallows the hook.</i>

803
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:50,826
They're here!

804
01:25:51,796 --> 01:25:53,126
They're here!

805
01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:55,276
They're coming!

806
01:25:56,326 --> 01:25:57,846
The Akashi men are coming!

807
01:25:57,916 --> 01:25:59,096
From where!?

808
01:26:00,746 --> 01:26:04,836
Along the Ohira Road. But there aren't seventy!

809
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:06,336
What?

810
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:10,466
Many more.

811
01:26:11,056 --> 01:26:12,536
Over two hundred!

812
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:13,966
Two hundred!?

813
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:33,439
Hanbei!

814
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:37,910
He bought time and
summoned troops from other areas!

815
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:41,926
Twelve men can never defeat two hundred.

816
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:45,926
So what!

817
01:26:46,406 --> 01:26:49,946
As for the fish that takes the hook:
the bigger, the better.

818
01:26:57,316 --> 01:26:59,996
Heaven's will brought us all together.

819
01:27:09,276 --> 01:27:10,216
Thirteen!

820
01:27:15,256 --> 01:27:20,306
The time has come,
to lay down your lives for the greater cause.

821
01:27:23,496 --> 01:27:24,666
Are you ready!?

822
01:27:26,186 --> 01:27:27,706
Ready to die!?

823
01:27:28,596 --> 01:27:29,616
Yes!

824
01:28:24,946 --> 01:28:28,466
Take your posts!

825
01:28:50,636 --> 01:28:51,726
Halt!

826
01:28:55,616 --> 01:28:56,826
<i>Asakawa, wait here.</i>

827
01:28:57,776 --> 01:28:58,956
Let me through!

828
01:29:35,256 --> 01:29:36,466
<i>Move out!</i>

829
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:28,346
How much longer to Nakatsugawa?

830
01:30:31,016 --> 01:30:32,876
Tell me how far!

831
01:30:44,556 --> 01:30:45,906
<i>Hanbei, what's the matter?</i>

832
01:30:46,676 --> 01:30:47,576
<i>Oh no!</i>

833
01:30:48,396 --> 01:30:49,526
My lord!

834
01:30:55,486 --> 01:30:57,576
Turn back! My lord!

835
01:31:36,346 --> 01:31:38,736
What fun. I'm going in, Hanbei!

836
01:31:41,736 --> 01:31:42,460
<i>My lord!</i>

837
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:43,419
Follow him!

838
01:31:48,986 --> 01:31:50,116
<i>Hey!</i>

839
01:31:52,866 --> 01:31:53,716
Over here.

840
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:57,664
This way!

841
01:31:57,888 --> 01:31:58,929
This way!

842
01:33:00,296 --> 01:33:01,526
Shinzaemon!

843
01:33:02,116 --> 01:33:04,249
<i>I presume you are the</i>

01:33:04,373 --> 01:33:07,929
Akashi entourage of Lord Naritsugu.

<i>By the order</i>

846
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:15,269
of His Shogun's subject Shinzaemon,

847
01:33:15,606 --> 01:33:18,468
we commemorate your passage...

848
01:33:18,548 --> 01:33:19,675
with arrows!

849
01:33:22,726 --> 01:33:23,586
My lord!

850
01:33:27,136 --> 01:33:27,986
My lord!

851
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:31,202
Leave the horses!

852
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:32,222
Protect our lord!

853
01:34:33,556 --> 01:34:34,456
My lord!

854
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:46,286
This way!

855
01:34:48,466 --> 01:34:49,686
Please wait.

856
01:34:50,446 --> 01:34:51,536
Secure the interior!

857
01:34:53,036 --> 01:34:54,246
Secure the interior!

858
01:34:55,296 --> 01:34:55,907
Hey!

859
01:34:55,937 --> 01:34:57,061
Secure the interior!

860
01:35:46,706 --> 01:35:48,026
<i>Enough petty tricks!</i>

861
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,926
Only one hundred thirty left.

862
01:35:58,726 --> 01:36:00,306
<i>What you paid for my life</i>

863
01:36:01,826 --> 01:36:03,126
was a real bargain.

864
01:36:05,956 --> 01:36:09,016
The enemy is not large! Don't panic!

865
01:36:10,016 --> 01:36:12,586
Show them the spirit of Akashi samurai!

866
01:36:13,026 --> 01:36:17,766
Trade your lives to protect our lord!

867
01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:37,876
My lord!

868
01:36:39,506 --> 01:36:40,456
Lord!

869
01:36:49,976 --> 01:36:55,346
{\an5}<b>TOTAL MASSACRE</b>

Kill! Kill!

871
01:37:13,102 --> 01:37:14,802
Kill them all!

872
01:39:40,256 --> 01:39:40,922
Ogura!

873
01:40:00,936 --> 01:40:02,556
<i>Fire? No!</i>

874
01:40:46,836 --> 01:40:48,296
My lord! I found a way!

875
01:40:57,546 --> 01:40:58,174
<i>No!</i>

876
01:40:58,198 --> 01:40:59,380
It's a trap!

877
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:04,946
My lord!

878
01:41:13,706 --> 01:41:14,636
Come!

01:41:46,936 --> 01:41:47,976

Go! Go!

01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:04,146
This way, my lord!

882
01:42:46,926 --> 01:42:47,856
Look.

883
01:43:14,016 --> 01:43:18,416
Ogura. Kill the men that get past me.

884
01:43:19,556 --> 01:43:21,516
Don't leave one alive.

885
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:23,536
OK.

886
01:43:28,546 --> 01:43:29,376
Kill!

887
01:44:36,766 --> 01:44:37,786
Retreat!

888
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:43,286
Ogura!

889
01:45:19,766 --> 01:45:21,686
Your samurai brawls are crazy fun.

890
01:45:22,466 --> 01:45:24,176
It's no brawl!

891
01:45:27,776 --> 01:45:29,576
Why are you samurai so arrogant?

892
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,586
Why are you samurai...

893
01:45:35,046 --> 01:45:37,316
so arrogant!

894
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:52,166
Higuchi, you OK?

895
01:45:54,646 --> 01:45:55,636
Thanks.

896
01:46:18,276 --> 01:46:19,086
Hioki!

897
01:46:58,866 --> 01:46:59,856
Hioki!

898
01:47:02,436 --> 01:47:03,438
<i>You fought well!</i>

899
01:47:03,762 --> 01:47:04,528
A true...

01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:06,092
<i>samurai!</i>

901
01:47:10,366 --> 01:47:11,386
Shinzaemon!

902
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:15,466
Higuchi!

903
01:48:00,756 --> 01:48:01,546
Go!

904
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:02,839
<i>Finish the job!</i>

905
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:05,696
<i>Ishizuka!</i>

906
01:48:16,006 --> 01:48:16,786
Ishizuka!

907
01:48:25,206 --> 01:48:26,456
<i>Otake...</i>

908
01:48:28,746 --> 01:48:31,486
Our mission...

909
01:48:32,686 --> 01:48:35,836
finish it!

910
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:44,416
Shinzaemon!

911
01:49:28,826 --> 01:49:29,836
Mitsuhashi!

912
01:49:41,276 --> 01:49:42,246
Damn!

913
01:49:49,866 --> 01:49:50,886
Mitsuhashi!

914
01:50:52,196 --> 01:50:53,436
You fool!

915
01:50:58,096 --> 01:50:59,216
Hanbei...

916
01:51:01,036 --> 01:51:03,986
You think the age of war was like this?

917
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:06,286
Perhaps.

918
01:51:08,656 --> 01:51:10,346
It's magnificent!

919
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:17,336
With death comes gratitude for life.

920
01:51:18,726 --> 01:51:23,256
If a man has lived in vain,
then how trivial his life is.

921
01:51:26,806 --> 01:51:28,506
Oh, Hanbei.

922
01:51:30,106 --> 01:51:32,106
Something wonderful has come to my mind.

923
01:51:35,016 --> 01:51:37,456
Once I'm on the shogun's council,

924
01:51:38,366 --> 01:51:41,486
let's bring back the age of war.

925
01:52:29,096 --> 01:52:32,586
I'm Kuranaga Saheita!

926
01:52:33,836 --> 01:52:35,436
Lord Naritsugu!

927
01:52:36,106 --> 01:52:39,056
I've come for your life!

928
01:52:41,796 --> 01:52:42,996
<i>Sir Hanbei!</i>

929
01:52:44,426 --> 01:52:47,636
Protect our lord!

930
01:53:19,596 --> 01:53:20,786
<i>Kuranaga!</i>

931
01:54:10,346 --> 01:54:11,406
<i>My lord!</i>

932
01:56:37,566 --> 01:56:40,316
Master...

933
01:57:06,036 --> 01:57:07,366
Who are you!?

934
01:57:09,206 --> 01:57:10,836
Kito Hanbei.

935
01:57:50,046 --> 01:57:51,146
Who are you!?

936
01:57:54,986 --> 01:57:56,386
You're no samurai!

937
01:57:57,086 --> 01:57:58,356
So what.

938
01:58:05,816 --> 01:58:07,746
Do only samurai matter in this world!?

939
01:58:14,266 --> 01:58:16,396
<i>I thought samurai would be fun.</i>

940
01:58:18,286 --> 01:58:20,326
But you bore me.

941
01:58:21,226 --> 01:58:23,596
You're useless.

942
01:58:24,816 --> 01:58:26,966
<i>Even more useless in great numbers.</i>

943
01:58:47,456 --> 01:58:49,926
This man speaks the truth.

944
01:58:50,316 --> 01:58:52,876
His reward is my short sword.

945
01:58:54,826 --> 01:58:57,776
<i>If</i> we can get past that...

946
01:58:58,866 --> 01:59:02,726
Remain focused! Victory is ours!

947
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:05,976
Keep our lord safe! We'll win!

948
01:59:52,746 --> 01:59:53,746
My lord!

949
01:59:55,316 --> 01:59:56,486
Let's run!

950
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:03,026
Hanbei, victory is not yet ours.

951
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,426
Shinza!

952
02:00:28,026 --> 02:00:31,386
Hanbei! I have no qualms with you.

953
02:00:34,056 --> 02:00:35,456
You will not pass!

954
02:00:36,616 --> 02:00:40,196
I'll trade my life to protect my lord!

955
02:00:42,626 --> 02:00:45,146
I must do what must be done.

956
02:00:46,676 --> 02:00:50,975
Are you so hungry for my lord's life?

957
02:00:51,276 --> 02:00:52,106
Yes!

958
02:00:54,526 --> 02:01:00,806
I gambled my life in this...
senseless war of power and politics!

959
02:01:03,236 --> 02:01:05,326
If he joins the shogun's council,

960
02:01:06,216 --> 02:01:12,546
<i>you know disaster will befall the people!</i>

961
02:01:12,686 --> 02:01:13,675
Am I wrong!?

962
02:01:13,976 --> 02:01:15,206
So what then!?

963
02:01:16,906 --> 02:01:19,946
Both you and I were born samurai.

964
02:01:20,706 --> 02:01:22,636
Ours is not to wonder why.

965
02:01:22,676 --> 02:01:24,116
Ours is...

966
02:01:25,286 --> 02:01:27,786
to obey our fate and die!

967
02:01:30,196 --> 02:01:32,666
<i>If you were my ally,</i>

968
02:01:32,896 --> 02:01:36,956
<i>if you were not an Akashi retainer,</i>

969
02:01:38,806 --> 02:01:40,976
<i>wouldn't our task be easier?</i>

970
02:01:40,996 --> 02:01:42,326
Don't lecture me!

971
02:01:43,866 --> 02:01:47,486
No matter how low I go, Hanbei Kito is a samurai!

972
02:01:48,486 --> 02:01:51,606
I won't hand over my lord's head so easily!

973
02:01:59,826 --> 02:02:01,256
Shinza.

974
02:02:03,446 --> 02:02:06,736
To pass, you'll have to kill me.

975
02:02:13,716 --> 02:02:15,616
That I shall do.

976
02:02:17,676 --> 02:02:18,736
Fight!

977
02:02:30,296 --> 02:02:33,106
Such elegance in fighting one-on-one.

978
02:03:17,166 --> 02:03:19,856
How I missed crossing swords with you!

979
02:03:26,376 --> 02:03:27,866
Hanbei...

980
02:03:29,076 --> 02:03:33,016
In the dojo, we were an even match.

981
02:03:47,386 --> 02:03:48,786
Hanbei...

982
02:03:51,116 --> 02:03:52,696
See you in hell!

983
02:04:27,736 --> 02:04:29,026
Some call it elegance.

984
02:04:30,176 --> 02:04:33,396
Some call it cruel and unfair.

985
02:04:34,976 --> 02:04:36,356
I like it.

986
02:05:06,626 --> 02:05:10,206
How could you kick his head?

987
02:05:11,806 --> 02:05:13,576
He gave his life for you!

988
02:05:15,636 --> 02:05:18,296
Kick my head if you want.

989
02:05:27,386 --> 02:05:33,046
For the shogun, for the people,
for the many who died untimely deaths,

990
02:05:33,296 --> 02:05:35,596
for Makino Uneme and his wife,

991
02:05:35,676 --> 02:05:39,536
for his father Makino Yukie,

992
02:05:41,376 --> 02:05:44,746
and for my men scattering Ochiai.

993
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:47,266
For that

994
02:05:48,696 --> 02:05:51,746
innocent, nameless young girl,

995
02:05:52,876 --> 02:05:55,146
with severed arms and legs,

996
02:05:57,916 --> 02:06:00,666
I shall take your life!

997
02:06:02,346 --> 02:06:04,016
<i>Ruling is convenient,</i>

998
02:06:04,996 --> 02:06:07,736
but only for rulers.

999
02:06:08,996 --> 02:06:11,626
The people must live to serve.

1000
02:06:14,286 --> 02:06:19,896
Even so, a time comes when
servants rise up against their masters.

1001
02:06:23,836 --> 02:06:26,416
You're on top thanks to support from the bottom.

1002
02:06:27,916 --> 02:06:29,456
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1003
02:06:38,326 --> 02:06:41,776
Your mistake is believing that

1004
02:06:42,266 --> 02:06:45,066
your decorative blade is not just for show.

1005
02:06:47,196 --> 02:06:50,476
Nonsense. It's not for show.

1006
02:06:51,476 --> 02:06:53,876
Decoration is for show.

1007
02:06:55,696 --> 02:06:59,256
Be silent like the decorative man you are.

1008
02:07:02,416 --> 02:07:04,186
Servant!

1009
02:07:08,966 --> 02:07:11,426
How is this for show!?

1010
02:07:37,466 --> 02:07:38,486
Uncle!

1011
02:07:44,686 --> 02:07:45,836
Pain!

1012
02:07:59,146 --> 02:08:00,366
It hurts!

1013
02:08:03,746 --> 02:08:05,396
That's unexpected.

1014
02:08:06,896 --> 02:08:08,876
Can you feel pain?

1015
02:08:11,416 --> 02:08:13,746
Am I... dying?

1016
02:08:16,266 --> 02:08:17,446
Dying?

1017
02:08:23,836 --> 02:08:28,176
I'm scared. So scared!

1018
02:08:28,386 --> 02:08:29,336
Scared!

1019
02:08:35,096 --> 02:08:36,556
I don't want...

1020
02:08:39,546 --> 02:08:40,946
to die.

1021
02:08:46,406 --> 02:08:47,606
I'm scared!

1022
02:09:02,886 --> 02:09:03,856
My lord...

1023
02:09:05,206 --> 02:09:06,006
Prepare yourself!

1024
02:09:11,866 --> 02:09:16,176
So death... comes for us all.

1025
02:09:22,876 --> 02:09:27,956
Allow me to thank you, Shinzaemon.

1026
02:09:38,136 --> 02:09:40,136
Of all the days of my life,

1027
02:09:41,696 --> 02:09:44,426
today has been the most exciting.

1028
02:09:48,746 --> 02:09:49,946
You're welcome!

1029
02:10:02,056 --> 02:10:03,346
It's over.

1030
02:10:09,126 --> 02:10:10,696
The big gamble paid off.

1031
02:10:19,346 --> 02:10:20,956
Shinrokuro...

1032
02:10:23,546 --> 02:10:25,556
Being a samurai...

1033
02:10:27,586 --> 02:10:31,536
is truly a burden.

1034
02:10:38,046 --> 02:10:39,566
Do what you want...

1035
02:10:42,606 --> 02:10:43,866
<i>with your life.</i>

1036
02:12:22,536 --> 02:12:24,266
Are you immortal?

1037
02:12:26,176 --> 02:12:28,836
You got the lord's head without me?

1038
02:12:30,886 --> 02:12:32,796
Our fight is over.

1039
02:12:35,006 --> 02:12:36,596
That ain't no fun.

1040
02:12:39,026 --> 02:12:40,436
You hurt?

1041
02:12:43,216 --> 02:12:48,466
Compared to fighting a wild bear,
these wounds are nothing.

1042
02:12:52,436 --> 02:12:53,726
All in all,

1043
02:12:55,816 --> 02:12:57,956
I want my Upashi.

1044
02:13:02,936 --> 02:13:05,956
I don't like towns swarming with samurai.

1045
02:13:07,216 --> 02:13:10,686
I'll go home, sweep Upashi off her feet,

1046
02:13:11,496 --> 02:13:13,736
and live far away!

1047
02:13:15,386 --> 02:13:16,926
Live your life.

1048
02:13:20,336 --> 02:13:21,786
Till the next life.

1049
02:13:28,966 --> 02:13:30,456
What are you going to do?

1050
02:13:34,066 --> 02:13:37,696
Whatever I want. Been a samurai long enough.

1051
02:13:39,826 --> 02:13:41,896
Become a bandit.

1052
02:13:42,766 --> 02:13:48,236
The greatest bandit in Japan.
Jump ship to America, make love to women.

1053
02:13:50,626 --> 02:13:51,896
Now you're talking.

1054
02:13:54,446 --> 02:13:56,406
Say "hi" to Upashi for me.

1055
02:14:01,496 --> 02:14:02,756
Sure.

1056
