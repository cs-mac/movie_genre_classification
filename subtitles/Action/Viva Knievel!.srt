1
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,671
When are you going to get
a real knife?

2
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,671
You can keep this.

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,237
Who has your papers?
Right here.

4
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
Good morning, my children.

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,308
Well, come closer. Come closer.

6
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,393
Here are their names, my president.

7
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,634
Now then, my children,
what's the problem you've brought me?

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,310
Well, someone has to tell.
You must have come for something.

9
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,919
Yes, my president,
we have come for something.

10
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,316
Well, you. You tell me.

11
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,351
You know that field?

12
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,031
That field with the big white rock
just south of Anenecuilco?

13
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,589
- My president, our delegation...
Shh!

14
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,470
- They've taken our land away.
- Who took your land away?

15
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,398
Children, when you make accusations,
be certain you have the facts.

16
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,792
- Who took your land away?
- The biggest state there.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,231
- It's bigger than a kingdom.
- They've taken our valleys.

18
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,790
- Left us only the rocky hillside.
We can't grow our corn.

19
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,713
That's right.
There's a new fence with barbed wire.

20
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,995
We can't feed our cows.
Those three houses by that white rock?

21
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,516
- They burned those!
- They're planting sugarcane in our land.

22
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,638
Can you prove that you own this field?

23
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,189
Our village has owned this land
since before history.

24
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,396
We have a paper from the Spanish crown
and from the Mexican Republic.

25
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,078
Well, if this is true, you have no
problem. The courts will settle this.

26
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,437
I'll send you to my personal attorney.

27
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,073
But before you see him, I urge you
to find your boundary stones.

28
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,357
Check them against
your grants and titles.

29
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,032
Verify your boundaries. Facts. Facts!

30
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,756
Now, my children, I have
many other matters to attend to.

31
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,668
I've been your president for 34 years.
It's not an easy job being president.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,150
Thank you, my president.

33
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,078
- Thank you.
- Thank you, my president.

34
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,516
What's next?

35
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,116
We can't verify the boundaries,
my president.

36
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,748
The land is fenced and guarded.

37
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,872
They're planting sugar cane
in our cornfields.

38
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,600
- The courts...
- With your permission...

39
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,271
The courts?

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,030
Do you know of any land suit
that was ever won by country people?

41
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,515
Has your land been taken?

42
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,392
My father's land was taken long ago,
my president.

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,071
My children, I'm your father,
your protector. I'm of your blood.

44
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,553
But believe me, these matters
take time. You must be patient.

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,193
With your permission. We make
our tortillas out of corn, not patience.

46
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,717
And patience will not cross
an armed and guarded fence.

47
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,078
To do as you suggest,
to verify those boundaries...

48
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,879
...we need your authority.

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,311
I cannot possibly exercise
such authority.

50
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,199
- But you advise it.
- I can only advise.

51
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,674
Then naturally, my president,
we will do as you advise.

52
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,196
Thank you. With your permission.

53
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,798
You!

54
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,277
You!

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,273
- Yes, my president?
- What is your name?

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,992
- Zapata.
- What is it?

57
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,152
Emiliano Zapata.

58
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,273
There you are.

59
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,592
Thank you, my son.

60
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,910
My pleasure, Father.

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,237
Come here! Come here.

62
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,158
Here! Here, here!

63
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,029
Here!

64
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,798
Go back! Go back!

65
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,599
Get the one on the white horse,
the one we're supposed to bring in!

66
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,437
That's the one, the one on the
white horse. That's the one, come on!

67
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,272
Zapata! Emiliano Zapata!

68
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,314
Emiliano Zapata!

69
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,753
Zapata! Emiliano Zapata!

70
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,192
Zapata? Emiliano Zapata?

71
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,595
The stupid, he's still coming.

72
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,070
Who do you think he is?
- A stranger.

73
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,071
- Shall I kill him?
- No.

74
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,832
- Shoot in front of him again.
Don't hit him.

75
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,752
When I want to hit, I hit.
When I want to miss, I miss.

76
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,717
A man has been known to die
of a close miss.

77
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,668
Zapata! Emiliano Zapata!

78
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,711
He's more stupid than I thought.
He's still coming.

79
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,913
He's crazy. You know it's not nice
to kill crazy people.

80
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,194
- Should I try him again, a bit closer?
- How can you come closer?

81
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,193
- Maybe he has a message.
- Maybe it's a trap.

82
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,351
Why don't we kill him?
It's so much easier.

83
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,159
- What does it cost? One bullet...
No!

84
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,074
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Emiliano Zapata.

85
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,559
He's not here.

86
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,997
- His friends sent me.
Who are his friends?

87
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,874
- People of the village.
He's not here.

88
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,470
I have no weapons.

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,950
- What's this?
- Writing machine.

90
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,352
- Sword of the mind.
- I thought you had no weapons.

91
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,990
Don't you dare break that!
Put it down! Put it down!

92
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,077
No.

93
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,838
Put it down.

94
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,919
You are Emiliano Zapata.

95
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,989
I come with news of Madero,
leader of the fight against Diaz.

96
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,671
Give me some water.

97
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,238
- Why do you come to me?
- Give me some water while I talk.

98
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,550
Fernando Aguirre.

99
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,557
Pablo Gomez.

100
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,195
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk.

101
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,478
- I want you to listen.
- Well, talk.

102
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,708
"The despotism of Porfirio Diaz
is unbearable.

103
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,155
For 34 years, he's ruled with
the hand of a ruthless tyrant."

104
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,472
- Yeah, Blanco. Pretty soon now.
Listen.

105
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,870
"The meaning of democracy
has long been forgotten.

106
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,270
Elections are a farce. The people
have no voice in the government.

107
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,513
Control is in the hands of one man
and those he's appointed."

108
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,159
Who wrote that?
- Francisco Madero.

109
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,869
"If we are to bring back to Mexico the
freedom that goes with democracy...

110
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,793
...we must unite to drive
this tyrant from office."

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,673
- Who's Madero?
- Leader of the fight against Diaz.

112
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,752
Where is he?
- In a part of the United States, Texas.

113
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,198
- A fine place to fight against Diaz.
- He's making preparations.

114
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,874
Now he's ready to move.

115
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,835
He's sending out people to spread the
word, search out leaders in Mexico.

116
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,399
I was sent to the state of Morelos.

117
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,874
Careful. The smell of a mare came in
on the wind and he's restless.

118
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,917
So am I.

119
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,437
- The people told me...
- Don't believe what people tell you.

120
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,750
Hey. Hey you!

121
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,639
- Come on, eat.
- Go on, eat.

122
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,477
Madero?
Yeah, remember?

123
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,153
I read to you about him.

124
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,238
- You promised to teach me to read.
I will. I will!

125
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,716
Let's talk to this man more about
Madero. Maybe he has a letter.

126
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,919
Anybody can write a letter, even you.
I like the look of his eyes.

127
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,116
- Then go and talk to him.
- I can't.

128
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,269
- Why not?
- Not now.

129
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
I know why.

130
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,152
I want you to go to Madero
and tell me what you see.

131
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,312
- Me? He's in Texas!
- Then go to Texas.

132
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,040
- How far is it?
- Who knows? Go and see.

133
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,913
- I've never been out of our state.
- Now you will be.

134
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,833
I want you to go see
if we can trust him.

135
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,196
I like his face.

136
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,553
But a picture is only a picture.

137
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,554
- When do you want me to go?
- Now.

138
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,598
- Now?
- Right now, cinch up.

139
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,794
If you like what you see,
tell him about our troubles here.

140
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,033
And tell him that we recognize him
as a leader against Diaz.

141
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,278
- Where is he going?
- What?

142
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,479
- Where is he going?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

143
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,795
- Now where is he going?
I don't know. He didn't say.

144
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,633
- What's the matter with him?
- Woman, what else?

145
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,032
- Where are you going?
- Where else?

146
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,069
- What about her?
- She can take care of herself.

147
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,316
This is all very disorganized.

148
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,919
Police.

149
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,117
Josefa, I must speak with you. Shh!

150
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,158
- The rurales are after you.
- I risked my life to come here.

151
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,515
- When may I speak with your father?
- What for?

152
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,353
- To ask permission for your hand.
- No, don't do it.

153
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,988
- Why not?
- Just don't do it.

154
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,717
- What is wrong with me?
- That's not it.

155
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,031
- What would be wrong with me?
- What do you mean?

156
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,598
I have no intention of ending up
washing clothes in a ditch...

157
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,189
...and patting tortillas
like an Indian.

158
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,231
Who says this?

159
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,553
- My father.
- My mother was a Salazar.

160
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,917
Zapatas were chieftains and
when your grandfather lived in a cave.

161
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,798
Always remember that.

162
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,432
Well, you're not chieftains now.
You have no land, no money.

163
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,512
- You'll be in jail by tomorrow.
- Be still!

164
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,829
I've been offered a position
by Don Nacio Delator.

165
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,152
Don Nacio Delator does not employ
fugitives from the law.

166
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,834
If I accept, he will have me pardoned.

167
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,357
Why in the world would Don Nacio
need anyone like you? Why?

168
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,718
Apparently, you do not know I am the
best judge of horses in the country.

169
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
You are the only one
who does not know this.

170
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,478
I was with him for years,
I bought every horse in his stable.

171
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,478
When I have not helped
Don Nacio buy his horses...

172
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,636
...it's later discovered
that they have five legs.

173
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,751
Conceited monkey.

174
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,512
Do you know that I can take you
away with me by force, now?

175
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,432
By force?

176
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,676
I would not prevent you.

177
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,230
I would go with you
because I couldn't prevent you.

178
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,951
- But soon you will go to sleep.
- And then?

179
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,800
Sooner or later you will go to sleep.

180
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,079
You wouldn't do that.
A respectable girl like you?

181
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,319
Yes, I would.
Because I am a respectable girl.

182
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,469
A respectable girl wants to live
a safe life. Protected, uneventful.

183
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,435
Without surprises.
And preferably with a rich man.

184
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,111
You don't mean that.

185
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,598
I do.

186
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,750
Come back when you can offer me that.
He's going to let you go. Don't scream.

187
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,748
The police are after him.
Let her go.

188
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,392
- I like him.
You do?

189
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,350
I mean, he's a terrible man.
A fugitive, a criminal.

190
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,636
I like him too.

191
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,435
Rub it in. Rub it in harder.

192
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,479
They're so lazy.
Luncheon is ready now.

193
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,317
If this is the best of the lot,
where are the others?

194
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,040
- Are the others here?
- They're so lazy.

195
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,079
If they're not stealing, they're asleep.
If they're awake, they're drunk.

196
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,674
- Let's look at the others.
- But luncheon is served.

197
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,319
It'll wait.

198
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,477
Hey, hey!

199
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,598
- This is what I'm talking about!
- What is it?

200
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,796
Stealing! Even a horse's food.

201
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,269
They steal everything!

202
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,036
Stop it, Emiliano! Stop it!

203
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,872
Get ahold of him!

204
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,432
Get him out!

205
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,078
Get out!

206
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,232
Get out!

207
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,431
When I had the charges dismissed,
you promised.

208
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,478
- I don't want to regret it.
- I know.

209
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,313
I've told you, violence is no good.

210
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,189
- Then why does he use it?
- So full of anger!

211
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,319
- That boy was hungry.
- Calm down, calm down.

212
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,554
Now, look, Emiliano.

213
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,638
You're clever and able,
you might even be important...

214
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
...have money and property,
be respected.

215
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,869
You told me that's what you wanted.
Do you want it or don't you?

216
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,716
- That boy was hungry!
- Are you responsible to everybody?

217
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,356
You can't be the conscience
of the whole world.

218
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,112
Thank you.
You should see them go down.

219
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,475
You have another cigar?

220
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,712
- Some of your admirers.
- Indians.

221
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,678
The most civilized thing about you
is your taste for good cigars.

222
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,434
I'm gonna prescribe for you, Emiliano.

223
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,993
You need that wife.

224
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,470
- You ever spoken to Josefa's father?
- No.

225
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,599
- Well, why not?
- He doesn't like me, I don't like him.

226
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,309
In the world of business,
few people like each other...

227
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,313
...but they have to get along
or there wouldn't be any business.

228
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,029
Now look, Emiliano.
Now you have position, clothes...

229
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,035
Go to Señor Espejo, tell him I'm
your patron. Make your peace with him.

230
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,156
And don't forget, the president
has drawn a circle around your name.

231
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,276
You must behave.

232
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,911
You better start practicing now.
Go over and apologize to him.

233
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,398
Well, go ahead.

234
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,636
- I apologize.
- Accepted. Accepted.

235
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,759
All right?

236
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,760
- You know them?
- He's a friend. He's been away.

237
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,189
Hey, look.

238
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,276
- What's that?
- Texas.

239
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,873
Hello.

240
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,598
- He spoke of you.
- He wants a message.

241
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,873
One strong push from the North or South
and Diaz drops like an old bull.

242
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,596
- The time has come.
- Why don't they lock Madero up?

243
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,069
- They protect political refugees.
- Why?

244
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,472
- Up there, they're a democracy.
- We're a democracy too, and look.

245
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,750
- I know, but...
- I'll explain it.

246
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,990
Up there, the government governs,
but with consent.

247
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,593
- The people have a voice.
- That's right.

248
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,354
They have a president, but he
governs with the consent of the people.

249
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,078
Here we have a president, no consent.

250
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,631
- Who asked us if we wanted Diaz?
- Nobody ever asked me nothing.

251
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,276
Well...
- How are you in all this?

252
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,555
Madero sent him with me.

253
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,315
- He wants a message.
- Tell him to get another leader.

254
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,351
- You don't believe in him?
- Yes.

255
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,512
- So?
- Tell him to get another man.

256
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,677
- As you wish.
- I have private affairs.

257
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,756
I don't want to be the conscience of
the world or the conscience of anybody.

258
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,311
As you wish.

259
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,794
- Nacente, what's the matter?
- Get away from the prisoner!

260
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,359
Nacente, what are they
taking you in for? Hey, Nacente.

261
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,875
He can't talk, Emiliano.

262
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,360
Nacente, here.

263
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,912
- What did he do?
- They're the craziest people I've seen.

264
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,629
- Well, what did he do?
- They're always doing something.

265
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
What are you going to do with him?

266
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,188
I think you better let him go.

267
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,713
Let him go!

268
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,915
Should have cut the rope
without talking.

269
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,474
He crawled through the fence
to plant the corn.

270
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,952
My father does the same thing.
He still thinks it's his own field.

271
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,350
Stubborn. That's what you are.

272
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,916
No, not stubborn.
The field is like a woman.

273
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,232
You live with it all of your life,
it's hard to learn that she isn't yours.

274
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,913
He understands.

275
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,238
Mano, I couldn't catch them...

276
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,992
- I'm sorry we've caused you trouble.
Now they'll be after you.

277
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,670
- You can hide in my house.
- It would be an honor.

278
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,032
Thank you.

279
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,479
You mentioned Don Nacio?
- Don Nacio is my patron.

280
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,870
He has assured me
that I will be a man of substance.

281
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,032
On that basis, I presume to sue
for your daughter's hand.

282
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,909
Do not think I'm insensible
of the honor you do me...

283
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,834
...by offering to take my daughter
off my hands.

284
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,959
Why is it impossible for me
to get a glass of cold water?

285
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,473
- Go, go!
- Shh!

286
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,073
Go, go!

287
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,635
But I do not need to give the problem
a great deal of thought...

288
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,316
...before I answer with a permanent
and unchanging no.

289
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,630
The answer is no.

290
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,316
- What is wrong with me?
- We have a proverb:

291
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,076
Though we are all made of
the same clay, a jug is not a vase.

292
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,109
- What is wrong with me?
- I'd hoped you would not ask again.

293
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,955
But since you have,
you are a rancher without land.

294
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,954
A gentleman without money. A man
of substance without substance.

295
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,954
A fighter, a drinker, a brawler.
These things you are.

296
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,918
Though I have nothing
against you personally...

297
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,676
...and I can see wherein some quarters
you may be considered desirable.

298
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,478
But my daughter...

299
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,191
I have no intentions of finding her
squatting on the bare earth...

300
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,995
...patting tortillas
like a common Indian.

301
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,237
What are you doing?

302
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,037
Find her a merchant. A musty,
moth-eaten man like yourself.

303
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,072
Let her be queen of warehouses
and mistress of the receipt book.

304
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,557
All right,
bring him down here. Down here!

305
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,430
Clear the way.

306
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,432
This man is a criminal.

307
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,831
You are making yourselves liable
for his crime.

308
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,318
What are you trying to do?

309
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,836
We are here, my captain,
with your permission...

310
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,113
...to see that the prisoner does not
try to escape. For if he did...

311
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,829
...you would shoot him in the back.
Is that not so?

312
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,878
- You're breaking the law.
- No, helping the law...

313
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,554
...guarding the prisoner.

314
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,000
Zapata. The wire.
- What do you mean?

315
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,357
Telegraph wire.
Cut it before he uses it.

316
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,315
Don't touch that!
This is rebellion.

317
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,199
- Emiliano?
- Cut.

318
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,869
No ammunition?
No ammunition.

319
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,871
What?
Uniforms and blankets.

320
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,871
No ammunition?
No ammunition.

321
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,235
Hermano, come here.
Look what I found.

322
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,591
Ammunition?
No. Dynamite.

323
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,797
- Boxes and boxes, all dynamite.
- Ammunition?

324
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,996
- Powder and dynamite.
How much?

325
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,913
- Plenty, look.
What do you think?

326
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,269
Only one way.
We use what we have.

327
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,357
- Anything doing?
- A few women.

328
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,479
- I liked it when they were shooting.
- Maybe Zapata's out of ammo.

329
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,473
- I wouldn't depend on it.
- They went away.

330
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,148
Market women.
If it's a market, they've gone.

331
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,955
- I don't trust the Indian women.
- No sign of Zapata.

332
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,918
- Send out a scout.
Captain! My captain.

333
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,753
What are you doing?
- Like to buy eggs?

334
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,149
Get away!

335
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,197
Pile those baskets.
Get away!

336
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,030
Pile. Hurry.
Get away, or I'll fire!

337
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,599
Get the baskets. Quick.

338
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,231
Fire!

339
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,555
Emiliano! Remember the gun
that flanked us from the hill?

340
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,439
Yeah.
- He and his brother...

341
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,434
...lassoed and took the gun from
the gunner. Look at his size.

342
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,830
- You do that?
- Of course. Bring the gun!

343
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,353
Leave the gun.

344
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,954
Did you do that?

345
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,075
Where's your brother?

346
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,437
He was killed.

347
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,993
- He should have a reward.
- Hey, hey. Mano, here.

348
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,993
Here.

349
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,069
Do you want this pig?

350
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,199
Well, what? Anything.

351
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,671
Not my horse.

352
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,190
That's a good horse.

353
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,472
He says that's why he wants it.

354
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,355
Take him.

355
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,192
- What did he do?
- I'm waiting to find out.

356
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,112
Don Emiliano, my friend...

357
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,478
...I'm here to present representatives
of our great liberator...

358
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,910
...Francisco Madero. Gentlemen.

359
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,436
Gentlemen, here he is.
I found him for you.

360
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,353
Emiliano Zapata,
one of my oldest acquaintances.

361
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,398
I think we know each other.

362
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,597
My congratulations,
General Zapata.

363
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,830
Read it.

364
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,520
- Read it!
- "To Emiliano Zapata:

365
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,117
I, Madero, act on authority given me
by the forces of Liberation...

366
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,396
...grade you general
of the armies of the South.

367
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,232
- Hey, padre.
- May a day come...

368
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,432
...when I embrace
you in triumph. Long live Mexico."

369
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,068
He signed it with his own hand.

370
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,511
I and my family would be happy...

371
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,319
Now you have to wear
things a general wears.

372
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,272
I and my family would...

373
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,194
- Where did you get those?
- Well, off a general, where else?

374
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,237
General.

375
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,112
My wife, my daughter
and myself would be honored...

376
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,672
A present.

377
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,071
Boys! General Zapata!

378
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,789
Boys! General Zapata!

379
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,310
Take this one, please. It's nicer.

380
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,559
What a waste of time.

381
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,713
- He should've stolen her.
- This way he gets her father's money.

382
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,836
But is it worth all this?

383
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,676
I have loved with all my heart 100
women I never want to see again...

384
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,877
...and he is still after this one.
It escapes me.

385
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,754
Did you think of me?

386
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,235
It is said, a warrior's shield
is his sweetheart's heart.

387
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,158
Huh?

388
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,311
We have a proverb: A man well-dressed
is a man well-thought-of.

389
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,550
A monkey in silk is still a monkey.

390
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,477
But when love and beauty
come into the house...

391
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,552
...then throw out the lamps.

392
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,395
- It's an hour and three-quarters.
- I know, makes me sick.

393
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,757
That's how these people
go about getting married.

394
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,432
Excuse me.

395
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,999
Do you believe the saying: An egg
unbroke, a horse unrode, a girl unwed?

396
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,551
I believe that a man is fire,
and a woman fuel.

397
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,230
And she who is born beautiful,
is born married.

398
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,715
Can you get away from the window?
Let some air through.

399
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,196
And get that horse out of here!

400
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,677
Go on!

401
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,954
Best horse I ever had.

402
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,278
Josefa, let's go walk,
there might be a breeze.

403
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,432
- A walk?
- Alone?

404
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,759
A whipped dog is the wiser dog.

405
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,839
Do you think that three women
and a goose make a market?

406
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,194
I believe that love cannot be bought
except with love.

407
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,957
And he who has a good wife
wears heaven in his hat.

408
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,874
After love food, a cup of chocolate?

409
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,033
- A starved body has a skinny soul.
Emiliano!

410
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,111
- Shh!
- Emili...

411
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,919
The pediment of the heart
is the stomach.

412
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,390
Alicia, will you bring chocolate?

413
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,437
Emiliano.
- What?

414
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,830
Diaz ran away. He left the country.

415
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,470
Viva Zapata! Viva Zapata!

416
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,197
- It's true?
It's true.

417
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,233
Josefa, the fighting is over.

418
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,952
- Josefa! Josefa!
- Mama, be quiet.

419
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,793
The fighting is over.

420
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,678
Emiliano?

421
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,034
It's almost morning.

422
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,478
- They never get tired.
Emiliano!

423
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,200
Emiliano, my little brother!

424
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,029
Josefa. Josefa, my sister.

425
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,712
Oh!

426
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,233
Emiliano, come back to bed.

427
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,597
My darling friend, we are getting old.

428
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,551
We are getting very, very old.

429
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,198
I know what's the matter with you.

430
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,598
- What?
- You, my friend, you have heavy blood.

431
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,953
- You are unhappy the fighting is over.
- Half-victors.

432
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,999
Always celebrating,
nothing really won.

433
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,792
I love you, but I don't like you.
I never liked you, my darling friend.

434
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,077
- There will be a lot more bloodshed.
- All right!

435
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,830
But not tonight! Here. Enjoy yourself.
Be human!

436
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,515
Emiliano?

437
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,229
Huh?

438
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,715
You're restless.

439
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,960
Are you unhappy?

440
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,352
No. Go to sleep.

441
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,119
- Can't you sleep?
- Pretty soon now.

442
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,269
What are you thinking?

443
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,476
Nothing.

444
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,354
- You are too.
- No, no, no.

445
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,357
What are you worried about?

446
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,634
We'll find a good piece of land
someplace, and we'll settle down.

447
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,798
- Now go to sleep.
- I don't want to sleep.

448
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,111
Emiliano, the fighting is over.

449
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,196
Madero is in the capital,
and tomorrow I'll go see him.

450
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,955
- Can I go with you?
- No.

451
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,715
- You think we'll have children?
- Yes.

452
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,194
We'll name them all Francisco, after
Madero because he brought peace.

453
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,158
Emiliano, is it something about me?

454
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,197
No.

455
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,955
You mustn't think that.

456
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,873
Then I want you to tell me.

457
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,194
I'll see Madero
and the men around him.

458
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,113
You're not telling me.

459
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,878
Men from schools.

460
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,916
- Lawyers, educated men.
- You're not telling me.

461
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,678
My horse and my rifle
won't help me there.

462
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,158
I can't read.

463
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,716
Teach me.

464
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,155
Of course.

465
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,715
Teach me now.

466
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,675
Get a book.

467
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,716
Hey, be quiet down there!

468
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,832
Can't you let a man sleep
on his wedding night?

469
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,672
- Shh!
- Shh!

470
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,798
"Mañanitas." "Mañanitas."

471
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,430
Begin.

472
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,830
"In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the earth."

473
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,991
In.

474
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,873
"In."

475
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,315
- The.
- "The."

476
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,515
Beginning.

477
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,356
Well, there he goes.

478
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,795
Old Diaz was rottener than we knew.

479
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,033
Huerta pushed from the North with
Pancho Villa, you, the South...

480
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,112
...why, Diaz crumbled.
- Pardon me, sir.

481
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,315
When will the village lands
be given back? People ask.

482
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,278
Don't worry.
We build slowly and carefully.

483
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,108
Give me this. I'll sign this now.

484
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,796
The country people want to know.

485
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,273
They will get their land, but under the
law. It's delicate. It must be studied.

486
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,317
What's to study?

487
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,519
Land must be given back under
the law so there's no injustice.

488
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,070
And speaking of lands...
Close the door, please.

489
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,400
Let me show you this.

490
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,556
Thank you.

491
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,076
You see here,
where these two streams meet?

492
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,992
The land is very rich here.
Rich and level and well-watered.

493
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,277
And I'm told it has
a good house on it.

494
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,960
You know what this is, general?

495
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,519
- No.
- This is your ranch.

496
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,112
My ranch?

497
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,909
It's an old custom
to reward victorious generals...

498
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,556
...and no one deserves it
more than you.

499
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,232
I did not fight for a ranch.

500
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,592
I don't think you know what I meant.

501
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,513
I know what you meant.

502
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,350
The land that I fought for
was not for myself.

503
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,632
- But...
- What about the land I did fight for?

504
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,759
General, that'll be taken care of.
Believe me. In good time.

505
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,433
Now is a good time.

506
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,154
- General, sit down.
- I am not tired.

507
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,832
This is a constitutional government.
There's a way to do things.

508
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,993
This noise, confusion, I can't think.
Get out! Out! Get out!

509
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,196
Give me these. I'll sign now.

510
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,989
They're still waiting, sir.
- Let them wait. I'll come.

511
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,789
I'll be back. Don't let anybody in!
Get the workmen out.

512
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,638
They make too much noise.

513
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,192
This mouse in a black suit
talks like Diaz.

514
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,355
No, he's right. This is peace.
It takes time. We work by law.

515
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,717
Laws. Laws don't govern, men do.

516
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,034
The same men who governed before are
here in that room. They have his ear.

517
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,272
- They've got to be cleaned out.
- And land given back.

518
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,908
- And if Madero doesn't do it...
- Yes?

519
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,514
Then he's an enemy too.

520
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,114
You're his emissary, officer, friend.

521
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,068
I'm a friend to no one
and to nothing except logic.

522
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,396
Peace is very difficult.

523
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,599
Mano, what do you think?

524
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,474
- It's a nice piece of land.
- Shh.

525
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,551
What's the harm?
You've never taken anything.

526
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,278
The result? We have nothing.

527
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,832
Now it's finally quiet.

528
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,717
General Zapata, don't you trust me?

529
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,193
You must trust me.

530
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,432
I promise,
my first preoccupation is the land...

531
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,479
...but in a way that's permanent.
Before you do anything by law...

532
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,555
...you must have law. We cannot have
an armed and angry nation.

533
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,228
It is time to stack our arms.
That is the first step.

534
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,757
That is my first request.
Stack your arms and disband your army.

535
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,312
- And who will enforce the laws?
- The regular army, the police.

536
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,234
They're the ones we just fought
and beat!

537
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,670
Give me your watch.

538
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,031
- What?
- Give me your watch.

539
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,956
Give it to me!

540
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,310
It's a beautiful watch.

541
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,151
Expensive.

542
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,118
- Now take my rifle.
- No.

543
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,311
Now you can have your watch back,
but without this, never!

544
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,831
You draw a strong moral.

545
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,033
You ask us to disarm.

546
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,309
How can we get our land or keep it
if we disarm?

547
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,992
It's not that simple.
There's a matter of time...

548
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,636
Time is one thing to a lawmaker,
but to a farmer...

549
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,837
...there's a time to
plant and a time to harvest.

550
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,390
And you cannot plant in harvest time.

551
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,079
General Zapata, do you trust me?

552
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,990
Just the way my people trust me.

553
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,039
I trust you and they trust me
as long as we keep promises.

554
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,078
And not a moment longer.

555
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,229
Where are you going?
I'm going home.

556
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,789
What will you do there?

557
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,477
I will wait, but not for long.

558
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:42,113
Kill that Zapata now.
Save time, lives, perhaps your own.

559
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,951
- Were you listening, General...?
- I advise you to shoot Zapata now!

560
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,588
General,
I do not shoot my own people.

561
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,910
- You'll learn.
- He is a fine man.

562
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,117
- What does that mean?
- He is an honest man.

563
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,319
What's that got to do with it?
A man can be honest and wrong.

564
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,914
- I trust him.
- To do what?

565
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,596
I think it is essential
to take my troops to Morelos...

566
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,832
...and help him decide to disarm.

567
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,159
Yes.

568
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,628
Oh, excuse me.

569
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,635
No, no. Wait, wait!
Come in. Come in.

570
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,469
- I...
- You can speak freely.

571
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,679
Yes. Excuse me.
Come in, come in.

572
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,995
I want to speak to Zapata again.
Ask him to come back.

573
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,393
He won't come back. He's stubborn,
but if you could come to Morelos...

574
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,953
...he's different there. You know,
his whole life has been fighting. He...

575
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,315
He can hardly read.

576
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,837
He needs you. He may not know it yet,
but he needs you to help him.

577
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,112
He can learn. He wants to.

578
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,678
If you'll excuse me for saying it,
you need him too.

579
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,118
I will come.

580
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,636
- Thank you.
- I will come.

581
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,438
With your permission.
Excuse the interruption, please.

582
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,112
Troops are not necessary.

583
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,390
I will do it without troops.
These are fine people.

584
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,159
You know, General Huerta, there is
such a thing as an honest man.

585
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:58,194
Oh, the odor of goodness.
Get me a drink.

586
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,399
We're never going to get
anywhere as long as Zapata's alive.

587
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:08,509
- He believes in what he's fighting for.
- So does Madero, sir.

588
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,277
I know, but he's a mouse.
He can be handled.

589
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,679
Zapata's a tiger.
You have to kill a tiger.

590
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,872
They don't mind giving up their arms,
now that I've explained it.

591
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,952
Explained it very well,
didn't he, Emiliano?

592
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,918
They have accepted it. Have you?

593
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,879
I've been fighting for so long,
I don't understand peace.

594
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,870
Peace is the hard problem.

595
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,597
Many men have been honest in war.
But peace...

596
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,594
I often wonder how a man can stay
honest under the pressure of peace.

597
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:30,430
What ever happened to that
little boy who got your horse?

598
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,196
He's dead. And they were
never able to find the horse.

599
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,391
- This woman has three rifles.
- Husband and two sons, killed.

600
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,478
Señora.

601
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,791
Please. Take this.

602
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,276
No, it is too valuable.

603
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,073
As valuable as your sons?

604
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,672
- Emiliano! Emiliano!
- What is it?

605
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,235
- Ask him.
- What is it?

606
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,874
Huerta's forces are coming
through the pass!

607
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,918
- Pretend you don't know it.
- No, they're not.

608
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,719
No, they can't.

609
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,480
- How many?
- Three regiments with artillery.

610
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,756
- Who posted scout?
- I did.

611
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,349
- You?
- I don't trust him. I'm right.

612
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,278
Look at him!

613
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,119
Bugle.

614
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,349
I want to shake hands with our
liberator so I can tell my children.

615
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,150
Troops are coming?
Huerta has disobeyed my orders?

616
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,356
What did you say, sir?

617
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,034
Thank you very much, thank you.

618
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,395
I have to go and stop them.

619
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,357
Huerta would not dare!
Would not dare!

620
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,355
We must trust Madero,
only he can bring us peace.

621
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,632
- Emiliano, please listen to me!
- No!

622
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,031
Now get the snipers out
and flank the road.

623
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,511
Might be better to finish him off.

624
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,513
Emiliano, I give you my word.
I will stop the troops.

625
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,996
I hope so.
But if you don't, I will.

626
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,395
- Sorry, Mr. President.
- Huerta must have misunderstood.

627
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,959
He's got good qualities too.

628
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,111
- Pablo.
- Yes. I know, I know.

629
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,312
I'll talk to Emiliano.
I'll bring you two together again.

630
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,590
You look across the river.
I'll look upstream.

631
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,916
Hey, the hat.

632
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,079
Hey!

633
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,718
Here! Here!

634
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,909
All right.
- Did you see him?

635
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,911
- Did you see Huerta?
- Yes.

636
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:15,074
- Why am I a prisoner here?
- You are no longer a prisoner.

637
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,471
But they won't let me leave.
I have been here for days.

638
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,596
He's been guarding you
for your safety.

639
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,591
- You have enemies.
- What enemies?

640
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,479
- Zapata, Pancho Villa.
- I don't understand.

641
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,996
But don't worry, Huerta
loves you. He will protect you.

642
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,355
You must agree, here you've been safe.

643
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,397
Why doesn't he give me
safe conduct to the port?

644
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,357
- When is he going to let me see him?
- Tonight.

645
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,753
- He asked me to take you to him now.
- Good. Good, good.

646
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,999
I don't want to keep him waiting.
We mustn't keep him waiting.

647
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,479
Come on.

648
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,950
I'll be with you in a minute.

649
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,710
It's going to be all right.

650
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,557
It stopped.

651
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,395
Where are they?
What's keeping them?

652
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,155
- We'll be late for the reception.
There they come.

653
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,594
Will you step out, my president?

654
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,830
Is Huerta here?

655
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,318
Where is he?

656
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,399
Where, where is...?
What is...?

657
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,193
What you do is wrong.
Wrong, I say.

658
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,593
No, you can't do this.
I tell you, because, because...

659
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,473
No!

660
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,154
Come on, come on, I'm late.

661
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,631
You were seen talking
to an officer of Huerta's army.

662
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,795
We were ambushed. We know that now.
What have you got to say for yourself?

663
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,676
He was my brother-in-law. They
brought me a message from my wife.

664
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,597
- How did he know where to find you?
- I sent word...

665
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,918
And we were ambushed.

666
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,234
- Shoot him.
Wait.

667
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,116
Look behind you.

668
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,992
Two hundred and forty-four
fighting men.

669
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,595
We planned a surprise.
Huerta was ready for us!

670
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,316
When they killed Madero,
we had to begin again.

671
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,998
We lost many men,
and there was a reason.

672
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,874
But this was useless.

673
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,032
Two hundred and forty-four
good farmers...

674
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,758
...your relatives, with victory
in their mouths, will never chew it.

675
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,912
Now you see why
we have hard discipline.

676
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,231
You told your wife
where we would be, and what?

677
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,311
Shoot him.

678
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,474
Thirty-two deserters.
They want to come over to us.

679
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,799
It's easy to come over to us
now that we're winning, isn't it?

680
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,558
Take care of them.

681
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,153
Go on.

682
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,438
Hexed.

683
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,029
I think I'll get some sleep.

684
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,350
Putting it off?

685
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,152
No.

686
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,310
You're looking tired, Emiliano.

687
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,193
You met with the enemy.
I have witnesses.

688
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,274
You don't need witnesses, just ask me.

689
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,551
It's true. I met with Madero
before he was killed.

690
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,591
- You met him many times.
- Many times...

691
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,557
Even after he signed orders
to destroy us.

692
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,234
At the end, Madero wasn't himself.

693
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,597
He tried to hold Huerta in check,
and Huerta killed him!

694
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,916
He was a good man, Emiliano.

695
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,477
Wanted to build houses, plant fields.

696
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,273
If we could begin to build
even while we're burning...

697
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,635
If we could plant while we destroy...

698
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,629
- You deserted our cause.
- No!

699
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,597
Our cause was land, not a thought.

700
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,275
The corn-planted earth
to feed the families.

701
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,631
Liberty, not a word...

702
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,952
...but a man sitting safely
in front of his home in the evening.

703
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,190
Peace, not a dream!

704
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,509
Time for rest, kindness.

705
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,233
A question beats in my head:

706
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,356
Can a good thing come from a bad act?

707
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,077
Can peace come from so much killing?

708
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:21,559
Can kindness finally come
from so much violence?

709
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,511
Can a man whose thoughts
were born in anger and hatred...

710
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,189
...can such a man lead the peace?

711
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,477
Can he govern in peace?
I don't know.

712
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,315
You must have thought about it,
Emiliano. Do you know?

713
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,672
Do you know?

714
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,392
Do you know?

715
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,029
Two hundred and forty-four of our men
were killed this morning.

716
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,391
We planned to surprise the enemy.
They surprised us.

717
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,312
Emiliano.

718
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,077
We've been friends
since we guarded the corn.

719
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,596
You know our rule
against consorting with the enemy.

720
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,478
Yes, my general.

721
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,630
- And you ignored it.
- Yes, my general!

722
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,957
- Shall I call the squad?
- Emiliano, not strangers.

723
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,792
Do it yourself. Do it yourself.

724
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,877
Message from General Villa.
Important.

725
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,752
General Zapata's busy.

726
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,759
General Zapata will see you now.

727
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,550
Why aren't you eating?

728
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,918
Tell me, why is he a general at all?
What's he got from it?

729
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,274
More.

730
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,432
Look at you. Look at that dress.

731
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,393
Is this a general's house?

732
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,119
Pancho Villa knows what to do
with his opportunities.

733
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,629
Look how he dresses.
Don't argue with me.

734
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,791
- More meat?
- More everything.

735
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,916
I know what I'm talking about.

736
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,868
It's a business opportunity,
and he's not taking advantage of it.

737
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:28,158
He could take half the state, and
everyone would respect him for it...

738
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,880
...and he won't touch it.
I give up on him.

739
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,598
Never had any faith in him!

740
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,031
What's that? Do you hear horses?

741
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,834
Are you hurt?
- No.

742
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,274
Sentry.

743
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,919
- How'd you get through the lines?
- There are no lines.

744
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,071
Huerta's defeated.

745
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,593
If he's in Mexico City,
I'll see him there.

746
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,069
Congratulations, my son.

747
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,028
- Are you sick?
- No.

748
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,433
I'm tired.

749
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,316
I'm tired.

750
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,355
Something's wrong with you.

751
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,874
No, nothing's wrong.

752
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,916
We've won. I just need sleep.

753
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,231
Right this way, gentlemen.

754
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,158
- Zapata!
- Look, look, Huerta.

755
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,234
Zapata.

756
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,798
Let's get this over with.
Here, sit down.

757
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,075
No.
- Sit there.

758
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,038
No.
- Sit down. Sit down!

759
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,839
I'll stand guard now.
What are they doing?

760
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,560
Pancho Villa's still talking,
deciding the fate of Mexico.

761
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,393
Let them take their time.
It's important.

762
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,430
- Forgive me, but it's past 3.
- You're right, we should be asleep.

763
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,870
- We have a great deal to discuss.
What?

764
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,036
- Political matters.
- Ah...

765
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,760
I ate too much.

766
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,119
I haven't anything to discuss.
I've made up my mind.

767
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,038
I'm going home.

768
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,471
I have a nice ranch now. I'm
going to be president of that ranch.

769
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,518
In the morning, I'll hear roosters
instead of bugles.

770
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,231
You know somebody took a shot at me
this morning, someone I didn't know?

771
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,358
What do you propose?

772
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,798
I've been fighting too long,
lost my appetite for it.

773
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,916
You're going home?
- I'm sick of it.

774
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,877
You beat one down
and two more jump up.

775
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,470
- I used to think it would work.
- What about Mexico?

776
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,548
I figured it out.

777
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,028
Only one man I can trust.

778
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,991
Can you read?

779
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,754
- Then you're the president.
- No.

780
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,273
- Yes.
- No.

781
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,318
Yes. Yes, you are.
I just appointed you.

782
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,916
You sleep on it. You'll see I'm right.

783
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,395
There isn't anyone else.

784
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,269
Do I look like a president?

785
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,590
There's no one else.

786
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,749
Acting on the report that there have
been gatherings of disgruntled officers...

787
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,835
...Chavez, on your orders, moved in
with a troop of cavalry after nightfall.

788
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,554
The names of the deceased officers,
my president.

789
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,399
- General, I am not president.
- General.

790
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,516
- All killed?
- All.

791
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,478
- Telegraph congratulations to Chavez.
- Yes, sir.

792
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,519
Next.

793
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,070
A delegation from the state
of Morelos with a petition.

794
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,396
I know these men.

795
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,152
Carlito, how are you?
Pepe, you got skinny.

796
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,036
Well, what can I do for you?

797
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,268
Huh?

798
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,519
What is it?

799
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,793
Lazaro?

800
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,999
What's wrong?

801
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,793
Well...

802
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,708
We have a complaint
against your brother.

803
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,239
My brother?

804
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,914
Your brother moved into
the hacienda de Ayala.

805
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,350
- And?
He took land you distributed.

806
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,476
He's living there.
He put us out.

807
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,949
He killed a man who wouldn't go.

808
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,795
- Carlito, is this true?
It's true.

809
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,997
Well...

810
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,559
All right.

811
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,112
- When I get time, I'll look into it.
These men haven't got time.

812
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,519
Huh?

813
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,071
- These men haven't got time.
- Well, I just...

814
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,037
One minute.

815
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:58,349
They plowed the land, and got it
half-sowed, and they haven't got time.

816
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,870
- Your brother...
- My brother is a general!

817
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:06,631
And he became one, fighting
and killing many of your enemies.

818
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,876
And don't you forget it.

819
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,439
I'm one of you, and you can trust me.

820
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,273
Since you are,
you know the land can't wait.

821
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,877
The furrows are open, the seed's not
planted, and stomachs can't wait.

822
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,678
What's your name?

823
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,311
Hernandez.

824
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,800
- What is it?
- Hernandez.

825
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,952
- H-E-R-N-A...
- I have it.

826
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,273
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

827
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,829
So you're throwing it away.

828
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,232
Leave tonight, your enemies will
be here tomorrow, in this room.

829
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:30,149
They'll hunt you down till
you get your rest in the sun.

830
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,073
- Leave now, you won't live long.
- I won't anyway.

831
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,310
In the name of all we fought for,
don't go!

832
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,596
In the name of all we fought for,
I'm going.

833
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,751
- I won't go with you.
- I don't expect you to.

834
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,191
Now I know you. No fields, no home.

835
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,195
No wife, no woman.
No friends, no love.

836
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,670
You'll only destroy,
that is your love.

837
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,868
And I will tell you what you will do.
You will go to Obregón or Carranza.

838
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,635
And you will never change.

839
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,673
Come on.

840
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,038
Brother, be careful
what you say to me.

841
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,158
Did you take the land away
from these people?

842
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,276
I took what I wanted.

843
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,634
- Mano...
- I took their wives too.

844
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,592
What kind of animal are you?

845
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,155
I'm a man,
not a freak like my brother!

846
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,918
Get out!

847
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:18,074
I fought as long and as hard as you.
Every day you fought, I fought!

848
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:23,914
I'm a general. Look. Look!
Here's my pay, a little dust.

849
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,399
I can't even buy a bottle of tequila.

850
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,310
We beat Diaz. He's living
in a palace in Paris.

851
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,075
We beat Huerta.
He's rich in the United States.

852
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:40,353
I have to beg pennies
from people who never fired a gun!

853
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,951
I'm a general! I'm gonna act like one!

854
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,396
And don't you
or anybody else try to stop me.

855
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,239
Chula!

856
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,993
So?

857
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:01,750
This land is yours.
But you must protect it.

858
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,230
It won't be yours long
if you don't protect it.

859
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,793
If necessary, with your lives,
and your children with their lives.

860
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:18,670
Don't discount your enemies.
They will be back.

861
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:23,676
And if your house is burned,
build it again.

862
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,719
If your corn is destroyed, replant.
If your children die, bear more.

863
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,350
If they drive you out of the valley,
live on the mountain, but live.

864
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,950
You always look for leaders,
strong men without faults.

865
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,238
There aren't any.
There are only men like yourselves.

866
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:45,117
They change. They desert. They die.

867
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,670
There are no leaders but yourselves.

868
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,396
A strong people
is the only lasting strength.

869
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,832
Emiliano!

870
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,518
Mano!

871
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,871
What he said was true.
He fought every day we fought.

872
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,431
He was a general.
We will bury him as a general.

873
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,759
No.

874
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,831
He didn't die in battle.
I'll take him home with me.

875
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:31,397
Pancho Villa's in the North.
There's no trouble with him.

876
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:33,835
But Zapata, what about Zapata?

877
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,709
Sir, how could you fight
an enemy you can't see?

878
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:41,668
You're looking for an army to fight.
There is no army.

879
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,555
Every man, woman and child
in Morelos is Zapata's army.

880
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,073
There's only one thing to do.
Wipe them out. All of them.

881
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,955
Excuse me, sir, we can't
find anybody to wipe out.

882
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,954
We go there, the corn is growing,
a fire in the hearth, and no one.

883
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,111
We burn the house,
we destroy the corn.

884
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,716
We go back, there are new shelter,
the corn is growing again.

885
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,351
They're like a different race.
They're not afraid of anything.

886
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,115
This is not a man we're discussing.
It's an idea, and it's spreading.

887
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,918
It's a man!

888
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,955
Cut off the head of the snake
and the body will die.

889
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:26,076
Ideas are harder to kill than snakes.
How do you kill an idea?

890
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,358
Kill Zapata, your problem's solved.

891
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,589
Let us through. Let us through!

892
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,194
Let us through.
Let me by!

893
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,557
- Well?
We saw the supplies.

894
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,995
The guns are new, never fired.
Machine guns too.

895
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,275
Shh.

896
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,352
- Ammunition?
- A mountain of it.

897
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,039
- Have you seen it?
- Yes.

898
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:15,190
That would give us a year. And in a
year, we'd be ready for anything.

899
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,991
- Why does he want to join us?
Was stripped of his rank.

900
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,673
He wants revenge.

901
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:24,230
And now he's a colonel
with a first-class regiment?

902
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,351
Sounds like a trap.

903
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,791
- But it's strange enough to be true.
- Yes.

904
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,757
What proof did he give you
of his good faith?

905
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,992
He executed Juan Calsavo,
chief of police.

906
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,152
Further proof he leads to you.

907
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,396
All right. All right.

908
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,348
Be here at sunset ready to ride,
and I'll think out some more proofs.

909
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,477
- What has happened?
Nothing.

910
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:14,912
- Emiliano, I want to know.
- What?

911
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:19,757
- What is happening?
- Are the hens beginning to crow?

912
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:36,074
Every night I have the same thought.
My heart says to me:

913
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,915
"Now for the first time, you have
your husband alone...

914
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,231
...without fighting, running, hiding."

915
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,118
But it also says soon you will be dead,
and I have never known you in peace.

916
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,953
Josefa, I'm trying to make a plan.

917
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:18,079
- We're getting the ammunition we need.
I don't want to hear!

918
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,035
Josefa.

919
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:28,519
Soon you will be gone, and a stranger
will come to tell me you're dead.

920
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:34,038
That is what is left for me.
That is what is left for me.

921
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:43,471
A federal colonel is giving me his
regiment and all his equipment...

922
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:46,279
- It's a trick.
- I always suspect a trick.

923
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,829
- They'll kill you.
- I haven't decided.

924
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,600
- Don't go.
- We need the ammunition!

925
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,150
- I have a feeling. Don't go!
- Enough! I will make up my mind.

926
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,313
- You want to die?
- I must do what is needed.

927
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:04,918
- Do you want to die?
- Josefa, that's enough!

928
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,753
I will make up my mind.

929
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,193
I must do what is needed.

930
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,835
I will be all right.

931
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:40,434
Look how the little clouds go
across the face of the moon.

932
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,869
The moon is racing.

933
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,391
Time's racing too.

934
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,072
Yes.

935
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:54,668
It reminds me,
you've made up your mind.

936
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,758
Shh.

937
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,116
I don't speak for myself now...

938
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,950
...but if anything happens to you,
what will become of these people?

939
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,238
- What will they have left?
- Themselves.

940
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:15,270
With all the fighting and the death,
what has really changed?

941
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,949
They've changed.

942
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,955
That's how things really change.
Slowly, through people.

943
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,190
They don't need me anymore.

944
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:30,559
- They have to be led.
- Yes, but by each other.

945
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,870
A strong man makes a weak people.

946
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,713
Strong people don't need a strong man.

947
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,475
Here.

948
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,639
Well?

949
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,876
The town is destroyed,
its garrison dead.

950
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,669
You saw it?
- The garrison is destroyed!

951
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,356
- And the supplies?
- I saw them stacked and waiting.

952
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,870
What do you think?

953
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,711
What do you think?

954
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,798
He's passed every test.

955
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,510
Paco.

956
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,995
When will you go?

957
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,030
Now.

958
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,911
We leave tonight. It's safer by night.

959
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,035
Chamaco.

960
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,398
Suppose something happened to me?

961
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,877
We'll get along.

962
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,112
Someday we'll go down
into the valleys again.

963
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,790
Until then, we know how to survive.

964
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,955
Don't, don't!

965
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,476
Emiliano, no.
Don't go, I tell you.

966
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,076
Emiliano, don't. Don't!

967
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,629
Emiliano!

968
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,796
Emiliano Zapata.

969
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,111
Jesus Gaujardo.

970
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,833
- Where did you find him?
- He's yours.

971
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:46,432
- Where have you been?
- A federal officer had him.

972
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,590
Got old.

973
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,515
Get that horse!
Shoot him!

974
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,432
Shoot him!

975
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,593
- The horse got away.
- The horse?

976
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,275
Well, these people
are very superstitious.

977
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,998
They must have been very afraid
of him. They shot him to ribbons.

978
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,435
The tiger is dead.

979
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,798
- Well, that's the end of that.
- I don't know.

980
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:40,397
Sometimes a dead man
can be a terrible enemy.

981
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,719
Expose his body in the plaza
so they can see it.

982
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,718
So they can all see that he's dead.

983
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,275
Who are they fooling?
Shot up that way, could be anybody.

984
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,351
- He fooled them again.
- You sure?

985
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:29,231
I fought with him all these years.
They think they can fool me?

986
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,470
- They can't kill him.
- They never will.

987
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:37,112
- Can you catch a river, kill the wind?
- He's not a river, he's a man!

988
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,193
- And still they can't kill him.
- Then where is he?

989
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,999
He's in the mountains.

990
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,757
You couldn't find him now.

991
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,790
But if we ever need him again,
he'll be back.

992
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,471
Yes.

993
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,154
He's in the mountains.
