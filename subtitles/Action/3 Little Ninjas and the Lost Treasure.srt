Oh! Oh!

32
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,256
Yeah, okay. There you go!

33
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,922
No, no, no!

34
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:34,892
Good job.

35
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:43,335

- Morning, Stone.
- Hey, Terence.

43
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,394
Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

44
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:48,199
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

45
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:51,605
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

46
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,177
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

47
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:59,045
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

48
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:01,379
I know, Fairy Gary.

49
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:20,228
Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

50
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,539
And where are you off to?

51
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:25,302
Just doing some errands and stuff.

52
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:30,647
- Errands!
- And stuff!

53
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,943
Why are you guys talking like that?

54
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,314
No reason.

55
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:40,421
- All right.
- Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

56
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,583
What?

57
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,627
Very funny.

58
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,958
All right, you got me.
I'm gonna help Tink again.

59
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,128
- Is it okay if I take this?
- Sure.

60
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:54,932
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

61
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,841
Hammer.

62
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,687
Thanks. Okay, try it now, Cheese.

63
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,128
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

64
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:28,666
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

65
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,400
Hi, Terence.

66
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:33,375
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

67
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,633
Hmm.

68
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,213
- Iridessa?
- Nope. Try again.

69
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,213
- Fawn?
- Me!

70
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,343
Just kidding.

71
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,513
<i>So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?</i>

72
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,521
Wow. The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

73
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,856
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

74
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,761
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

75
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,925
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

76
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,230
I think it's gonna be perfect.

77
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:09,103
Clip.

78
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,887
All right, Cheese, ready to launch.

79
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:19,616
Aah!

80
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:23,490
It floats!

81
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,299
Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

82
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,133
Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

83
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,794
- All set?
- Check.

84
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,370
Let her rip.

85
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:42,838
Whoa.

86
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,349
And now for hydro-drive.

87
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,185
Sorry.

88
00:07:58,696 --> 00:07:59,754
Whoa!

89
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,891
Oh, no!

90
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,503
Hmm.

91
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,878
Ooh!

92
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,832
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

93
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,667
I can't believe the boat broke.

94
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:45,333
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

95
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:46,932
I'm impressed.

96
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:50,673
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

97
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,874
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

98
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:55,713
- I drove it into a tree?
- Never mind.

99
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,382
Jingles!

100
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:02,481
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

101
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,060
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

102
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,191
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

103
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:14,068
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

104
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,072
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

105
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,968
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

106
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,747
Uh-oh.

107
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:27,942
- Someone's in trouble.
- Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

108
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,817
The stinkbug incident?

109
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,282
Oh, no.

110
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:35,425
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

111
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,929
It's all
a big misunderstanding.

112
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:45,365
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

113
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,901
One moment.

114
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:54,168
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

115
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,870
Thank you, Viola.

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,772
- Fairy Mary, are you certain?
- Whatever do you mean?

117
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:03,820
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

118
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,152
- Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
- Well, yes.

119
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,818
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

120
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:13,192
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

121
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,563
Very well.

122
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,025
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

123
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,000
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

124
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:32,310
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

125
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:40,879
- This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
- No.

126
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:43,516
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

127
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:44,685
Mary.

128
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,325
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

129
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,263
- My dear.
- Hi.

130
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,697
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

131
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:57,205
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

132
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,499
Since time immemorial,

133
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,807
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

134
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:08,215
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

135
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:12,314
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

136
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:16,851
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

137
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,393
- They're beautiful.
- Every scepter is unique.

138
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,202
Some are the work of animal fairies,

139
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:30,967
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

140
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:35,003
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

141
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:38,513
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

142
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,147
- Me? But I'm... I'm...
- A very talented tinker.

143
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,851
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

144
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,725
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

145
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,363
When the blue moon is at its peak,

146
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:02,667
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

147
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:07,102
The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

148
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,947
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

149
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,508
We are relying on you.

150
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,276
This way, dear.

151
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,421
Here is the moonstone.

152
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:26,029
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

153
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,358
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

154
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:35,631
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

155
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,370
- Thank you!
- Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

156
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:42,877
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

157
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,885
- Why are you counting?
- It helps to calm me down.

158
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:54,490
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

159
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,957
Yahoo!

160
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:05,826
Tink!

161
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,462
Tink?

162
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:11,631
Hey!

163
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,747
So?

164
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,440
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

165
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,383
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

166
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,009
Well, I...

167
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,284
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

168
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,452
Me! Me!

169
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:33,257
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

170
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,922
Yeah! Want to see?

171
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:44,164
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

172
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,108
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

173
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,804
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

174
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,940
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

175
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:55,450
at a 90-degree angle

176
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,543
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

177
00:13:57,654 --> 00:14:00,782
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

178
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,084
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

179
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,026
Hey! You know what this calls for?

180
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:08,996
- Two cups of...
- Chamomile tea.

181
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,363
- With extra honey and...
- And some milkweed whip.

182
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,371
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

183
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:18,202
Fairy Gary loves it.

184
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,969
- He's so cute.
- Lf you say so.

185
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:26,111
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

186
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:29,242
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

187
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:34,281
- You will? That's... That's so sweet.
- Hey, what are friends for?

188
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,486
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

189
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:38,959
That would be great.

190
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,623
- The best dust-keeper fairy.
- And the best tinker!

191
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,996
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

192
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,339
Knock-knock.

193
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:57,411
- Morning.
- Hi.

194
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:03,208
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

195
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:08,687
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

196
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:09,850
Whoa.

197
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,654
Wow, Terence, how did you...

198
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,197
I love this thing!

199
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,895
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

200
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:22,096
Looks good.

201
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:24,265
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

202
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:27,309
if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.

203
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,673
Right. Got it.

204
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,216
Knock-knickity-knock!

205
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,690
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

206
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,620
You gotta keep the fire nice and hot.

207
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:06,949
Excuse me, Tink.

208
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,747
Yeah, you know, you should
really keep that workspace clean.

209
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,654
Okay, let me just...
Let me get that one right there.

210
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,224
Just one more. Thank you.

211
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,298
- Whoa!
- One, two, three...

212
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,457
- Why are you counting?
...four...

213
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,568
Knickity-knickity-knock!
Knickity-knock!

214
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:35,909
Watch your angle there.

215
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,403
Knock-knock!
Who's there?

216
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,764
Knock. Knock who?
Knock-knock-knickity-knock!

217
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:05,532
Knickity-knock.

218
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:38,434
Steady.

219
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:42,041
You gotta be easy.
This is the tricky part.

220
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,240
I know.

221
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,741
All right, now we gotta match
the trajectory of the light beam

222
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,843
- with the...
- Got it. Thanks.

223
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,444
- With the...
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

224
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:53,887
- With the...
- Shh!

225
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:59,658
- The curvature of the moonstone.
- Will you please...

226
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,532
Tink, it looks like you need
some sort of, you know, sharp thingy.

227
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,769
That's exactly what I need.

228
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,710
Could you go out
and find me something sharp?

229
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:21,079
You got it. I'll be right back.

230
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:22,785
Take your time.

231
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,193
Clank, what is that?

232
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:38,498
This is a fireworks launcher.
Allow me to demonstrate.

233
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:43,335
Iridessa and Rosetta will mix
light crystals with flower pigment.

234
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,005
The mixture will go into the launcher,
like so.

235
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:50,174
Then I tighten the spring, like so.

236
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,005
- Oh, dear. Clank...
- Then you throw the trigger...

237
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,243
- Yes, Clank...
...and the fireworks shoot into the air!

238
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,910
- Clank!
- Like so!

239
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,215
Clanky, that's brilliant!

240
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:07,753
Hey, Bobble. Listen, do you know
where I can find a sharp thingy?

241
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,666
- A sharp thingy?
- How about a stick?

242
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:17,301
- No, a sharp thingy-majigy.
- A stick can be pretty sharp!

243
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,772
No, I need something sharper
to help Tink.

244
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:22,535
For Tink!

245
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:26,673
- Clank, don't sneak up on me like that.
- Did you try the cove?

246
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,284
Of course! That's where
all the lost things wash up.

247
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:34,483
- Thanks, Bobble. Thanks, Clank.
- Our pleasure. So long, Terence!

248
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,619
I'm getting a little dizzy.

249
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,389
Uh-oh.

250
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,768
Perfect.

251
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,970
And now for the finishing touch,
a spattering of silver shavings.

252
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:03,377
Steady. I can't wait till she sees this.

253
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:08,248
Oh!

254
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,926
There. Perfect.

255
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,367
- Finally.
- Hey, Tink! I'm back!

256
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,774
- What is this?
- It's your sharp thingy.

257
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,974
My... That's not...

258
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:38,180
One, two, three, four...

259
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,853
Terence, this is not sharp.
This is round.

260
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,161
It is, in fact, the exact opposite of sharp.

261
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:50,724
- Really, look, if you look inside, it's...
- I need to work, okay?

262
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,296
Now, would you please
get this thing out of here?

263
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:04,744
My scepter!

264
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:10,982
Tink, I'm so sorry. I...

265
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,585
- Out, Terence! Just go!
- What?

266
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:18,719
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

267
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,093
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

268
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:25,926
- I was just trying to be a good friend. I...
- Go away! Just leave me alone!

269
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,734
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

270
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,417
Ow! Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

271
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,155
No.

272
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:21,514
Kept her workspace clean,
brought her food, stoked the fire!

273
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,659
"Find a sharp thingy."
Searched high and low,

274
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,021
and she didn't even say thank you!

275
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:33,961
Whoa.

276
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:45,837
I know some rock fairies
that are gonna be pretty upset.

277
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,048
What? There are no rock fairies.

278
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,551
You never know. There might be.

279
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,223
Are you okay?

280
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:58,217
Yeah, I'm great! Why do you ask?

281
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:04,158
I'm... No. I'm sorry.
I... I had a fight with Tink.

282
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:06,702
What happened?

283
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:11,440
There was just an accident,
and she just... She just exploded. I...

284
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,408
She exploded?

285
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:15,572
No, no, I don't mean like that.

286
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,079
I mean, she just yelled at me,
you know? And...

287
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,239
Oh!

288
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,511
Did she turn red?

289
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,348
Well, of course she turned red!
It's Tink!

290
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:27,923
Just give her a chance to cool off.

291
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:31,719
Yeah, you're probably right.

292
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,582
- Hello, Tink!
- Clank! Bobble!

293
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:00,788
Came to see if you wanted to join us
for fairytale theater.

294
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,949
We figure you could use
a real break.

295
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,755
Break? Nothing's broken!
What do you mean?

296
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,454
What do you know?

297
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,323
Sorry, fellas. Busy.

298
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,162
You know, the revelry,
fall scepter, whatnot.

299
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,634
I can't wait to see that scepter!

300
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:18,904
- Try.
- Is it as beautiful as I imagine?

301
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,301
Uh...

302
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:23,412
- No.
- Terence told us it's amazing.

303
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:26,107
We're so proud of you.

304
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:31,717
- Look, guys, I really don't have time.
- Well, not to worry, Tink.

305
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:34,346
We'll tell Fairy Mary
you couldn't make it.

306
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,391
- Fairy Mary?
- Well, sure!

307
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:39,621
You know her.
She never misses fairytale theater.

308
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,691
Bye-bye!

309
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:48,595
Clank! Bobble! Wait for me!

310
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,411
Fairy Mary, I...

311
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,746
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

312
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:04,247
Have you finished the scepter?

313
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:06,888
Well, not exactly.

314
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,693
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

315
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,552
Yes?

316
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:14,591
It's about the moonstone.

317
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:18,691
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

318
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,430
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

319
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,440
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

320
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,908
using two would create even more.

321
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:30,012
Do you have another moonstone?

322
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:34,277
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

323
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,481
And thank goodness we found it.

324
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:40,044
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

325
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:43,353
and things would be pretty tough
around here, believe you me.

326
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,620
Are you okay? You look sort of pale.

327
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,991
- Wait. I know what's going on.
- You do?

328
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:58,036
You've been working too hard.
What you need is a little theater.

329
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:02,444
Knowing you, you'd probably redo
the whole scepter if you could.

330
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:05,445
- Is that an option?
- Tinker Bell!

331
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:36,344
How exciting!

332
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,886
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!
- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!</i>

333
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:54,362
<i>- 'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore
- 'T is the moment for ancient fairy lore</i>

334
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,299
Tinker Bell, do you mind?

335
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:01,233
Sorry. Skunk training.

336
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,169
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush!
- Hush, fairies! Hush!</i>

337
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:10,179
<i>- For a fairytale of yore!
- For a fairytale of yore!</i>

338
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,949
'Twas a distant fall

339
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,983
when a pirate ship
arrived in Neverland.

340
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,356
The dreaded pirates swarmed ashore,

341
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:29,461
seeking the greatest
and most elusive prize of all.

342
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,293
A fairy.

343
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:34,536
Pirates give me the willies!

344
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,573
Far and wide, the pirates searched
until they found a fairy.

345
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,607
They chased her, captured her

346
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:45,238
and forced her to lead them
to the most magical treasure,

347
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:48,346
the enchanted Mirror of Incanta.

348
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:57,088
Forged by fairy magic in ages past,

349
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,893
the mirror had the power
to grant three wishes,

350
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,862
anything precious to your heart.

351
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,903
- Fairy Mary, is this true?
- Every word.

352
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,835
The pirates used two wishes,

353
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:14,272
but before they could use
the third wish,

354
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:19,411
the ship was wrecked
on an island north of Neverland.

355
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:25,777
The Mirror of Incanta,
with its last remaining wish,

356
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:29,556
was lost forever.

357
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:39,496
Yet it is said that the clues to find it
are hidden in this ancient chant.

358
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:43,934
"Journey due north past Neverland

359

362
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,790

365
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,491
What did she say?

366
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:15,696
I think she said something
about a toll bridge.

367
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,170
- Toll bridge?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,798
- But I don't know how much it costs.
- Oh?

Pan. Chart.

384

Extra clothes.

385
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:56,898
This one's not for traveling.

386
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,935
How am I gonna carry all this?

387
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:03,836
Not enough.

388
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:08,012
- There you go. One cup, dear.
- Thank you.

389
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,612
Fairy Gary. Hi.

390
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,648
Hello, Tink. What brings you here?

391
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,289
I see that bucket-and-pulley system
I rigged for you is working out.

392
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:20,453
You know, Fairy Gary,
you really run a tight ship.

393
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:24,693
I know it sounds like I'm just saying it,
but you really do. Really.

394
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,266
That's very sweet, dear.

395
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:30,829
Anyway, I was wondering,
can I have some extra pixie dust?

396
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,468
Pardon?

397
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:37,876
Come on, Fairy Gary. Please?
Just a smidge?

398
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:42,041
Now, Tinker Bell, you know the rules,

399
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:46,382
and it says here
you already got your ration.

400
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,623
Iridessa! Rosetta!

401
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,824
- What do you think?
- Lend you some of our dust?

402
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:01,563
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

403
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:05,004
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

404
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,240
Sorry, Tink.

405
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:11,672
Say, you know who can help.

406
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:20,215
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

407
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,514
- Hi, Cheese!
- Hey, Terence!

408
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,092
Morning, Fawn!

409
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:27,258
- Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
- Terence.

410
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:30,429
- Tink?
- Hi.

411
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:34,929
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

412
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,605
I'm working on it.

413
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,904
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

414
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:45,412
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

415
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,943
I need some extra pixie dust.

416
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:53,914
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

417
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:55,215
Yeah.

418
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:59,090
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

419
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:01,891
I... I can't tell you.

420
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:03,997
You can't tell me?

421
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,331
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

422
00:33:07,436 --> 00:33:10,132
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

423
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:13,308
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

424
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,207
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

425
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:20,743
No, I...

426
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,546
I guess we're not.

427
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:26,783
I'm on my own, then.

428
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,352
What?

429
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:50,098
So long, Pixie Hollow. I'll be back soon.

430
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:15,820
I just need to angle the moon
with the horizon.

431
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,438
Huh?

432
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:19,019
I'm starving.

433
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,055
My boysenberry rolls!

434
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:48,417
My mouse cheese!
My pumpernickel muffin!

435
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,116
Out. Out. Shoo. Go find your friends.

436
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,592
Stop following me.

437
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,797
I'm on a very important mission.

438
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:10,167
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

439
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,830
No, I don't need any help.

440
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,671
Yes, I am sure. Okay. Now, let's see.

441
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:23,877
Hey, look! Look, little guy. Fetch!

442
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:29,284
Will you please get out of here?

443
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,699
That does it. Out!

444
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,646
All right. You can stay.

445
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:41,587
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

446
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:46,764
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

447
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,834
I'm Tinker Bell. What's your name?

448
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,009
Okay. Blinky?

449
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:59,012
Flicker? Flash? Beam? Flare?

450
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:02,475
Well, how in the blazing bellows
am I supposed to guess your name

451
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:03,552
if you keep...

452
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,617
Your name's Bellows?

453
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,250
Oh, Blaze.

454
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,091
Kind of a tough-guy name.
You a tough guy?

455
00:40:16,532 --> 00:40:18,523
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

456
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:22,426
That's it, Cheese.
Keep them coming.

457
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:23,863
Next.

458
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,605
Okay. Next.

459
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,734
Iridessa,
how are those lanterns coming?

460
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,941
Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

461
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,178
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

462
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:41,313
I can't wait to mix them up
with my begonias, gardenias and...

463
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,891
- Forget-me-nots.
- Forget-me-nots.

464
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:48,062
I keep forgetting those.

465
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:52,528
Fawn, show me how that
21 -butterfly salute is coming along.

466
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:56,160
All right, fellas, when I blow the whistle,
you guys go.

467
00:40:57,406 --> 00:40:59,340
On your mark, get set...

468
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:05,844
One down and 20 to go.

469
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:10,448
Keep at it, sweetie.
Silvermist, what are you working on?

470
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,713
Pollywog bubbles. Okay, guys.

471
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,388
Ooh!

472
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,929
- There you go.
- Nicely done, dear.

473
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,257
Next.

474
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,526
Fireworks. Is it ready yet?

475
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:29,968
- Yes!
- Let her rip!

476
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,835
- Right, Bobble.
- Dear.

477
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:37,206
I'm okay.

478
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,781
Still okay.

479
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,147
Honestly.

480
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:59,534
One, two.

481
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:05,698
I don't understand, Blaze.
We should've seen land by now.

482
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:11,176
You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

483
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:44,941
Whoa! I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm...
In a tree?

484
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:48,276
This must be the lost island.

485
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,449
There it is.
The stone arch from the story!

486
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:55,412
You stay here and guard the balloon.

487
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,821
I'll be right back.

488
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:17,768
Oh!

489
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,345
Oh, no.

490
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:23,646
This is supposed to be a rock arch,
not a twisty, branchy, tree arch.

491
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,061
Not now.

492
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,709
What has gotten into you?

493
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:52,071
Blaze, where's the balloon?

494
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,179
It's gone?

495
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:58,250
My compass, my supplies,
my pixie dust.

496
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:01,655
I left you in charge.
Why didn't you warn me?

497
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:05,418
Well, I... You...

498
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:10,359
Okay, okay. We'll get back to that later.
We gotta find that balloon.

499
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:29,242
Blaze!

500
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:40,152
Tink?

501
00:44:44,032 --> 00:44:49,129
- I'm so sorry...
- Terence. Terence. How did you...

502
00:44:49,238 --> 00:44:52,765
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

503
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:55,036
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

504
00:44:55,143 --> 00:44:57,338
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...

505
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,175
Just leave me alone!

506
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,983
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

507
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,383
No. Terence, come back. Terence.

508
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,989
Terence.

509
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,203
Blaze, where are you?

510
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,936
Blaze!

511
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:42,981
I lost my balloon. I lost my pixie dust.
I'm starving.

512
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:45,985
What have I done?

513
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:56,429
Wow, that hit the spot.
Thank you so much.

514
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:02,327
Hey, we're lost.

515
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:06,839
By any chance, have you seen
a stone arch around here?

516
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:31,195
I'm out of dust.
Looks like I'll be walking from here.

517
00:47:40,575 --> 00:47:41,906
My compass!

518
00:47:45,747 --> 00:47:46,839
Ouch!

519
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:49,347
That is a sharp thingy.

520
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,312
Terence.

521
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:07,333
The stone arch. Blaze, hey, we made it!
We're here!

522
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,866
Thank you so much.

523
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:17,604
Thank you all so much. Bye, now. Bye!

524
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:22,911
Great to have friends
that will help you out, huh?

525
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:31,786
I know Tink is my best friend.

526
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:34,861
We should just forgive each other.

527
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:38,421
Someone just needs
to take the first step.

528
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,058
Who?

529
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:43,329
Yeah, well, I think it should be Tink.

530
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:45,835
- Who?
- Tink.

531
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:48,968
She blamed me
for breaking the scepter.

532
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:52,469
- Who?
- Tink!

533
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:54,538
I know she's under a lot of pressure,

534
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:57,447
but she shouldn't
have treated me that way.

535
00:48:57,986 --> 00:48:59,749
She should apologize.

536
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:01,446
Who?

537
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:08,251
Me.

538
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,396
Thank you so much, Mr. Owl.

539
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,266
You know what? You are truly
the wisest of all the creatures.

540
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:22,904
The fellows are making fun
of my kilt again.

541
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,445
- Who?
- The guys at the depot!

542
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,876
They keep calling it a skirt.

543
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:39,116
Hey, Tink, it's me.

544
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:44,862
Look, I know you're mad at me, okay,
but there's something I need to tell you.

545
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:47,426
Tink?

546
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,107
Anyone home?

547
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:01,615
The moonstone.

548
00:50:06,354 --> 00:50:07,412
What?

549
00:50:21,002 --> 00:50:24,699
It's our last day, Blaze.
We gotta find that shipwreck soon.

550
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,287
None shall pass
the secret troll bridge.

551
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:49,052
Troll bridge?
I thought it was "toll bridge."

552
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:52,967
- Look, fellas, I don't want any trouble.
- We are guardians of the secret...

553
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:56,003
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- What?

554
00:50:56,104 --> 00:50:58,902
It's my turn to give
the ominous warning, blockhead.

555
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:00,269
- Is not.
- Is too.

556
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:04,936
- Is not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!
- Is too! Is too! Too! Too! Too! Too! Too!

557
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:06,809
You did it last time.

558
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:09,880
That was over 300 years ago!

559
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,548
Go ahead.

560
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:17,916
We are guardians of the secret bridge.

561
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:22,390
Beat it before we grind your bones
to make our bed.

562
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:25,690
- Bread.
- What?

563
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:32,367
The expression is, "Grind your bones
to make our bread," not "bed."

564
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:34,334
Oh? Really?

565
00:51:35,977 --> 00:51:38,741
Who would want
to make bread out of bones?

566
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,511
Might break a tooth.

567
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:43,413
Well, who would want to sleep in a bed
made of bones?

568
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:46,679
It's hard on the back. It'll put a crick
in your neck, you knucklehead.

569
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:50,019
Lx-nay in front of the ictim-vay.

570
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,284
Gravel for brains.

571
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:53,793
- Fuzz face.
- Thimble head.

572
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,226
- Stinky breath.
- Googly eyes.

573
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,763
- Waxy ears!
- Unibrow!

574
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,833
Excuse me. I need to get through.

575
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:01,333
None shall pass!

576
00:52:01,603 --> 00:52:04,265
Do you have any idea
what I've been through to get here?

577
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:05,771
I almost got attacked by bugs and bats

578
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:07,307
and got blown all over the place
by the wind,

579
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:10,037
and almost starved to death to find
a mirror that grants one last wish,

580
00:52:10,145 --> 00:52:11,169
which I wouldn't have even needed

581
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,110
if Terence had taken his time
finding me a sharp thingy

582
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,909
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

583
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:17,041
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

584
00:52:17,152 --> 00:52:18,881
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

585
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:21,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

586
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:23,952
- Who's Terence?
- Is he a friend of yours?

587
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,890
Well, yeah.

588
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,260
He was my best friend.

589
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:33,425
- You're not very nice.
- Hey, don't you judge me!

590
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:36,766
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

591
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:38,839
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

592
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,305
You old softie.

593
00:52:41,643 --> 00:52:46,671
- Like when I call you "wart face."
- Yes. Or when I call you "big nose."

594
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:49,714
- Booger breath.
- Stinky feet.

595
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:51,581
- Weasel toes!
- Badger brain!

596
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,816
- Garden gnome!
- Garden gnome?

597
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,823
Oh, dear,
I don't know where that came from.

598
00:53:01,663 --> 00:53:05,895
- I crossed the line.
- Say the magic words. Go on.

599
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:10,727
I'm sorry.

600
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,330
- Do you mean it?
- Absolutely.

601
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,375
- Do you feel it?
- Deeply.

602
00:53:17,045 --> 00:53:19,946
Well, then, I forgive you.

603
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:25,182
- Friends?
- Friends.

604
00:53:29,591 --> 00:53:31,786
- Come here, buddy.
- Pal!

605
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,827
<i>- Amigo.
- Compadre.</i>

606
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:36,061
- You're the best.
- No, you.

607
00:53:36,164 --> 00:53:37,961
- No, you.
- No, you're right, I am the best.

608
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,762
- So now you think you're the best?
- I know I'm the best!

609
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,598
Now, don't you argue with me!

610
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:43,762
Well, you're ugly
and stinky.

611
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:44,930
Really?

612
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,646
Blaze, listen, it's the ocean.

613
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:37,853
The ship that sunk but never sank.
Okay, Blaze, this is it.

614
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:41,491
We gotta find that mirror
and fix the moonstone. Let's go.

615
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:12,217
Why couldn't the mirror
be in a bunny-filled meadow?

616
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,726
Blaze!

617
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,171
Who's that? Who's there?

618
00:57:04,934 --> 00:57:06,299
Look, Blaze.

619
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:22,106
Ah!

620
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,459
What do you think? Too big?

621
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:44,436
It's gotta be in here somewhere, Blaze.
Come on. Help me look.

622
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:11,696
It's real.

623
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:25,406
Okay. Deep breath.

624
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:30,541
Clear your mind.
Only get one shot at this. Here it goes.

625
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:34,679
I wish... I wish...

626
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,590
I wish...

627
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:42,863
Blaze, I wish you'd be quiet
for one minute!

628
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:51,435
No, no, no, no! No!
That one didn't count!

629
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:54,843
I take it back.
Please, please. I take it back!

630
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:57,037
That wasn't my wish. Please!

631
00:58:58,948 --> 00:59:01,109
Blaze, look what you've done!

632
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:05,487
This mirror was my last chance.
This is all your fault!

633
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:27,232
I'm sorry, Blaze. It's not your fault.

634
00:59:29,011 --> 00:59:30,308
It's mine.

635
00:59:33,249 --> 00:59:34,716
It's all mine.

636
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:44,893
I wish Terence were here.

637
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:48,256
I wish we were still friends.

638
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:53,797
We are friends, Tink.

639
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:56,899
Terence.

640
00:59:58,107 --> 01:00:01,736
- I am so sorry.
- I forgive you.

641
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,241
I miss you so much.

642
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:09,874
I miss you, too. But, Tink, why...

643
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:13,684
Why didn't you tell me
about the moonstone?

644
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:16,584
I didn't want anyone to know.

645
01:00:16,926 --> 01:00:19,690
I didn't think
I needed any help, Terence.

646
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:22,860
I was wrong. I wish you were here.

647
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,700
- I am here.
- I know you are.

648
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:30,736
But, I mean, really here, with me.

649
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:33,808
I am with you.

650
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:37,911
No. I mean here, Terence,
right next to me.

651
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:40,645
I'm standing behind you.

652
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:43,045
Terence!

653
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:48,856
I'm so sorry, Terence.
I know, I was so wrong...

654
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,926
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, too.

655
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,652
You know, you were under
a lot of pressure... Whoa! Hey.

656
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:57,592
- Who's this?
- This is Blaze.

657
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,600
He's been a big help
in some tough spots.

658
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:02,637
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- How did you...

659
01:01:02,738 --> 01:01:05,138
I flew all night and all day over the sea,

660
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,209
and just when I was gonna
run out of dust,

661
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,335
I stumbled
into that flying machine of yours.

662
01:01:09,445 --> 01:01:10,673
That thing is awesome!

663
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,476
I only had a pinch of dust left.
It got me all the way here.

664
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:15,072
You found my balloon?

665
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:17,744
But where did you even get the dust
to make it this far?

666
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:20,515
I, you know, borrowed a little extra.

667
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:25,892
- You broke the rules for me?
- Hey, I knew you needed my help.

668
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,023
Run!

669
01:01:41,944 --> 01:01:43,070
Blaze!

670
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:13,802
Hold on!

671
01:02:34,196 --> 01:02:36,687
- That was kind of fun.
- What?

672
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:43,733
There's our way out.

673
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:52,513
Terence, buy me some time.
Come on, Blaze.

674
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:04,693
Back, you dirty rats!

675
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:35,750
- Are they gone?
- They're gone.

676
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:43,259
Let's go.

677
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,497
Come here, you vicious monster.

678
01:03:58,147 --> 01:04:00,115
Now, how are we
gonna fly this thing?

679
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:02,241
I used the last of my dust
getting it here.

680
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:04,182
Well, with any luck,
my pixie-dust bag

681
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:06,049
should be around here somewhere.

682
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:08,522
Is it enough?

683
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:12,893
- Yeah, it's enough. Anchors up.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

684
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:18,924
Just a little bit of pixie dust up front
will get this baby going.

685
01:04:20,536 --> 01:04:22,504
That should do the trick.

686
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:23,897
Whoa!

687
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:27,633
Wow.

688
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:30,671
I guess it pays
to have a dust-keeper fairy around.

689
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:33,441
I'm telling you, we just might make it.

690
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:37,052
Hey, are you okay?

691
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,811
What's gonna happen
when we get back?

692
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:44,324
Would you happen to have
an extra moonstone?

693
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:53,564
I don't know if it's gonna help,
but I brought this.

694
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:57,870
My scepter.

695
01:05:09,351 --> 01:05:11,319
Hey, I've got an idea.

696
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,616
- Terence?
- Right. Right.

697
01:05:18,994 --> 01:05:20,791
No, I know. You need your space.

698
01:05:20,896 --> 01:05:24,354
No. I can't do this without you.
Would you help me?

699
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:25,825
Sure.

700
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:29,569
If I turn this, then this can go in here.

701
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:31,469
Wait a second.
You think this would work?

702
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:33,838
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

703
01:05:33,943 --> 01:05:35,205
Set it at a 30-degree angle

704
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,211
so that the reflective qualities
of the moonstone...

705
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:39,941
Are magnified in relation
to the moonbeam rays.

706
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:41,812
Yes! You're a genius.

707
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:47,581
- I almost got it. I just need...
- Like a sharp thingy?

708
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:49,649
Yeah.

709
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,952
Excuse me, Blaze.

710
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:26,057
That's a bit heavier than I remember.

711
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:34,129
1,492, 1,493...

712
01:06:34,236 --> 01:06:35,260
No, no, no.

713
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:38,431
It's all right.
Tink will be here any second now.

714
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,735
The blue harvest moon is high.

715
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,971
The moonbeams
are almost at their mark.

716
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,108
This is a disaster.

717
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:49,479
Fairy Mary, where is Tinker Bell?

718
01:06:49,785 --> 01:06:51,047
- I don't know!
- You...

719
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:52,814
Minister, Fairy Mary?

720
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:54,616
Yes, Your Highness?

721
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:55,815
Is anything the matter?

722
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:57,915
- Yes...
- No, Your Highness.

723
01:06:58,193 --> 01:07:00,684
- Where is Tinker Bell?
- Well, we've been...

724
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:01,990
Whoa! Look up there!

725
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,198
Tinker Bell!

726
01:07:07,836 --> 01:07:09,303
Hi, everybody!

727
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:11,002
- Wow!
- Wow!

728
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:19,236
Hi! Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary,
I made it!

729
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:23,106
- There she is.
- Now that's an entrance.

730
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:26,120
Right in the nick of time.

731
01:07:37,032 --> 01:07:38,499
Your Highness.

732
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:42,263
Tinker Bell,
at the beginning of the season,

733
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:45,397
you were entrusted
with a great responsibility.

734
01:07:46,408 --> 01:07:48,399
Where is the fall scepter?

735
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:51,470
There were complications,

736
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,248
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

737
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:57,174
This way, dear.

738
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,661
Fairies of Pixie Hollow,
I present the autumn scepter.

739
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:18,200
The moonstone! One, two...

740
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:24,906
No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

741
01:08:25,714 --> 01:08:28,114
Wait, wait.

742
01:08:28,517 --> 01:08:30,109
Come on, come on.

743
01:08:30,385 --> 01:08:32,979
Please work. Please work. Please work.

744
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:59,880
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

745
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,208
Indeed.

746
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,250
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

747
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:10,514
- It's more.
- Yeah. Much more.

748
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,018
This is amazing!

749
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,295
- Only Tinker Bell.
- Pretty good, huh?

750
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:21,498
Come on, girls. It's show time.

751
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:25,364
Fairies
of Pixie Hollow,

752
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:29,570
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

753
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,840
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

754
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:38,614
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

755
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:43,748
And her friend, Terence.

756
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:47,792
- And her new friend.
- Blaze.

757
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:52,333
Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.

758
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:01,072
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Fairy Mary.

759
01:10:01,877 --> 01:10:03,902
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

760
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:06,446
into all those tiny little pieces?

761
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:08,075
Genius!

762
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,583
On your lead, my dear.

763
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:18,389
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

764
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:27,891
That's our cue!

765
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,870
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

766
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:44,513
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

767
01:10:45,153 --> 01:10:47,280
Aye, it certainly did.

768
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:56,491
<i>To believe in who you are</i>

769
01:10:56,899 --> 01:11:01,393
<i>Who you were always meant to be</i>

770
01:11:02,337 --> 01:11:06,239
<i>To you open up your heart</i>

771
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:11,006
<i>Then you set your spirit free</i>

772
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:16,040
<i>In this time of the season</i>

773
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:20,583
<i>Every leaf on every tree</i>

774
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,318
<i>Start to shine</i>

775
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,684
<i>Come and see</i>

776
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:28,089
<i>Take my hand</i>

777
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,127
<i>Come with me</i>

778
01:11:30,265 --> 01:11:35,669
<i>And fly</i>

779
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,372
<i>"The greatest treasures
are not gold</i>

780
01:11:43,478 --> 01:11:46,038
<i>"Nor jewels, nor works of art</i>

781
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:51,282
<i>"They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart</i>

782
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:57,386
<i>"For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go</i>

783
01:11:58,093 --> 01:12:03,554
<i>"But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow"</i>

784
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:31,349
<i>Sometimes you think
you'll be fine by yourself</i>

785
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:36,289
<i>'Cause a dream
is a wish that you make all alone</i>

786
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:40,930
<i>It's easy to feel like you don't need help</i>

787
01:12:41,169 --> 01:12:45,071
<i>But it's harder to walk on your own</i>

788
01:12:45,707 --> 01:12:49,905
<i>You'll change inside</i>

789
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:54,213
<i>When you realize</i>

790
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:56,647
<i>The world comes to life</i>

791
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,414
<i>And everything's all right</i>

792
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:02,216
<i>From beginning to end</i>

793
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:05,953
<i>When you have a friend
by your side</i>

794
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,757
<i>That helps you to find</i>

795
01:13:09,564 --> 01:13:13,625
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

796
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:16,829
<i>And believe in</i>

797
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:20,899
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

798
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:26,274
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

799
01:13:28,683 --> 01:13:32,983
<i>Someone who knows
when your lost and you're scared</i>

800
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:37,324
<i>There through
the highs and the lows</i>

801
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:42,326
<i>Someone to count on
Someone who cares</i>

802
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:46,333
<i>Beside you wherever you'll go</i>

803
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:51,201
<i>You'll change inside</i>

804
01:13:51,706 --> 01:13:55,437
<i>When you realize</i>

805
01:13:55,577 --> 01:13:57,875
<i>The world comes to life</i>

806
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:00,447
<i>And everything's all right</i>

807
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,316
<i>From beginning to end</i>

808
01:14:03,418 --> 01:14:07,149

01:14:15,063 --> 01:14:18,396
<i>And believe in</i>

812
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:23,934
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

813
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:29,837
<i>And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground</i>

814
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:33,210
<i>You'll feel all alone</i>

815
01:14:33,748 --> 01:14:36,842
<i>When you don't know which way to go</i>

816
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:40,649
<i>And there's no signs leading you on</i>

817
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:45,985
<i>You're not alone</i>

818
01:14:47,429 --> 01:14:49,556
<i>The world comes to life</i>

819
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:52,428
<i>And everything's all right</i>

01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:55,196
<i>From beginning to end</i>

821
01:14:55,303 --> 01:14:57,294
<i>When you have a friend</i>

822
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:59,066
<i>By your side</i>

823
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:02,200
<i>That helps you to find</i>

824
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:06,709
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

825
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:10,148
<i>You believe in</i>

826
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:15,481
<i>When you believe in</i>

827
01:15:15,824 --> 01:15:19,692
<i>When you believe in</i>

828
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:24,462
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

829
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:57,796
<i>Where the sunbeams play
in the highland glade</i>

830
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:02,398
<i>Where the leaves are gently falling</i>

831
01:16:03,305 --> 01:16:09,244
<i>Where we used to dance
in the autumn shade</i>

832
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:14,806
<i>My foolish pride drove you away</i>

833
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:20,989
<i>Where the storm clouds rose
and the cold winds blew</i>

834
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:25,525
<i>Oh, I could not hear you calling</i>

835
01:16:26,294 --> 01:16:32,290
<i>Till you took my hand
and you pulled me through</i>

836
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:37,268
<i>To where the sunbeams play</i>

837
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:43,173
<i>To ride with you
upon the wind</i>

838
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:48,448
<i>To fly above the sea</i>

839
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:54,147
<i>To be far and wide
of Neverland</i>

840
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:57,450
<i>I would dare to go</i>

841
01:16:57,559 --> 01:17:00,460
<i>If you would go with me</i>

842
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:07,064
<i>Now the wind blows our love
against our day</i>

843
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:12,265
<i>And the dark of night is falling</i>

844
01:17:12,907 --> 01:17:16,001
<i>But if you're with me</i>

845
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:19,978
<i>We will find our way</i>

846
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:26,318
<i>To where the sunbeams
To where the sunbeams</i>

847
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:31,154
<i>To where the sunbeams dance</i>

848
01:17:31,459 --> 01:17:37,398
<i>And play</i>
