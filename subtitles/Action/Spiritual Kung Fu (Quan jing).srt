1
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,463
Let's get a bit of a breeze going.

2
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,143
That pupil of yours really is naughty.

3
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,670
Look at him playing tricks
right under our noses!

4
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,336
Now I've got to start all over again.

5
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,164
Night shift again, Yilang?

6
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,848
Yeah, worst luck!

7
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:53,511
Why, you've already been doing
the night shift for a fortnight.

8
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:57,333
Well, I'm not as fortunate as you.
Go and get some rest.

9
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:18,335
You have not been vigilant enough.
Now that the manual has been stolen,

10
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,104
what am I supposed to say to the Head?

11
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:26,171
It's all my fault. I have underestimated
the intruder.

12
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:29,305
He was in fact very skillful.

13
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:33,715
Otherwise he wouldn't have invaded
the Shaolin Temple.

14
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,735
I suspect that the manual
is not all he wants.

15
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,579
- He must have an ulterior motive...
- Say no more.

16
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:46,607
My incompetence is to blame
for this scandal.

17
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:51,419
- I take full responsibility.
- You mustn't blame yourself.

18
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:53,742
I am to blame.

19
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:58,229
As the 32nd master of Shaolin,

20
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,782
I can't even look after a manual.

21
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:06,081
I am not fit to lead Shaolin.

22
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,339
- Master!
- Do not despair, Master.

23
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:13,313
We need to come up with a strategy.

24
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:16,155
When all's said and done, its just a book.

25
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:20,793
"Just a book"? Do you know what
the book in question is?

26
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:26,228
<i>- Is it the Seven Deadly Fists?
- The Seven Deadly Fists manual.</i>

27
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,498
The 25th Master outlawed those practices,

28
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:35,778
for that fighting style is too vicious.

29
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:38,273
Now the manual has been taken,

30
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:42,820
it could wreak havoc throughout
the community.

31
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:46,847
I am sure that the founder of Shaolin

32
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:49,929
must have invented a counter-style.

33
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,089
<i>The Essence of the Five Fists manual
was lost centuries ago.</i>

34
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:59,627
As for this theft,
I am guilty of negligence.

35
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:04,773
I am now going into confinement
to meditate and repent.

36
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:27,285
I shall be here for 100 days.

37
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:31,430
I shall leave Master Clarity in charge.

38
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:35,358
You must all obey his orders.

39
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:37,116
Yes!

40
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,655
You must be vigilant.
We cannot afford any more mistakes.

41
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,779
Take care, Master!
In the name of Amitabha!

42
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:23,342
Those guarding the library
are all guilty of negligence.

43
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:27,884
You shall be locked in
the repentance room for three days.

44
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:33,390
Yes, Brother Purity's team, please.

45
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:43,631
- And Yilang as well.
- What, me?

46
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:48,876
I had nothing to do with it.
I was outside sleeping.

47
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,294
- Go in!
- But...

48
00:11:56,723 --> 00:12:00,079
- But, I'm innocent!
- You're unlucky.

49
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,986
Why me?

50
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:05,187
- Rotten luck.
- In you go, troublemaker!

51
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,590
- Elder, please...
- Just shut up and go in!

52
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,283
But I really am innocent!

53
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,611
I can't cope
with three days' meditation.

54
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:27,354
Please help me. I was sleeping.
That's not a crime.

55
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,343
- You were asleep on the job!
- I didn't do it on purpose.

56
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,667
I just fell asleep somehow.

57
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,525
You deserve to be punished.
Go and contemplate your deeds.

58
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,849
But Elder, please... Listen!

59
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,201
You deserve to be punished.

60
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,966
There were five of you,
yet he got away.

61
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,795
Now I've got to suffer in here with you.

62
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:06,718
I always end up
getting punished somehow.

63
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:12,244
Meditation and repentance, indeed.
What do I need to repent for?

64
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,113
I am not repenting!

65
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:18,181
Repent, indeed!

66
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,787
Three days without food?
Don't worry!

67
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,778
I'll eat a tiger the minute I get out.

68
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:53,926
Be good!

69
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,141
Come on!

70
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:14,132
Now where are you gonna run to?

71
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,897
Where are you going?

72
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:40,083
Oops! Now it's gone up...

73
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,699
Smells nice!

74
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:47,306
- What is it?
- Ah, it smells so nice!

75
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:52,690
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to make this soup.

76
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:56,383
The main ingredient is
a hen that's never laid any eggs.

77
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,576
How do you know it never laid any eggs?

78
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,779
Don't interrupt! What else has it got in?

79
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,073
Frog... sparrow... carp...

80
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:11,887
eels, catfish, whelks, duck,
partridge, earthworms...

81
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:15,930
Earthworms? Are they edible?

82
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,412
You're such a yokel. Earthworms
were the Emperor's favourite.

83
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:25,594
- Is it ready?
- Can we eat now?

84
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:30,331
Let me make one thing clear. I won't be
taking the blame if the Elder finds out.

85
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,648
- No, of course not.
- Let's eat.

86
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,980
- Come on!
- Let's enjoy this.

87
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:37,876
Mind your manners.

88
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,960
- There's just one thing missing.
- What's that?

89
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,394
- Wine!
- I've brought some.

90
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:47,780
- Where did you get that from?
- It was for Buddha.

91
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,963
You took it from the altar?

92
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:55,924
- Don't you want any, then?
- Of course. Why waste it?

93
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,481
- Oh, no!
- What?

94
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,200
- I've forgotten...
- What?

95
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,709
Dog meat. It'd be so much tastier
if we had some.

96
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,980
- Of course!
- We'll have some next time.

97
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,577
It's good!

98
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,651
It's divine.

99
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:22,581
Whose recipe is it, Yilang?
What's it called?

100
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:25,228
- It's a traditional stew.
- Oh, no it isn't.

101
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:29,250
It was created by Emperor Qianlong.

102
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,212
- It's called Monk Over The Fence.
- That's a strange name.

103
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:36,937
It smelt so good that a monk
was tempted to...

104
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,735
Monk Over Fence? That's impossible!

105
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:42,330
You shall be punished for this.

106
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:06,869
You're not supposed to be
messing about, Yilang.

107
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,557
Brother...

108
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,110
- Can I have a smaller brush?
- No way.

109
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,730
The whole point of being punished
is that you suffer.

110
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,891
This brush weighs a ton!

111
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:26,074
Where am I now?

112
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,369
The Holy Scriptures...

113
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,268
I've made a mistake.
I'll have to write it out all over again.

114
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:43,041
Oh, what a clumsy pig!

115
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,184
It looks awful.

116
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,280
Oh, what the hell.

117
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,568
Damn! Not again!

118
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,468
What's that noise?

119
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:08,833
What's happened?

120
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,194
What's wrong?

121
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:16,483
I thought the Elder was going easy on me,
getting me to copy out the Scriptures.

122
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:21,270
It's turned out to be very hard work.

123
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,864
- Look at my poor hand.
- We're sorry, Yilang.

124
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,897
- But we can't help you.
- No.

125
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:30,218
- I'm doomed.
- Why?

126
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:34,866
It's taken me a whole day
just to finish half a page.

127
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:39,386
I've got to make 100 copies.
It'll take centuries to finish.

128
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,920
Look at how thick this book is.
How many pages do you think it's got?

129
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,141
<i>The Seven Deadly Fists?</i>

130
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,410
Your father went to a great deal
of trouble to get it.

131
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:03,471
We must win the Martial Master title
next year.

132
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,876
Your father says that this manual
is the key to success.

133
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,196
Father, is this style really so powerful?

134
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,834
It can make one invincible.

135
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,942
You must work hard to perfect
the Seven Deadly Fists style.

136
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,882
Thirty years ago,

137
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:30,833
your father failed to win the competiton
on account of Shaolin's interference.

138
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:37,039
So, do you see why he expects
so much of you?

139
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,251
Auntie, I promise not to return home
without the title.

140
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:48,187
You are very courageous. That's my boy.

141
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:51,004
Once you've mastered
the Seven Deadly Fists,

142
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:55,417
the title of Master shall stay
in the Luk clan forever.

143
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,800
Didn't you say that there was also
a counter-style to the Seven Deadly Fists?

144
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:04,954
<i>The Essence of the Five Fists manual
has been lost for centuries.</i>

145
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:07,592
That is, unless it has returned to Earth
from Heaven.

146
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:18,335
- What's happened?
- Run!

147
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,590
Let's get out of here!

148
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,469
- What's that?
- Where did they come from?

149
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:58,175
Hey! Where are you from?

150
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:05,501
- Let's go a bit closer.
- Go on, then!

151
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,984
Touch it.

152
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:18,475
- Why is it so cold?
- It's ice-cold.

153
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,292
Ghosts! Make a run for it!

154
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,625
- All right, all right, what's going on?
- Ghosts!

155
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,023
- There are ghosts up there.
- Ghosts? Nonsense.

156
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,401
- I don't believe you.
- Go and see for yourself, then.

157
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,346
THE GOD OF PERFECT VISION

158
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:43,464
Buddha, your humble servant is here.

159
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:46,474
Our temple is haunted.

160
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:51,069
May I borrow your incantation?
I shall return it straightaway.

161
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:55,016
Excuse me.

162
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,945
I do beg your pardon.

163
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,345
THE GOD OF PERFECT HEARING

164
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,645
I do beg your pardon.

165
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:15,689
Elder, what are you doing?

166
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:20,667
These incantations can protect me.

167
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,276
They give me superior
vision and hearing.

168
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,658
If the ghosts ever come again...

169
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:31,167
I'll catch them. Now, get going.

170
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:55,278
Come on.

171
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,473
- What's he doing?
- No idea.

172
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:06,305
- You?
- How should I know?

173
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:09,466
- Shall we ask him?
- All right, then.

174
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,999
Do you have a headache?

175
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:18,017
A headache? Only when I lay eyes
on you lot.

176
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:23,861
- The Head Priest ordered us to come.
- All right, then. Now be off with you.

177
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:29,783
- What are you doing here?
- We're on night watch.

178
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:34,462
- There are ghosts upstairs.
- That's impossible.

179
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:38,057
- We touched them and they were ice-cold.
- You saw them?

180
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:41,568
- It's true.
- You need to see a doctor.

181
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:46,550
- Yilang, I'm not going.
- How about you?

182
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:50,038
- And what about you?
- Ask him.

183
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:55,851
All right, then, cowards. I'll go on my own.

184
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,058
- It's no joke...
- Come here!

185
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:02,821
The ghosts have red hair
and they're ready for a fight.

186
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,318
Why can't I sleep?

187
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:21,972
Is this place really haunted?

188
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,397
I'll get one of them to play with me.

189
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:31,789
Hey, there. Listen to me.

190
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:35,842
Be you big, small, greedy, wronged,

191
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:42,016
stupid, naughty, sleazy or whatever.
Just show yourselves, ghosts!

192
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:45,108
Are you afraid, or what? Come on out.

193
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,676
I'm known for being a rebel myself,
so we're well-matched.

194
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,956
No response?

195
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,876
I might as well get some sleep, then.

196
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,816
What the...?

197
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:28,638
It wasn't like this before.

198
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:32,248
Am I dreaming?

199
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,447
Can breath bend?

200
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:57,201
It really is haunted in here.

201
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:00,060
I'd better look for the Exorcist's Scriptures.

202
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:17,540
Now, which one is it?
Oh, what a mess!

203
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,103
Here it is.

204
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,526
Which book?

205
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:35,634
These ghosts are afraid of books.

206
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:42,020
What are you playing at, pervert?

207
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:44,059
I'm not that way inclined!

208
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,695
Why, this ghost's a pervert!

209
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:08,906
I was almost strangled to death, there.
Time I was off!

210
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:25,169
So you think that you can stop me, huh?

211
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,596
Want to play, huh? Let's see where
you're off to, then.

212
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:51,340
Trying to escape? Let me show you
my Kung Fu skills!

213
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,327
Let's go!

214
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:14,448
Oh, esteemed Elder, the ghosts are here!

215
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,978
- Ghosts?
- Yes.

216
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:21,430
- Where?
- Over there.

217
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:31,036
I can see them.
There are five of them in total.

218
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:34,209
- Five?
- I'll catch them all.

219
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,969
Demons!

220
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:38,653
How dare you!

221
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,273
Let's see what you're made of, then.

222
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:54,070
- What is the Elder up to?
- He must be possessed.

223
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,793
Stop right there!

224
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,227
- What is he doing?
- He's gone crazy!

225
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,660
- Where are they?
- What are you looking for?

226
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:11,307
- Ghosts!
- He's looking for ghosts.

227
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:19,085
Why, that incantation
is more powerful than an X-ray.

228
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:22,110
Where are they?

229
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:32,769
How eerie! Air on my derriere.

230
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,081
So, Elder, can you really
see something, then?

231
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:48,644
Of course! I can also hear
the ghosts talking.

232
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:51,830
Can we have a go?

233
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:56,513
No. I don't think that you have the ability.

234
00:32:56,876 --> 00:32:59,788
- Perhaps we do.
- No way.

235
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:03,444
- This is the way.
- What are you doing?

236
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:06,670
- Give it back to me.
- Come and get it.

237
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,120
Give it back! Stop!

238
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:11,834
Let's take turns.

239
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,704
I'm done for, now.

240
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:28,674
- Let me see it.
- Don't tear it.

241
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,425
Wait your turn.

242
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,139
Let me take a look.

243
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,702
Don't be so selfish.

244
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,410
Let's share it.

245
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,480
What's wrong with him?

246
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,407
- He's gone crazy.
- What's wrong?

247
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:59,599
- Don't go!
- I want nothing more to do with this.

248
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:33,568
What's wrong? Why is he turning back?

249
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:44,364
Put me down, put me down!

250
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:51,156
Please, I beg you.

251
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,685
Ooh, I need to go to the loo!

252
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,167
Oh, my God! Run!

253
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,040
What's that noise?
Seems like it's coming from downstairs.

254
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,884
My leg! Help!

255
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,926
Practising in the middle of the night?
Why, he's got to be mad!

256
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:01,104
It stinks!

257
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,502
How dare you break wind
in my face!

258
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,339
That looks like fun.

259
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,401
Finished so soon?

260
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,592
Got you!

261
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:42,923
Try and get out of this!

262
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,546
Just give up... What? There are
four more of you?

263
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,855
They're afraid of me.

264
00:36:53,116 --> 00:36:57,029
Hey, you don't know what
you're up against.

265
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,488
You're messing with the wrong man.
I've got a reputation, you know.

266
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,869
Even the Elders can't cope with me.

267
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,298
Right, then. Get up and get out!

268
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:13,477
Form a line.

269
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,958
Why are you causing trouble here?

270
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:20,579
Are you seeking justice for something?
You can tell me everything.

271
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,971
I'll sort it out for you.

272
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,799
Cat got your tongue?

273
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,191
What are your names?

274
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,243
What's wrong?

275
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,243
I asked you your names.
What's this supposed to mean?

276
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:42,942
Dragon?

277
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,681
Your name is Dragon?
And you?

278
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:49,798
Snake.

279
00:37:51,508 --> 00:37:53,226
Tiger.

280
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,656
Crane.

281
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,677
Leopard. They're all names of beasts.

282
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:05,527
Dragon, Snake, Tiger, Crane,
Leopard, come here.

283
00:38:08,442 --> 00:38:12,071
You are on trial. Stand up straight!

284
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,565
Now tell me...

285
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,546
Who tried to strangle me earlier on?

286
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:31,147
Speak!

287
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:38,730
It was you, was it?

288
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:41,089
And who pulled my trousers down?

289
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,538
And who took off my shoes?

290
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:52,180
You again? That's twice.

291
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:56,957
I can forgive most things, but I hate
having my trousers pulled off.

292
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:02,036
Now, line up, and I'll give you
forty lashes each.

293
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,085
Stay there.

294
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:14,417
Hiding, are you?

295
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:18,954
Now come out from that crevice,
will you?

296
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,513
I'm going to pee.

297
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,329
Frightened, are we?

298
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,835
Still not coming out? Very well.

299
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:10,047
<i>The Essence of the Five Fists?</i>

300
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,410
Hasn't this been missing for centuries?

301
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,728
It's so worn...

302
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:28,752
There you are, you cheeky monkeys!

303
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:33,142
I've got... Why, you're all in here,
aren't you!

304
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,341
Out you come!

305
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:42,398
One, two, three, four, five.
All present and correct.

306
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,716
Don't even think of hiding in there again.

307
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,699
I'll teach you a lesson!

308
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:51,695
Stay where you are!

309
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:56,363
Still want to run?
Now I know where you hide,

310
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:01,371
if you don't obey me, I'll
burn down your home, understand?

311
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,960
Do you promise to behave?

312
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:13,277
I've rumbled you. You know
all the moves in the manual, don't you?

313
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:17,104
Well, I want you to be my masters
and teach me everything.

314
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:20,224
Stand up properly.

315
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:23,681
Don't get too cocky, now.

316
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:27,004
If you don't teach me properly,
I'll beat you up.

317
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,392
What can I do for you?

318
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:24,763
I hear that you've been chosen
to compete for the Master's title.

319
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:28,673
- Is it true?
- Yes, it is.

320
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:38,213
- Do you have the ability?
- I'm not good enough,

321
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,101
but they think highly of me,
so I'll give it a go.

322
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,749
- I advise you against it.
- Why?

323
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:52,136
Follow my master, and you'll be rewarded.

324
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:55,794
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- We're not.

325
00:42:56,108 --> 00:43:01,057
I'm just giving you some advice.
Ignore it at your peril.

326
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:06,714
The Master's title has to be earned.
It cannot be bartered.

327
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:09,876
- I will fight for it.
- You won't be able to.

328
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:12,924
Why not?

329
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:18,778
Because you'll be dead.

330
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:57,663
Brilliant!

331
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,030
SHAOLIN TEMPLE

332
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:21,746
What can we do for you?

333
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:26,781
Shek Yingfeng, of the Wudang clan,
needs to see your Master urgently.

334
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:29,229
Please follow me.

335
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:40,613
Master Shek Yingfeng is here.

336
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:43,005
MAIN TEMPLE

337
00:44:51,726 --> 00:44:54,524
How are you, Master Clarity?

338
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:59,091
- Good to see you.
- Phoenix, greet the Master.

339
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:00,955
How are you, Master?

340
00:45:01,194 --> 00:45:06,905
It has been such a long time.
Miss Shek has grown.

341
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,634
Please come in.

342
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:19,269
I am temporarily in charge
in Master Wisdom's absence.

343
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:24,661
I can tell that you have
something important to discuss.

344
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:27,326
Is this a good place to talk?

345
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,268
- Yilang!
- Yes.

346
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:35,783
This is Miss Shek's first visit.
Please show her around.

347
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,108
- Me?
- May I, Father?

348
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:44,371
- Thank you, young man.
- Not at all.

349
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:47,706
Come along.

350
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:54,430
Now that we are alone, Master Shek,

351
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,586
you may speak freely.

352
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:01,190
Do you know that the Seven Deadly
Fists manual is now in the north?

353
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,178
Really? My God!

354
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:12,463
I know that the Seven Deadly Fists
are a Shaolin speciality.

355
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:17,561
The manual has recently come to light
once more, after many centuries.

356
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:21,613
Someone has been exploiting it,
which is why I am here today.

357
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:25,855
I hope to get to the bottom of this
so that peace can be restored.

358
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:30,771
If the manual really has been used,

359
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:34,466
the whole community will suffer.

360
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:38,907
See? We've got squirrels
and sparrows everywhere.

361
00:46:42,672 --> 00:46:44,628
Why don't you lead the way?

362
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:48,670
- I don't know this place.
- Let me take you to the river.

363
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,332
- We come here two or three times a day.
- What for?

364
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:56,753
To get water to wash with.

365
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:05,514
Here you have the Four lmmortals.
Tall, aren't they?

366
00:47:05,945 --> 00:47:07,856
There's a pond over there.

367
00:47:09,616 --> 00:47:11,732
Look! Isn't it beautiful?

368
00:47:11,993 --> 00:47:14,871
I grew up here, so I know
the place well.

369
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:17,154
- You grew up here?
- Yes, I did.

370
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:19,565
Have you ever been outside?

371
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,472
Never.

372
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:26,330
What's that smell?

373
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:32,077
Wow! It's huge! And look at all the fish!

374
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,868
Come and have a look.

375
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:38,376
Are you all right?

376
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:43,570
- I want to ask you something.
- What is it?

377
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:46,494
Why do you smell so nice?

378
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:52,367
Are you a virgin?

379
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:56,974
- What else would I be?
- So this is what they were talking about!

380
00:47:58,373 --> 00:48:02,366
They tell me I've got to meet
that kind of lady when I leave here.

381
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:07,911
- Don't be so fresh!
- But that's what my mates told me.

382
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,495
Can I feel your bum?

383
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:13,840
You'd better stop now, I'm warning you.

384
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:16,565
There's no need to get mad.

385
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,548
Don't you get fresh with me!

386
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:23,771
What do you mean. I wash every day,
of course I'm fresh.

387
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:25,545
Why are you so mad?

388
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,393
So you know Kung Fu, do you?
Me too.

389
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:39,218
Well, I've got nothing else to do.
Shall we play?

390
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:41,534
Play, my foot!

391
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,677
I was having a laugh.
Are you fighting for real?

392
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:00,170
I'll show you what I can do!

393
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,870
Is that how you carry water?

394
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,582
See? I'm very gentle.

395
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,336
Let me show you what I'm really made of.

396
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:51,078
- What's this?
- This is the Crane style.

397
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,846
- What?
- The Crane style.

398
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,825
Never heard of it.

399
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,909
"Here's my handle, here's my spout!"
You look just like a big teapot!

400
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,738
Are you making fun of my method?
Let's make a bet.

401
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:09,195
- On what?
- If I lose, I'll kowtow to you.

402
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:12,345
- If I win...
- What then?

403
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,194
- You'll let me have a feel.
- Go to hell!

404
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,108
You've lost. So, do I get to...?

405
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:51,133
Phoenix!

406
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,293
Where are your manners?

407
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:04,571
Father, can you believe that that idiot
thought he could take me on?

408
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:10,367
Stop that. Master, forgive
my daughter's impertinence.

409
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:14,531
- That's all right.
- Go and apologise at once.

410
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:19,938
- Apologise?
- He lost. He should kowtow before me.

411
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,681
Nonsense!

412
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:23,666
Master Shek...

413
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:28,546
Master Wisdom will
emerge from seclusion tomorrow.

414
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,195
Please stay here overnight.

415
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:37,096
It'd be better to discuss
the matter with our Master.

416
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,548
Thank you so much.

417
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:42,879
Cognition, take the guests
to their rooms.

418
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,511
This way, please, Master Shek.

419
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,935
That's how I lost, Master.

420
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:26,691
Points six, seven, eight and ten
of the Ten Nevers.

421
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:30,293
Wow, I've broken four rules
by making one mistake?

422
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:36,258
"Six: Never underestimate
your opponent."

423
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:45,840
I admit that I thought fighting
a girl would be easy. I was wrong.

424
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,280
"Seven: Never hesitate."

425
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,578
"Eight: Never lose focus."

426
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,637
You've lost. So, do I get to...?

427
00:52:55,883 --> 00:53:00,001
You know, it was the first time
I met a girl.

428
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:01,859
I felt dizzy.

429
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:05,294
"Ten: Never pause between strikes."

430
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,275
Thank you, Masters.
I'll be sure to win tomorrow.

431
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:15,926
- Morning, there.
- Afraid of me?

432
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:19,760
Why are you running from me?

433
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,149
What? Want to be beaten again?

434
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,039
Not really. I just want to even the score.

435
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,602
All right, then. Come on down.

436
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,722
Let's go then, you little minx.

437
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,039
Come on!

438
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:16,469
It's the big teapot, look!

439
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:20,347
Care for some tea?

440
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:29,949
Careful you don't drown in the tea!

441
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,391
More tea?

442
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,623
If I let go, you'll have a nasty fall.
Now get up.

443
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,628
How dare you?

444
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,930
Not so smart, are you?
Time for a spanking.

445
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,682
Are you crying?

446
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,598
What's wrong? Stop cry...

447
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:05,201
You big bully! I'm telling my father!

448
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,348
What's the punishment this time?

449
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,541
Wait, wait! I was only having a bit of fun!

450
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:16,045
Wait, don't! Wait, please!

451
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,874
It was only a game!

452
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:29,081
Father! Father! Father!

453
00:55:29,414 --> 00:55:30,972
Father!

454
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:48,039
- Something is wrong, Master.
- What is it?

455
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:50,943
Brother Clarity is asking for you.

456
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:53,422
Master Shek Yingfeng
has been found dead.

457
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:30,078
I will take care of this, Miss Shek.

458
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:55,529
I hope that the perpetrator
will come forward and confess.

459
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:04,844
Do you know how Master Shek died?

460
00:57:05,178 --> 00:57:09,854
- The Exalted Palm.
- But that is impossible!

461
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:20,444
What, you think I murdered him?
Why would I do that?

462
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,933
The evidence on his body
is undeniable.

463
00:57:25,281 --> 00:57:27,317
- Master...!
- It was you!

464
00:57:30,746 --> 00:57:34,341
Miss Shek, please let the master
deal with this.

465
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:37,486
Cognition...

466
00:57:39,337 --> 00:57:42,727
You are the only one here
who knows the Exalted Palm.

467
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:46,803
The fact that Master Shek died here
is a very serious matter.

468
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:52,689
As Master of Shaolin, I'm
accountable to the martial community.

469
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,174
- Earth! Void!
- Yes, Master!

470
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,755
Escort him to the repentence room.

471
00:57:59,024 --> 00:58:01,857
Yes, Master. Come with us, Elder.

472
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:07,102
My conscience is clear.
I have no need of an escort.

473
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:15,674
Our condolences, Miss Shek.

474
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,711
Tomorrow he'll be taken to
Martial Headquarters.

475
00:58:19,003 --> 00:58:22,712
There the judge will look into the matter.
Now please come with me.

476
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,008
Miss Shek!

477
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,471
I knew that you would come.

478
01:00:16,664 --> 01:00:21,658
He murdered my father, Master.
I must seek vengeance.

479
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:23,683
Please calm down.

480
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:28,358
Things are getting dangerous now.

481
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:31,747
You'd better leave with Cognition.

482
01:00:32,055 --> 01:00:33,932
- Leave with him?
- Hm.

483
01:00:34,182 --> 01:00:38,733
- But why?
- There's no time to explain now.

484
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:42,812
- You'd better leave now.
- Not unless you tell me more.

485
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:47,964
Take a sniff.

486
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:52,072
Tell me if you recognise this substance.

487
01:00:54,743 --> 01:00:56,699
Cinnabar dye?

488
01:00:56,955 --> 01:00:59,310
Correct.

489
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:01,857
The palm print was fake.

490
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:04,799
The murderer is still at large.

491
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:08,124
If the Master was in seclusion,

492
01:01:08,425 --> 01:01:12,100
and it was neither you nor I,
are you saying that it was Purity?

493
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:15,226
We must investigate first
before we accuse anyone.

494
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:19,144
Leave now, or else you'll both be killed.

495
01:01:19,478 --> 01:01:22,038
Listen. Someone is coming.

496
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:54,370
Elder, Elder, are you all right?

497
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:58,536
Elder! Somebody, help!

498
01:02:58,869 --> 01:03:01,258
Somebody, help!
The Elder has been killed!

499
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:04,690
Someone has murdered him!

500
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:06,354
- Murdered!
- Help!

501
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,159
What has happened?

502
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,102
I saw what happened. He was killed
by a man clad in black.

503
01:03:26,565 --> 01:03:28,556
The Exalted Palm again!

504
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:31,695
The killer has struck once more.

505
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:55,540
Just as I expected, he's gone.

506
01:03:55,802 --> 01:03:58,635
I knew it was him.

507
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:04,209
You mean Elder Cognition?
What did he do?

508
01:04:04,603 --> 01:04:07,117
<i>He stole the Seven Deadly Fists manual.</i>

509
01:04:07,396 --> 01:04:12,550
He also murdered Master Shek
and Elder Purity.

510
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:17,223
That's not possible. Elder Cognition is
such a good man.

511
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:20,885
What do you know? I am right,
without a doubt.

512
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:25,276
- Well, I'm not sure...
- Master, Master!

513
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:28,343
- What is it?
- It's dreadful.

514
01:04:28,627 --> 01:04:31,460
Miss Shek has disappeared
and so has Master Shek's body!

515
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:33,905
- Disappeared?
- Yes.

516
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:42,521
It breaks my heart to see that
Shaolin has produced such scum.

517
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:47,086
- Silence!
- Yes!

518
01:04:48,314 --> 01:04:53,513
Tell the Eighteen Monks to go
into town at once.

519
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:58,897
- Cognition must be captured.
- Yes, Master.

520
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:02,693
So many have lost their lives
on account of the Seven Deadly Fists.

521
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:06,624
Those who obey me live.
Those who do otherwise die.

522
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:10,659
You might want to think about that.

523
01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:16,617
I shall never obey scum like you!

524
01:06:17,905 --> 01:06:20,738
Why, Young Master,
you really are invincible!

525
01:06:21,033 --> 01:06:23,627
The title of Martial Master is all yours.

526
01:06:23,911 --> 01:06:25,902
Who else is left?

527
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:27,835
Poker Face of the South.

528
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:37,486
Dragon: agililty, soul.

529
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:47,246
Snake: evil, heart.

530
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:59,765
Tiger: viciousness, strength.

531
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:14,443
Crane: speed, mind.

532
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:30,671
Leopard: ferocity, power.

533
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:37,015
Dragon, Snake, Tiger,
Crane, Leopard.

534
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:14,477
- Who's next?
- It should be Old Man Shek.

535
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:10,326
Your instructor tells me that you wish
to leave. Why is that?

536
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:14,334
I want to help apprehend that thief
and murderer Cognition.

537
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,550
I know you mean well, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

538
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:24,963
- Brother Clarity.
- Yes, Master.

539
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:29,255
How, when even the Eighteen Monks
have failed,

540
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,873
do you expect this boy to succeed?

541
01:09:32,144 --> 01:09:36,422
- His intentions are good.
- Yes, but is he skillful enough?

542
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:39,207
- He has made much progress.
- Hm.

543
01:09:39,484 --> 01:09:45,161
Yilang. I shall allow you to leave Shaolin
and see that justice is done in our name.

544
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:50,649
Do you think that you can pass
the traditional Eighteen Monks' test?

545
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,274
I'd like to try.

546
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:20,015
Go easy on me.

547
01:10:28,284 --> 01:10:30,195
That really hurt!

548
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,913
Why so serious?

549
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:04,711
The Master is watching
and this is a serious matter.

550
01:11:04,988 --> 01:11:07,343
This is inhuman.

551
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:09,207
Here I come!

552
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:50,302
Hey, get up!

553
01:11:55,914 --> 01:11:57,233
Watch out!

554
01:12:01,628 --> 01:12:03,744
Take that!

555
01:12:12,514 --> 01:12:13,833
Halt!

556
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:32,391
You have passed the preliminary test,
but you must always be on your guard.

557
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:34,183
Take care!

558
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:40,794
Master, please allow me to fight
with short batons.

559
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:54,415
Elders, I should like to take the whole test.
I shall aim to do my best.

560
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:06,555
Let go, or else I'll pull your moustache off!

561
01:17:21,453 --> 01:17:26,322
Master, Yilang has passed
the Eighteen Monks' test!

562
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,462
Now you are qualified to leave, Yilang.

563
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:35,838
- Are you related to Shek?
- My name is Wong.

564
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:40,375
Master Shek has passed away,
and he is survived by a young daughter.

565
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:43,713
I am temporarily in charge here.

566
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,342
This is ideal.

567
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:51,119
Please hand over the Badge.

568
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:52,999
The Badge?

569
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:57,706
Now that Shek is dead, we need
a new Martial Master.

570
01:17:58,074 --> 01:17:59,905
- But the rules...
- What rules?

571
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,834
He who has the strongest fist rules!

572
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:08,873
If that were true, why would we
have an election every ten years?

573
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,641
Let me enlighten you.
The leaders of every school...

574
01:18:12,963 --> 01:18:19,675
that is, the ones who were eligible, have
all been killed by the Seven Deadly Fists.

575
01:18:20,137 --> 01:18:22,014
The Seven Deadly Fists?

576
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:25,223
Since you wouldn't hand over the Badge,

577
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:28,475
you too shall sample
the Seven Deadly Fists.

578
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,000
And what about me?

579
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:34,550
Shek Yingfeng may be dead,
but his daughter still lives.

580
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,328
I'm the one you have to ask for the Badge!

581
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,438
Miss Shek is certainly pretty.

582
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:54,066
But somehow, I don't think that that's
enough to secure the Badge.

583
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:56,450
Try me.

584
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,237
Let me through.

585
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:06,509
Come on.

586
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:02,123
- Are you ready to surrender?
- Now, why would she do that?

587
01:20:03,325 --> 01:20:06,476
Shame on you, bullying a wee girl.

588
01:20:06,787 --> 01:20:08,539
Come down.

589
01:20:15,338 --> 01:20:18,296
- What are you doing here?
- Why are you fighting?

590
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,706
That's Luk Ching, the Wanderer.

591
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:24,596
He says he wants to be the Martial Master
and that he wants my father's badge.

592
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,249
- Martial Master?
- Hm.

593
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:34,035
So you're the Wanderer, are you, then?

594
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:36,881
Martial Master? You?

595
01:20:37,151 --> 01:20:41,429
Well, let me tell you.
You're looking at the Martial Master.

596
01:20:42,783 --> 01:20:45,138
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

597
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,878
You'll get a heart attack
when I tell you.

598
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:55,215
I am... the invincible, honourable,
supreme...

599
01:20:55,628 --> 01:21:01,305
one-and-only, unbeatable... Yilang!

600
01:21:01,718 --> 01:21:04,391
This man is pretty vicious, Yilang.

601
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:06,874
Don't you worry about that. Hold this.

602
01:21:07,139 --> 01:21:08,970
I'll show him what I'm made of.

603
01:21:19,653 --> 01:21:21,644
Upset stomach?

604
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:39,316
You won't catch me out that easily.
I'm very supple.

605
01:22:45,282 --> 01:22:47,352
Have mercy. Please.

606
01:22:47,617 --> 01:22:49,255
Please forgive my son.

607
01:22:49,493 --> 01:22:51,290
Go home, now!

608
01:22:52,454 --> 01:22:56,208
This stupid son of mine isn't too bright.
Please forgive him.

609
01:22:58,711 --> 01:23:01,509
Actually, he's not bad at all.

610
01:23:03,049 --> 01:23:04,368
The Badge.

611
01:23:06,302 --> 01:23:10,898
Yes, we should hand over
the Badge to you.

612
01:23:11,266 --> 01:23:17,102
However, it is the Shaolin Master
who has the final say in these matters.

613
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:22,197
So, what say we meet at
the Shaolin Temple in seven days' time

614
01:23:22,569 --> 01:23:23,922
and you can receive it then?

615
01:23:27,823 --> 01:23:30,656
No one can compete with you anymore.

616
01:23:30,952 --> 01:23:34,262
The Badge is yours now.

617
01:23:34,581 --> 01:23:36,412
What's the hurry?

618
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:39,101
Why, it would ruin your good reputation

619
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:43,768
should the community mistakenly believe
that you had taken it by force.

620
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:47,522
Very well, then. I shan't embarrass you.

621
01:23:47,844 --> 01:23:51,120
- We shall meet in seven days' time.
- Goodbye.

622
01:23:52,975 --> 01:23:55,205
Pompous fool.

623
01:23:55,477 --> 01:23:57,627
Elder, you made fun of me.

624
01:23:57,897 --> 01:24:00,365
- How could I be your son?
- I did you a favour.

625
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,083
Otherwise you'd be dead by now.

626
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:04,547
- I could take him on.
- I doubt it.

627
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:09,371
It's far better to lure him back
and let the Master take care of him.

628
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:14,610
All those who do not belong to the Court,
please leave.

629
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,076
Very good, Master!

630
01:24:30,304 --> 01:24:31,657
Cognition!

631
01:24:35,101 --> 01:24:39,379
As a Shaolin disciple, you were
wrong to steal the manual.

632
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:45,248
You also murdered Master Shek
and Purity on Shaolin ground.

633
01:24:45,653 --> 01:24:48,121
You deserve a harsh punishment.

634
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:53,790
I have always abided by Shaolin laws
and teachings.

635
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,240
I have been set up.
Please help me to clear my name.

636
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:03,413
With hard evidence like the
palm print, you won't get away.

637
01:25:03,755 --> 01:25:06,553
If you were innocent, why
did you flee?

638
01:25:10,094 --> 01:25:13,882
My father's killer is still at large,
and now we must deal with Luk Ching,

639
01:25:14,224 --> 01:25:17,819
who is demanding the Badge.
I am not very experienced

640
01:25:18,144 --> 01:25:21,659
and I am unable to protect my father's
honour. So, here is the Badge.

641
01:25:21,981 --> 01:25:23,380
Please help me.

642
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:26,839
Luk Ching? How old is he?

643
01:25:28,113 --> 01:25:31,264
About thirty. He practises
the Seven Deadly Fists.

644
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:33,485
- The Seven Deadly Fists?
- That's right.

645
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,230
- You are...
- I am Luk Ching.

646
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,896
I understand that Master Shek
has passed away.

647
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:47,003
Obviously he must be replaced,
so I have come to claim the Badge.

648
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:56,225
We must establish where he learnt
the Seven Deadly Fists.

649
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:59,750
The Shaolin have not practised
them for many a century,

650
01:26:00,062 --> 01:26:04,294
yet you have the nerve to ask me
where I learnt?

651
01:26:06,276 --> 01:26:10,428
How can we allow him to insult us
this way, Brother?

652
01:26:10,781 --> 01:26:14,456
Shaolin would be disgraced

653
01:26:14,785 --> 01:26:19,176
if the public knew about the theft,
so we'd better leave it.

654
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:23,976
Our master has deigned to come here
and collect the badge.

655
01:26:24,337 --> 01:26:28,728
Anyone who refuses to submit to his
authority had better speak up right now!

656
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:31,400
What did you say? Master...

657
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:35,669
This man is dishonouring Shaolin.
Shall we teach him a lesson?

658
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:40,315
This is not how a Buddhist should behave.

659
01:26:40,602 --> 01:26:43,878
But I am not a monk,
and I cannot take this.

660
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,748
I'll teach him a lesson.

661
01:26:47,026 --> 01:26:50,780
You could do with being less cocky,
you pompous arse!

662
01:26:51,114 --> 01:26:53,708
How about a duel?

663
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:58,826
You got off lightly last time, loser.
Aren't you afraid?

664
01:26:59,205 --> 01:27:02,356
I'd save as much breath as possible,
if I were you.

665
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:05,306
There's no telling yet
which one of us will win.

666
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:08,225
Come over here, if you're a man.

667
01:27:53,343 --> 01:27:54,662
The Starving Crane!

668
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:04,775
The snake!

669
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,759
The tiger hunts!

670
01:28:11,737 --> 01:28:13,807
Scooping the moon!

671
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,572
Here's a gift for you...

672
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:56,050
...to enjoy in Hell.

673
01:29:03,414 --> 01:29:05,086
What style is that, Yilang?

674
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:06,731
Oh, it's...

675
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,874
- The Essence of the Five Fists.
- Oh, is that so?

676
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,445
Stop! No killing in the grounds
of the temple!

677
01:30:54,943 --> 01:30:58,652
You do want to kill me, don't you?
Time for the dragon!

678
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:02,424
The snake bites!

679
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,779
The tiger hunts!

680
01:31:17,174 --> 01:31:20,052
The crane flies!

681
01:31:20,345 --> 01:31:22,097
The leopard strikes!

682
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:29,126
Now, all five elements: The dragon...

683
01:31:29,436 --> 01:31:31,074
...the snake...

684
01:31:31,314 --> 01:31:34,784
...the tiger, the crane, and the leopard.

685
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:44,278
Ching, my son!

686
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:49,836
Ching, my dear boy!

687
01:31:55,047 --> 01:31:57,515
I know who you are!

688
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:03,352
You are Luk the Fearless, who lost the
title of Martial Master some 20 years ago.

689
01:32:03,763 --> 01:32:05,560
So, you remember my name.

690
01:32:05,807 --> 01:32:09,959
Back then I defeated all the others
with my own skills.

691
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:14,271
Yet you bald fools in Shaolin
discredited me for being...

692
01:32:14,607 --> 01:32:18,202
too young and lacking in social standing.

693
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:21,680
I swore that I would seek vengeance.

694
01:32:21,991 --> 01:32:26,064
So you changed your name and shaved
your head in order to join the Shaolin.

695
01:32:26,411 --> 01:32:29,403
Yes, and I have waited for
thirty long years.

696
01:32:29,706 --> 01:32:33,096
Now I have the manual of
the Seven Deadly Fists.

697
01:32:33,418 --> 01:32:36,091
I wanted my son to become
the Martial Master.

698
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,690
I wanted the Luk clan to rule over
the martial community forever.

699
01:32:40,008 --> 01:32:43,239
I knew something was up
from the moment the manual was stolen.

700
01:32:43,554 --> 01:32:48,184
The fake palm print suggested a traitor
in our midst. But you?

701
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:52,472
Yes. I killed Shek Yingfeng
and Purity!

702
01:32:52,814 --> 01:32:57,444
- What did my father ever do to you?
- I had to get rid of the strongest rival.

703
01:32:57,818 --> 01:33:01,128
How were you able to kill them
during seclusion?

704
01:33:01,447 --> 01:33:05,440
- There is a secret passage...
- Why kill Purity?

705
01:33:05,786 --> 01:33:10,621
He knew too much,
so I had to silence him.

706
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,955
Why set me up?

707
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:16,598
Oh, a scapegoat always comes in handy.

708
01:33:16,921 --> 01:33:19,389
Now that you know everything,

709
01:33:19,674 --> 01:33:23,508
it's time for me to right the wrongs
old and new, once and for all!

710
01:33:23,844 --> 01:33:25,482
Prepare for a bloodbath!

711
01:33:30,977 --> 01:33:34,890
I'm the one who killed your son.
Leave the others alone.

712
01:34:25,992 --> 01:34:28,062
The leopard strikes!

713
01:35:06,907 --> 01:35:09,262
THE ESSENCE OF THE FIVE FISTS

714
01:35:13,289 --> 01:35:14,688
Who's there?

715
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,747
What is it?

716
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:18,640
Where?

717
01:35:18,877 --> 01:35:21,186
Why, go to hell... Who's that
hitting my leg?

718
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:24,410
Monster!

719
01:35:31,933 --> 01:35:34,925
Who's that tugging on my arm?
Let go of me!

720
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:52,790
Let go. Let me go!

721
01:35:54,372 --> 01:35:56,966
You don't look so clever now, do you?

722
01:36:03,215 --> 01:36:04,933
Are you afraid of ghosts?

723
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:22,428
What are you doing?
Get off me!

724
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,856
Let go of me!

725
01:36:36,164 --> 01:36:37,802
Why don't you jump?

726
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,078
You want more?

727
01:36:50,637 --> 01:36:52,389
You're really not helping!

728
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:56,296
What the heck?

729
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,350
The tiger!

730
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,686
Who's holding me?

731
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,195
Snake!

732
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:46,888
My poor shoulder!

733
01:37:55,079 --> 01:37:57,229
All Five Elements at once!

734
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:39,912
Please, Master! No!
