1
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:59,677
Glory be to Allah.

2
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:11,747
Glory be to Allah.

3
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:16,254
l testify that there is
none worth worshipping..

4
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,455
..except the Almighty Allah.

5
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,803
'Questions were many.
One of them was..'

6
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,569
'..did Noor win or lose?'

7
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,275
'But the bigger question was..'

8
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:11,242
'..how can there be a relationship
or brotherhood with the country..'

9
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,752
'..we'd fought three wars with?'

10
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,260
The Quaid-e-Azam
kickboxing goodwill tournament..

11
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,696
..which has been
organised in Lahore..

12
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:31,998
l'm certain that
we'll win this tournament.

13
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:37,368
Our players are fit,
trained and experienced.

14
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,901
Thank you very much.

15
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,009
And now, the lndian coach
Mr. S.K. Rao will address the press.

16
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,285
What do you speculate
about today's match, Mr. Rao?

17
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,418
What do you wish to hear?

18
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,894
Even today, we're going to win.

19
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,523
Every individual
has his own opinion.

20
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,899
And if l were to share mine..

21
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,428
..you didn't win in
Kuala Lumpur either.

22
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,003
lt's the question of Lahore today.

23
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,874
l won't accept defeat here,
at any cost.

24
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,005
Sorry, sir.
We'll decide the codes today.

25
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,788
The prime issue today is
the competition at Lahore.

26
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,255
And the confidence..

27
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,262
..with which he has assured
the victory for his team..

28
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,265
..l think even l can say
this with full confidence..

29
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,928
..that we've come fully
prepared to return as winners.

30
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,362
Thank you so much.

31
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,268
ln the last 62 years,
lots of things have been played..

32
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:17,003
..between the two nations.
Lots of things.

33
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:26,284
lf there's something that
hasn't been played, it's sports.

34
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,710
Well said, sir.

35
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,250
Sir, what's your
opinion regarding the fact..

36
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,256
..that the sport which
will be played now..

37
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,848
..will further
strengthen the relations?

38
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,264
When l was a child, my
granny would tell me..

39
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,858
''Go out and play with friends.''

40
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,864
Now, after all these years..

41
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,302
..l've again stepped out
in search for friends.

42
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,704
So that l can play with them.

43
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,272
After all, sports are only
played with friends. Right?

44
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,240
But sir, the nations where
cricket is seen as a religion..

45
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,251
..does the success of a kickboxing
tournament in those places..

46
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,446
..seem to be a far cry?.

47
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,249
No, no. Look, this is not
a platform..

48
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,693
..to criticise cricket or hockey.

49
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,424
lt's about time we paid attention
to other sports as well.

50
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:21,337
Kickboxing is just the beginning.
Just wait and see. What did you say?

51
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,934
This is the result of
Mr. Mohammad Akhtar's efforts.

52
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:30,243
This Quaid-e-Azam
goodwill kickboxing tournament..

53
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,251
..which shall be played out in Lahore.

54
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,270
The 16th national kickboxing
championship's final bout..

55
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,276
..in the featherweight
category is being fought between..

56
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,280
..Rajasthan's Dheerender
Singh and Gajanan Oinam of Delhi.

57
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,247
Delhi's Gajanan Oinam..

58
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,911
..has been a national
champion for the last five years.

59
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,251
Whereas, this is not just
Dheerender Singh's first time..

60
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,257
..at the national championship..

61
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,327
..but he's also made it
to the final.

62
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,919
And he seems to be
in tremendous form.

63
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,362
Yes. Take him. Look out.
 
64
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,730
To the left. Left.

65
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,805
Move. Corner.

66
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,684
Come on. Yes. Come on.

67
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,255
Yes. Comeon. Come on, come on.

68
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,362
Very good. Well done.

69
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,337
Stop. Stop.

70
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,698
Stop. Stop.

71
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,770
Start.

72
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,248
Running up from the
pavilion end to bowl..

73
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,913
..is Haryana's medium-pace bowler.

74
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,583
And the ball..
And the batsman has been beaten.

75
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,293
He has been beaten completely.
He wanted to play it..

76
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,723
Yes.
- What happened?

77
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,323
lt's still on.

78
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,290
What are brother's chances?

79
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,726
Can't say anything right now.

80
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,271
This is the second
success for Haryana.

81
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,396
Delhi has lost its second wicket.

82
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,272
Oh, no. Every call of
yours costs a wicket.

83
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,935
lt's you who called up, not me.
- Veeru, you're on.

84
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,779
The crowd is eagerly
waiting for the next batsman.

85
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,679
Delhi's run machine.

86
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,517
That means, Veerender
Singh is on the ground.

87
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,253
This majeesic batsman
hailing from Delhi..

88
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,350
..is well known for
his powerhouse batting.

89
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,359
Right-handed Veerender Singh.

90
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,567
He has scored seven half centuries.
That means seven 50s.

91
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:07,264
And his average is 80.88%.

92
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,274
And the first ball..

93
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,837
Veerender Singh used his wrist
beautifully to play this ball.

94
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,974
And the ball has crossed the
boundary line for four runs.

95
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,656
Dig it in.
- Yes.

96
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,657
Go in.
- There's.. There's a hit.

97
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,987
Yes. Yes..

98
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,721
Tough competition.

99
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,263
Gajanan Oinam wouldn't
like to lose..

100
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,268
..the national title at any cost.

101
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,270
And this is one opportunity
for Dheerender Singh..

102
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,272
..to secure a place
in the national team.

103
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,407
Both the players are trying
every possible way to win.

104
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,937
Corner.

105
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:56,912
Good. Good.

106
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:08,528
Hey, Rao. What are you
looking at so intently?.

107
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,996
Gajanan is going to win.

108
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,271
He's been the national champion
five times. He'll win for sure.

109
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,733
This boy from Rajaeshan will win.

110
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,272
What are you saying?

111
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,337
He's playing rough.

112
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,575
Jues get up close to him.
Remember that. Keep up your defence.

113
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,708
And you have to get up close.

114
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,911
Make sure you have to get close.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,254
Very good, very good.
Concentrate on foot work.

116
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,985
Be on your guard.
- Careful.

117
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,316
What's the score?

118
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,592
Listen to me carefully, Dheeru.

119
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,257
Phone? - Nothing else.
Look at me. Pay attention to me.

120
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,594
Listen to me carefully, Dheeru.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,931
Look, Dheeru, this game is
in the bag. No need to worry.

122
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,264
Don't worry, don'tworry.

123
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,861
Oh, yes? Are you sure?

124
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,668
Absolutely sure.

125
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,536
All right. Want to bet?
- Round two.

126
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,544
You'll pay for the coffee?
- Done.

127
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,270
And VeerenderSingh has
taken the aerial route..

128
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,997
..and has hit the ball
beyond the boundary line.

129
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,400
The ball has landed in
the stands for six runs.

130
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,259
Foul, foul.
- lt's a foul.  A clear foul.

131
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,521
Move. Stop.

132
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,264
This is your last warning.
Go to your corner.

133
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:53,997
Hey, foul. Foul.

134
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,247
Gajanan wants to
prove Dheerender Singh..

135
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,512
..that he has lot of potential
left in him. - Are you okay?.

136
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,712
Yes, Veeru.

137
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,585
And it's difficult for a new
fighter to last before him.

138
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,394
But Ronnie, Dheerender's
will power is quite strong.

139
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,254
Yes.
- Yes.

140
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,259
Very Good.

141
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,261
What?.

142
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,374
Do you want to continue?

143
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,978
So, Ronnie,what do you have
to say about this final kick?

144
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,449
Over.

145
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,260
And with this, the
new national champion..

146
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,728
..is Dheerender Singh
from Rajaeshan.

147
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,999
Yes. He's the hero.

148
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,324
You're right.

149
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,736
You..
- You. Coffee is on you.

150
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,397
Yes.

151
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,666
Yes.

152
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,254
This is the 11th four by
Veerender Singh today.

153
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,260
Veerender Singh is in great form.

154
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,259
This takes his individual
score to 95.

155
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,599
l would like to remind you here..

156
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,261
..that Veerender Singh has
fallen prey to nervous 90s..

157
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,533
..seven times before this.

158
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,742
And there's no century
to his credit to date.

159
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,745
And thecrowd is at their seat.

160
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,641
Will he be able to
make a century today?

161
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,588
He was trying to attack
from the back.

162
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,717
lt's good that he got trumped.

163
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,987
But you shouldn't
have turned your back.

164
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,994
This is a bad habit.

165
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,321
This boy fought well.

166
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,260
What are you doing?

167
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,468
You fought very well.
- Thank you, sir.

168
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,865
My name is S.K. Rao.

169
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,268
l'm the coach for the
kickboxing federation team.

170
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,005
l know, sir. l know.

171
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,937
This is Mr. Suri, technical
director ofthe federation.

172
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,273
Hi.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

173
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,007
Very well played.

174
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,380
l'll wait for you in the canteen.
Meet me before you leave.

175
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,509
Okay, sir. Thanks.
- Okay?

176
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,984
l'll be waiting.
- Okay.

177
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,256
All the bees.
-All the best.

178
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,585
Have you filled in the names?
- Yes, sir.

179
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,316
Has the winner's been included?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,450
Good. Thank you very much.

181
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,858
Shall we?
- Let's go.

182
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,454
Clean bowled.

183
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,260
With this, Veerender
Singh's beautiful knock..

184
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,391
..comes to an end.

185
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,531
Yes, tell me.

186
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,008
lfl fail to put an end
to your love story today..

187
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,336
..then you can call me any names.

188
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,470
Veeru.

189
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,516
The match was at its peak.
How could l've replied?

190
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,708
What happened?

191
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,247
Knockout in the second round.

192
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,522
Long live Prince Dheerender Singh.

193
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,386
What? Knockout?
- Of course.

194
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,255
Are we going to settle for any less?
Here, you talk to him.

195
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,922
Yes, junior.

196
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,664
Hey, Brother, great going.

197
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,528
At least today we deserve a drink.

198
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,264
Stupid. Should l call up mom?

199
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,330
Brother, it's not
like l drink every day.

200
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,003
And, neither do l
make a century every day.

201
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,669
You scored a century?

202
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,248
Yes. That too in 65 balls.

203
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,248
Hey, he made a century in 65 balls.

204
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,251
Hey, give me the phone.
- Couldn't you do it in 63?

205
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,581
You could've broken Sehwag's record.

206
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,845
Hey..

207
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,786
Couldn't you tell me earlier?
- Tell him to come here.

208
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,260
But l told you now, dear.
Okay, tell me. Where are we going?

209
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,994
Nowhere. l'll be late.
 
210
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,265
Got it? Let's keep it till tomorrow,
okay?

211
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,923
Stay back at our place today.

212
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,992
l swear l won't even
peep in your room.

213
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,933
Shameless. Okay, listen.
Come soon and pick us up.

214
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,275
Stupid, come here directly.

215
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,868
Don't go on a drinking binge
with your friends. - Excuse me.

216
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,004
Autograph please.

217
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,571
Yes, sure.

218
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,251
We're from Pakistan.
Lahore Medical College.

219
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,585
Welcome to lndia.
- You play really well.

220
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,851
Thank you.

221
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,658
But l'd definitely like
to add one more thing.

222
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,662
You also get out very well.
- What do you mean?

223
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,265
l mean, this is my first time..

224
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,467
.. l've seen someone reverse
sweep on a full toss ball.

225
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,539
You finally saw it today, right?

226
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,803
This is called anxiety syndrome.

227
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,508
Nervousness in common language.

228
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,648
Are you the
psychiatrist of the Pakistan team?

229
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,847
What if l am?

230
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,525
Then do one thing.
Cut Shoaib Akhtar's hair short .

231
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:54,257
His line and length will
improve by itself. Right?

232
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,994
Left an impression.

233
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,328
Yes, he did.

234
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,977
Pakistan High Commission,
New Delhi.

235
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,708
Hello?

236
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,251
Could l talk to
Mr. Sikander Hayaat?

237
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,851
Hello?

238
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,588
Why didn't you come
for the tournament?

239
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,258
Flight was delayed.
How is the new fellow?

240
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,931
Very good. He's from Rajasthan.

241
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,668
He won't be less than
Noor in an Asian championship.

242
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,544
l wish you'd seen him.

243
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,281
lf l get selected for the
Asian Championships..

244
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,246
Not ' if '.... You will be.

245
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,643
He's here. Hey.
- Veeru.

246
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,778
Oh, Brother.

247
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,516
You centurion..

248
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,385
Congratulations, Brother.

249
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,529
You, too, fool.
- Thank you, Brother.

250
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,857
How are you, Sister-in-law?

251
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,796
Hey, shameless.
- Hey, she's your sister-in-law.

252
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,527
When did l say she wasn't?

253
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,863
Come, l'll introduce you to someone.

254
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,931
Who is it, Brother?
- Our coach.

255
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,270
Sir,this is my younger
brother Veerender.

256
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,805
Yes, yes. Who doesn't know him?

257
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,343
He's a renowned
player ofthe Delhi team.

258
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,337
By the way, how's this?

259
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,014
Elder brother is into kickboxing.

260
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,250
And the younger brother is
playing cricket. How's that?

261
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,252
Sir, even l was a kick-
boxer till college. - Then?

262
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,446
Then l changed my mind.
- Why?.

263
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,521
Because l have a problem
with fighting as a sport.

264
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,721
lt's correct in a way.

265
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,259
As a cricketer, you'd be
staying in five-star hotels.

266
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,592
lf he'd been a kick boxer..

267
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,395
..he would've been lying
somewhere in the  stadium.

268
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,330
Mr. Rao always cribs on this issue.

269
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,000
Dheeru.
- Hey, Gajanan.

270
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,335
Good show.
- Thanks.

271
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,873
You played very well.

272
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,250
l guess my wish to be
coached by you..

273
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,251
..remained a wish.

274
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,381
The committee is yet to be formed.

275
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,716
Who knows what their
decision will be.

276
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,313
Then we'll see what's
done and what's not.

277
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,253
Now, what more is
left in this, sir?

278
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,729
By the way, people from
Rajasthan know how to fight.

279
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,737
l really feel sorry for him.

280
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,868
Never feel sorry for your opponent.

281
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,346
Got it? You played well,
that's why you won.

282
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,309
l agree with you 100%, sir.

283
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,514
Are you getting it?
- Yes.

284
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,448
Now, he'll go and fight in Delhi.

285
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,654
And, you can never win there.

286
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,717
l didn't get it, sir.

287
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,457
Actually, he's very close
to the cabinet minister.

288
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,587
He's right.

289
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,263
These days, sports are
played less in the ring..

290
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,267
..and more in the offices of the
ministers. Understand, mister?

291
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,730
Gajanan.
- Yes, sir?

292
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,864
How long do you intend to play?

293
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,268
You've held the national
title so many years.

294
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,912
lt's not about being
national champion, sir.

295
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,648
But the Asian
championship means alot to me.

296
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,253
Don't worry, don' tworry.
lt's not difficult.

297
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,848
Your selection is not an issue.

298
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,384
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

299
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,594
Yes, Gajanan.
- Yes?

300
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,528
Now, l want my
people in the federation.

301
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,269
Be prepared.
- Okay. Sure.

302
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:33,249
''Birds have flocked in
from beyond borders.''

303
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:44,259
''Birds have flocked to
the walls of the country.''

304
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:55,467
''lmbue me before
l fly away, my friend.''

305
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,873
''lmbue me before
l fly away, my friend.''

306
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:06,250
''lmbue yourself in
my hues, my friend.''

307
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,978
''lmbue me in your hues.''

308
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,585
''lmbue me.''

309
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:16,922
''lmbue my every pore.''

310
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,588
''lmbue me.''

311
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,666
''lmbu emy core.''

312
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:27,531
''Win over this heart, my friend.
Win over this heart.''

313
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:33,008
''Win over this heart, my friend.
Win over this heart.''

314
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,268
So, when the questions
rose in the senate..

315
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,609
..l asked who'll take these steps.

316
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,246
And even you have
a good government.

317
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,850
lf they don't take
the initiative..

318
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,989
Oh, lda. Sir ,this is
my daughter lda.

319
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,314
Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:23,451
Mr. Rao, the coach of
lndian kickboxing team.

321
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,862
Oh. So, him too?

322
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,661
He's not that kind of a coach.

323
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,464
Please come.
- Come.

324
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,736
Well, l'm a psychiatrist.
Maybe, l'll join father's team.

325
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,273
Psychiatrist? ln kickboxing?

326
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,514
Mr. Rao, you have
misunderstandings about Pakistan.

327
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,853
Pakistan is an independent
and an advanced country.

328
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,245
Why not, sir? The coach of the
team that downs eight pegs..

329
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,517
..in just half an hour..

330
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,856
.. must surely be very advanced.

331
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,264
Mr. Rao, you should see Mr. Sikander
with his team some time.

332
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,532
His preparations are no less
than a war. Right, Mr. Sikander?

333
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,730
Look, kickboxing is not possible
without aggression, Mr. Rao.

334
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,940
Anyway, this sport is not
much different from war.

335
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,877
But as usual,
l don't agree with uncle Sikander.

336
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,243
ls there any professor in the
Lahore Government College..

337
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,842
..whom you've agreed with ever?

338
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,311
Absolutely right.

339
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,914
Absolutely right.

340
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,525
Uncle, everyone has a right
to have an opinion.- Right.

341
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,994
By the way, even l have objections.
How can sports be war?

342
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,666
Because, victory comes
only with this spirit.

343
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,338
Absolutely. Victory is important.

344
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,738
But life doesn't end if at
all you face defeat, right?

345
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,274
lt can. And maybe,
this is the very reason..

346
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,279
..why such a big country of yours..

347
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,781
..could never bag even a
single gold medal yet.

348
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,253
Mr. Rao, sports has
been the dominant factor..

349
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,253
..in yesterday's treaty?.

350
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:03,457
Because only sports bring
our nations closer, doesn't it?

351
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,524
You're absolutely right, sir.

352
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,528
By the way, there's a poem
by one of our Urdu poets.

353
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,459
A phrase apt fo rthe coach.
- Go ahead.

354
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,999
''Both of our houses
are made of glass.''

355
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,402
''Worth pondering for both of us.''

356
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,277
''And still, we both
have a rock in our hand.''

357
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,609
''Worth pondering for both of us.''
- Wow.

358
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,710
Wow. Wow. Well said, Mr. Rao.

359
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,252
Even Gajanan is a capable player.

360
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,516
Maybe, sir. But not
fort his tournament.

361
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:38,251
l mean, can't it be possible
for someone out of the others..

362
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,524
..to report sick
at the last moment?

363
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,931
Even if that does happen, sir..

364
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,268
..there are many people
above Gajanan on the merit list.

365
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,270
Who are more capable than him.

366
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,005
We're spending so much money.

367
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:55,005
Then Delhi should get a
chance at representation.

368
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,678
Sir, this is sport.

369
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,773
People rise only on the
basis of their capabilities.

370
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,917
Capability is not the only
thing required to run sports.

371
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,253
You need money,too, Mr. Rao.

372
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,256
Now, all the hurdles..

373
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,853
..against the good will match
with Pakistan have been resolved.

374
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,525
l'll be meeting with
their high commission today..

375
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,325
..and decide on the dates.

376
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,266
lt'd be better if this
tournament of yours..

377
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,272
..happens after the
Asian tournament, sir.

378
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,804
Players are usually very tired.

379
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,655
Two-nil.

380
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,792
Less beer, more exercise, Suri.
What are you doing?

381
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,269
Look, Rao, the game
l play with the management..

382
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,670
..is tougher than this.

383
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,799
Really?
- Absolutely.

384
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:58,933
Look at yourself.

385
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,550
Oh, God. Why in
heaven's name is he calling?

386
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,882
Hello? Who's speaking?

387
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,255
Bhaskar Reddy.

388
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,558
Yes, sir.
- What's this, Mr. Rao?

389
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,261
How did this news reach the press..

390
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,997
..without my permission?

391
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,269
Sir, l thought since
l selected the team..

392
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,501
..l should be the one to inform.

393
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,978
Do you know it requires
the president's signature?

394
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,781
Yes, sir. That's why
l'm sending you the file.

395
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,905
Sign it.

396
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:47,450
Look, Mr. Rao.
l challenge you openly.

397
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,254
lf not today, then tomorrow..

398
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,332
..Gajanan will definitely
play for the national team.

399
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,330
Really? Let's see what happens, sir.

400
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,504
l'm a little busy
right now, sir. Yes, bye.

401
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,471
As if the team's your
lineage for you to select it.

402
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,681
So,was it the devil's call?

403
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,375
Yes.

404
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,285
Was he giving you threats?

405
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,721
He tried to, but l didn't take it.

406
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,253
ln such a coalition
government, Suri..

407
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,921
..a minister's threat
doesn't last for along time.

408
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,625
Everyone is out to
double cross the other.

409
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,668
Rao, tell me something.
Why do you lock horns with them?

410
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,761
These people run the nation.
Don't lock horns with them.

411
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,500
These people run the
nation and the media runs them.

412
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,276
That's why l always have
media on my right side..

413
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,537
..to make the
minister work dead straight.

414
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,312
So, what's the score?

415
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,608
2-0.
- l'll makeit 5-0. Come on.

416
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,981
Oh, really?
- Yes.

417
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:50,912
Challenge?

418
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,584
Wow.
- Mother, do you know?

419
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,387
What?.
- This Delhi player.

420
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,523
Gajanan?
- Yes?

421
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,490
He was the champion
for the last five years.

422
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,989
Really?

423
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,996
l knocked him out.
- Very good.

424
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,901
Leavemybag.
- What's this?

425
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,466
Tamarind.

426
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,676
Mom, tamarind.
- So?

427
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,314
Mom, why does she eat tamarind?

428
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,375
Hey, even normal people
eat tamarind. Understand?

429
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,252
Shut up, naughty.
Don't talk rubbish.

430
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,982
Mom, l doubt something is wrong.

431
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,381
You..
- Hey.

432
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,586
Shut your mouth.
Otherwise, l'll smack you.

433
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,826
God knows when you'll
stop babbling.

434
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,398
By the way,
what are your plans, dear?

435
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,324
Tiill when are you
planning to live like this?

436
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,729
You know people outside
have big mouths.- Mom.

437
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,570
Get them married, Mom.
They're so restless.

438
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,338
Dheerender. You tell me, Son.

439
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:54,314
Mom. Let this Asian
Championship get over.

440
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,986
Pick any date after
l return from Kuala Lumpur.

441
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,321
l just want everything to
be done in time. That's all.

442
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,862
Bytheway, l'm getting very late.
Veeru, get up quickly.

443
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,339
Change your clothes and drop me.

444
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,905
Stayback here tonight?

445
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,704
Naughty. What nonsense
are you talking about?

446
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,976
Mom, it's not like
this is the first time.

447
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,508
Right, Brother?

448
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,983
What is he talking about, Dheeru?

449
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,585
Mom, who are you listening to?
He's talking nonsense.

450
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,715
lt's a complete lie, Mom.

451
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,384
She's listening to me today.
- So, Brother?

452
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,428
Quick, she's getting late.

453
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,491
Mom, l'll leave. See you tomorrow.

454
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,324
Come on.

455
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,334
l'm very happy.

456
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,339
Just let your wife come.
l'll settle all the scores.

457
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,340
l won't let anyone touch my wife.

458
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,338
l'll hide her from the whole world.

459
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,935
Yes, yes, sure.
We'll buy a cage for her.

460
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,413
We'll lock her in. Okay?
That'll be better for her.

461
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,974
Hey, mister. Can you please
ask them to sit at the side?

462
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,649
They're tired. Why don't
you go from some other route?

463
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,849
My friend, that's
not where l'm headed.

464
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,789
And it's they who are
sitting in the middle.

465
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,385
Hey, don't you understand?
They're tired.

466
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,520
Go from some other lane.

467
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,327
Just because you're tired doesn't
mean you can occupy any lane.

468
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:22,003
Why are you racking our brains?
Just get lost.

469
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,833
Veeru, leave it.
We'll wait and then leave.

470
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,276
Why wait? We'll go right now.

471
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,322
What's your opinion regarding
national coach Mr. S.K. Rao?

472
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,322
He's a capable and
intelligent coach.

473
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,593
Our team will definitely
win under his guidance.

474
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,265
But your differences
with him are world famous?

475
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:58,339
Differences? These
differences are media creation.

476
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,501
lt's not the truth.

477
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,012
Did you send this reporter?

478
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,379
We all work together
for our country's honour.

479
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,885
You have to do these
things sometimes. You have to.

480
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,255
But questions have
always been raised..

481
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,825
..regarding a team's fair selection.
Any comments on that.

482
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,258
Fiive times national
champion Gajanan..

483
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,389
..didn't get a place
in the team this time.

484
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,336
What can be a better example
off air selection than this?

485
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,266
This was the cabinet
minister Mr. Kunjal Bhaskar Reddy.

486
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,606
Who's also the president of the
Kickboxing Federation of lndia.

487
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,280
You're always ready
with your tactics.

488
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,584
He's a shameless fellow.
How else can we manage him?

489
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,851
Yes, you're right in a way.

490
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,445
Today's second big sporting
news is related to cricket.

491
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,255
'Last evening, there
was a huge fight..'

492
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,258
'..between the famous Delhi
cricketer Veerender Singh..'

493
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,454
'..and those on a pilgrimage
near Chhatarpurtemple.'

494
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,255
'Veerender Singh is a
renowned cricketer.'

495
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,267
'And the rumour has it
that he'll soon be selected..'

496
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,530
'..for the national team.'

497
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,664
'This is Sumeet Vidrohi from
Chhatarpur temple for lndia TV.'

498
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,943
Veeru, let's go. Veeru.

499
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:38,538
lsn't he Dheeru's brother?

500
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,668
What?.

501
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,807
Yes. Looks like him.

502
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,249
Well, then why is
he playing cricket?

503
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,252
He should be
in the kickboxing team.

504
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,450
That's what he's doing
on the road.

505
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,663
Hurry up. Faster. Faster.

506
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:41,795
Jump.

507
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:44,865
Jump.

508
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,274
Further. Come on.

509
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,856
No or, your ribs
could've easily been broken.

510
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,315
But they weren't, right?.

511
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,452
What if they had broken?

512
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,722
We'll worry about it
when it happens.

513
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,925
Look, your ribs have become swollen.

514
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,660
Your blood pressure
is running high.

515
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,270
lt happens to everyone
while fighting.

516
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,271
lt's been six hours since
the practice got over, Noor.

517
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,671
What are you getting at?

518
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,244
l'm just saying you don't
need to bring your arena home.

519
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,249
lt ends right there
in the ring, Noor.

520
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,847
Coach knows better.

521
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,722
lt's your life, not the coach's.

522
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:11,261
Look, ma'am. l came here
for my routine session..

523
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,523
..not to waste time.

524
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,265
l'll take your leave now.

525
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,667
71..

526
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,337
72..

527
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,306
73..

528
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:38,445
74.. 75..

529
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,582
76..

530
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,983
Don't stop!

531
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,797
That's it.

532
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,666
Now, hit on the chest.

533
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,802
Yes. Ready.

534
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,239
You can't talk like that about him.

535
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,441
Father, l'm just
giving you advice.

536
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,982
Are you listening to
what l'm saying? - Yes.

537
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,922
l think Noor needs 
more counselling.

538
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,521
He was counselled by a
Dr. Hidayat.

539
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,458
But it was six months ago, Father.

540
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,265
Do you know that a person's
psyche undergoes changes every day?

541
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,268
l know that.
But Sikander won't agree to it.

542
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,928
And he's the team coach.

543
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,934
l'm concerned only
about Noor right now.

544
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,941
He's not playing
this game like a sport.

545
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,306
lda, this is
Sikander's responsibility.

546
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:18,451
And l'm sure he knows his
responsibilities as a coach.

547
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,922
lf only that were true.

548
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,450
What do you mean?

549
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,791
Sir, your call.
- But..

550
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,926
Hello? Yes, speaking. Go ahead.

551
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,861
All of you stay there.
l'm on my way.

552
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:41,542
lda, how was Noor's
health when you met him today?.

553
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,596
ls there anything serious?

554
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,808
There's swelling in the ribs.
lt'll be all right till tomorrow.

555
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,470
But Mr. Sikander
should be a little lenient.

556
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,241
The Championship is around the corner.

557
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:23,650
Saying that to him at this
time is like belling the cat.

558
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,981
His work is an obsession with him.

559
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,454
l don't have any
objection to his obsession.

560
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,591
But Noor is our best bet
for this championship.

561
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,256
Pakistan can't afford him failing.

562
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,800
lda. Did you speak
to Noor yesterday?

563
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,802
Yes. l just said..

564
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,462
Do you know you're just an intern?

565
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,665
Yes.

566
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,470
Then behave like an intern.

567
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,244
Don't try to
demoralise my player next time.

568
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,443
Please come, Mr. Mohammed.

569
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,452
Yes. Yes, sure.
You people please go ahead.

570
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,778


571
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,914


572
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,316


573
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,260
Yes? - What if Noor
gets sometime to relax?

574
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,592
He's the pillar of our team.

575
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,263
No. Nothing will happen to
his health. He's a tiger.

576
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,339
Please see this.
- Yes. Sure.

577
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,237
These are all the
players Noor will be facing.

578
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,253
But l'm eyeing this lndian player..

579
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,256
..who's much better than theirs.

580
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,325
But everyone will be there to win.

581
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,460
This is life for me, Mr. Mohammad.

582
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,329
l have to win this championship.

583
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,272
God willing.

584
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,667
l won't return from
Kuala Lumpur defeated.

585
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,983
l'll get few Malaysian girls
for you from Kuala Lumpur.

586
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,252
l'd rather prefer
someone from Pakistan.

587
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,450
You're still not over her?

588
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,259
There was definitely
something about her.

589
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,792
So,what else can l get?
Besides girls.

590
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,263
Veerender Singh will get
''what else'' for you. - Oh, really?

591
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,264
Just wait for three-four years.

592
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,735
And what are you going
to do in three-four years?

593
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,274
ln the next two-three years, the lndian
cricket team will be touring..

594
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,469
..England, Australia.
And now, even Pakistan.

595
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,273
And at these tournaments, girls will fall flat..

596
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,439
..on every six
prince Veerender Singh hits.

597
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,779
How many?.
- Look,who's talking. Understood?

598
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,908
Just wait and watch.

599
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,647
Yes, l am. And, l understand, too.
- Wait.

600
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,779
Mother's right here.
Should l tell her?

601
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,913
You'll put me in a fix.

602
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,321
And this, to protect
you from a bad omen.

603
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,722
What are you doing, Mom?
l'm not a child.

604
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,316
You'll always be for me.

605
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,588
Let's go, Neela.

606
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,922
Bye, Mom.
- Bless you.

607
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,466
Junior.
- See you, Brother.

608
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,661
No gallivanting. And
do take care of mom.

609
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,268
Now, why..
- lfy ou return after 7 o'clock..

610
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,271
..l'll come back and bash you up.

611
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,397
Look, Mother.
- Don't.

612
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,532
He's scolding me
even while leaving.

613
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,933
Let's go.

614
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,678
Bye.
- Hey, bye.

615
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,248
Take care of yourself. Bye, Mom.

616
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,643
Bye.

617
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,312
Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

618
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,447
Bye, Veeru.
- Bye.

619
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,581
Bye.

620
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,659
Behave respectfully with Sikander.

621
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,662
He's a very experienced person.

622
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,789
Father, did l complain till now?

623
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,868
But still. Do remember
what l've said.

624
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:55,526
''So, the skies can be embraced.''

625
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:08,002
''Fly, seeking new directions.''

626
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:32,860
''Yes, this group will reach
for the skies and beyond.''

627
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:40,274

''..their victory will be
etched in golden letters.''

redder than ever before..''

635
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:31,453
''..pounding through the veins.''

636
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:47,875
''May every drop of
blood serve the country.''

637
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:59,712
''lt will be
immortalised for eons to come.''

638
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,802
''lt will be
immortalised for eons to come.''

639
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:16,807
So, Neela, when is the
wedding planned for?

640
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,934
So, Neela, when is the

put on a bit of weight since then.

692
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,450
Look, Pakistan's
honour is in your hands now.

693
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,250
ln the beginning, he
showed a lot of aggression..

694
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,517
..out of over-confidence. Got it?

Okay. Start!

712
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,454
Hey, what is he doing? He's playing

lf he blocks the kick,
then punch. Got it?

721
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,662
Just play your natural game.

722
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,598
Don't worry. Play close. Close!

723
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,795

00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,327

What are you doing?
Why can't you hit him?

748
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,251
He's very solid, sir.
His kick has tremendous power.

749
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,652
Look, don't worry about his kick.
The game is in our hands.

750
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,316
He has more points,
so he will waste time.

751
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,250
Don't give him a chance to do that.

752
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,797
lf he tries to block,
hit him below the waist.

753

00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,730
Round three. Start

759
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,247

01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:44,262
The government of lndia has
declared it a state funeral.

781
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:11,537
Down with them! Down with Pakistan!

lt's a public outcry, sir.

784
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,255
When there's such a huge injustice..

785
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,659
..people are bound
to be outraged, sir.

786
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:11,255
People like you don't understand..

787
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:16,327
..how this will affect our
relations with Pakistan.

788
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,408
Sir, you're the
chairman of this federation.

789
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,272
Haven't you considered..

790
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,905
..how Dheerender Singh's
death has affected his family?

791
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,245
We have to answer to lslamabad..

792
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,445
..whether the goodwill
match will be taking place or not.

793
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:35,251
Do we need to answer them
or get an answer from them?

794
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,259
We can't blame anyone..

795
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,329
..until the Malaysian
committee's report is released.

796
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,389
Sir, our boy is no more.
Now what is the use of the report?

797
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:49,267
Sir, l agree it's good to
improve relations with any country.

798
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,332
But that doesn't mean we
succumb to absolute injustice.

799
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,335
Don't worry about
government policies, Mr. Rao.

800
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,379
Actually, even you
should be held answerable.

801
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:04,252
Definitely, sir. But
when you get time from..

802
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,516
..all the formalities of sending
reports, questioning and answering..

803
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,786
..then do realise the man who
died was representing lndia.

804
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,321
The meeting is over.

805
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,523
Thank you very much.

806
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,246
Yes, Father.

807
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,717
lda, how is the situation there?

808
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,787
What would you expect, Father?

809
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,391
l have no words to say.
Just take care of yourself.

810
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,395
How long do you intend to stay?

811
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,260
For a few more days.

812
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:57,939
Dear, keep your emotions
under control. No interviews.

813
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,399
lt might create trouble here.

814
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,501
l know, Father. Our
relations are improving.

815
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,844
Both the countries
want the same thing.

816
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:48,384
''Dear one.. dear one..''

817
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:52,525
''Happiness has left with you.''

818
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,587
''Happiness has left with you.''

819
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,533
''Happiness has left with you.''

820
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:04,663
''Happiness has left with you.''

821
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:09,938
''The paths seem deserted.''

822
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:18,647
''The courtyard lies
empty before me.''

823
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:24,454
''And my heart is desolate.''

824
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:31,728
''Dear one.. dear one..''

825
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:39,337
''Happiness has left with you.''

826
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:45,840
''Happiness has left with you.''

827
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:13,264
''The pleasant breeze
passed me by.''

828
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,368
''The monsoon showers went by..''

829
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:25,253
''..and the kites and
boats of the season..''

830
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:29,723
''..no longer matter without you.''

831
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:41,401
''The stars serve as a blanket,
but even thes ky can't sleep.''

832
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:46,603
''And dreams take flight.''

833
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:54,582
''Dear one.. dear one..''

834
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:01,247
''Happiness has left with you.''

835
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,925
''Happiness has left with you.''

836
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,249
We welcome the spectators
in this lrani Trophy match..

837
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,648
..being played between Ranji
Trophy Champion Uttar Pradesh..

838
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,448
..and Rees of lndia at
Fiirozshah Kotla stadium.

839
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:36,253
We welcome the spectators
to this match.

840
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,258
After this series of matches..

841
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,797
..the winning team will tour
Australia and New Zealand.

842
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,857
Winning today's match is
crucial for every player. - Out!

843
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,271
Appeal.. And he is out..

844
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,731
The first
breakthrough for Uttar Pradesh.

845
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:59,838
The next batsman for Rees
of lndia is Veerender Singh.

846
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:07,388
Veerender Singh has been
exceptional in this season.

847
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:11,248
Veerender Singh is
playing on his homeground..

848
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,261
..in front of his home crowd..

849
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:17,332
..and that is certain to help him.

850
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:18,730
This is a huge chance
for Veerender Singh.

851
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,392
And he is a very aggressive player.

852
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,336
His striking rate is 90.68.

853
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,270
Little brother!

854
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:43,842
Clean bowled! Veerender Singh..

855
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:47,581
..is clean bowled off
the very first ball!

856
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,658
Very good bowling from Uttar Pradesh,
and it's a big achievement..

857
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,659
And the next batsman from the
rest of lndia is Nitin Ojha.

858
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,917
Long live Kunjal Bhaskar Reddy!

859
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:25,460
Long live Kunjal Bhaskar Reddy!

860
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:26,585
Pleased to hear that.

861
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,930
Our youth should unite and
become an inspiration to others.

862
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,593
Long live Kunjal Bhaskar Reddy!

863
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,799
What do you mean,
''it's 'their' country''?

864
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,738
Don't they abide by
international law?

865
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:46,776
Don't they respect
a sportsman's spirit?

866
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,645
lt's their decision, Mr. Rao.

867
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,717
They say the referee
failed to raise his finger.

868
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,380
My player has died.
Do you get that?

869
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:00,586
And he hasn't died due to some
referee's not raising the finger.

870
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,658
The person who is responsible..

871
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,322
..for his death is moving
around free and proud.

872
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,798
What should l do? l was helpless.

873
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,667
Lousy rogues!

874
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,604
You're more talked about
in Pakistan these days..

875
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,868
..than even the prime minister,
Mr. Sikander.

876
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,437
This accomplishment's credit
goes wholly to my boy Noor.

877
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:58,770
You're right.

878
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,642
You're my tiger.Always
fight fearlessly like this.

879
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,720
This time too, l will accept
nothing less than in Kuala Lumpur.

880
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,257
And the world will
watch how Pakistan's hero..

881
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,725
..gets his deserved
place in the latest match.

882
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,387
Godwilling!

883
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,594
So they declared it an accident.

884
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:23,728
Yes.

885
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,531
And what about your Pakistan?

886
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,244
Our report corroborates theirs.

887
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:36,583
Noor may get a clean chit.

888
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:44,256
So, my brother's
death has become a joke.

889
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,259
The media got spicy content and..

890
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,526
..politicians got a
chance to blame each other.

891
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,261
And amidst all this..

892
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,272
..a happy family..

893
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,255
When are you leaving?

894
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,330
l haven't yet decided.

895
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:41,779
You've been a great support.
l won't be able to forget you.

896
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:50,249
lt's so difficult to
predict what form death..

897
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:54,522
..and humanity might take
and come in front of you.

898
01:18:56,698 --> 01:19:01,328
l ask you for forgiveness on
behalf of all ofPakistan.

899
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,781
On behalf of the government
of lndia..

900
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,247
..l am honoured to announce
the resumption of the..

901
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,254
..Kickboxing Goodwill Championship
between lndia and Pakistan..

902
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,256
..to be held in Lahore
in a few days.

903
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,258
We have taken the decision
in order to promote peace..

904
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,522
..love and harmony
between the two nations.

905
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,265
Dheerender Singh's sudden death..

906
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,460
..at the Asian Championship
was given a clean chit.

907
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,469
What does the government
have to say about that?

908
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,272
lt's still very soon to
pass a comment on that..

909
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,274
..but justice will not be denied.

910
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,375
lf that is so,
then why did you decide..

911
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:45,241
..that the Goodwill
Championship be held so soon?

912
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:48,316
Well, there's a famous saying.
lt's never too late..

913
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:05,261
l can't sum up courageto ask you..

914
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:10,270
..to come to Pakistan some day.

915
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:38,264
Neela, my country and
my people are not bad.

916
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:12,334
Do you even know what
you're talking about?

917
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,858
Do you even know what
you're talking about?

918
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,805
This is kickboxing.
lt's a specialised sport.

919
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:19,530
What's with you?

920
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,312
No, sir. You will
make me a kick boxer.

921
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:29,307
l've had the skills since childhood.

922
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,246
My friend, there are
more people above me..

923
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,322
..in the federation authority.

924
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,255
l'm answerable to them.
lt's not a walk in the park.

925
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:46,330
l've read the federation
rules, sir.

926
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,268
National coach and
technical director..

927
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,340
..can give a chance to a fresh
candidate at their discretion.

928
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:56,342
Provided, there's more than a
month's time for the tournament.

929
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,645
There is such a rule
in the rule book.

930
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:01,778
But it's never been implemented.
Understand?

931
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,854
Many things happen for
the first time, sir.

932
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,459
My brother's death is
one such thing.

933
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,460
Look, you have such a good and
a well-set career in cricket.

934
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,266
Why do you want to
forsake that for the ring?

935
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,475
l just want to
fulfil my brother's dream.

936
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:37,307
l want to fight. Just like him.

937
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:43,923
lt's not that simple.
lt's not easy either.

938
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,792
Hey, Bhagyaram,what
are you all doing?

939
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,658
Am l supposed to check this
ball and the rubber density?.

940
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,324
Then, what are all of you here for?

941
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,876
Nothing is easy, sir.
lt has to be made easy.

942
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:08,309
Give me some time. Let me think.

943
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,317
You sure can think about it, sir.

944
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:17,852
l juts want to say
that you won't regret it.

945
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,525
Look, Rao, don't
even think about it

946
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,659
l'm telling you.
Kunjal will kill you.

947
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:32,264
l'm the coach of
lndia's kick boxing team..

948
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,808
..not your Kunjal's slave. Got it?

949
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:38,367
But what's the need? This
is just a good will match.

950
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,244
Good will match? Do you
know what goodwill means?

951
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,917
To walk with pride with
humiliation written on our face?

952
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,316
ls that what goodwill means?

953
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,253
l mean, he's a cricketer, right?
Not a kick boxer.

954
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,791
Gajanan is far better.
And even you know that.

955
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,718
Oh, okay, okay.

956
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:57,320
Now, you'll teach me who's
a better kick boxer, right?.

957
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,595
Look, Rao.. - Suri, even you
were a sportsman once, right?

958
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,264
What happened to you?

959
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,597
Look.. - Why are you so
paranoid about Kunjal?

960
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,866
Don't tell me all this, get it?

961
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,541
l don't know
why are you so difficult?

962
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:11,237
Why are you putting your
career at stake, along with mine?

963
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,711
Nothing will happen to your career.

964
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,244
l'll be responsible
for whatever l'm doing.

965
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,374
Fine.
- All alone.

966
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,508
So, it's your responsibility.

967
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,246
This is your
decision and responsibility?.

968
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,378
Yes. My responsibility.

969
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:21,512
You'll be accountable for
whatever happens. - Yes, l will.

970
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,588
Same lousy story.

971
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,921
All right. Treat me to a coffee.

972
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:31,855
Do you people think this is a joke?
Gajanan has been finalised.

973
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:35,333
Sir, he's still a candidate.
Just like Veerender is.

974
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,598
What? A cricketer
will fight in kickboxing?

975
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,267
And in the national team?

976
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,342
That'll be proven
in this match, sir.

977
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:43,271
What do you say, Suri?

978
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,240
Look, sir, what l'm saying is..

979
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,371
..that if Gajanan wins,
he'd be in thet eam anyway, right?

980
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,241
Okay. Bye.

981
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,378
Bye, sir

982
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,256
Happy?

983
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,774
Veeru.

984
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,514
Why are you doing all this?

985
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,259
Withdraw your name.

986
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,339
l don't hav eany courage left.

987
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:11,459
Nobody did anything, Mom.
l met everyone.

988
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:16,263
Everyone wants to brush
it off as an accident..

989
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,271
..and forget my brother.

990
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:25,911
lt's all over. For them,
as well as for us.

991
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:32,715
Can you believe that
he's not alive anymore?

992
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,924
He has been killed in
the name of victory.

993
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,257
lf this is the truth,
then we have to believe it.

994
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,264
l won't be able to accept it, Mom.

995
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:53,272
Because l see a burning
pyre in these eyes every day.

996
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,446
But my Dheeru won't come back.

997
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,805
Look, l've tried my best.

998
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,341
But l doubt if Kunjal
will give in so easily.

999
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,735
He's a minister after all.

1000
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:33,312
Gajanan? You should've
been in the selection hall.

1001
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,438
What are you doing here?

1002
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,251
Sir, after proving
myself for so many years..

1003
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:41,652
..l don't see the need to
compete with a cricketer.

1004
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,314
That too, just
for selection's sake?

1005
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,392
What do you mean?
- l've changed my mind, sir.

1006
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:49,330
What are you doing?
You're a sportsman.

1007
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,725
This is an opportunity for
you as well as for Veerender.

1008
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:56,326
lf Veerender has the guts and
talent, he'll prove himself.

1009
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,667
But you're losing out
on a good opportunity.

1010
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:00,867
Are you getting what l'm saying?

1011
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,239
Yes. Okay, sir.

1012
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:12,843
'Hey, Veeru.'

1013
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:25,256
''No one has been able to outdo me.''

1014
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:31,527
''The horse Chetak
belonged to Rana Pratap.''

1015
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:38,303
''Who never backed off
from a battlefield.''

1016
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:45,244
''That horse Chetak
belonged to Rana Pratap.''

1017
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:39,270
''When Chetak was spurred..''

1018
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:45,244
''..every foe was
left biting thedust.''

1019
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:57,789
''He shared an
unbreakable bond with Rana.''

1020
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:06,263
''He was a warrior,
a Rajput caste.''

1021
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:13,398
''He was a warrior, a Rajput.''

1022
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,808
So, what is to be done, sir?

1023
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:20,638
Let's see.

1024
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,644
Bye, sir.

1025
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:29,517
What does the minister say now?

1026
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,255
Shall l order coffee, Mr. Rao?

1027
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,261
Mr. Singhania, this should be
the most explosive news tomorrow.

1028
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,529
You have no idea how
big this story is.

1029
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,335
Juts read it tomorrow.

1030
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,254
You got it on the
internet as well, Mr. Rao.

1031
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:05,386
This is front-page news.

1032
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,393
Even Kunjal's
messiahs can't do anything.

1033
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,787
You have to do these things,
dear. You have to.

1034
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:17,461
You might be fighting
againts Noor Mohammed.

1035
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,336
The Noor Mohammad your
brother died while fighting with.

1036
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,465
l know.

1037
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,600
Any comment on that?

1038
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:28,646
Look, it was an accident.
Accidents have been a part of sport.

1039
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:32,310
And they'll continue to be.

1040
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,591
'Veerender Singh has been
included in the lndian team..'

1041
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,857
'..that's arriving here
for the goodwill tournament.'

1042
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,593
'Veerender Singh is the
brother of theperson..'

1043
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,932
'..who died whilefighting
Pakistan's Noor Mohammad.'

1044
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:51,664
'Only Veerender
Singh knows the motive..'

1045
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,467
'..with which he's come to Lahore.'

1046
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:56,270
'The motive can be victory,
or to avenge..'

1047
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,436
'..a brother's defeat, or
you can say, his death.'

1048
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:02,248
Yes, l understand you.
But l'm sorry..

1049
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,318
..l completely disagree with you.

1050
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,247
l believe..

1051
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,455
..that this is not an appropriate
time for the tournament.

1052
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,262
Look, if anything happens..

1053
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,592
..Pakistan will be answerable
to the whole world.

1054
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:24,266
Sir, everyone knows why
Veerender is coming to Pakistan..

1055
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,273
..except for politicians like us.

1056
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,533
So, l'm repeating myself again.

1057
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,437
We've been given one
opportunity to prove..

1058
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,640
..how seriously committed we are..

1059
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:36,910
..regarding the
restoration of peace with lndia.

1060
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:38,578
Don't let it go to waste.

1061
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,389
We should leave something
good for our next generation.

1062
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,318
Please. Think it over.

1063
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:51,792
Before it's too late. Thank you.

1064
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:57,530
This tournament was my dream.

1065
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,270
l had to give everything l had..

1066
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,366
..to get my own
government consent to this.

1067
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:06,906
And today, l'm being
explained its significance.

1068
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:11,712
Father.
- Yes?

1069
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,318
Can't anything be done now?

1070
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:16,647
There is.

1071
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,929
lf any one of them withdraws.

1072
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:39,370
Yes.

1073
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:44,577
Oh. Ms. lda.
- Hello.

1074
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:45,709
How come you're here?

1075
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,715
Anyway, you've been
recommended in abundance.

1076
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,452
lf God wills, you'll be
permanent by the end of this year.

1077
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:56,387
What's this?

1078
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,263
Resignation letter.

1079
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:02,463
This is not the place to resign.

1080
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,669
Even great people
have resigned here..

1081
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:07,331
..Mr. Sikander Hayaat.

1082
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:09,600
What's the meaning of this?

1083
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:13,241
That's the problem.
One who should know the meaning..

1084
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:16,316
..is standing here
like a spectator.

1085
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:20,253
Noor, if you think by
playing this match..

1086
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:23,255
..you're adding another
feather to Pakistan's cap..

1087
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,258
..then it's your
huge misunderstanding.

1088
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,385
Don't you dare talk to him
like this. He's my player.

1089
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:31,329
And don't you dare talk
to me in this way, Uncle.

1090
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:38,262
l'm no more your employee.
Look, Noor..

1091
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:40,264
..if you still want
to save your own..

1092
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,274
..and this country's
conscience from this blot..

1093
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:43,866
..then you should
withdraw from this match.

1094
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:46,242
Report yourself sick.

1095
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:49,242
Get your hands broken,
or your legs. Do anything.

1096
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,908
l said stop it and get away
from here. Let's go, Noor.

1097
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,849
You've ruined a family.

1098
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:57,389
Remember, you'll be cursed
in the name of humanity.

1099
01:34:57,491 --> 01:34:59,254
Jues get away from here.

1100
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:04,865
You're a very petty player, Noor.

1101
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:09,458
Just fear Him. No one's a
superior coach than Him.

1102
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:21,642
What are you brooding over?
Don't?

1103
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,446
Stop thinking.
You shouldn't think at all.

1104
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:27,782
You just have to fight.

1105
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:44,865
Sir.. Sir, please. Please.

1106
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,337
Minieser is coming.
Ask the minister.

1107
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,805
Sir, one question.
- Ask the minister.

1108
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,671
Would you please, sir..
- Sir.. Sir..- Ask the minister.

1109
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:51,301
Sir, please.
- Ask the minister.

1110
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:53,712
Sir. Sir. Just a short question.
- Come on.

1111
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,252
Best of luck,
Mr. Rao. Return as winners.

1112
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:05,253
You've already put a noose
of defeat around my neck.

1113
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,925
He's not incapable.And it was
his dream to play in your team.

1114
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:13,864
Then you should also think
about the person you dropped.

1115
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:18,735
No, no. He wasn't dropped.
He's injured. lnjured.

1116
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:21,532
That means you've already decided.

1117
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:29,307
Mr. Rao, your heart knows
that Gajanan is better than him.

1118
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:32,645
l'm not commenting
about Veerender Singh.

1119
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,580
Gajanan, comehere.

1120
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:38,389
Please take care of him, Mr. Rao.

1121
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:39,857
You're always there for that,
right, sir.- Yes, yes.

1122
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,257
Thank you.

1123
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:42,522
Best ofluck, dear.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1124
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,602
l'll leave kickboxing forever..

1125
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,670
..if l don't play up
to your expectations.

1126
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:52,800
l won't let you down.

1127
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:55,933
Just allow me to be
a part of the team.

1128
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:00,773
Let's do our best. Come on.

1129
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:19,596
The lndian kick boxing team,
along with the group of delegates..

1130
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,861
..arrived today at Lahore airport..

1131
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,664
..for the goodwill
kickboxing match..

1132
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:26,262
..to be held at Lahore
in the next few days.

1133
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:28,269
Special correspondent Mr. Jade..

1134
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:29,865
..reporting live
from Lahore airport.

1135
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:32,311
With the arrival of the
lndian kick boxing team..

1136
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,904
..the excitement among the
Pakistan people is already rising.

1137
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,381
So,what do the officials
have to say about this issue?

1138
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:41,318
Well, the things are still not
very clear regarding the issue.

1139
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:43,715
Also, there had been
a little furore..

1140
01:37:43,824 --> 01:37:46,588
..when the brother ofthe
deceased player Veerender Singh..

1141
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:47,718
..joined the team.

1142
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:50,929
Move, mister. Move, move.
Let us through.

1143
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:53,329
Mr. Veerender Singh, you'll
be fighting Noor Mohammed.

1144
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:54,924
ls it a mere coincidence?

1145
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,266
Do you think you didn't get
justice in the Kuala Lumpur case?

1146
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:01,671
Are you in Pakistan to
avenge your brother's death?

1147
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,437
Look, this is a goodwill
match and they're our guests.

1148
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:06,775
At least think about the
dignity of our country.

1149
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,246
Mr. Rao, the rumours
are doing the rounds..

1150
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:10,249
..that you can even bring
hockey and Kabaddi players..

1151
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:12,251
..in kickboxing.

1152
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,385
Make way. Make way.

1153
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:15,921
No comments.
- Let them through.

1154
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,919
lt is now a matter of a few days..

1155
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:22,257
..that will determine the
fate of the two countries..

1156
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:24,923
..and the noble
endeavours towards the peace process.

1157
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,248
l called you many times.

1158
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:26,325
l even spokewith Neela. But..
you never replied.

1159
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,324
l was about to come here myself.

1160
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:32,456
So, did you come and meet me?

1161
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,659
l was practicing.

1162
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,672
Practice doesn't go on
for 24hours, Veeru?

1163
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:44,373
You'll feel better if you tell me.

1164
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,308
l don't have anything to tell.

1165
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:54,846
You do. What's going to
happen in tomorrow's match?

1166
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:57,654
What happens in a match, lda?

1167
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,391
You won't be doing what
usually happens, right?

1168
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:05,658
Only l know what l'm going to do.

1169
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:08,257
Then, why can't l know about it?

1170
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:12,929
Can we talk after tomorrow?

1171
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,735
Why shouldn't we talk
about tomorrow?

1172
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:18,238
Just leave me alone.

1173
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:27,844
You've changed, Veeru.

1174
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:31,318
lt's better this way, isn't it?
You take care of your own life.

1175
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,328
But my life is not
separate from yours.

1176
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:37,321
Just get out of my life.

1177
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:46,670
You can't bring
Dheerender back by killing Noor.

1178
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,508
He was my brother.
- He meant a lot to many.

1179
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:57,312
Fire of revenge burns not just
in one house but the whole city.

1180
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,783
l don't care about
the house or thecity.

1181
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:04,651
You have to, Veeru. You have to.

1182
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:06,458
These issues don't ever end.

1183
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:08,591
Tomorrow, someone
will come to kill you.

1184
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:13,659
More sobs will be heard.
Then, l'll cry. Like Neela.

1185
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:44,256
And now let us take you to Pakistan
where, a little while from now..

1186
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:47,265
..the Quaid-e-Azam Goodwill
Kickboxing Tournament..

1187
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:50,336

Lahore's Gaddafi stadium.

1190
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:56,934
..who had very recently
come to lndia on a tour.

1191
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:59,711
This tournament has been a topic
of discussion for many reasons.

1192
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:44,256
Pakistan will win!
Pakistan will win!

1193
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:48,259
Pakistan will win!

1197
01:43:18,559 --> 01:43:20,527
From Gaddafi Stadium,

match is part of the ongoing effort..

1202
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:37,776
..to improve the relationship
between the two countries.

1203
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,368
Hello.

1204
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,304
Hello.
- Hello.

1205
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:52,375
Hello.

1206
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:11,336
Do you think that you'll be
victorious here in Lahore?

1207
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:14,873
Are you still thinking
about winning and losing?

1208
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:20,240
Let me explain the
rules and regulations..

1209

..to be followed in the tournament.

1210

The two teams will be
playing five matches.

1211
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:27,251
Whichever team gets more
wins and more points..

1212
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:29,254
..will be entitled to lift..

1213
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,382
..the trophy of this
Quaid-e-Azam tournament.

1214
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:35,855
Let him get tired.

1215
01:45:36,563 --> 01:45:37,587
Come on. Let's go.

1216
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:38,855
All the best, Jasbir.

1217

Best of luck, Qasim.

1218
01:45:44,037 --> 01:45:46,597
The treatment of tuberculosis
is not tomorrow but today.

1219
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,714
And with this,
the tournament is about to start.

and lndia's Jasbir Singh.

1222
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:04,849
Qasim Ali takes on Jasbir
Singh in an aggressive manner.

1223
01:46:13,433 --> 01:46:17,267
1. 2. 3.
- Yes!

1224
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:25,241
And Pakistan gets its first win.

1225
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:29,245
Very good. Very good, my boy.

1226
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:33,783
You're next.

This is Pakistan's
second consecutive win.

1234
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:10,721
This is the second
successive loss for lndia..

1235
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:12,985
..and Pakistan is
leading by two matches.

1239
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:30,968
..team lndia will have to go back
empty-handed with a crushing defeat.

1240
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:34,241
No!

1241
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:43,849

Well done!

1243
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:54,398
Stop! Stop! Go to your corners.

1244
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:00,666
lt should be 6/7..

1245
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:13,309
What are the judges doing?

1246
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:18,517
Both sides are tense. Everyone
seems to be holding their breath.

1247
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:20,253
Winner!

1248
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,850
Yes!
- Yes!

1249
01:48:24,564 --> 01:48:26,862
And Almino Pereira
has won the match.

1250
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,268
And now with this, lndia gets its
first victory in this Championship.

1251
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:43,648
With Almino Pereira's win,
lndia is back into the tournament.

1252
01:48:44,017 --> 01:48:45,712
Rejoicing among the lndians..

1253
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:50,256
And now the points are
lndia 9 and Pakistan 15.

1254
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:51,790
But lndia is still in the
more difficult position.

1255
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:54,160
The fourth round will be
between Gajanan Oinam of lndia..

1256
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:58,597
The fourth round will be
between Gajanan Oinam of lndia..

1257
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:01,258
..and Sohail Raza of Pakiesan.

1258
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:31,258
Raza, what..

1259
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:36,265
Go to your corner.
- Get up!

1260
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:39,272
So far,this fight between
Gajanan Oinam and Sohail Raza..

1261
01:49:39,372 --> 01:49:41,272
..has proved to be the..

1262
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:43,274
..most interesting
match of this tournament..

1263
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:47,238
..and both the teams are expecting
their players to win this match.

1264
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:50,440
Are you okay? Start!

1265
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:04,386
Raza, don't lose this opportunity.

1266
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:14,330
That's the way, Gajanan. Good.
Good, very good.

1267
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:16,940
Sponge him. We've
already won two fights.

1268
01:50:17,043 --> 01:50:19,238
lf you win the third one,
we'll win the tournament.

1269
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,239
Keep the same pace.
You can knock him out.

1270
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:24,909
His left hand is weak.
Keep your focus on that.

1271
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:26,912
l know you can do it. Got it?

1272
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,653
Only your victory can bring
us back in this tournament.

1273
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:31,849
You got that? Come on, do it.

1274
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,919
Come on, get ready. Move.

1275
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,587
Keep it up. Come on, come on!

1276
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:46,272
Gajanan is trying his level
bees to win this match for lndia.

1277
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,941
lf lndia wants to
win this tournament..

1278
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:52,910
..then they have to win
both the matches for sure.

1279
01:50:53,546 --> 01:50:54,570
Push him away.

1280
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:58,908
Stop! Stop!

1281
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:13,856
Come on!

1282
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:33,443
Yes!

1283
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,248
Go back.

1284
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:40,450
Come on, he's hurt!

1285
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:47,258
Gajanan Oinam has
been seriously injured..

1286
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,335
..and is being
taken out of the ring.

1287
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:54,003
The fight was still ongoing
and Gajanan was leading so far.

1288
01:51:56,576 --> 01:51:57,565
lt's okay, Gajanan.

1289
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:08,253
Only 30 seconds remain
for the match to get over..

1290
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:11,321
..and if Gajanan
doesn't enter the ring soon..

1291
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:12,982
..he'll be considered knocked-out..

1292
01:52:13,293 --> 01:52:15,454
..and Pakistan will
win this tournament.

1293
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:20,392
You have two minutes to
decide whether to continue or not.

1294
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:21,991
All right, all right.

1295
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:28,269
His shoulder has been
dislocated and is very serious.

1296
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:30,440
Sir, no.
- He must be taken to the hospital.

1297
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:34,445
Sir, please don't withdraw
from the match! Sir.. no, sir!

1298
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:37,243
Look at your shoulder.
- Sir.. no, sir!

1299
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,443
Now if l withdraw..

1300
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:42,453
..winning on Pakistan's
soil will remain a dream.

1301
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,657
Please, sir. l won't
let you down, l'll do it.

1302
01:52:48,628 --> 01:52:50,391
lt's over, Gajanan.
- No! No, sir!

1303
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,922
He can't come back now.

1304
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:14,253
Now what should this be called?
lnnocence or passion?

1305
01:53:14,554 --> 01:53:17,580
To play for your country
is the greatest of emotions.

1306
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:21,918
Gajanan is back in the ring
despite being injured.- Start!

1307
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:33,604
Yes! Yes!
- No! - Yes! Yes!

1308
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:40,236
Wait! 1. 2. 3. 4.

1309
01:53:40,613 --> 01:53:46,779
Yes! You've done it!
- 6. 7. 8.

1310
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:50,523
9. 10. Over!

1311
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:56,459
Gajanan has won.
lt's a very big victory for lndia.

1312
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:03,593
After winning two matches each..

1313
01:54:03,703 --> 01:54:05,534
..both Pakistan and
lndia are in equal position.

1314
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:12,310
l'm proud of you, my boy!
You're a young tiger! A tiger!

1315
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:14,837
You should have hit
him on the shoulder.

1316
01:54:15,815 --> 01:54:16,839
Why didn't you just
hit him on theshoulder?

1317
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:19,444
You were playing slow.
What else do you expect?

1318
01:54:22,956 --> 01:54:25,584
And now, all eyes are
set on the fifth match.

1319
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:29,796
Veeru, remember he
isn't just Noor Mohammed.

1320
01:54:29,796 --> 01:54:33,323
Veeru, remember he
isn't just Noor Mohammed.

1321
01:54:33,633 --> 01:54:35,260
He's just your opponent.

1322
01:54:36,035 --> 01:54:40,267
But how can l forget
that he's not just..

1323
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:44,969
..an opponent, sir?
He's also Noor Mohammed.

1324
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:51,578
Noor, you know the
reason why he has come here.

1325
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:54,776
But only you must win.

1326
01:55:23,883 --> 01:55:25,908
Red corner, blue corner.. start!

1327
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:51,234
That.. This is foul!

1328
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:54,977
Don't do that!

1329
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:00,252
Stop! Stop! Go back.

1330
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:11,925
Come on, Veeru! Come on!

1331
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,323
Are you okay?

1332
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,328
Ready?. Start!

1333
01:56:35,288 --> 01:56:40,248
Stop! Stop! Leave him!
Go back! Go back.

1334
01:56:41,694 --> 01:56:42,718
Are you all right?

1335
01:56:42,962 --> 01:56:44,862
Get up, get up. Noor.

1336
01:57:02,281 --> 01:57:04,442
Despite several
warnings from the referee..

1337
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:07,246
..Veerender Singh is
unable to control his anger.

1338
01:57:07,553 --> 01:57:10,522
lf he persists, then
points may be deducted.

1339
01:57:11,557 --> 01:57:14,253
Stop! Stop!

1340
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,788
That fool will cos tus points!

1341
01:57:17,296 --> 01:57:19,321
Leave him! Leave him! Stop!

1342
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:41,320
You're playing perfectly.
Take advantage of his anger.

1343
01:57:41,487 --> 01:57:45,651
What are you doing? He doesn't
need to even try for a win.

1344
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:47,450
You're making your team lose.

1345
01:57:47,627 --> 01:57:50,653
Make him play foul.
He has already received a warning.

1346
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:51,990
Next time, his
points will be deducted.

1347
01:57:53,032 --> 01:57:55,865
lf you keep making fouls,
you'll soon be disqualified.

1348
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:58,794
Come on now.

1349
01:58:17,023 --> 01:58:18,251
He's doing well. He's doing well.

1350
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:19,582
Get up! Get up!

1351
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,268
Yes! Come on!

1352
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,580
No! No!

1353
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:59,663
Stop! Stop! Go to your corners! Go!

1354
01:59:06,839 --> 01:59:07,863
You wretch!

1355
01:59:10,376 --> 01:59:11,365
You wretch!

1356
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:13,240
Leave him. Listen to me. Leave him..

1357
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,510
Both of you will be disqualified!
Leave him!

1358
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:18,849
Please stop them. Somebody..

1359
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:23,312
You wretch!

1360
01:59:25,558 --> 01:59:26,582
You rogue!

1361
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:39,394
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1362
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:40,529
He was punching under the belt.

1363
01:59:40,773 --> 01:59:42,001
l also gave him a
Lahore punch. That wretch!

1364
01:59:42,308 --> 01:59:44,367
You're not going to do anything.
Let him do it.

1365
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:49,577
Wipe the blood.. and cover
the eyes. Apply some Vaseline.

1366
01:59:50,283 --> 01:59:53,252
Our goal is just winning.
Let him make a mistake.

1367
01:59:53,553 --> 01:59:54,577
We'll win just like that.

1368
01:59:56,556 --> 01:59:57,580
Go. Come on.

1369
01:59:58,891 --> 02:00:01,257
l had assumed that
there is a difference..

1370
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:04,796
..between my player
and a player like Noor.

1371
02:00:04,964 --> 02:00:06,261
But if you have
a different opinion..

1372
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:07,923
..then l have
nothing else to tell you.

1373
02:00:09,902 --> 02:00:11,870
This is the last and the
final warning for you.

1374
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:13,596
Next time, you will be disqualified.

1375
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:19,301
Start!

1376
02:00:23,282 --> 02:00:24,306
Yes!

1377
02:00:24,884 --> 02:00:29,514
1. 2. 3. 4. 5..

1378
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:34,718
Come on!

1379
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:36,585
Are you okay?

1380
02:00:37,496 --> 02:00:38,520
Start!

1381
02:01:01,554 --> 02:01:02,578
That's it. Keep it up, Noor.

1382
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:18,798
Yes! Very good!

1383
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:23,867
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

1384
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:28,242
You want to continue? Okay. Start!

1385
02:04:13,612 --> 02:04:14,772
'Hey, little brother..'

1386
02:04:15,948 --> 02:04:16,972
'..it's sport.'

1387
02:04:17,817 --> 02:04:18,841
'Not war.'

1388
02:05:09,435 --> 02:05:13,337
Sir,we've won!

1389
02:06:06,692 --> 02:06:10,253
Veeru, what you've won
today is far greater..

1390
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:14,856
..than any fight,
medal or tournament.

1391
02:06:16,435 --> 02:06:18,665
Today, you've
conquered everyone's hearts.

1392
02:06:20,306 --> 02:06:23,605
l'm proud of you.
l'm very proud of you.

1393
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:42,328
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1394
02:06:42,328 --> 02:06:43,590
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1395
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:48,597
Welcome to the grand finale of the
Quaid-e-Azam Kickboxing Tournament..

1396
02:06:49,034 --> 02:06:52,265
..which has been a high-voltage

1409
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:20,253
Until now, l've been
fighting for victory..

1410
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,256
..because l have been trained
to think that my victory..

1411
02:08:24,363 --> 02:08:27,730
..was entwined with
my country's victory.

1412
02:08:29,568 --> 02:08:34,267
But today, l've realised
that a nation's victory..

1413
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:39,834
..is the victory
that you've won today.

1414
02:08:45,884 --> 02:08:48,250
No victory or loss can
be more important than..

1415
02:08:48,353 --> 02:08:50,981
..the life of a human being.

1416
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:58,795
Your brother was not
only a great sportsman..

1417
02:09:00,699 --> 02:09:02,257
..but also a fine human being.

1418
02:09:05,904 --> 02:09:09,863
Today, l truly regret his demise.

1419
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:13,241
l'm sorry.

1420
02:09:15,614 --> 02:09:16,638
l'm sorry.

1421
02:09:29,294 --> 02:09:30,318
l'm sorry.

1422
02:10:19,278 --> 02:10:22,839
Mr. Rao, you've truly won  over Lahore.

1423
02:10:31,423 --> 02:10:32,856
Mr. Sinha..

1424
02:10:32,958 --> 02:10:37,986
..we've always created barriers
between Lahore and Amritsar.

1425
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,267
But today, l can see those
barriers tumbling down.

1426
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:57,646
This is a historic moment.
What else can we say of it?
