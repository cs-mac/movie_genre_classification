1
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:12,758
<i>I am Ghost Agent K.</i>

2
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,678
<i>A shadow without a name or reputation.</i>

3
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:18,889
<i>A lovers tactic should be open</i>

4
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,076
<i>and blatant.</i>

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,727
<i>I'm considering taking you up
on your offer.</i>

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,955
<i>Robert Yoon.</i>

7
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:27,332
Do you know Agent Y?

8
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:28,356
<i>Traitors?</i>

9
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,878
<i>Our side isn't always on our side.</i>

10
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,696
<i>Ghost Agent K.</i>

11
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:35,531
<i>Hand him over to me.</i>

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,825
<i>Whose side are you on?</i>

13
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,285
I took care of Agent K myself.

14
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,563
I told you my condition
was to give him to the Russians.

15
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,108
Yes.

16
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,546
They are no match for K.

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,280
I eliminated the risk for failure

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,699
and chose the most fail-safe method.

19
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,553
<i>I met your condition,</i>

20
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:22,786
so please keep your promise.

21
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:25,581
I will be waiting for your call.

22
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,397
Episode 12

23
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:12,289
You should have gone to the hospital.
Why would you come here?

24
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,881
Ghost agents...

25
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:26,345
are more trustworthy than doctors
when it comes to gunshot wounds.

26
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:27,930
Do you trust me?

27
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
If you are gone,

28
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:36,688
I can disappear for good.

29
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,815
You can't kill me.

30
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,944
You still have to take...

31
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:45,404
revenge.

32
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,379
He isn't here either.

33
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:13,785
Un-gwang.

34
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,579
<i>Is Seol-woo with you by any chance?</i>

35
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:17,604
Guard Kim?

36
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:18,938
No, he isn't.

37
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:23,169
We were supposed to meet,
but I can't reach him.

38
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:26,697
He went to meet people on our side.
Maybe the discussion is running long.

39
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:28,490
Maybe.

40
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:31,493
He wouldn't have skipped town
to avoid repaying my $5,000,000.

41
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:34,745
No, right?

42
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:35,973
No.

43
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,124
No way.

44
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,959
Wait.

45
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,503
Why are you two meeting?

46
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:43,087
What?

47
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,255
Well...

48
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,527
We were supposed to meet briefly.

49
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:48,903
At this hour? Alone?

50
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,530
Just the two of you alone?

51
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:53,533
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- At his studio.

52
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:55,517
I came because I was worried,

53
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,412
and he isn't here either.

54
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm sure he will call soon.

55
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:02,065
He won't disappear
without telling us again.

56
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,650
Okay.

57
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:06,862
I'm sure everything's okay.

58
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:43,940
The bullet didn't hit any bones or organs
and went right through.

59
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,919
Whoever it was that shot you,
you were lucky.

60
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:47,944
No.

61
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,407
It means he has excellent aim.

62
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,537
Was it someone on your side?

63
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,526
It means he wants me to disappear.

64
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:06,922
The way they treat
Ghost agents hasn't changed.

65
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,163
They use you when they need you,
and they throw you away.

66
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,679
- Selfish bastards.
- Is that why...

67
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:18,934
you chose betrayal?

68
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,980
A country that uses you
and discards you is meaningless.

69
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:27,567
I simply chose my family...

70
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,946
over a backstabbing country.

71
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,074
Now,

72
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,203
you must choose too.

73
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:49,798
Are you working late?

74
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,469
- Yes. When did you get out?
- A few hours ago.

75
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:56,930
Goodness.

76
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,182
I thought you would be waiting
at the gate.

77
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,808
Were you busy?

78
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:02,811
Yes, a little.

79
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:06,940
Do you know where K is?

80
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,820
That punk isn't at his studio
and isn't taking my calls.

81
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,948
K left.

82
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,991
Where to?

83
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,701
Is he on a mission?

84
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,299
The wood carving mission has been stopped.

85
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,081
So K left as well.

86
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:25,542
The mission was stopped.

87
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:30,088
Still, that punk. How could he leave
without saying goodbye?

88
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:32,424
I guess he never did, to begin with.

89
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,511
Anyway, does that mean you've found
the third wood carving?

90
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,098
- I will, by tomorrow.
- Okay.

91
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:44,060
Things progressed real quick
while I was away.

92
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,814
- What happened?
- I will tell you once it's been completed.

93
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:49,857
You must be tired.

94
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,192
Go get some rest.

95
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,110
Mr. Jang.

96
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:01,286
Who's the traitor that ratted out Agent Y?

97
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,289
- Did you find out?
- Not yet.

98
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:09,920
But we should be able to find out
once the wood carving mission is complete.

99
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,342
So, you still don't know anything.

100
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,509
Get some rest.

101
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,188
Mr. Jang knows the mole
who betrayed Agent Y. K.

102
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:35,570
<i>Mr. Jang knows the mole
who betrayed Agent Y.</i>

103
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,147
Seol-woo.

104
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,735
What happened to you?

105
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:17,848
You weren't answering your phone.

106
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,676
Did you wait for me?

107
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,577
What the hell? I was worried.

108
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,039
Did something happen?

109
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,291
Goodness.

110
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:36,047
You're burning up.

111
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,215
Let's go to the hospital.

112
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
No.

113
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:43,763
No hospitals.

114
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:01,800
You're up.

115
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:04,094
Do you feel okay?

116
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,181
You slept for three days straight.

117
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,600
Have some porridge.

118
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,870
- Isn't this movie so sad?
- <i>My brother...</i>

119
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,373
At the end, the man...

120
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,999
Well.

121
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,419
Okay. No spoilers.

122
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,591
But the scene where they meet again
at the end

123
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,427
is just too sad.

124
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,998
I'm glad you've finally recovered.

125
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:00,733
Isn't it nice being out again?

126
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,280
Do you know something?
We did all the dates.

127
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:09,242
We ate together, watched a movie,
and had tea.

128
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:19,419
But why is this place so empty?

129
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:36,078
Are you okay?

130
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:38,248
Are you awake?

131
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,125
You had such a high fever.

132
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,169
What happened?

133
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:47,924
You went to see someone on our side.
Why did you end up like this?

134
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:53,096
What happened,
that you can't even go to the hospital?

135
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:07,860
It's such a relief that you're safe.

136
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,321
What is a relief?

137
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,783
How is this a relief?

138
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:18,329
Thank you

139
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,874
for staying by my side.

140
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,470
You said you wouldn't disappear
without saying anything again.

141
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,265
Don't worry.

142
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:39,683
I will keep my promise.

143
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:51,654
I won't die

144
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,158
without your permission.

145
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:32,921
<i>Good job last night.</i>

146
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,281
I like how well you handle things.

147
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:38,283
Let's make the trade.

148
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:46,226
I like how sensible you are
and don't try to flatter or brag.

149
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,670
Did you obtain the third key?

150
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,009
Let's finish this up.

151
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:21,303
<i>The subject of the deal in exchange</i>

152
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,662
for the third wood carving...

153
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,208
- was me.
- Goodness.

154
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,169
So, who shot you?

155
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:33,506
Mr. Jang shot me.

156
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,926
What kind of a mission involves
shooting one of your own?

157
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:41,264
There are plenty of ways
to fake your death.

158
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,475
He chose the most fail-proof method,

159
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,187
since it didn't matter if I really died.

160
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,233
A means to obtain a goal.

161
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,903
A card you can use and discard

162
00:17:58,489 --> 00:17:59,490
as needed.

163
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:08,791
Hello there.

164
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,086
Well, where is the CEO's car?

165
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,482
Is that it over there?

166
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:16,799
Is that his car?

167
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,550
Why?

168
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,804
I was told to pay special attention
to the area around it.

169
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:24,474
It was an order from above,
so I have to do it.

170
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:27,726
Yes, that's the car.

171
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:31,272
Is it? Okay. Thank you.
Keep up the good work.

172
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:34,692
Hello.

173
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,201
I have the coordinates.

174
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:35,836
It's in Sugeumsan.

175
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:40,901
Sugeumsan

176
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,678
"Songsan Produce Warehouse."

177
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,537
Dong-hyun Lee was acquitted
and released yesterday.

178
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,580
What? Why so suddenly?

179
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:55,857
The prosecutor's office accepted

180
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,835
the evidence submitted
by Mr. Jang from the NIS.

181
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,796
With all the people we greased up above,
they couldn't stop that?

182
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,115
Something is up with those people.

183
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,118
Hold on. What's going on?

184
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:10,997
That couldn't happen unless Mr. Mo
from Songsan...

185
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,585
Are you saying Mr. Mo betrayed me?

186
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,647
What has he been up to?

187
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:22,860
He had a secret meeting last night
with Chairman Victor from Russia.

188
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,302
Chairman Victor?

189
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:30,725
That means he dealt with him
to get the third wood carving.

190
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,270
But that punk Mr. Mo didn't even call me?

191
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:44,488
Does this mean
you've really been thrown away?

192
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:49,243
Regardless of me,
you will get your $5,000,000...

193
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:53,413
Does it hurt?

194
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:55,457
Goodness.

195
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,294
You really don't need to go
to the hospital?

196
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,378
I'm fine.

197
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:02,881
No.

198
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:04,716
You should lie down.

199
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:06,510
I'm really okay.

200
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:08,304
Careful.

201
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,269
Goodness.

202
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:20,358
I'm really okay.

203
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:25,154
I will somehow take care
of the $5,000,000.

204
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:29,575
Whatever.

205
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:32,288
Don't think about anything
for now and just rest.

206
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:35,787
You need to live if you're going to
pay me back or get revenge or something.

207
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:37,582
Get better first.

208
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:40,795
Okay.

209
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:44,674
I'll say both of you are on vacation.

210
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,402
Me too?

211
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:50,388
Then what? Should I,
the Korean star, nurse him?

212
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,350
You take care of him in my place.

213
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Okay.

214
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,440
I said, "in my place."

215
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,044
Do only things you can do with me.

216
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:07,196
No intimate stuff, got it?

217
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:10,616
Come on. Seriously, Un-gwang.

218
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,252
Are you okay?

219
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:25,088
Yes.

220
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:13,929
Sugeumsan

221
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Hello?

222
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:53,969
This is Dong-hyun Lee.

223
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:11,713
Sugeumsan

224
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,989
This is definitely the location.

225
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,159
Check it.

226
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,838
There is a passageway going down!

227
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:34,218
Damn it. He hid it so well.

228
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:43,811
<i>Ghost Agent K.</i>

229
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:45,562
<i>It's time for you</i>

230
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,313
to rest.

231
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:53,487
<i>Stay out of it and stand by.</i>

232
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:55,131
<i>It's an order.</i>

233
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,592
I'm saying we should wait
because we can't do anything right now.

234
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:59,994
You're not the only agent with NIS.

235
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,829
We will need a new plan.

236
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,623
- The third wood carving...
- We will have it soon.

237
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,127
<i>- Then we should hurry...
- Leave the third wood carving to me.</i>

238
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:11,130
Maintain your fake identity
and stay under the radar.

239
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:14,758
<i>The situation is bad,
but hang in there a while longer.</i>

240
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,987
It will all be over soon.

241
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:19,388
Dong-hyun will be out soon.

242
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,974
<i>It's almost over.</i>

243
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:25,352
We will get the third wood carving soon.

244
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,647
<i>Give me the first two keys.</i>

245
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:30,917
Was I the subject of the deal?

246
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,401
<i>I repeat.</i>

247
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:34,987
The wood carving mission is over.

248
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:41,285
<i>Will our side get the third key
with the two keys I gave you,</i>

249
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,040
<i>or will Seung-jae Mo get these two keys?</i>

250
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,251
<i>Whose side are you on?</i>

251
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:22,575
Wait upstairs.

252
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:39,653
<i>Every Monday,</i>

253
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,365
<i>Yoon met with Mr. Jang here.</i>

254
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,428
November 2004, December 2004
April 2005, May 2005

255
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:48,454
June 2007
February 2008, March 2008.

256
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:54,334
Impressive.

257
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:59,214
Chairman Byung-do Mo's slush fund
is worth a trillion won.

258
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,509
This is my money
that I would have had already,

259
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,722
if my grandfather had trusted me
with the key.

260
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:12,561
Because I am the king.

261
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,150
Good job.

262
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:27,385
What do you want to do with this money?

263
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,660
What would I do with the money?

264
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,161
I'm going to spend it.

265
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,122
I will spend it to change the world.

266
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,503
A world in which one
who spends money feels rewarded.

267
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:41,548
A world in which the value of money
is truly appreciated.

268
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,718
A world in which one is judged by money.

269
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,014
Isn't that what capitalism is about?

270
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,182
I like you.

271
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,139
Work with me until the end.

272
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,749
What you are looking for is right there.

273
00:29:01,193 --> 00:29:04,029
The dirty records my grandfather
had left behind.

274
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:27,094
<i>But they left empty-handed,</i>

275
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:30,973
<i>and they never saw Agent Y again.</i>

276
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,940
<i>Did you see Agent Y again, Father?</i>

277
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:46,756
He said what was found was not everything.

278
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,826
Did he say anything else
about what was not found?

279
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:54,455
If it is the Lord's will,

280
00:29:55,998 --> 00:29:58,208
He will lead you to the right path.

281
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,335
Holy bible

282
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:04,589
<i>The path</i>

283
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:07,509
is in the Word.

284
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,868
<i>"For God does speak - now one way,"</i>

285
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:35,496
<i>now another,</i>

286
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:40,918
<i>"though no one perceives it."</i>

287
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,423
Some tapes are missing.

288
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:56,350
Which tapes are missing?

289
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,019
Goodness. What's missing now?

290
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,396
I will look for them.

291
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:09,738
Confiscation warrant

292
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:12,157
It's a confiscation warrant.

293
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:16,161
Hi, friend. What are you doing here?

294
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,765
A confiscation warrant?

295
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,808
What nonsense is that?
This is my land and my money.

296
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,668
What you just said?

297
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:25,480
You just admitted that this is all yours.

298
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,232
It clearly looks like illegal funds.

299
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:28,256
Mr. Jang.

300
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,670
What are you trying to pull?

301
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,303
Is this why you wanted to release him?

302
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:36,616
Mr. Lee. This is an NIS mission.

303
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,018
Sure. If you want to talk,
you can do it at the Prosecutor's Office.

304
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:43,814
NIS or whatnot, I will arrest you,
if you obstruct justice.

305
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:45,416
Okay.

306
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,943
One civil servant. One civilian.

307
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:52,531
This is my jurisdiction now,
so please leave.

308
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,827
Look here.

309
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,793
Do you think you can defeat me?

310
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,632
If you change your mind,
today may be the luckiest day

311
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:12,426
of your life.

312
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,226
Take a few of the items you want and go.

313
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,648
Well, thank you for the offer,

314
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,401
but rather than a few items,

315
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,364
I'll just take everything,
as the warrant provides.

316
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,076
Also,

317
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,624
you were caught bribing a public official.

318
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:45,374
If you please.

319
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:53,069
You are under arrest for attempting
to bribe a public official.

320
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:02,017
Take him away.

321
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:12,361
It really is my lucky day!

322
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,448
Dong-hyun, even if you do this...

323
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:18,742
You asshole.

324
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,745
If you have something to say,
say it at the Prosecutor's Office.

325
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,202
When did you come?

326
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,038
Just now.

327
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:50,417
Why are you sleeping here like this?

328
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,146
This is more comfortable.

329
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,337
No way.

330
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:56,757
How is the sofa more comfortable?

331
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:07,350
Well,

332
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:10,437
even at my place,
you slept on the sofa, sitting up.

333
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:13,023
Do you really find it more comfortable?

334
00:35:16,526 --> 00:35:18,153
I can sleep without dreaming.

335
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:30,957
What's with this hand?

336
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,043
Well,

337
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,464
can't I touch you
whenever I get the chance?

338
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:45,346
Well,

339
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:49,142
it's my healing hand.

340
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:54,481
My grandfather did this for me, saying,
"Healing hands," whenever I was sick.

341
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,709
We will get in trouble
if Un-gwang finds out.

342
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,547
During missions, there are times when
you need to deceive your colleagues.

343
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,177
Are we continuing the lovers tactic?

344
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,265
Until you end it.

345
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:23,111
Interrogation in process

346
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:30,177
<i>Why was a senior manager from the NIS
in Songsan's slush fund storage room?</i>

347
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,847
It's of national security,
so I cannot say.

348
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,915
I see. National security.

349
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,922
Then what is your relationship
with Seung-jae Mo?

350
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:43,544
Did he give you allowances?

351
00:37:43,882 --> 00:37:45,091
It's of national security.

352
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:48,487
Under the Act of the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Economic Crime,

353
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,513
embezzlement, breach of duty
and accounting fraud.

354
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,159
Also, violation of Foreign Exchange Law,

355
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:56,728
violation Cultural Protection Policy,
tax evasion and offering a bribe.

356
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:58,313
Hey,

357
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:00,523
how befitting of the size of Songsan.

358
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:03,860
The charges are quite diverse.

359
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,028
Yes.

360
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:08,883
Take it from someone who was in jail.

361
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:10,492
Bring your long johns.

362
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:13,161
The jail is very cold.

363
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,207
Okay.

364
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,627
Let me tell you what will happen.

365
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:22,855
The phone will ring.

366
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,631
You will answer the phone.

367
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:28,510
You will apologize profusely
and I shall leave.

368
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:33,264
Is that so?

369
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:36,893
Well...

370
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,073
Hello, Chief.

371
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,618
Yes, he is with me now.

372
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:56,663
We have more than enough evidence.

373
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:58,915
He is quite feisty.

374
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:02,127
There shouldn't be any health problems
in serving time...

375
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes.

376
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:07,464
Yes.

377
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,593
I understand, sir,

378
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:14,848
but this call is being recorded.

379
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:18,435
Are you okay with what you just said?

380
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
He hung up.

381
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:29,978
I'm busy. Why is he calling...

382
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:41,475
- Who are you?
- I'm Songsan's counsel.

383
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:43,209
She is his wife.

384
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:48,131
Counsel may sit.
His wife can visit him in jail.

385
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:52,052
You can't just come in here like this.

386
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:02,395
What happened today was a joint project
between the NIS and Songsan.

387
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,749
Excuse me?

388
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:08,044
Songsan was going to provide NIS
with the tapes on the slush fund

389
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:09,694
that Chairman Byung-do Mo set up.

390
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,740
The slush fund was going to be
donated to the society.

391
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:18,763
This is the project plan
for Make Songsan Upstanding.

392
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:20,914
Make songsan upstanding

393
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,919
Check with the NIS agent who was with him.

394
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:33,426
Is there a hidden motive for treating
a businessman cooperating with the NIS

395
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:35,887
in such a manner?

396
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:49,943
<i>They opened
Chairman Mo's secret storage room,</i>

397
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:52,505
but the prosecutor raided them?

398
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,216
They're donating the slush fund
to the society

399
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,408
and giving the tapes to the prosecutor.

400
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:03,456
He will place all the guilt
on the late Chairman Mo, is that it?

401
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,852
Whom do they have in NIS?

402
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:08,562
It was confirmed to be Tae-ho Jang.

403
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:10,046
Tae-ho Jang?

404
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:15,385
That moron teamed up with Mr. Mo?

405
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,847
I don't like how things are going.

406
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,267
Get more boys on Mr. Mo
and find out what you can.

407
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,819
A joint project between Songsan's CEO
Seung-jae Mo and the NIS?

408
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:34,486
Is that right?

409
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:36,990
Are you saying it is correct, Mr. Jang?

410
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:42,537
You expect me of all people,
the one in charge of the mission,

411
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:44,473
to believe you?

412
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:48,769
I will give you the tapes of Chairman Mo
bribing officials, so investigate them.

413
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:49,793
Drop the act!

414
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:54,608
What did you first say to me
about this mission?

415
00:41:54,632 --> 00:41:58,553
I said let's find Songsan's slush fund
source and eliminate the Baek Infantry!

416
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:04,684
- That mission is still in progress.
- What about Seung-jae Mo?

417
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:06,811
Do you just want to let him go?

418
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,482
Forfeiting Seung-jae Mo
is the second best option.

419
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:12,941
Plan B.

420
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,738
You investigate the bribes
thoroughly as a prosecutor.

421
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,699
I will wipe out the Baek Infantry
within NIS.

422
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,451
What about K?

423
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:28,708
K didn't just simply disappear, did he?

424
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:37,342
If by chance he is alive,
tell him that K is dead.

425
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,668
You said you wanted to watch a movie.

426
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,400
I don't watch movies.

427
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,880
- Why not?
- I like dramas.

428
00:42:57,904 --> 00:42:59,006
<i>I'm going to go with him.</i>

429
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,698
Dramas are much longer.

430
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,326
<i>Would you like to choose another one?</i>

431
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,703
Is it because you want to spend
more time with me?

432
00:43:07,914 --> 00:43:12,001
Once this one ends, we should watch
one with 50 episodes.

433
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:14,044
Okay.

434
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,966
We can eat instant noodles, watch dramas,

435
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,467
and have some drinks.

436
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:23,721
No drinking. You're not well.

437
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,479
No?

438
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,233
What?

439
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:38,027
Did "drinking" mean...

440
00:43:41,614 --> 00:43:43,324
drinking me in?

441
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:51,248
Really?

442
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:54,459
Again?

443
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:07,015
<i>Are you back? Are you okay?</i>

444
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,233
Do-ha?

445
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:21,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

446
00:44:23,823 --> 00:44:24,991
Hey.

447
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:29,746
What were you doing there?

448
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:31,816
- Watching a drama.
- Nursing him.

449
00:44:36,627 --> 00:44:38,067
- I was hurt...
- Watching a drama...

450
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:41,131
You were hurt,

451
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:44,427
so you watched a drama.

452
00:44:49,682 --> 00:44:52,351
Did you get my secret message?

453
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:56,679
- What about the mission?
- Shut up and relax your eyes.

454
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:03,279
First, explain why Do-ha is here
in your secret hideout.

455
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,453
The bullet wound...

456
00:45:11,913 --> 00:45:12,913
It hurts.

457
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:18,669
Really? Goodness.

458
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,590
You should lie down and rest.

459
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:25,527
- I think I should.
- Okay.

460
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:26,761
Did Mr. Jang shoot you?

461
00:45:27,553 --> 00:45:28,638
Goodness.

462
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,183
Do-ha.

463
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,536
You should go home today.

464
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,603
Okay.

465
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,208
Then I'll let you two talk.

466
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:41,317
I will be back in the morning.

467
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,163
What?

468
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,774
You went to Plan B
for the wood carving mission?

469
00:46:03,798 --> 00:46:07,718
Dong-hyun is preparing a list
of Chairman Mo's tapes.

470
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,261
However...

471
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:12,431
- However?
- Some tapes are missing.

472
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,310
- I think they are of Congressman Baek.
- Really?

473
00:46:19,897 --> 00:46:23,151
Congressman Baek.
The most important tapes are missing.

474
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:26,154
We have no direct evidence on him,

475
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,948
but we can obtain evidence of the others.

476
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:34,162
Now, we can identify
the Baek Infantry members within the NIS.

477
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:35,848
If you give me authority...

478
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:39,072
I'll appoint you as the special inspector
under my authority as the NIS director.

479
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,097
Put together a team
and handle it yourself.

480
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:43,545
I will.

481
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:45,214
I will uproot them completely.

482
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:46,966
But Tae-ho...

483
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:49,528
Yes?

484
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:52,722
You made a deal with Songsan's CEO,
Seung-jae Mo while executing Plan B?

485
00:46:54,348 --> 00:46:59,228
I believe it is better than
forfeiting nothing and gaining nothing.

486
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:05,735
A plan that violates the rules
may bite you in the end.

487
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:07,777
Keep that in mind.

488
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:11,532
It doesn't matter anymore.

489
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:16,370
The bullet missed perfectly.

490
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:19,165
I realized when I didn't die

491
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:22,186
that Mr. Jang was following Plan B.

492
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,628
That traitor bastard.

493
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:27,215
Still, how could he team up
with Seung-jae Mo?

494
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,926
To be honest, until you showed up,

495
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,219
I suspected you too.

496
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:33,780
Me?

497
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:37,725
That's why I left you a message
before going to see Mr. Jang.

498
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:42,396
Whatever happened, the message
would have entrapped the traitor.

499
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:48,694
<i>Mr. Jang knows the mole
who betrayed Agent Y.</i>

500
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:52,216
That's what that was?

501
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,034
If you were the past traitor
that sold out Agent Y,

502
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:58,931
you would have killed Mr. Jang,
who knew it was you.

503
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:03,626
If I killed Mr. Jang, the present traitor
would have been eliminated,

504
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,250
I would've exposed myself as being
the past traitor,

505
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,506
and it would've entrapped...

506
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:12,385
Hey, you are right.

507
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:16,472
It was the best way to uncover everything.

508
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:20,369
Sadly, you weren't the traitor.

509
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:21,811
What, punk? Sadly?

510
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,854
I would never be the traitor.

511
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:26,291
Because you're not the traitor,

512
00:48:26,315 --> 00:48:30,003
you tailed Mr. Jang,
who seemed suspicious.

513
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:34,448
Thus, I responded as you predicted, and...

514
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:38,035
Seriously.

515
00:48:39,078 --> 00:48:41,372
Why do I feel so manipulated?

516
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:47,229
But as it stands now, we don't know
who the previous traitor was.

517
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:48,629
That's right.

518
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,090
We don't know yet.

519
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:53,466
What now?

520
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:57,614
Do we just watch Mr. Jang follow Plan B
and work with Seung-jae Mo?

521
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:59,598
What do you mean by "watch"?
You need to join him.

522
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:02,351
The prosecutor has a lot to do.

523
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:04,895
Well, that's true.

524
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:07,147
What about you?

525
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:09,482
Me?

526
00:49:14,572 --> 00:49:15,572
Goodness.

527
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:21,454
Should I disappear as Mr. Jang said?

528
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:23,038
What?

529
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:25,665
Where to?

530
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:27,667
Just.

531
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:29,837
Living an average life.

532
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,768
<i>How's Seol-woo?</i>

533
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:46,520
His fever didn't rise or anything.

534
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:51,335
He says he will be fully recovered
with a couple of days of rest.

535
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,693
After a gunshot wound?

536
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,112
He says he knows his body.

537
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:58,574
He says it happens occasionally.

538
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:05,247
Being a Ghost agent isn't like the movies.
It kind of sucks.

539
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:10,086
I know three Ghost agents.

540
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:16,509
<i>One faked his death in an explosion
and lives in hiding.</i>

541
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:21,597
<i>Another is blind and retired,
and is now a priest.</i>

542
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:23,641
Also...

543
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:27,061
Brother was betrayed by a colleague
and was shot.

544
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:39,657
I'm sure you think
you can overcome it all now,

545
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:42,576
but you will end up getting hurt
and suffer in pain.

546
00:50:44,328 --> 00:50:46,080
It will hurt even if I run away.

547
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:51,502
If it's going to hurt anyway,

548
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:55,840
I would rather enjoy myself a lot now
and then hurt a lot later.

549
00:50:57,174 --> 00:51:00,487
- That's such a foolish...
- Just cheer me on for now.

550
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:02,888
- Then, you will just...
- Later.

551
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:05,891
Later.

552
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,479
If I'm really hurt and in pain,

553
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:13,315
you can comfort me then.

554
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:18,612
Since I have you.

555
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:21,907
I will be myself and face it head on.

556
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:26,787
I want to do my best until the very end.

557
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:44,823
We will summon everyone
in these Byung-do Mo tapes

558
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,557
and investigate them.

559
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:49,828
They are rich and powerful politicians
and businessmen,

560
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:51,937
so we expect a lot of pressure,

561
00:51:52,354 --> 00:51:55,858
but we will follow the rules and the law
and take it all the way.

562
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:05,862
I'm a special investigator from the NIS,
Tae-ho Jang.

563
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:07,512
Jae-hyuk Choi.

564
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:10,016
You're under arrest for bribery
and violating rules of the NIS.

565
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:32,996
Interrogation in process

566
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,065
It's of national security,
so I cannot say.

567
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,400
I don't need you to speak.

568
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,202
Now, do you remember?

569
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:52,414
If you're not sure yet,

570
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:55,376
you can take your time
and think about it in jail.

571
00:52:56,293 --> 00:52:59,964
You will be there long enough,
until you remember.

572
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:15,937
Robert Yoon.

573
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:17,564
Byung-do Mo.

574
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:22,111
Mi-eun Song

575
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:24,989
Seung-jae Mo

576
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:42,131
Jae-hyuk Choi.

577
00:53:45,676 --> 00:53:48,822
Songsan group's apology press conference

578
00:53:48,846 --> 00:53:51,473
We promise to donate the slush fund
that was found,

579
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,868
which is about a trillion won,
to the society

580
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:56,103
via a scholarship foundation.

581
00:53:57,896 --> 00:54:00,858
Just because the wrong was committed
during the late Chairman's term

582
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:05,237
does not mean I am free
from the responsibility.

583
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:08,949
As the CEO of Songsan,
a corporation for the people,

584
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:12,286
I sincerely apologize once again.

585
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:22,087
<i>"After Songsan Group's CEO
Seung-jae Mo's apology press conference,</i>

586
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:26,842
every subsidiary
of Songsan's stock prices went up."

587
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,890
You turned a crisis into an opportunity.

588
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:36,310
Meanwhile, your crisis remains a crisis.

589
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:41,082
Your ratings are at the bottom,
but you're still campaigning?

590
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:44,109
There was no evidence on me
in the chairman's tapes.

591
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:49,382
Any accusations against me
are slander and conspiracies.

592
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:51,408
The Baek Infantry has been arrested.

593
00:54:52,076 --> 00:54:53,470
How will you run your campaign?

594
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:55,663
It isn't over until it is really over.

595
00:54:56,372 --> 00:54:58,290
My support base is solid,

596
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:01,335
so you don't know
until you count the votes.

597
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:03,962
You have a healthy imagination,

598
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:06,340
but you have poor judgment.

599
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:11,679
I understand you worked with Mr. Jang
to stab the Baek Infantry in the back,

600
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:16,558
but do you want to cut ties
with me as well?

601
00:55:17,434 --> 00:55:21,939
You aren't asking me for campaign funds
in this situation, are you?

602
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:27,611
You need to keep your spirit
under control.

603
00:55:28,612 --> 00:55:31,615
If you and I face off,
the nation will be chaotic.

604
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,368
It's chaotic enough already.

605
00:55:37,162 --> 00:55:38,330
Take care of yourself.

606
00:55:39,373 --> 00:55:40,373
You too.

607
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,793
Take care of yourself.

608
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:57,307
How do you feel?

609
00:55:58,767 --> 00:55:59,977
I'm almost fully recovered.

610
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:02,938
Looks like we will start shooting again.

611
00:56:03,647 --> 00:56:06,047
It's probably related to the stuff
on the news lately, right?

612
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:07,608
Yes.

613
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:11,530
I'll get you your $5,000,000 soon as well.

614
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:14,741
How?

615
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:17,870
Will you get it from the jerk
who shot you?

616
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:22,458
Don't go.

617
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:26,003
I don't care about the $5,000,000 anymore.

618
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:34,511
The Buddhas have grown on me
too much to return them to you.

619
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:40,350
Same goes for you.

620
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,107
Stay with me

621
00:56:48,025 --> 00:56:49,025
as my family,

622
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:51,152
as my brother.

623
00:56:54,198 --> 00:56:56,950
You don't even know who I am,

624
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:02,206
where I am from or my past.

625
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,708
I know, you punk.

626
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,088
You're as lonely as I am.

627
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:15,176
Live with me.

628
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:20,224
Don't hurt Do-ha,
and don't get hurt yourself.

629
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,647
Think about it and do as I say.

630
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:29,398
Rest up.

631
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,166
Restricted number

632
00:57:48,418 --> 00:57:50,355
Find the missing tapes
of Congressman Baek.

633
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:53,382
The traitor knows your weakness. Y.

634
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:06,996
Hello.

635
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,123
Thank you for your hard work.

636
00:58:08,147 --> 00:58:10,399
He is a prosecutor on the case.

637
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:14,319
We need to look at some things. Thank you.

638
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:36,049
We removed the cash and the tapes,

639
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:40,470
but we're keeping the art and artifacts
here until the investigation is over

640
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:42,651
because the facilities here are excellent.

641
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:46,703
What are you looking for, anyway?

642
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:50,731
A clue that Robert Yoon left behind
to locate the tapes of Congressman Baek.

643
00:58:51,315 --> 00:58:52,900
A clue that Robert Yoon left behind?

644
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:55,224
Agent Yoon left something else?

645
00:58:58,238 --> 00:58:59,948
<i>If it is the Lord's will,</i>

646
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:02,993
He will lead you to the right path.

647
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:04,994
The path

648
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:07,497
is in the Word.

649
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:13,170
The path is in the Word.

650
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,928
Hey. You can't go through them like that.

651
00:59:27,517 --> 00:59:28,517
Hey.

652
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:47,912
Found it.

653
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:51,666
What is this?

654
00:59:52,584 --> 00:59:54,795
<i>The path is in the Word.</i>

Saint Michael and his angels fighting
a dragon, from the Bible verse

659
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:08,517
Robert Yoon left behind.

660
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:10,017
Is it?

661
01:00:10,435 --> 01:00:12,980
Is there a clue in this painting?

662
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:17,943
Is it like a hidden picture?

663
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:22,823
Goodness.

664
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:26,451
Hey. You can't do that.

665
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:28,036
What the hell?

666
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:29,537
You reckless punk.

667
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,180
It's a floor plan.

- Give me the keys.
- Okay.

674
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:11,360
Here.

Is that bodyguard alive?

680
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:59,309
That rat is alive.

681
01:02:01,228 --> 01:02:03,605
Do you know something?

682
01:02:05,232 --> 01:02:06,232
No.

683
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:09,611
There's something I didn't know.

691

01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:00,180
