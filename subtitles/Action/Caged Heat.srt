1
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,300
Check, charge or cash?
Cash.

2
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Make it out to...

3
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,600
...Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

4
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
$788.30.

5
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,800
Taking me to breakfast?

6
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

7
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Hey, Vincent.

8
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,300
Where are my barrettes?
I saw them on the kitchen table.

9
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,200
I already checked.

10
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,500
Coffee?

11
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
No school today?
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

12
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
Try under the sofa cushions.

13
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
He's already a half an hour late.

14
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,500
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

15
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll make coffee.
Out of time.

16
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,900
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

17
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,600
Wear the blue ones.

18
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,700
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

19
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,100
-Did you check in your bathroom?
-I checked everywhere!
What do you want me to do?

20
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,500
Find them!

21
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,300
-Mom, pay attention!
-All right, sweetie, all right!
Daddy's going to be here.

22
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,300
I won't be ready!
-I can't be late.
-You won't.

23
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,900
I will be late!

24
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,300
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

25
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

26
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

27
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,100
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

28
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,500
Give me another refill.

29
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,600
What's your name?
Waingro.

30
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,900
You're Michael?

31
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,000
You guys always work together?

32
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,100
All the time.

33
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,100
Real tight crew?
Real tight.

34
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,700
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

35
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

36
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,900
How's he doing?
Hundred percent.

37
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,500
Right on schedule.

38
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,300
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

39
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
We're a mile and a half from you.
Okay.

40
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,700
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

41
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Get set.
I am.

42
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,300
Here we go.

43
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,600
2 11 !

44
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,800
We're being held up!

45
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
-2 11 alarm. Armored car.
-There's the call.

46
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,200
Three minutes.

47
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,500
Clear!

48
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,300
Eighty seconds left!

49
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Get back! Get back!

50
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Get back!

51
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,200
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!
Cool it!

52
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
I got it.

53
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,300
Got it.

54
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
You had to fuck with me.

55
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Want to fuck with me?

56
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,300
What are you doing? What did he do?
He was making a move.

57
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,500
Dumb motherfucker.

58
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
I heard them.

59
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,100
$1.6 million....

60
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,900
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

61
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Here's $150,000 front money.

62
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Get you the rest in two, three days.

63
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Who owned these?

64
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

65
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,700
Roger Van Zant.

66
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
Owns banks in the Caymans...

67
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,900
...runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

68
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
So?

69
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
You ripped off his bearer bonds.
He's insured.

70
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

71
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,100
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

72
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,700
...for 60 percent of their value. Makes
40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

73
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,500
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

74
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,400
Try it on.

75
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,500
Kelso called.
About what?

76
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,000
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

77
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,600
I don't need his score. I got my own.
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

78
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,700
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
What happened?

79
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
Don't ask.

80
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Find the ambulance?
-Dumped it four blocks from here.
-22nd Street.

81
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,600
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

82
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,200
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

83
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,100
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

84
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.
You taking this one?

85
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Or does it stay in Division?

86
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,400
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

87
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,700
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

88
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,100
We got three motorists.
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

89
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,100
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

90
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Did he ID anybody?
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

91
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
What about them?

92
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,500
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

93
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Smart.
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

94
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Now, I figure this guy...

95
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,900
...went for that hold-out piece,
ankle holster.

96
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
From here...

97
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,900
...bang, bang...
...bang, bang, bang.

98
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,600
This side.

99
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,200
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

100
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,900
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.
Probably executed.

101
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,800
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

102
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,500
They ignored the loose cash.
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

103
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,500
Which means they knew
our response time to a 2 11...

104
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,400
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

105
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,200
...escaped in under three minutes.
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

106
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,200
Two freeways...
...within a quarter of a mile.

107
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,000
Traffic video camera?
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

108
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,900
You recognize the M.O.?
M.O...

109
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
...is that they're good.

110
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,200
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

111
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,600
...they didn't hesitate.
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

112
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,900
Why leave a living witness?
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

113
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,600
The shape charge.

114
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,600
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

115
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,800
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

116
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,500
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

117
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,100
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

118
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

119
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,100
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

120
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,200
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.
Hang in with Forensics.

121
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,200
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

122
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,500
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

123
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,300
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

124
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Anyone want some pie?

125
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Gotta go to the john.

126
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,800
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

127
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

128
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
...to make up for his full end...

129
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,900
...'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

130
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
Hold it!

131
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,800
Where's the rest?
We're late. You look too good to go out.

132
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,500
I'll just jump you right here.

133
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,400
-Where is it?
-Squared the bookies, baby.

134
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,800
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.
Come on.

135
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
You gotta be kidding me.

136
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,200
Honey...
...it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

137
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's go.

138
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,100
Get your coat.

139
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,600
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.
What does that mean?

140
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

141
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,700
...because I married a gambling junkie.

142
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,600
Get in the fucking car.

143
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
What am I doing in here?

144
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,300
You're not!
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

145
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,400
...in the kitchen on your way out!
-Are we going?
-Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

146
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,200
Don't even think about....

147
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,100
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

148
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Albert Torena call Vincent?

149
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
No.

150
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,100
Report came in.

151
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,600
The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.
You can pick it up in Nevada...

152
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,600
...Arizona, New Mexico.

153
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Too common to trace a sale.

154
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
That's wonderful.

155
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,000
You all right?

156
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
What happened? Where have you been?

157
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,000
Work.

158
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Lauren's dad show up?

159
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Didn't call...
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

160
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

161
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
I don't know.

162
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,200
Fucking jerk.

163
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,300
Is she okay?

164
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,500
She's been in her room all day.

165
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,200
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

166
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
I made dinner...

167
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
...for us, four hours ago.

168
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,800
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...
...you withdraw.

169
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,200
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

170
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,900
...off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

171
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm sorry...

172
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
...if the goddamn...

173
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,800
...chicken...

174
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,100
...got overcooked.

175
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,100
Coffee, sir?
Please.

176
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Will you pass the cream?

177
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,600
Thanks.
What'd you get?

178
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
What?

179
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600
What are you reading?

180
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,700
Book about metals.

181
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Stress Fractures in Titanium.

182
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,700
What kind of work do you do?

183
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,100
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

184
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,100
I've seen you in the store.
What store?

185
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

186
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,900
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

187
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,400
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

188
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

189
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
My name's Neil.

190
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm Eady.

191
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,400
You like working there?

192
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,000
Sure.

193
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,600
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.
What area?

194
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
Graphic design.

195
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,700
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

196
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,000
...the store's a day job
until I get enough going.
Who do you do that for?

197
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,500
A restaurant.

198
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I did their menus, and...

199
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,900
...a small record label.

200
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CDs.

201
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
I've done two so far.

202
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,800
You go to school for that?

203
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Yeah.

204
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
I went to Parsons.
Where's that?

205
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,500
New York City.

206
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
How long you been here?

207
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,100
About a year.

208
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,300
Like it?

209
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,900
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

210
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Live in this neighborhood?
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

211
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,300
It's a little house I rent.
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

212
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,400
What about you?
I live up here.

213
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
That's very funny.

214
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,900
Where's your family from originally?

215
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,900
They're Scotch-Irish.

216
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,000
They emigrated to Appalachia...
...in the late 1700s.

217
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,500
Where are you from?

218
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
The Bay area.

219
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
Your folks there?

220
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,400
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...
...I don't know where he is.

221
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Got a brother somewhere.

222
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,600
You have a tight family. I can tell.

223
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,400
Right?

224
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,900
You're right.

225
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,300
City of lights.

226
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,000
In Fiji, they have...
...iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

227
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,900
That's what it looks like out there.

228
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,200
You been there?

229
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
No, I'm going there someday.

230
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
You travel a lot?

231
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Yeah.

232
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,200
Traveling make you lonely?

233
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm alone. I am not...

234
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,700
...lonely.

235
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,200
You?

236
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,200
Real lonely.

237
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,300
Albert!

238
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,200
Shit!

239
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,500
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

240
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,000
You were supposed to get back to me.
Where the fuck you been?

241
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,700
I couldn't break free.
Let's violate his ass right now.

242
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
I do for you...

243
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,100
...you don't do for me, is that it?

244
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,100
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

245
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,700
That's got nothing to do with me.

246
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

247
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
You bullshit.

248
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,600
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

249
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,200
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

250
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,300
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

251
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,500
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.
You fall in love?

252
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,400
Did you fall in love...

253
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,100
...and went off somewhere?
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

254
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Give me all you got!
Give me all you got!

255
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,700
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

256
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,500
I heard Richard?

257
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,300
He's going to talk to you.

258
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,900
He gonna meet you man,
I swear, tonight.
He's not here, is he?

259
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,100
No, he gonna meet you tonight.
Tonoght? What happened to right now?

260
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,200
I- I- I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

261
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,400
Bullshit.

262
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,700
No, no, I swear. He said no...

263
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
...'cause he in Phoenix.

264
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,300
"By the time I get to Phoenix

265
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,600
"He'll be rising

266
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,000
"He'll probably leave a note
"Right on the door"

267
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,900
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

268
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,900
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

269
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
At 2:00 a.m.

270
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,700
Be there.
You be there too.

271
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,600
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.
I got things to do, I got places to be.

272
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,100
Be there.

273
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,100
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

274
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,900
What is it?

275
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
It's a bank.

276
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,700
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

277
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

278
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,800
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.
On the prowl or strong?

279
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,100
Strong. Through the door.
How many guys?

280
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,000
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

281
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,100
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

282
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,100
Sounds like a cowboy score.

283
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,400
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

284
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,300
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

285
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Two Telco and a cellular.

286
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,800
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...
...the night before...

287
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,100
...you cut in...
...and trick out
the alarm system computer...

288
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,800
...to turn itself...
...and the video recorders off...

289
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,400
...20 minutes before you enter.

290
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,800
Architectural, electrical plans?
I got that.

291
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,700
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

292
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,100
What's the estimate?

293
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
$12.1, $12.2 million.

294
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,700
You're on.

295
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,200
Congratulations.

296
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,400
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

297
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

298
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,900
My way, you get 100 percent
from the insurance company...
...take the bonds back from us...

299
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,100
...at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40 percent.

300
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,800
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

301
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,200
Sure, you got a deal.

302
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,300
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

303
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,700
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.
Yeah, okay.

304
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Nice talking to you.

305
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,700
You gonna deal with these guys?
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

306
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

307
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,700
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

308
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,600
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

309
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,000
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

310
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,300
How'd you get this information?
Just comes to you.

311
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,600
This stuff just flies through the air.

312
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,100
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.
I know how to grab it.

313
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,600
Okay, here we go.

314
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,600
$13.9 million.

315
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,000
-I bought it.
-Good.

316
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,900
What did I tell you?

317
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Here.

318
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,500
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

319
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,000
How is he?

320
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,000
He's a businessman.

321
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Chris is at my place.

322
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,000
What's wrong?

323
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,000
Husband-and-wife stuff.

324
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,700
I'll let him sleep it off.

325
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,500
What happened to you?

326
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,200
When will you get some furniture?
When I get around to it.

327
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,000
Charlene's gonna leave me.

328
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Why?

329
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

330
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,900
With everything we've been doing?

331
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,500
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

332
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,000
When you gonna get an old lady?
When I get around to it.

333
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,900
You got something else on the side?

334
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,700
Nothing regular.

335
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,900
She got something else on the side?
-No.
-You sure?

336
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,600
Yeah, I'm sure.

337
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,000
I don't know what you're doing.

338
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,900
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

339
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,000
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

340
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,700
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

341
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,500
Remember that?

342
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,300
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

343
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,500
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

344
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,800
...then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

345
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Bank? What bank?

346
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,400
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.
That goes too. Then the bank.

347
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,300
Want some breakfast?

348
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
Are you okay?

349
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,700
Yeah, sugar.

350
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
For real.

351
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
I'll do good.

352
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,500
I'll see you later.

353
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,500
You Solenko?

354
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm Don Breedan.

355
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,400
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

356
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,500
You're familiar with this kind of operation?
I'm a great grill man.

357
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,100
Good. Good for you.

358
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,200
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

359
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,700
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.
I'll violate you back fast.

360
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,700
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

361
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,000
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

362
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
What are you waiting for?

363
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,300
Malibu Equity and Investments.
Roger Van Zant.

364
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Please hold.

365
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,200
This is Roger Van Zant.

366
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,600
I'm supposed to collect something.
Someone will call you back
from another line.

367
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,400
818-133-6089.

368
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,600
I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.

369
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Just send one man, alone.

370
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,600
-Who was that guy?
-Nobody.

371
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,800
-Who was that guy?
-Nobody.

372
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,100
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?
He's nobody, Neil.

373
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,900
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

374
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,700
Chris will make up.

375
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,500
-It's too late! I'm sick of it!
-Shut up!

376
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,200
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

377
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,400
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

378
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,700
...on my own, anywhere you want.
Dominick will go with you.

379
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,400
And my word counts. But right now...

380
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,900
...you will give him the chance.

381
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,700
Clean up. Go home.

382
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,700
Clean up. Go home!

383
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,200
Give me all your money.
You'll get smoked with that shit.

384
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,700
Won't be you.

385
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,400
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

386
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,200
Vincent, hey, man.

387
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,300
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.
It's all right.

388
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
What have you got for me?

389
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,800
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

390
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,400
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

391
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,800
...if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

392
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,000
...they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

393
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,200
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

394
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,500
I'm a good citizen.

395
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm Donald Duck.

396
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,700
You got something to tell me?

397
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,800
Check this out, cuz.

398
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,000
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

399
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,900
...that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

400
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,200
Hanna is straight up.

401
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,700
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.
And you know because I say so...

402
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,200
...after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!
Fuck you.

403
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,900
You understand?

404
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,300
I can get killed for telling you this.
You can get killed walking your doggie!

405
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,900
All right, man...

406
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,600
...there was a cat I was locked up with.

407
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,600
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

408
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,200
And so?

409
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,800
He's a big fiend for action.

410
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

411
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,500
...he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

412
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,500
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.
Right then and there I know...

413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,700
...this cat's got something going down.

414
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,100
Pretty fucking great.

415
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,000
Albert, what's wrong with you?

416
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,600
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

417
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,300
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

418
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,000
That's right.
Well, I am...

419
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
...over-fucking-whelmed.

420
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,700
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

421
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

422
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,100
Is he kidding me?

423
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,700
I'm telling you:
This Slick is no joke.

424
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
He's double time.

425
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,300
Say what?

426
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,500
"Slick." What does that mean?
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

427
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,800
Tell me about him.

428
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,900
About 6 feet tall...

429
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,200
...lots of jailhouse tats.

430
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,600
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

431
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,500
What's his name?

432
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,700
Cheritto.

433
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,900
Michael Cheritto.

434
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,600
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

435
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,500
Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.

436
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,600
Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.
Three years in Marion.

437
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,000
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

438
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,500
Jacket's two inches thick.
Who do I have there now?

439
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,300
-Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
-Tell SIS...

440
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,300
...I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

441
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,700
We never close. Open every day.

442
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,000
Bug the car, the house, the work.
When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...

443
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,600
...I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.

444
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,200
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

445
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,300
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

446
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,000
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them.

447
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,100
I tell you what to do.
I tell you how to do it.

448
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,400
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

449
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,800
...take the package and throw it in here.

450
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Behind you.
On the right.

451
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,600
Roger Van Zant.

452
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,500
Who's this?

453
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,600
You know who this is.

454
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,500
Yes, I do.

455
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,300
I sent a guy to deliver the package.
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

456
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,600
I tell you what, forget the money.

457
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
What?

458
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,300
Forget the money.

459
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,900
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

460
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,300
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

461
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,500
I don't understand.

462
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,400
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

463
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,000
Do you like it?
Look at my ring.

464
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,800
Did you know?

465
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,700
You are insane.

466
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,100
Do you like it?
-It's beautiful.
-It's good.

467
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,600
Don't ask him where he got it.

468
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,900
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
I don't know.

469
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,400
Just like me.

470
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,300
I don't know either.

471
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,700
Hello?

472
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,600
It's me.

473
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,600
I was wondering if you'd call.

474
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,500
I've been busy.

475
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,100
Can I see you?

476
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,600
I was afraid that was just...

477
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
...the one night.

478
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,800
Not for me, it wasn't.

479
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
Yeah, me neither.

480
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,500
Can I fall by?

481
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,900
Yeah.

482
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,300
I'll see you in a little bit.

483
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,900
Goddamn convention.

484
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,600
-Which one's Slick?
-The wide one.

485
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
We got two transmitters.

486
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,400
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.
Here we are.

487
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,800
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

488
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,300
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

489
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,400
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

490
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,600
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

491
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,200
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

492
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,100
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.
Who's the loner?

493
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,400
First time we've seen him.
We're not on him yet.

494
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,900
Get on it.

495
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,400
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

496
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,500
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

497
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,900
Baby, time to go.

498
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,900
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

499
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,600
You fly.

500
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,100
You're cool.

501
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,400
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

502
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,800
I ain't lying.

503
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,900
You're a hot dog.

504
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,300
A regular rodeo rider.

505
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,000
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

506
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,600
Now, I got to get my ass street-side, sugar.
You don't have a truth-telling style.

507
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,900
What are you talking about?
You don't know what this is.

508
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,000
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

509
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,600
Where have you been?

510
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,300
SHU at Pelican Bay.

511
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,400
Folsom, B-wing.

512
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,000
I am a cowboy...

513
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,800
...looking for anything heavy.
Billy said to come see you.

514
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,400
That is why I am here.

515
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,700
Why don't you call this guy?

516
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,600
This guy's always putting guys on.

517
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,900
Thank you.

518
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,300
You're perfect for each other.

519
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,900
I knew a guy in grade school.

520
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,300
His name was Raoul...whatever.

521
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,000
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

522
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,400
He'd turn his eyelids inside out....
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

523
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,300
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...
...bestial sort of way.

524
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,100
Woman.

525
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,300
This better be earth-shattering.

526
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,300
This is to Raoul.

527
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,300
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

528
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Here's how we found her.

529
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,200
How old?
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

530
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,900
How'd she die?

531
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,600
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

532
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,600
Who's that?

533
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,200
Mother and siblings.
-What the hell are they doing here?
-It's fucked up.

534
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,700
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

535
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,500
Let's go.

536
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,300
Nice.

537
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,200
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

538
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,500
...so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

539
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,700
Sheriff's getting anywhere?
Not yet.

540
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,500
Get off of me!

541
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,700
Oh, my God!

542
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,400
Where is she?

543
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,100
Easy, easy, easy.

544
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,000
Please, come on.

545
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,600
It's okay.

546
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,500
Where is my baby?

547
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,900
Where is she?

548
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,700
I need to know what happened.

549
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,100
I guess the earth shattered.

550
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,800
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

551
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,300
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

552
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,700
What was it?

553
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,500
You don't want to know.
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

554
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,300
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

555
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,300
You never told me I'd be excluded.

556
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,600
I told you when we hooked up...
...that you'd have to share me...

557
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,500
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

558
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,000
And I bought into that sharing...

559
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,000
...because I love you.

560
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,900
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

561
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,400
I don't care.

562
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,200
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

563
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,300
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

564
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,100
What I should do is come home and say:

565
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,500
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

566
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,600
"...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

567
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,100
"...because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

568
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,300
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

569
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,800
"...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

570
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,500
Right?

571
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,000
Wrong.

572
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,800
You know why?
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

573
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,300
We fuck and you don't speak.
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

574
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,900
I preserve it...
...because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

575
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,000
Where I gotta be.

576
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,000
You don't live with me.

577
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,200
You live among the remains
of dead people.

578
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,300
You sift through the detritus.

579
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,400
You read the terrain.

580
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,200
You search for signs of passing...

581
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,900
...for the scent of your prey...
...and then you hunt them down.

582
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,400
That's the only thing you're committed to.

583
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,900
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

584
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,400
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

585
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,500
Let's go, baby.

586
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,000
I met the manager.

587
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,000
Is that the boss?

588
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,900
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

589
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,800
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

590
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,400
Can you do that?

591
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,900
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

592
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,700
Why're you hanging with me?

593
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,300
Because I'm proud of you.

594
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,800
You're proud of me?

595
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,900
Why the hell are you proud of me?

596
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,600
Come on home.

597
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,800
What were you doing there?
I was skiing.

598
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,800
I was trying to ski.

599
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,600
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

600
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,300
...and you meet people.

601
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,900
You try to have a good time.
-Did you have a good time?
-No.

602
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,100
Why not?

603
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,700
I'm not good at meeting people.

604
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,200
You met me.

605
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,900
That happened without my thinking
about it.

606
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,100
Which is why I probably....

607
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,800
No, it's because you are fine.

608
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,100
Take off with me for a while.

609
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,400
Where?

610
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,200
New Zealand.

611
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,600
When?

612
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,300
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

613
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,900
But my job....

614
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,700
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio and work there.

615
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,900
I don't know.
What's there to know?

616
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,700
Are you married?

617
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,200
What?

618
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,700
The last thing I am is married.

619
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:04,500
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.
Then, all of a sudden...

620
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,800
...someone like you comes along.

621
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,600
You don't know me.
I know enough.

622
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,000
Come with me.

623
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,400
What's wrong?

624
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,300
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

625
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,900
Yeah.

626
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Good.

627
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,100
Hi, sweetie.

628
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,100
You forget your mom was picking you up?

629
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,600
No.

630
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,500
So, what's going on?

631
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,300
I felt like being alone.

632
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,200
Come on, I'll drive you home.

633
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,300
What's happening?

634
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,900
Sir.

635
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,000
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

636
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,600
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

637
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,100
Technique.

638
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,600
Open Sesame. Right there.

639
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,800
There he is.

640
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,100
We walk!
I'm there.

641
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,600
We walk! Now!

642
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,000
He's heard it.

643
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,500
Heads up.

644
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,700
-One's coming out.
-Hold it, Captain.
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

645
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,100
I see.

646
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,900
-Here we go.
-Not till my boss says so.
Both of them are not carrying anything.

647
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,700
-Let them go.
-What do you mean?

648
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,000
We can take them--
On what?

649
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,200
They didn't steal anything yet.

650
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,000
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

651
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:05,800
No fucking way.
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

652
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,500
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

653
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,300
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

654
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,600
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

655
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,900
Back to work.

656
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,600
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

657
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,100
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

658
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,700
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

659
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:19,000
Assume they got our phones, our houses.
Assume they got us right here, right now...

660
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,900
...as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

661
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,700
How will we buy the bank package?
I'll front that.

662
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,700
What about Van Zant?

663
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,800
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

664
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,600
No, I want my 750.

665
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,200
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

666
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,300
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

667
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,100
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

668
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,300
The bank is worth the risk.

669
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,100
I need it, brother.

670
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,200
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

671
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,200
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

672
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,300
-Whatever.
-Not on this one.
On this one, you're on your own.

673
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:36,900
You figure this is the best thing to do?
This is the best thing to do?

674
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,900
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

675
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:46,300
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.
You got T-bonds, real estate.

676
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,900
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

677
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,700
For me...

678
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,100
...the action is the juice.

679
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,800
I'm in.

680
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah, sure.

681
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,400
Let's go.

682
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,000
Fuck them, let's do it.

683
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,700
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

684
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,800
Tim, I gotta call you back.

685
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,800
-Can I help you?
-Are you Alan Marciano?
Who the fuck are you?

686
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,100
Who am I?

687
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,000
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

688
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,800
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

689
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,600
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

690
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,300
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

691
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,300
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

692
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,700
...up from North Carolina three years ago...
...or you go to work for us.

693
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,500
Cut and dried.

694
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,300
That is it.

695
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,700
Shit.

696
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,400
Charlene Shiherlis.

697
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,900
Who?

698
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,900
Who?

699
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,100
What are you, a fucking owl?

700
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,100
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

701
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500
You can't tie me to her.

702
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,600
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

703
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:45,100
Why did I get mixed up with her?
Because she's got a great ass!

704
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,700
And you got your head all the way up it.

705
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,800
Jesus.

706
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,100
Ferocious, aren't I?

707
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,600
When I think of asses...
...a woman's ass...

708
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,300
...something comes out of me.

709
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,600
So?
So, no big thing.

710
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,100
All I want...

711
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,400
...is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

712
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,100
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

713
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,500
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

714
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,800
...that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.
Right.

715
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,100
The security systems around here
are a joke.

716
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,900
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

717
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,300
No. 2:

718
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,600
Over here. Anaheim to the 1 10.

719
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,900
Good.

720
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,600
You got it?
Good. Let's go.

721
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,300
They were looking back...

722
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,100
...in this direction.

723
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,500
A container facility?

724
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,100
What? Cartage theft?
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

725
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,700
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.
Refinery only pays by check.

726
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,300
No cash around.

727
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Same for the scrap yard.

728
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,100
Stealing hubcaps?

729
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,100
A refinery and a scrap yard.

730
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,300
What the hell is going on?
That's what we are trying to figure out.

731
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,000
We thought we had it.

732
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,400
Thought we had it.

733
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,300
I got an idea...

734
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,600
...on what they were looking at.

735
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,400
Want to know what they're looking at?

736
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,200
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

737
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,000
This crew is good.

738
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,700
Know what they're looking at?

739
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,100
What?

740
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,500
Us.

741
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,200
The LAPD.

742
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,000
The police department.

743
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,900
We just got made.

744
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah!

745
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,600
Okay!

746
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,000
Okay, motherfucker!

747
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,200
Kelso come through?

748
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,100
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

749
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,400
Name is Hanna.

750
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,400
First name, Vincent.

751
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:41,400
I smeared this sergeant five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

752
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,900
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

753
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,800
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.
He's a hot dog.

754
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,300
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

755
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,700
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

756
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,200
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.
He was a fucking maniac.

757
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,600
He was working Narcotics before that.

758
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,900
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.
He's why the extra heat.

759
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,500
The vice sergeant...

760
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,800
...says Hanna likes you...

761
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,000
...thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

762
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,000
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

763
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,200
Funny as a heart attack.
Three marriages? Do you think that means
he likes staying home?

764
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:35,200
Means he's one of those guys out there...
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

765
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,600
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

766
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,200
It's worth the stretch.

767
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,900
This guy can hit or miss.

768
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,200
You can't miss once.

769
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,000
You sure?

770
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,500
I am sure.

771
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,200
Let's go to the garage.

772
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,100
Where are we going?

773
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,800
Where are you going?

774
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Out.

775
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,100
What are they on?
TAC 9.

776
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.

777
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,700
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?
This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.

778
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,400
Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...

779
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,700
...approaching the 1 10.

780
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,900
Revolving tail?

781
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,700
I got two units in front, three behind.

782
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,400
OK, have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

783
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,400
Let's go.

784
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:25,100
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

785
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,000
Three hundred yards, center lane.

786
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,700
How're you doing?

787
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,000
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

788
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

789
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,600
Follow me.

790
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,300
Seven years in Folsom.

791
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,900
In the hole for three.

792
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,600
McNeil before that.

793
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,900
McNeil as tough as they say?

794
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,400
You looking to become a penologist?

795
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,100
You looking to go back?

796
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,400
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.
That you?

797
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,300
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

798
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,400
I worked all kinds.

799
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:45,400
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

800
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,300
No, I do not.

801
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,600
Right.

802
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,000
I am never going back.

803
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,800
Then don't take down scores.

804
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,700
I do what I do best:

805
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,000
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Trying to stop guys like me.

806
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,400
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

807
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,700
W' the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

808
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,400
Yeah.

809
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,500
This regular-type life, that your life?

810
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,600
My life? No, my life....

811
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,400
My life's a disaster zone.

812
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,400
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

813
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:35,400
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.
I got a wife.

814
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,400
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.
My third.

815
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:46,700
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.
That's my life.

816
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,100
A guy told me one time:

817
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:01,200
"Don't let yourself get attached to anything
you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds...

818
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,500
"...flat if you feel the heat around the corner."

819
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,500
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

820
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,600
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

821
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,800
That's an interesting point.

822
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,800
What are you, a monk?

823
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,100
I have a woman.

824
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,200
What do you tell her?

825
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,400
I tell her I'm a salesman.

826
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,900
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

827
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,900
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

828
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,000
Not say good-bye?

829
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,600
That's the discipline.

830
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,000
That's pretty vacant.

831
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,900
It is what it is.

832
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,300
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

833
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,700
I don't know how to do anything else.
Neither do I.

834
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,700
I don't much want to, either.

835
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,200
Neither do I.

836
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,400
You know, I have this recurring dream.

837
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,200
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

838
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,800
...all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

839
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:27,500
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

840
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,500
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

841
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,800
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

842
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,400
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

843
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,900
The neighbors reported the smell...

844
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:48,400
...and there they are...
...all just sitting there.

845
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,200
What do they say?

846
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,000
Nothing.

847
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,500
No talk?

848
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,600
They have nothing to say.

849
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,400
We just look at each other.

850
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,900
They look at me...

851
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,900
...and that's it. That's the dream.

852
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,700
I have one where I'm drowning.

853
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,200
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

854
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,700
Know what that's about?

855
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,500
Having enough time.

856
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,400
Enough time...

857
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,800
...to do what you want to do?
That's right.

858
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,100
You doing it now?
No, not yet.

859
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,000
You know, we're sitting here...

860
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,900
...like a couple of regular fellas.
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

861
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,800
Now that we've been face to face...

862
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,500
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

863
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,300
...I won't like it.

864
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,700
But, I tell you...

865
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,700
...if it's between you...

866
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:13,100
...and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

867
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,100
...brother...

868
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,200
...you are going down.

869
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,100
There's a flip side to that coin.

870
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,700
What if you do got me boxed in...

871
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,200
...and I gotta put you down?

872
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,900
Because no matter what...

873
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,500
...you will not get in my way.

874
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,700
We've been face to face, yeah.

875
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,900
But I will not hesitate.

876
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,600
Not for a second.

877
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,100
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

878
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,100
Or...

879
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,800
...who knows?

880
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,100
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

881
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,200
They dumped us.

882
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,500
What?

883
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,500
They dumped us.

884
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,600
What do you mean?
Chris slipped away.

885
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,700
He doesn't talk about their scores...

886
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,200
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

887
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
-What about Cheritto?
-Same.

888
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,700
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

889
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:53,100
They dumped all our surveillance?
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

890
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,500
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

891
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,500
We were on you.
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

892
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,800
His car's still there. He's gone.

893
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:15,800
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

894
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,100
Hear from him?

895
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

896
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,600
This guy...
...we put him on.

897
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,700
Says he knows McCauley.

898
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,600
Who are you?

899
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,600
Waingro.

900
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,800
My name's Waingro.

901
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,900
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

902
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,200
We took some major scores together.

903
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,400
Why haven't I heard from him?

904
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,600
He's probably busy right now.

905
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,600
But he's real thorough.

906
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,500
He ain't going to forget about you.
That's reassuring.

907
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,800
I got some moves I could make here.

908
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,300
Probably be a big help to you.

909
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,900
You recognize the grill man?

910
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,000
No.
Folsom.

911
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,500
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

912
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,900
I ain't got my break yet.
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

913
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,800
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

914
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,200
Take your break later.

915
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:57,800
Piece of shit.

916
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,200
Pick up!

917
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,600
Where the hell is he?
I want to check the slot for the work car.

918
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:07,900
So did I.

919
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,800
Hang on.

920
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,000
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

921
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:40,700
Where are you?
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

922
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,900
I can't dump them.

923
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,100
They know you see them?

924
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,300
They're doing parallels.

925
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:55,700
I can try to dump them again.
How are we going to know if you did?

926
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,000
If not, you'll draw them to us.
Go to Ventura.

927
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,900
Pull them out of here.
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

928
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,700
Pick up.

929
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,800
Neil, man. What's up?
What's up?

930
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,900
What are you doing here?

931
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,900
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.
Right now, today.

932
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,900
You remember the drill?
Yeah, sure.

933
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,200
You cool?

934
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,600
You know I'm cool.

935
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,800
One answer: yes or no. Right now.

936
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,800
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

937
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,800
Out back in five.

938
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,600
What's burning?

939
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,400
What is this?

940
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,400
Where do you think you're going?

941
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,500
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!
Hands up!

942
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,200
Put them up! Now!

943
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,700
Get on your knees!
The keys!

944
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,500
Get on your knees!

945
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,100
Get over there!

946
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,100
Turn around!
Put your hands behind you!

947
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,300
Get down!
Stay down!

948
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,500
Get down!

949
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,200
-Down!
-The keys! The keys!

950
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,700
Stay down!

951
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,300
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

952
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:51,100
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.
Think of your families.

953
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,800
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

954
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:58,100
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

955
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,900
...anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

956
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,600
The key.

957
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,000
What key?

958
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,800
Sit down and stay down!

959
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,600
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

960
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,100
Get down. Down, down, down.

961
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,900
Put your heads down!

962
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,600
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

963
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:36,800
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

964
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,300
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

965
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,900
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...
...and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

966
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,200
They're already coming out.

967
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,700
We gotta take them in the car.

968
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:52,900
Wait till they are all in.
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

969
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,000
Police! Move!

970
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,200
Move. Move. Get down.

971
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,700
Move it. Down, down.

972
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,300
We did it!

973
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,500
Move!

974
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,000
Get down!

975
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,000
Get in the car!

976
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:16,900
Go! Go!

977
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:18,400
Go!

978
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,400
Go!

979
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,700
Come on!

980
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,800
Get down!

981
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:17,300
All the way down! Get down! Now!

982
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,300
Come here.

983
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,200
I got you.

984
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:15,000
Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

985
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,300
Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.

986
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:22,500
This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

987
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:26,500
With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers....

988
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:31,700
Excuse me, bartender.
Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

989
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:35,200
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...

990
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,000
...that ended in homicide and terror.

991
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:43,600
Michael Cheritto...
...one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.

992
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:48,600
Also fatally wounded:
...another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...

993
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,400
...during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.

994
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,700
All right, hold him.
It's all right.

995
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:06,800
So?

996
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,800
He's got blood loss and shock.

997
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,700
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

998
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,000
Bottom line?

999
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,100
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1000
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:21,200
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1001
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,300
Six, seven hours.
-That's it?
-That's it.

1002
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:27,000
Take off your shirt.
What?

1003
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,600
Take off your shirt.

1004
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,500
My daughter gave it to me.
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1005
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,200
Listen to me.

1006
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:00,400
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1007
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,100
Where's Charlene?
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1008
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,600
I'm not going without her.

1009
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,400
Think about that.

1010
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:15,000
I will meet you at Nate's.
Where are you going?

1011
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:20,500
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.
Who did it?

1012
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,500
Who wasn't there?

1013
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:25,800
Trejo.

1014
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,400
See you at Nate's.

1015
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,200
You still want me?

1016
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:44,800
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

1017
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,900
Okay, baby.

1018
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,300
I'll be there in two hours.

1019
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,800
All right.

1020
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:55,300
Goddamn you, Chris.

1021
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,900
Goddamn you.

1022
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,000
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1023
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:01,200
Right.

1024
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:51,800
Why did you do it? What happened?

1025
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,700
-They made me.
-Who?

1026
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,100
Where's Anna?

1027
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,600
She's dead.

1028
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:05,000
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1029
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,300
Who did it?

1030
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,100
Who did it?
They had Anna, man.

1031
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:10,300
Who?

1032
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:12,900
Waingro.

1033
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,900
Waingro.

1034
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,900
On his own?

1035
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,500
-For someone.
-Who?

1036
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,800
The other he worked for.

1037
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,600
Van Zant.

1038
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:30,700
Van Zant?

1039
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,500
Are you sure?

1040
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,200
Van Zant.

1041
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,700
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1042
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,000
I don't think so.

1043
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:46,900
Come on.

1044
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,200
I don't remember.

1045
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,700
I'll call a medic.
I'm not going to make it.

1046
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,100
I can't feel nothing.

1047
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:06,800
My Anna's gone.

1048
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,700
She's gone.

1049
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Don't leave me like this.

1050
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,500
Please, homes.

1051
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,700
Don't leave me like this.

1052
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,100
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1053
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,400
It's a new one.

1054
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:57,700
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.
10725.

1055
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:59,400
10725.

1056
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,200
Chris?

1057
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,400
He's with me, my place.

1058
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,400
Next, Waingro, okay?

1059
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,300
You got the time?

1060
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,500
I'll make time.

1061
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,600
And I need a new out.

1062
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,700
Is it blown?

1063
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:18,900
How can I trust it?

1064
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,200
You got it.

1065
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:25,600
Stay healthy.

1066
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:32,800
Charlene Shiherlis.

1067
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:38,100
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.
Neil's transportation.

1068
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:42,300
When we're done here, get on the phone. Somewhere,
someone's trying to put it together for him.

1069
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,700
You don't believe he already had a plan?
Sure. Now he needs another.

1070
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,700
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1071
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:53,100
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1072
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:58,600
He's a C.I. for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.
On Neil McCauley.

1073
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,600
How much time we got?

1074
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:05,300
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1075
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,900
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1076
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,400
Who told you?

1077
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:06,000
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1078
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,500
Who?

1079
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,900
Waingro, where is he?

1080
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,100
Where is he?
How the hell would I know?

1081
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,000
Well...

1082
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,500
...what do we have here?

1083
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,600
This pretty?
This pretty?

1084
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:37,600
You piece of shit.
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1085
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:43,000
You want out? This is out.
-Yeah, what's your end?
-I don't need no stupid broad.

1086
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,000
How'd I get into this?
Easy.

1087
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:49,400
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1088
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:52,800
Fix her a drink.
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1089
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,000
Fuck her.

1090
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:59,200
You better get in there and stay in there.

1091
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,900
Lookie here.

1092
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:09,800
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1093
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,600
He stays with me.

1094
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,500
So, what now?

1095
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,600
He's right.
You want out? This is out.

1096
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:35,000
You believe you have to betray Chris?
No shit.

1097
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,900
That's right. You would have to.

1098
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:42,000
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1099
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:46,900
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1100
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:51,700
...'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1101
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,700
...juvenile facilities.

1102
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:55,700
Then he steals a car.

1103
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,500
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1104
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:03,500
Fucked for life.

1105
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:08,500
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1106
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:13,800
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1107
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,800
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1108
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:21,300
You can do it...

1109
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:24,100
...for your kid, so you can raise him.

1110
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:30,600
What else are you selling?
All kinds of shit.

1111
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,900
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1112
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:46,800
Here's an update.
Drucker's on Line 2.

1113
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,000
Hold on for a second.

1114
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:53,300
Drucker's on the other line.

1115
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,600
Conference him in.

1116
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:57,500
Go ahead.

1117
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,400
Vincent, it's me.

1118
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:04,600
One answer. What's it going to be?

1119
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,800
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1120
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:16,400
That's good. Here's the deal.

1121
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,300
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1122
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,400
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1123
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:27,400
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1124
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,900
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1125
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,300
Van Zant.

1126
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:40,600
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1127
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:44,100
If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.

1128
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:49,800
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...
...under the name Jamieson.

1129
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,200
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1130
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,600
...assignment officers
and snitches in County.

1131
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:02,000
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1132
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:07,300
...and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1133
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,500
How're you feeling?

1134
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,600
Banged up, but I'll live.

1135
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:21,600
He's here.

1136
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,100
Neil is still here.

1137
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:26,800
I can feel it.

1138
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:29,100
For how long?

1139
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:32,600
Seven, eight hours, max.

1140
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,500
What did you do?

1141
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:45,100
That was you?

1142
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,900
I don't sell metal.

1143
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:52,500
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.
We gotta go together.

1144
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,400
Those other people were with you?

1145
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:58,700
My friend, Michael...

1146
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:02,000
...he knew the risks.

1147
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:08,800
When it rains, you get wet.

1148
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:13,300
Get packed. Let's go.

1149
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,300
Why did you do this to me?

1150
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:49,100
It'll be all right.
Do you understand?

1151
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:56,200
It's going to be all right.

1152
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:10,600
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1153
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,400
Here's some cash.

1154
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:21,800
When is it over?

1155
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:27,000
Twenty-two hours from now.

1156
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,800
-Then we get out of here clean.
-When will you let me leave?

1157
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,700
Go now.

1158
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:38,000
You want out? There's the door.

1159
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:40,500
Will you let me leave later?

1160
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,200
It will be different.

1161
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:50,500
Do you even understand?

1162
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,700
It's ready.

1163
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,400
This is my friend Ralph.

1164
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,000
You didn't tell me you were--

1165
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,000
Oh, my God!

1166
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,700
Where's Lauren?

1167
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,600
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1168
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,400
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.
What for?

1169
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,700
Sit down.

1170
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:48,100
Don't you get angry?

1171
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,200
I'm angry.

1172
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:53,600
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1173
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,000
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1174
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,500
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1175
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:05,200
In her ex-husband's...

1176
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:10,200
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...
...if you want to.

1177
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:14,900
But you do not get to watch...

1178
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:17,100
...my fucking...

1179
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:20,300
...television set!
For God's sake.

1180
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:31,700
Put the television set down.
-I never cheated on you, bitch.
-Maybe you should have.

1181
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,900
-I should have?
-You're a party to this.

1182
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.
Our situation is absurd.

1183
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,600
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1184
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:51,200
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1185
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:54,000
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1186
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:57,700
How admirable.
-You bet.
-Except none of it's about us.

1187
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,300
No.

1188
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:03,700
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1189
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:07,000
...you walk through our life dead.

1190
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:11,600
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1191
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:27,200
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1192
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:28,800
The plane...

1193
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:32,100
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1194
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,700
Call letters are 10 11 Sierra.

1195
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:41,400
Touches down...
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1196
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:45,700
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1197
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,200
Where's Chris?

1198
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:49,600
He's gone.

1199
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:51,800
What?

1200
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,900
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1201
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,700
-Did you bring him here?
-Yeah, I did.

1202
02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,800
What happened?

1203
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,200
It's a free country.

1204
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,300
Check in with me at 9:00...

1205
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,600
...everything is still cool.

1206
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,300
All right.

1207
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:40,100
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1208
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,900
I know life is short.

1209
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:47,800
Whatever time you get is luck.

1210
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:51,900
You want to walk?

1211
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,500
You walk right now...

1212
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:59,800
...all on your own.

1213
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:03,100
On your own you choose to come with me.

1214
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,100
All I know is...

1215
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:16,600
...there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1216
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:20,500
...if it's going to be alone...

1217
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:22,800
...without you.

1218
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,400
I got a live one.

1219
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,100
I'll hold.

1220
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:30,200
Show yourself.

1221
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:32,900
-Do it.
-Shut up!

1222
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,800
Now, just one second at the window...

1223
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:42,500
...and it's all over.

1224
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,800
Hey, man...

1225
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:38,700
...you know any place to rent around here?

1226
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,500
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1227
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,900
It's not him.
It's not Chris.

1228
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Unit 2, this is Command.

1229
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,900
Take him at the street.
Check him out.

1230
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:43,400
He's John Peterson.
Valid ID. Car's registered to...

1231
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:45,300
...Bukowski, Gene.

1232
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:48,400
Ran it to DMV.
It's clean.

1233
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:52,700
Let him go.

1234
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,200
Roger.

1235
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:56,700
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1236
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:59,700
It's no-go.

1237
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:12,600
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1238
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:14,600
Yeah, that would be nice.

1239
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,300
What do you got?
Nothing's happening.

1240
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:03,400
Hello, it's Vincent.

1241
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:07,100
What do you got?
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1242
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:08,900
That's it.

1243
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:19,000
You know what?

1244
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,800
Neil is gone.

1245
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:29,600
Flying like a bird.

1246
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:31,700
How do you know?

1247
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:36,600
We still got bait!
-Maybe some time!
-What do we got?

1248
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,300
What do we got?

1249
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1250
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:43,900
You were good.

1251
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:47,600
I'm going to the hotel.

1252
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:50,900
I'm going to take a shower...

1253
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:54,400
...and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1254
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:06,500
Here.

1255
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,800
Come on.

1256
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,400
Shit.

1257
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,400
Motherfucking waste.

1258
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:41,700
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1259
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:44,300
Not you, baby.
Not you.

1260
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:52,300
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1261
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:55,700
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1262
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:05,000
I need somebody to help....

1263
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,500
I got you.

1264
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:16,700
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1265
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:20,600
Let's get a doctor!
Let's go! A doctor here!

1266
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:23,300
-There's your mama.
-Let's just calm down.

1267
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:26,000
-Is she on any drugs?
-I'm calm. No.

1268
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,700
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1269
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,700
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1270
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:36,000
Her pressure's down.

1271
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,600
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.
It's ready.

1272
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:44,500
When's the last time anybody saw her?
I don't know.

1273
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:47,200
Where did you find her?
The bathtub.

1274
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:53,000
Give her large-bore normal saline.
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1275
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:57,100
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1276
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:01,800
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1277
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:05,400
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1278
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:16,000
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.
Her vital signs are stable.

1279
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:19,900
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.
She's okay?

1280
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,700
She's doing good.
She'll be okay.

1281
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:25,100
She's going to be okay.

1282
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:28,300
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1283
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,800
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1284
02:25:37,100 --> 02:25:40,000
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1285
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:45,200
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1286
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:01,300
It's me.

1287
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:04,700
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1288
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,900
I still can't find a driver...
...so that's in the trust.

1289
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,900
One other thing...

1290
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,400
...I gotta tell you.

1291
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,000
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1292
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:21,800
...which I figured you wouldn't.
You figured right.

1293
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,000
So, so long, brother.

1294
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,600
You take it easy.

1295
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:29,800
You're home free.

1296
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,000
Take it easy.

1297
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,100
What is it?

1298
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:46,500
Nothing.

1299
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,100
Home free.

1300
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:29,400
I gotta take care of something.
Is there time?

1301
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:31,600
There's time.

1302
02:28:00,300 --> 02:28:03,200
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1303
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,400
Registration.
This is room service.

1304
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:51,400
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1305
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,600
-They're always doing that.
-I know.
1735.

1306
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:56,200
Thank you.

1307
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,200
Your attention, please.
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1308
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:46,900
Do not panic.

1309
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:49,200
Do not take the elevators.

1310
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:58,800
I'm staying here.
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1311
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:06,100
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1312
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:09,100
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1313
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:12,800
And she chose you.

1314
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:17,300
She picked your place.

1315
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:22,600
It's not right, what happened to her.
No, it's not.

1316
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:41,300
Is there any way that...

1317
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:45,800
...it could work out between us?

1318
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:50,700
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1319
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,100
But...

1320
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:53,800
...in the end....

1321
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:00,500
It's like you said:

1322
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,000
All I am...

1323
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:07,800
...is what I'm going after.

1324
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:17,500
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1325
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,400
Go on, if you have to.

1326
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:36,400
I'll stay.
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1327
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:41,100
Just be careful.

1328
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:44,500
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1329
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:46,500
Okay?

1330
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:51,500
Security. There's a fire on three.
We have to evacuate all floors.

1331
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,300
I can't leave here.

1332
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:05,300
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1333
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:21,000
He's here on 17.

1334
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,000
Look at me.

1335
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:26,400
Look at me!

1336
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:30,800
Look at me!

1337
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:05,800
LAPD! Don't move!
Put your hands on your head!

1338
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:43,100
Switch me to TAC 5.

1339
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:45,100
Casals....

1340
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:46,500
JJ....

1341
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:51,000
Drucker, JJ....
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

1342
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:55,100
What have you got?
Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th floor.

1343
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:59,100
Elevators are all out of commission
because of the fire alarm.

1344
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:00,400
Fine. 10-4.

1345
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:27,400
Let me have that shotgun.

1346
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:47,400
Told you I'm never going back.

1347
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,500
Yeah.
