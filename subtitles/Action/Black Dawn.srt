1
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:00,267
This is where I intercept
with the target?

2
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:02,090
Exactly.

3
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:12,938
Spare no one, Julia.

4
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,407
Or we die slaves.

5
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:18,604
Spare no one, Julia.

6
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:21,478
Spare no one, Julia.

7
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:25,675
Or we die slaves.

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,939
Or we die slaves.

9
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,527
Spare no one, Julia.

10
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,988
Spare no one.

11
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,482
Or we die slaves.

12
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,351
Or we die slaves.

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,959
Spare no one.

14
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,542
Or we die slaves.

15
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,472
Or we die slaves.

16
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,128
Or we die slaves.

17
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,017
Spare no one.

18
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:28,975
Or we die slaves.

19
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:32,173
Or we die slaves.

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,527
-Are we ready to go?
-She's a little nervous.

21
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,597
She's a little nervous.

22
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,325
She's a little nervous.

23
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,503
You'll make a good martyr.

24
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,887
You'll make a good martyr.

25
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:48,719
You'll make a good martyr.

26
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,603
Spare no one.

27
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,569
Meanwhile, all of our comrades
will be getting killed one by one.

28
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,295
It will be worth it.

29
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,376
It will be worth it.

30
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:01,515
It will be worth it.

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,539
Nicholi, you have to be patient.

32
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:15,662
Your moment will come.
Now go. You have work to do.

33
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:07,917
-Spare no one, Julia.
-Or we die slaves.

34
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,382
-Are we ready to go?
-She's a little nervous.

35
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,617
You'll make a good martyr.

36
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:16,201
Now go. You have work to do.

37
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,526
-Yes?
-Turning the corner.

38
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:51,176
Okay.

39
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,801
Stop. Stop.

40
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,790
Get the fuck out.

41
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,959
I thought this was
the high-level security facility.

42
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:33,969
Well, it is. Why, you already in?
You're good.

43
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,984
-Let's go, send me the scan.
-There you go.

44
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,960
Thomas, make sure
the encryptions are right...

45
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:40,779
...I don't wanna get stuck
at that gate.

46
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,521
No, she's good.
Numbers are virtually the same.

47
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,151
Perfect.

48
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,230
That's what I'm talking about.

49
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,158
Let's do it.

50
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,343
Who the hell are you?

51
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,649
-Who the hell are you?
-Prep that arm.

52
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,496
There's a thing called the Geneva
Convention. I've got rights.

53
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,657
-You know about that, do you?
-You are fucking dead.

54
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,817
You are dead.
You are fucking dea--

55
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,341
Doc, you sure you
hit the right vein?

56
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,407
No vein there, it's lM.
Get that bag ready.

57
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,766
-Scary shit.
-Okay, you guys can leave, please.

58
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,107
Nurse.

59
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,519
Doctor.

60
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:30,122
He's going into anaphylactic shock.
Get me 2 c's of epi, right now.

61
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:33,039
We'll work on the airway later.
We'll have to transfer him.

62
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,786
He's a red wristband. We can't.

63
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,662
Well, we're gonna have to.
I don't have the facilities here.

64
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:43,436
-Under whose authority?
-Under mine.

65
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,413
I'll call an ambulance.

66
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,180
-Open the gate.
-We've got a flatliner.

67
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,939
We're transporting now.

68
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:17,005
Get him up.
All right, move it, move it.

69
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:48,811
Stop the vehicle.

70
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,839
Wait a minute. What's going on?
You're not a doctor.

71
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:39,660
Been away so long, it even
feels good to be stuck in L.A. traffic.

72
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,410
I hope my brother cut you
a good deal.

73
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,643
It was worth the trouble.

74
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,812
How many years were you
in the system?

75
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:52,299
For long enough
to know my way around.

76
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:54,920
So do you have any other skills...

77
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,196
...or do you just break people
out of prisons?

78
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,527
What kind of skills
are you looking for?

79
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,912
Do you know
what a little fat boy is?

80
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,683
Why would you ask a question
like that?

81
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:14,988
Jonathan Cold, ex-ClA.

82
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,502
Current freelance operative
specialized in covert operations...

83
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:23,791
...and nuclear-weapons intelligence.

84
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,543
I don't recall leaving my resume
with you people...

85
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,423
...but I'm impressed with the way
you've done your homework.

86
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,880
Who do you think employed you,
Mr. Cold?

87
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:36,558
You don't think I'd entrust
my freedom to my baby brother.

88
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,778
You're here because I wanted
you here, simple as that.

89
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,653
So, what's your day rate?

90
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,399
I can't believe you're safe.

91
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,996
Good to see you, brother.

92
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,501
Wait a minute.

93
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:28,299
Jesus Christ. That's Jonathan Cold.

94
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,769
God, I thought he was dead.

95
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,553
Who is Jonathan Cold?

96
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,723
He taught me everything I know.

97
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,184
-I had excellent help getting here.
-Expensive help.

98
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,162
Come on inside, Mr. Cold.
Get you the rest of your money.

99
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:47,753
No hurry. Mr. Cold's gonna be
staying around for a while.

100
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,340
A robbery in the Amsterdam
Diamond District.

101
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,410
Interpol believes a Chechen
resistance group is responsible...

102
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:05,132
...for this and a string
of other robberies across Europe...

103
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:07,273
...presumably to finance
their political goals.

104
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:10,065
Joining us is Dr. Richard Turpin...

105
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,424
...an expert on European terrorism.
Thank you.

106
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,813
Besides funding their operations
with daring robberies...

107
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,183
... what else do we know
about this organization?

108
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:22,795
A year ago, their leader,
Aslan Masklov, was assassinated...

109
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,937
...in what is believed to be
a CIA hit.

110
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:28,462
The group has intensified
its terrorist activities since...

111
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,529
...and vows vengeance
on the United States.

112
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,405
Good job getting my brother
out of that place.

113
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,489
Yeah, my pleasure.

114
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:45,935
What exactly does he want you
to do for him?

115
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,716
Well, why don't you ask him?

116
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,590
-You forget who's paying you.
-I made the deal with your brother.

117
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,757
If you have any issues,
why don't you take them up with him.

118
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,586
Don't get too comfortable.

119
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,686
Any movement?

120
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:31,731
Nothing yet. They're just waiting.

121
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,356
So tell me about your friend.

122
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,261
Well, he was my first handler.

123
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,370
One of the best operatives
in the field.

124
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,677
So why's he working
for the bad guys?

125
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,838
I'm not sure.

126
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:54,378
Rumor has it he turned tables, killed
six agents and then disappeared.

127
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,186
Now he's classified as a foreigner.

128
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:34,030
There's a shoot-on-sight
sanction on foreigner operatives.

129
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,774
-lf he's seen, he's dead.
-Exactly. So why is he here?

130
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:43,466
This isn't his style.

131
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,383
I'm gonna call Greer and fill him in.

132
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,395
-Greer.
-Stuart here.

133
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,636
Looks like we got a little party
going on.

134
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,462
Donovan just showed up.

135
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:04,335
Interesting. Have you heard
of any prison breaks?

136
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,656
Nope. But he had an escort.
Jonathan Cold.

137
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,128
Cold?

138
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:13,586
Are you sure? Intel says he died
last year in Prague.

139
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,301
Well, he's here,
and I'm pretty sure he's not dead.

140
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:18,315
You know him?

141
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,812
Yeah.

142
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,092
A long time ago.

143
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,906
Be careful. Dead or alive,
Cold is a dangerous man.

144
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,759
Should we alert
the Marshals Service?

145
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:31,372
-Let them know we found their man?
-No. Stay dark.

146
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:33,296
Donovan is only one piece
of the puzzle.

147
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:37,648
I wanna know exactly what they're
up to before we make our move.

148
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,689
Yes, sir.

149
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:46,096
Finally, we have reached
our targett

150
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:49,011
The great city of Los Angeles.

151
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,095
One more time, that's all.

152
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:56,815
One more.

153
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,308
Then we have enough.

154
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,755
And then everything changes.

155
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,784
It's big. See how much bigger it is...

156
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,869
...than the one your boyfriend
bought you?

157
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,678
But size isn't everything.
Believe me, I know.

158
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,462
Girlfriend, they'll hear
wedding bells looking at that.

159
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:23,950
Hands in the air.

160
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:37,422
Come here. Come here.

161
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,916
-Open it.
-I don't have the combination.

162
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:54,768
I can't.

163
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,901
How about now?

164
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:07,058
Come on. Come on. Do it.

165
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,026
Take a breath.

166
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:16,722
Now, one at a time.

167
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,242
That wasn't so hard, was it?

168
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,522
Only two types of sales make the kind
of money I like:. drugs and weapons.

169
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,657
I hate drugs. You still interested?

170
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:08,431
Well, that would depend
on what's in it for me.

171
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,078
Two hundred K up-front.
Another 800 when the job is done.

172
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,423
-I'm listening.
-lf you were me...

173
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,247
...would you buy this?

174
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,898
-No.
-Why not?

175
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,206
Because there's only half
the schematic there.

176
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,064
It's a teaser from the seller.

177
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,194
That's right. You see,
in this business...

178
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:33,652
...the keys to the kingdom
is weapons-grade plutonium.

179
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:36,496
If you ain't got that,
you ain't got shit.

180
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,914
You'd be surprised how generous
the local nuclear test program is.

181
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,498
You just have to know who to ask.

182
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,163
I heard that.

183
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:48,014
Jonathan's in.

184
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,723
-lsn't that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

185
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:55,501
Need to talk to you.

186
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,929
Give us a minute.

187
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,995
Relax, James.
You're getting yourself all worked up.

188
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:13,077
I don't trust him. I want him out.

189
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:17,099
I trust money. He needs us
more than we need him.

190
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,697
Three years you've been gone.

191
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,063
Three years I've been
putting this deal together.

192
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,156
The people, the product.
All me, all me, all me.

193
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:29,673
I've risked my ass to get you home,
and it's still not enough?

194
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:32,693
-When do I get a say?
-You did good.

195
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,641
I'm proud of you.

196
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:38,636
But you didn't get me out. He did.

197
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:41,642
Cold stays.

198
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,603
They called. They wanna meet
tomorrow morning.

199
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:49,652
-We're not ready.
-They are.

200
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:55,402
Well, then. I guess we're gonna
have a busy night.

201
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,535
What is a common criminal
like James doing hanging out...

202
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,549
...with a Russian nuclear physicist
like Myshkin?

203
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,914
Okay, let's just say,
for argument's sake...

204
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,664
...that they're trying to build a nuke.

205
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,807
Where would they get
the plutonium?

206
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,361
There are two power stations
in Oakland...

207
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:19,445
...and a test facility in Pasadena.

208
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,801
Okay, the test lab in Pasadena
is a civilian facility.

209
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:25,006
Start there,
the security should be lighter.

210
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:26,931
Then find a list
of their new employees...

211
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:28,817
...and run backgrounds
through the grid.

212
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:33,421
I'm gonna take a walk,
so keep your cell phone on.

213
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,439
All right. Time to give it up, baby.

214
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,098
-Morning.
-Good morning.

215
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,420
Sorry, I was--

216
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:07,216
Much better.

217
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:12,269
Can't beat this weather,
can you, Mr. Macabe?

218
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,997
Better than Los Alamos.

219
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,305
Bet you're happy
you got transferred here.

220
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,713
-Every day.
-Have a nice day.

221
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,219
You too.

222
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,201
Keep moving.

223
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:14,607
Find anything?

224
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,225
Gun.

225
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,077
Please.

226
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:21,904
I thought we were all
on the same team.

227
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:26,327
I trust my men. No one else.

228
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,072
You know what, you can't
kill everybody you don't trust.

229
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:33,103
I owe you once
for bringing him back.

230
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,535
Won't ask twice.

231
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,776
Is that right?

232
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,891
Get his phone.

233
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:25,837
Follow me.

234
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,455
Yeah. Hey, Myshkin's here.

235
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:07,702
-Doctor, a pleasure as always.
-You said no guns.

236
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,519
No need to worry. Want me
to get you something to drink?

237
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:13,549
Where is my money?

238
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,617
Very well.

239
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,463
Business first.

240
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,552
I believe you have something for me.

241
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:32,690
I tell you, she is very delicate.

242
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,855
Based on the Mk-54 design.

243
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:40,277
But with 23 microprocessors
and eight charges.

244
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:44,944
Each precisely calibrated to fire
within two microseconds of the next.

245
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:49,648
Implosion causes the core to reach
critical mass and then....

246
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:50,862
Well, then...

247
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,463
...you know the rest.

248
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:57,332
Yeah, she should yield a 5-kiloton
charge. Just like you asked.

249
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:01,456
Small but powerful. Like the heart,
if you will.

250
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:04,174
A child can carry this.

251
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:12,084
Here is the rest of my test results...

252
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,061
...along with the rest of the plans.

253
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:21,458
They are all there. You can look.
Go ahead.

254
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:27,158
Then I guess we have a deal.

255
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,779
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

256
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,662
Brother, where's the password?

257
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,624
The ignition sequences are missing.

258
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,731
Without the numbers,
there's no boom.

259
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:43,700
Is this how friends behave?

260
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:47,985
It is only an insurance policy.

261
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,604
Please, I am not a stupid man.

262
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,068
The numbers.

263
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:57,711
When I get to my car, you will have
everything that you need.

264
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,109
I cannot spend my money
if I'm a dead man.

265
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,984
Go with James.

266
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,471
Thank you very much.

267
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,005
What?

268
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,846
You're a piece of shit, that's what.

269
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,776
That hurt. I did it for you.

270
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,303
You wanted...

271
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,072
...to get paid, right?

272
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:19,472
Oh, yeah, it's all about
the money, huh?

273
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,166
If these are the wrong numbers...

274
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,459
...it'll be interesting to see
what your next trick is.

275
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:29,038
Thank you.

276
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,424
Greer, it's Stuart.

277
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,925
Look, this is going down right now.

278
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,121
-It's good?
-lt is.

279
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,946
Give me the book.

280
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:46,476
Who you selling this to?

281
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:52,526
Since when do you ask questions,
Mr. Cold?

282
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:53,940
It's not your style.

283
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:57,230
You know what, you're right.
I don't know what got into me.

284
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:08,312
What if they try to screw us?

285
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:11,858
-They won't.
-What if they do?

286
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:14,838
It will make no difference.

287
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:18,100
They will all be glowing in the dark
in the end.

288
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:23,889
We are days away from
realizing Aslan's dream. Just days.

289
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:27,606
No more petty crimes.
No more blowing up buses.

290
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:31,607
We are ready to die,
and they are not.

291
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,795
-They're here.
-Copy.

292
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,870
We have an appointment.

293
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,494
No guns.

294
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:54,775
You first.

295
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,635
No guns.

296
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,728
No deal.

297
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:10,160
Those two stay here.

298
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,485
Do you have the diamonds?

299
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,071
Where are the rest?

300
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:12,175
When we have the device and
the plutonium, you get a key.

301
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,098
Key to what?

302
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:17,330
A large safe-deposit box
full of diamonds.

303
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,805
A lot of diamonds.

304
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,245
Our friend, Mr. Cold,
ran a complete diagnostic.

305
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:28,211
It passed with flying colors.
Here's the rest of your plans.

306
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:39,124
Password.

307
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,733
Well, Mr. Macabe.

308
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,929
Looks like you're not exactly
who you say you are.

309
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:02,323
Who the fuck are you?

310
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:06,318
Where is she?

311
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,179
Who?

312
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:10,097
Where is she?

313
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,819
What's he got?

314
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,864
Yeah, be quiet, you bitch.

315
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,424
So where's my plutonium?

316
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:05,269
As I told you, we have to wait.

317
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,499
-How long?
-A day at most.

318
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,979
-Hey, look what I found here.
-Who the hell is this?

319
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,026
Maybe we should be asking you.
Were you followed?

320
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:26,226
-We're being set up.
-Hold it.

321
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,012
Who are you?

322
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:36,281
-I'm a reporter for the Times.
-Since when do reporters carry guns?

323
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:41,169
Directional mike,
telescopic zoom.

324
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,328
-You spooks are all the same.
-ClA?

325
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,708
-Please don't--
-Shut up.

326
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:58,072
How many of your friends
are out there?

327
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,338
Just shoot her.

328
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:03,738
You wanna live...

329
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,744
...you'd better find something to say.

330
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:23,700
What a silly girl.

331
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:25,043
Well, have it your way.

332
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,752
I'm disappointed, Jonathan.
I thought we had an agreement.

333
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:36,182
-Shit happens, you know?
-I don't give a shit.

334
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:24,305
-Get them.
-No. Nobody move.

335
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:26,961
They have seen us.
They know who we are.

336
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:29,399
They know what you're doing.

337
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:30,871
Nicholi.

338
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:33,935
Then you'd better get them.

339
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,694
Go. Now.

340
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,475
Stupid, stupid idiot.

341
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,372
I knew it.

342
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,529
Jonathan Cold.

343
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:17,681
Good to know you still have
the magic touch.

344
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,092
It's a shame you don't.

345
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,450
I mean, what was that, How to
Surrender to the Bad Guy 1 01?

346
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,856
You are my teacher,
O master of spook.

347
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,499
Apparently not.
You haven't learned a goddamn thing.

348
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:42,705
I'm in.

349
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,664
Get out of the way.

350
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,147
-Find the lever.
-What?

351
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:07,476
Shit.

352
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,181
Hold on.

353
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:32,914
Shit!

354
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,250
There are no brakes.
We're gonna have to jump.

355
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,722
What?

356
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:01,362
Jump.

357
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:28,725
Enjoy the ride?

358
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:38,107
Well, it's nice to be appreciated
anyway.

359
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:40,313
You want to tell me...

360
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:43,288
...what you and your new best buddies
are planning to do?

361
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:45,239
Oh, let me see.

362
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:48,436
Shoot you in the head and make
Vegas beachfront property.

363
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,217
Yeah. With your help.

364
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:55,129
Look, these guys have access
to the plutonium now.

365
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:56,468
You know what that means?

366
00:43:56,668 --> 00:44:00,148
They could make a bomb right quick.
We don't have time for this.

367
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,245
I can't believe that
you are a part of this.

368
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:10,841
We work for the same people.
Just on a little different level.

369
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:15,669
You disappeared for six years.
You expect me to believe this bullshit?

370
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:20,409
Believe what you want.
I'll brief you later.

371
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:22,931
You can't just walk away, Jonathan.

372
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:31,441
-So, what do you want me to do?
-Whatever it takes.

373
00:44:31,644 --> 00:44:34,328
Right now, that just means
getting out of here.

374
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:58,395
Try these.

375
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,747
-Where we going?
-The warehouse.

376
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,601
You know, back in the day,
one of the first things I taught you is:.

377
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:10,739
When you're on the run, never
go back to where you came from.

378
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:15,059
You're on the run, not me.
And I gotta find my partner.

379
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,100
Looks like he's been doing
his homework.

380
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:23,762
It's Macabe.

381
00:45:35,004 --> 00:45:36,759
It's me.

382
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:38,518
He found him.

383
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:42,071
Yes, sir.

384
00:45:45,149 --> 00:45:47,515
It's a bad day for you.

385
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:56,947
-Any idea who those Russians are?
-Well, that's a good question, isn't it?

386
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,570
For someone who's on the inside,
you don't know very much.

387
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,434
You think?

388
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,883
Look, why would they classify you
as a foreigner...

389
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:06,645
...if you still work with the agency?

390
00:46:06,845 --> 00:46:09,430
Darling, you just need to
hang around me for a little while.

391
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:12,149
Let me get you up to speed.
You're a bit out of your league.

392
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:15,738
-Then help me understand.
-The agency...

393
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,327
...has four top-secret columns.

394
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:22,321
Those columns are dedicated
to doing work...

395
00:46:22,524 --> 00:46:26,103
...that's probably considered by
many people to be immoral or illegal.

396
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:28,635
Nonetheless, it's stuff we have to do
in the interest...

397
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,545
...of the United States' security
all over the world.

398
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,810
I belong to one of those columns.

399
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,020
There's two people above me,
two people below me.

400
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,774
Nobody else knows about me.
Nobody but you right now.

401
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:42,966
So that means folks might try
to come and kill you.

402
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:46,164
I'm a senior agent.
Why wouldn't I know about this?

403
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:50,588
Well, what do you think
the agency's main m.o. is?

404
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:52,380
Disinformation.

405
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:55,923
That's right. What do you think the
greatest business in the world is?

406
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:58,711
-Drugs.
-And above that, there's war.

407
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,698
Okay, it's the same old
song and dance...

408
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:04,690
...but busting an international
arms dealer out of jail?

409
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,965
Placing nukes in the hands
of baby-faced fanatics?

410
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:09,402
I mean, come on.
This doesn't make any sense.

411
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:11,866
This is not exactly what you think.

412
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,929
I think you know me well enough
to know I couldn't have opened up...

413
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:18,745
...a coffee shop or something. So how
long you been watching these folks?

414
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:20,314
Two months.

415
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,964
We've been following him
since Philadelphia.

416
00:47:24,637 --> 00:47:25,585
I think this is a bad idea.

417
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:28,276
It'll be worth it if Max has a lead
on the plutonium.

418
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:30,616
If it don't work, we'll
have to shoot our way out.

419
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,011
Fuck.

420
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:41,430
They're in.

421
00:47:41,627 --> 00:47:43,417
Yes, sir.

422
00:47:59,806 --> 00:48:01,333
Oh, my God.

423
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,802
Oh, Christ, Max.

424
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:06,556
Who did this?

425
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,880
Stuart, this place has been
compromised.

426
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:12,466
-We gotta get out of here.
-No.

427
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:16,346
I gotta find some information.
He left me something.

428
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,803
Listen to me. There's no time.
We gotta go.

429
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,167
I've gotta find it.

430
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,620
Stuart, gotta go. Now.

431
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:29,367
-Let's go.
-Just wait.

432
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,407
Agent Stuart.

433
00:48:53,757 --> 00:48:55,035
Greer?

434
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,079
What are you doing here?

435
00:48:59,614 --> 00:49:01,620
Pierson called me in.

436
00:49:01,821 --> 00:49:04,090
-What happened here?
-Why don't you tell us.

437
00:49:04,604 --> 00:49:06,198
No, don't do it.

438
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:08,790
What's he doing here?

439
00:49:09,374 --> 00:49:12,374
He's helping me. Please, sir, just...

440
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:14,580
...put the gun down. I can explain.

441
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,337
You're lucky to be alive.

442
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:26,972
So, what exactly did Pierson dig up
that got him killed?

443
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:30,077
We're not sure.

444
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:33,749
Myshkin showed up last night
and Max and I got separated...

445
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:36,469
...and we came back here...

446
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,350
...and this is how we found him.

447
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,658
That's it?

448
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:45,176
Who's this guy down here?
Is he one of yours?

449
00:49:47,709 --> 00:49:51,420
There's a leak within the agency. A
small faction is working off the grid.

450
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,996
We don't know why or what they're
after, but you may not be safe.

451
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:58,231
-Me?
-Look around, this was no accident.

452
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:02,138
Come on. I'll bring you in.
Debrief you on the way.

453
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,895
You're gonna trust him?

454
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,789
What the fuck are you doing?!

455
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,083
Go, go, go.

456
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,279
Move it, move it, move it.

457
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:01,432
You all right, man?

458
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:04,281
I'm good, but there's some people
up there that are no good.

459
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:06,748
Not doing too good up there.

460
00:52:39,934 --> 00:52:41,429
-Did you get them yet?
-Not yet.

461
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,112
-But my people are on it.
-That does not sound very reassuring.

462
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:48,212
With the ClA after us,
we have to move up our time line.

463
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,974
I need my plutonium now.

464
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:52,216
Yeah?

465
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:54,967
You really gonna do it?

466
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:01,946
I need a place
to put this thing together.

467
00:53:02,142 --> 00:53:04,030
-What kind of place?
-Metal workshop.

468
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,802
With a lathe and C4.
Something clean and discreet.

469
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,821
And we need protection.

470
00:53:10,016 --> 00:53:12,634
I'm gonna need more. A lot more.

471
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,178
Don't you worry. We have vacuumed
half the globe for diamonds.

472
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,198
You will be well rewarded when
you complete your end of the deal.

473
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,686
Diamonds will be the only currency
worth anything for the next 1 0 years.

474
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:25,781
You will be a very rich man
in the new global economy.

475
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:30,645
Just be bloody sure I'm not here
when it goes off.

476
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:34,973
You get me my plutonium, I'll give you
1 2 hours to get out of town.

477
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,270
If Cold comes back, he's mine.

478
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:40,474
You just get me what I need.

479
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,039
I almost forgot. Again.

480
00:53:56,094 --> 00:53:57,949
Mr. Macabe.

481
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:16,919
I'm sorry that it's so late.

482
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,026
No problem, Mr. Brown.
Everything has gone through.

483
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:23,637
The helicopter will be available
from tomorrow onward, sir.

484
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,971
-Okay. Thanks.
-Have a good evening.

485
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,022
And you.

486
00:54:53,726 --> 00:54:56,859
-Yes.
-Are you alone?

487
00:54:57,055 --> 00:55:00,022
Damn it, what is wrong
with using the lnternet?

488
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:03,223
Relax. Just checking in.
Do you have it?

489
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:07,669
I got one more run.

490
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,931
-After that, I'll have enough.
-Good. Where is it?

491
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:14,554
Well, it's not here.

492
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:19,127
-But it's safe.
-Get it ready. It's almost time.

493
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:07,230
Still broken, Mr. Brown.

494
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:02,778
Contact your seller.

495
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:05,496
-We'll be ready in four hours.
-Yeah.

496
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:07,158
Hey.

497
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:10,806
Go over my escape plan
if I were you.

498
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:19,295
Round up some men.

499
00:58:20,448 --> 00:58:22,619
Get moving. We have no time.

500
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:53,790
-Can I talk to you?
-Talk.

501
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:57,048
I have a bad feeling about this.

502
00:58:57,249 --> 00:58:59,452
I don't trust these men, Nicholi.

503
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:01,787
As long as we stay focused,
we'll be fine.

504
00:59:01,984 --> 00:59:06,393
The timing is not right anymore.
The ClA knows what we're up to.

505
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:11,067
-Why don't we wait it out?
-There is no more waiting.

506
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,142
Who else wants to quit?

507
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:24,407
Nobody wants to quit, Nicholi.

508
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:28,700
But we don't want to get ourselves
killed before we push the button.

509
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:32,344
-We don't want to die like Julia.
-Julia, she sacrificed herself.

510
00:59:32,544 --> 00:59:34,333
We vowed to be martyrs...

511
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:36,794
...not corpses without a cause.

512
00:59:37,378 --> 00:59:40,312
There is no more time to waste.

513
00:59:40,512 --> 00:59:42,781
I am finishing this.
With or without you.

514
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:53,240
Room 467, 6:.00.

515
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:54,618
Right.

516
00:59:55,937 --> 00:59:58,392
Got four guys heading that way.
Plane's on the runway.

517
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:01,276
-Whenever we get there, it's ours.
-Good. Cool.

518
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:06,813
Are you ready to give up your home
to a bunch of lunatics?

519
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:09,397
Yeah.

520
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:11,324
Well...

521
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:13,911
...fuck them.

522
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:19,608
Once we get the key,
we waste them. Yeah?

523
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,437
-May I help you?
-Hi, I'm with the EPA.

524
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:33,494
-I have a meeting with Dr. Macabe.
-Well, Mr. Macabe's right down there.

525
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,637
If you hurry, you might be able
to catch him.

526
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,492
Thank you.

527
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:51,934
-Fuck.
-Hey, Billy.

528
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:55,195
Cold? I'd heard you were dead.

529
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:56,702
Devil didn't want me, Billy.

530
01:00:56,897 --> 01:00:59,547
-Just didn't want me at all.
-Yeah, okay.

531
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:01,467
You know, I was thinking.

532
01:01:01,664 --> 01:01:04,031
If you didn't wanna get found...

533
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:05,786
...you should leave the suburbs.

534
01:01:06,753 --> 01:01:09,885
Yeah, well, the rent's cheap,
you know?

535
01:01:10,081 --> 01:01:13,080
Listen, I was wondering if
you could do me a big favor.

536
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:18,272
Can you use all of your tricky-dicky
spooky talent that you got there?

537
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:20,254
Can you take a look
into my old company...

538
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:22,075
...check out some supervisors?

539
01:01:22,273 --> 01:01:26,266
One named Greer, G-R-E-E-R,
and see what you come up with?

540
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,024
-That's it?
-Well, no, that's not it.

541
01:01:28,225 --> 01:01:29,917
I got a few more things.

542
01:01:30,113 --> 01:01:31,968
And if I do this...

543
01:01:32,162 --> 01:01:33,984
...you won't kill me, right?

544
01:01:34,178 --> 01:01:36,153
No, I don't kill people.
But you know what...

545
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:38,774
...I got something better for you.
Do this for me right...

546
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:42,239
...I'm gonna hook you into some
TS lntel that even you can't reach.

547
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:45,052
-A real lifesaver, you hear me?
-Okay. That's--

548
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,519
I'm gonna do that now.
Just give me a minute.

549
01:01:52,065 --> 01:01:55,000
-Just takes a minute.
-Hey, man, I got all day.

550
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,295
Load up.

551
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:32,406
Follow me.

552
01:02:46,466 --> 01:02:47,674
Someone's been busy.

553
01:02:47,872 --> 01:02:51,169
Eastern Europe, Balkans,
Estonia, Chechnya.

554
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:52,539
On what's he been working?

555
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:55,737
Oil, gas, uranium.

556
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,825
He's guarding assets.

557
01:02:58,049 --> 01:03:00,667
Well, he's been dark
for about two years...

558
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,516
...and then last year
he took over as the district chief.

559
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:07,831
Look, I need you to see if you can
check any e-mails in the last 72 hours.

560
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,474
Oh, yeah, sure. You mean his
personal, highly encrypted e-mails?

561
01:03:12,674 --> 01:03:16,056
-ls that what you want me to do?
-Look, look. Just do it, okay?

562
01:03:16,257 --> 01:03:19,606
And find out if the nearest nuclear test
facility is and if there's been any...

563
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:22,363
...cross-contamination with any
of his guys, stuff like that.

564
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:25,726
Oh, yeah. Sure. It's really--
It's very simple. Yeah. Okay.

565
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:28,475
I'll do that.
It's-- It might take me a minute.

566
01:03:57,538 --> 01:03:58,999
Yeah?

567
01:04:00,354 --> 01:04:02,077
All right, I'll be there.

568
01:04:57,729 --> 01:04:59,868
Don't do it.

569
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:03,228
Throw the gun over there now.

570
01:05:03,425 --> 01:05:06,622
-Look, I'm ClA.
-Who isn't nowadays?

571
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:09,146
Toss it.

572
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:11,133
Now.

573
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,734
Now where's the plutonium?

574
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:38,650
Oh, you bitch.

575
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:09,089
Son of a bitch.

576
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,639
Where the hell is it?

577
01:06:18,402 --> 01:06:21,600
This guy's connected.
All black ops.

578
01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:25,470
Chechnya, Balkans, Estonia.
Same.

579
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:29,050
Just like my old friend.

580
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:32,546
-Who else?
-Well, wait a minute, I got a hit.

581
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:35,133
Julius Macabe.

582
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:39,001
Employed eight months.
Top-level security clearance...

583
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,789
...plutonium disposal technician?

584
01:06:41,987 --> 01:06:43,994
Yeah. Yeah, okay,
that sounds like fun.

585
01:06:44,194 --> 01:06:48,537
-Yeah. What does the e-mail say?
-Look, I told you, I can't open it.

586
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,200
These guys are whales.

587
01:06:50,403 --> 01:06:55,356
They're triple-encryption and blinds,
all sorts of shit. It would take weeks.

588
01:06:55,555 --> 01:06:58,718
-I can't do it. I'm sorry.
-All right, okay. Give me an address.

589
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,703
All right, fine.

590
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,744
All right. That's about 1 0 blocks
from here.

591
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:07,964
Listen, Cold, I actually--
I got some bad news for you.

592
01:07:08,163 --> 01:07:11,840
In putting together
all of these names, l--

593
01:07:12,035 --> 01:07:15,262
Them showing
up in one locale like this...

594
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:18,393
...it's obvious that a cleanup team
is coming to hit you.

595
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:22,785
And these guys are-- They're the best.
Hey, wait. What about my bonus?

596
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:26,142
Get out of L.A. right away.

597
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:29,753
What the hell does that mean?

598
01:07:29,954 --> 01:07:32,955
"Get out of L.A. now."

599
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:36,250
Oh, fuck me. This--

600
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:57,693
Yeah, this is Harry Brown
from Tishman.

601
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:00,510
I just wanted to check on my rental.

602
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:06,973
Very good. Thank you very much.

603
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:34,945
My man.

604
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:38,688
What's up?

605
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:59,480
Oh, excuse me.
The elevator's broken.

606
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,392
Yeah? May I use your phone?

607
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:09,312
Thank you.

608
01:11:09,858 --> 01:11:11,714
Stairs?

609
01:11:21,765 --> 01:11:24,000
It's gotta be in here.

610
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:51,487
Gotcha.

611
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:04,480
Oh, shit.

612
01:12:41,763 --> 01:12:44,797
Room 667. Said he'd be here.

613
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:55,070
Who the hell are you?

614
01:12:58,435 --> 01:13:00,161
Be quiet.

615
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,490
-Shit.
-Who the fuck is this?

616
01:13:06,885 --> 01:13:08,509
He's dead.
Package is in the bathroom.

617
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:11,034
It's not here.

618
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:12,895
That's it.

619
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:16,320
-Where is it? Tell me right now.
-We can end this now if you want.

620
01:13:16,515 --> 01:13:18,077
Not now, Nicholi.

621
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,787
You better not be
fucking with me, man.

622
01:13:21,987 --> 01:13:24,443
-I kill you.
-Go ahead.

623
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:30,593
Sweep the hallway. Let's go.

624
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,072
Listen, if we retrieve this plutonium,
we can save the op.

625
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:49,919
You guys make it around back,
meet me in the center.

626
01:13:50,116 --> 01:13:53,793
You're my team. Let's do this.
Make it right.

627
01:14:08,357 --> 01:14:10,080
This isn't what it looks like.

628
01:14:10,277 --> 01:14:12,697
I don't know her.
This is not--

629
01:14:12,901 --> 01:14:14,495
It's not--

630
01:14:15,236 --> 01:14:18,083
Hey. Check it.

631
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:06,622
Stupid bitch.

632
01:15:49,636 --> 01:15:51,426
Dial 91 1, man.

633
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:57,219
-This is it.
-Where's my key?

634
01:15:59,142 --> 01:16:01,312
-Where am I going?
-Sun Country Bank, San Diego.

635
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:03,875
-I wouldn't dilly-dally if I were you.
-Let's move.

636
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:53,829
Don't move.

637
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:16,254
Where's Sergey? Where's Fedor?

638
01:17:16,742 --> 01:17:19,676
What happened? Nicholi, tell me.

639
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:22,813
-What's going on?
-Shut up and drive.

640
01:17:34,053 --> 01:17:36,061
I thought you were dead.

641
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:40,389
-You all right?
-Yeah. Okay.

642
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:48,957
Yeah, just park it right there.

643
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:09,155
-Can you open the door, please?
-We're closed.

644
01:18:09,349 --> 01:18:12,165
-Can you let me in? Please. Please.
-We're closed.

645
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:14,080
-Let me in.
-Come on.

646
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:17,729
Please, open.

647
01:18:24,677 --> 01:18:27,359
Thank you. Thank you so much.

648
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:31,169
My father's working late upstairs,
and my cell phone died.

649
01:18:31,365 --> 01:18:32,511
Can you buzz him?

650
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:35,936
Please?

651
01:18:37,925 --> 01:18:39,267
What's your dad's name?

652
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:42,910
Bob.

653
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,073
Where is the damn elevator?

654
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:01,120
Shit.

655
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:04,738
We detonate here.

656
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,958
So where would you detonate
a nuke if you were the Chechens?

657
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,221
Wherever I could inflict
maximum damage.

658
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:24,385
Listen, I found a credit card
receipt in Macabe's house.

659
01:19:24,582 --> 01:19:27,845
It's for a dummy corporation
that he set up at the Vox and Billing.

660
01:19:28,037 --> 01:19:30,559
-He's renting space there.
-What for?

661
01:19:30,758 --> 01:19:33,692
If he rents space there, he has access
to the corporate helipad.

662
01:19:35,846 --> 01:19:38,366
-And that's what you're talking about.
-Oh, yeah.

663
01:19:38,598 --> 01:19:40,486
-Maximum damage.
-That's what I'm saying.

664
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:50,373
Best way to escape a small nuke
has to be in a helicopter.

665
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,633
It makes sense, but how did he know
they would come here?

666
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,220
I think there's somebody else.

667
01:19:57,032 --> 01:19:58,624
Who you working?

668
01:19:58,823 --> 01:20:00,732
I was supposed to be on James
and his people.

669
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:02,623
But we weren't supposed
to make a move...

670
01:20:02,821 --> 01:20:05,059
...just report his whereabouts. Why?

671
01:20:05,253 --> 01:20:09,052
-Who did you report to?
-Only to Greer.

672
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:18,272
There's gotta be another way
in here.

673
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:29,723
We did it.

674
01:20:32,614 --> 01:20:36,476
In moments, we will be heroes.

675
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:51,906
Wouldn't want you to set that
until I'm safely out of here.

676
01:20:54,022 --> 01:20:58,495
Ingenious, how you put this together.
You were a good choice, Nicholi.

677
01:20:58,693 --> 01:21:00,320
Who the fuck are you?

678
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:03,166
Who do you think could
pull off a job like this?

679
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:05,058
Not you, not Aslan.

680
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,202
Me.

681
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,175
You are nobody.

682
01:21:10,504 --> 01:21:11,964
I am everything to you.

683
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:15,680
You are here because
I put you here. I created Aslan.

684
01:21:15,879 --> 01:21:18,814
I told him to detonate it here.
That's who I am.

685
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:22,401
You burn in hell, you pig.

686
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:38,435
-Step away from the device.
-Cold.

687
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:42,589
You don't know what you're doing.
I'm after the same ends as you.

688
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:46,209
You don't know who I work for
or who I work with.

689
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,822
Now step away from the device now.
Don't do anything else.

690
01:21:50,023 --> 01:21:51,878
Don't move. Just do that.

691
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:55,809
You know I can still push this button
even with a bullet in me.

692
01:21:56,998 --> 01:21:58,460
You're not a martyr, Greer.

693
01:22:00,134 --> 01:22:03,036
You don't understand,
this has to be done.

694
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,752
Step away from the device now.

695
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,827
Check the security desk. There
should be a switch for the elevator.

696
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,209
-Shut it off.
-I can't.

697
01:22:22,407 --> 01:22:25,025
If I touch anything,
it might go off.

698
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,171
So, what are we gonna do?

699
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,189
I just wanna get this away
from people.

700
01:22:37,383 --> 01:22:40,383
I'm gonna see if I can get up
on the roof and in the chopper.

701
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,628
Okay, thank you very much
for everything.

702
01:23:06,822 --> 01:23:10,238
-Thank you. Now get out.
-No.

703
01:23:10,888 --> 01:23:14,183
Listen, it's too dangerous.
I really appreciate you coming.

704
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,358
See you later.

705
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,537
No.

706
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,350
Hang on.

707
01:24:38,983 --> 01:24:40,477
We're probably gonna die,
aren't we?

708
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:42,567
How deep is it?

709
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,024
What?

710
01:24:45,224 --> 01:24:47,875
How deep do you think
the water is here?

711
01:24:52,775 --> 01:24:55,808
I don't know.
A thousand feet, maybe?

712
01:24:56,808 --> 01:24:58,368
Well, that's good.

713
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:01,285
That's good.
I was hoping you'd say that.

714
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,847
All right. Open the door
and throw that bitch out.

715
01:25:04,328 --> 01:25:05,604
What?

716
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,029
-Get it out.
-Okay.

717
01:25:15,464 --> 01:25:18,279
-Do it now.
-Okay.

718
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:39,206
Are we gonna make it?

719
01:25:39,624 --> 01:25:41,446
I wouldn't count on it.

720
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,093
Oh, Jesus.

721
01:26:02,344 --> 01:26:03,751
Are we clear?

722
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:08,512
Well, it looks like we might be...

723
01:26:08,712 --> 01:26:11,907
...but we could be glowing
in the dark for a while.

724
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:34,078
Now I just kind of wanted
to compliment you on a job well done.

725
01:26:34,568 --> 01:26:36,456
Now, what do you mean by that?

726
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:39,233
Well, I mean, you did good.

727
01:26:40,104 --> 01:26:43,617
We're both still alive, and you've been
a good student and a good friend.

728
01:26:43,816 --> 01:26:46,118
-A friend?
-Yeah, a friend.

729
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:47,719
A friend.

730
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:50,018
First of all, I'm your colleague.

731
01:26:50,216 --> 01:26:52,288
And secondly, "friend"?

732
01:26:52,936 --> 01:26:55,805
After all that we've been through,
you're gonna call me a friend?

733
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:57,796
Normally when people
sleep together, they--

734
01:26:57,993 --> 01:27:00,578
Look, what are you talking
about, man? Okay, okay.

735
01:27:00,776 --> 01:27:02,783
All right.

736
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:05,477
Lover? Concubine?

737
01:27:05,672 --> 01:27:07,559
Wizard of the three-night stand?

738
01:27:07,752 --> 01:27:10,535
"Master of the three-night stand,"
that's really classy.

739
01:27:10,728 --> 01:27:14,143
You know, I don't recall
there just being three nights.

740
01:27:14,345 --> 01:27:17,477
Oh, whatever. You know,
as busy as I am, it's all a blur.

741
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:20,455
Now, see, I would stop there.
Because being your student...

742
01:27:20,648 --> 01:27:22,721
...you taught me how to use
these chopsticks.

743
01:27:26,984 --> 01:27:28,293
All right.

744
01:27:28,489 --> 01:27:30,212
To friends.

745
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:44,541
I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't reachable.

746
01:27:46,121 --> 01:27:49,438
Yes, sir, I am well and intact.

747
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,398
Well, thank you, sir,
but I was just doing my job.

748
01:27:55,561 --> 01:28:00,197
The last time that I saw Cold,
he was in a helicopter with the nuke.

749
01:28:03,368 --> 01:28:05,758
With all due respect, sir...

750
01:28:06,345 --> 01:28:08,931
...in all my years of service
with the ClA...

751
01:28:09,129 --> 01:28:12,292
...it's the most courageous act
I've ever seen.

752
01:28:12,488 --> 01:28:14,855
Guess he had a change of heart.

753
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:18,472
Yeah. I'll have a report on Monday.

754
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:20,741
Sir?

755
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:24,967
The president?

756
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,841
Well, I would be honored.

757
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:30,333
No, sir.

758
01:28:30,985 --> 01:28:33,287
Just a ticket for one.

759
01:28:42,501 --> 01:29:11,655
THE END
