1
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,908
It was
unmistakable--

2
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,979
a wolf raising its stem and stern,

3
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,047
its sail dripped blood-red.

4
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,790
These things served
but one purpose--

5
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,344
to strike fear and
terror into the hearts

6
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,782
of any who came across them.

7
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:00,469
Each stroke, each painful breath...

8
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:05,841
they believed it brought them ever
closer to the ends of the earth.

9
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,211
But onward they pushed, for the
ends of the earth they sought.

10
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:20,013
Gloria, honor, these
things awaited them there.

11
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,346
But so did something else.

12
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,780
The waters have stilled,
the winds have died.

13
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,171
I suspect her sight to be true.

14
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,273
That, or we're near the abyss.

15
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:46,798
Lyngvi, lost land of legend and fable,

16
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,489
we found it, Baldur.

17
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,823
Of that you can be certain.

18
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:55,822
Aye. If the night proves
your woman to be wrong again,

19
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,645
she'll find herself rowing
for 20 men on the morrow.

20
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,811
Have faith, Ulfrich,

21
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,913
for if Freyja's led us
to Midgard's edge for

22
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:07,374
nothing more than gloom and fog,

23
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,586
I'll gladly take your
place upon the rail.

24
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,749
Or at least Thor will.

25
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:18,711
The eyes of the wolf moon point
the way with Frigg¡¦s distaff.

26
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,663
That they do.

27
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,439
Our destiny may lie on these shores.

28
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,653
It's still your oar
to row upon our return.

29
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,175
If we return, eldest.

30
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:35,539
No Northman has dared
sail this far before.

31
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,424
We shall claim this island
and all it bears for our own.

32
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:42,384
And if Northmen have sailed here before?

33
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,504
Well, then we'll take it anyway.

34
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,020
This land may yet prove our kingdom.

35
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,393
Forgive me, brother.

36
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,309
Your kingdom.

37
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:53,716
Aye.

38
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:55,929
Father will be pleased.

39
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,176
Perhaps he'll give it to Ulfrich.

40
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,824
The weather here seems
to suit his temperament.

41
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:11,255
Disappointed there's
nobody here to greet us?

42
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:13,845
No army to grind to the ground?

43
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,028
No,

44
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,520
it's just a strange sensation,

45
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,558
almost as if I've been here before.

46
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:24,027
Have you ever known such a thing, Sif?

47
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,848
Some say such feelings are of

48
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:29,213
long-forgotten memories
of our past lives.

49
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,127
So, tell me, Freyja,

50
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,986
does your foresight extend back as well?

51
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,871
On occasion.

52
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,656
Well, if I lived before,
that means I died as well,

53
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,613
a mistake I won't be making twice.

54
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,332
Don't encourage him, wife.

55
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,121
Thor's already too eager
to ride with the Valkyries.

56
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,958
You'll find your path to the
gates of Valhalla soon enough,

57
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,811
whether it be here or some
other godforsaken land.

58
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,919
But what of your path, brother?

59
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,448
It's to look after
you, of course--

60
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,242
make sure you don't die
before your proper time.

61
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,015
- Aegir!
- Aye.

62
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:03,415
Go with Thor and scout the shoreline.

63
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,810
I'll expect you both back within
an hour with enough food for 20 men.

64
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,665
More if you plan to eat as well.

65
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,702
That's one man

66
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,140
who will never know the
dishonor of growing old.

67
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,188
Aye.

68
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,328
Sail with Thor long enough,
we'll all be spared from it.

69
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:33,180
Forgive me. I forgot my place.

70
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,112
Remind me. Where is it?

71
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:42,168
By your side. Always.

72
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:45,435
Then there's nothin' to forgive.

73
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,855
One day, I'll be a king,

74
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,902
and you my queen.

75
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:55,545
Take care not to forget
that as well, hmm?

76
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,813
Be mindful of them.

77
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,088
It's a dangerous game they play.

78
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,849
Sif and Ulfrich?

79
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,079
You know very well who I speak of.

80
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,605
You can't deny nature.

81
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,046
And Thor's
that--

82
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,217
a force of nature,
if I've ever seen one.

83
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,140
I haven't known such dreariness since

84
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:28,413
spending an evening alone with Ulfrich.

85
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,271
It can only mean we've entered
the realm of the frost giants.

86
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:37,119
Well, if we've truly
crossed into the mist world,

87
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,316
then Sol herself would be hard
pressed to shine her light this far.

88
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,063
And if you honestly
believe we're the first men

89
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,526
fool enough to venture this far, then

90
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,030
I believe it as well.

91
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:52,412
Who goes there?

92
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,309
Do you expect the deer to respond?

93
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,718
Or the rabbit, perhaps?

94
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,351
Let's unmask your stalker.

95
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:22,840
Aegir!

96
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:24,732
Aegir!

97
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:26,871
Aegir!

98
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:34,623
So, tell me, Freyja,

99
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,563
what do you expect we'll find here?

100
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,120
Gods? Giants? Monsters?

101
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,222
I want a piece of them all.

102
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:49,218
Well, careful now, Bragi,
or a piece you may have.

103
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,648
Your imagination exceeds
that of even Thor¡¦s.

104
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,496
I suspect we'll find little
more than lonely trees and

105
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,832
some scattered rocks
in this miserable place.

106
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:15,967
So much for trees and rocks.

107
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:24,706
Thor!

108
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,210
What's wrong?

109
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:28,064
- Where's Aegir?
- Speak, man.

110
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:29,821
He's been taken.

111
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:32,707
- Taken? by who?
- By a great beast.

112
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,691
I--it moved like
a wolf, but...

113
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,731
but not like a wolf
I'd ever seen before--

114
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:39,706
easily the size of a
man, but maybe larger.

115
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,155
And you left Aegir to them?

116
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,769
No, I followed him until I lost 'em.

117
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,617
I'd have been lost,
too, had I continued.

118
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,754
They led me into a trap.

119
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:53,123
- I barely escaped with my life.
- Then we've little time.

120
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:55,073
Hodur, Tyr, Geirrod,

121
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,925
mind the ship and the women.

122
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,915
They can busy themselves with the ship.

123
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,533
We'll mind ourselves. Sif?

124
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:04,867
Well, come on, then.

125
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,068
Nothing the lot of us can't handle.

126
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,120
Set the tents?

127
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:16,096
Let's see what they find.
Our stay may be brief.

128
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:46,210
If Aegir died, I only hope he died well.

129
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:49,760
If he's dead, envy him.

130
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:52,323
He sits in the great hall drinking

131
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:55,238
Lerad's mead while we freeze our stones.

132
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:58,179
Aegir couldn't drink for piss.

133
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,607
They'll send his ass back

134
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:03,493
when he can't finish
the horn in three drafts.

135
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,676
What is it?

136
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,129
Nothing.

137
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,892
Tracks.

138
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:32,446
Look at their size.

139
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,470
Ah, it's animal just the same.

140
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,010
Baldur?

141
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,710
These tracks are laid in twos.

142
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,073
Tell me, Ulfrich,

143
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,923
what animal walks on just two legs?

144
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,343
You may get your monsters after all.

145
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:24,996
Fabled isle, eh?

146
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,934
You can keep it.

147
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,870
I don't understand.

148
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:36,293
I truly believed it our destiny
to discover a new kingdom.

149
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:45,121
Thor, if you're ever to
rule or lead, you must learn

150
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:47,812
to forsake such things in
the face of greater needs.

151
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,700
Aegir is your kinsman.

152
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,450
What say we find him, if
only to provide the rites?

153
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,392
Expanding our kingdom we'll leave
for another time and place, huh?

154
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,139
This is why you lead, Baldur.

155
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,432
You're right about one thing, brother.

156
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,743
There is something on this island,

157
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,207
and it doesn't much like men.

158
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,822
- What is it, Freyja?
- Do you sense something?

159
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,570
Only suffering and death.

160
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:27,872
This place has known both.

161
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,848
Well, you don't need the
sight to figure that one out.

162
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,213
Wait, there's something in there.

163
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,770
- Stand back.
- Ulfrich, wait!

164
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:56,385
By the skalds.

165
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,985
I've no words for that stench.

166
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:07,786
It's all right.

167
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,434
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.  It's not all right.

168
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,996
- You must leave at once.
- We're not here to hurt you.

169
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:15,593
But the others are.

170
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:28,811
Forgive our manners.

171
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:32,134
It's been months since
we've had real food.

172
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,534
My name is Hel.

173
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,843
This is Garmur.

174
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,675
How is it you've survived if
you haven't left this hall?

175
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:44,707
Grubs, worms-- whatever
the dirt provides.

176
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,876
The better question is how
did you know of this island?

177
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:49,291
- What brought you here?
- Thor.

178
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,910
- And where from? Where do you hail?
- Thor!

179
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,441
Please continue.

180
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,065
We came from Faroer.

181
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,360
Explorers you could say,
though misguided to be sure.

182
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,612
We were seduced by the
stories of gods and giants.

183
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,462
So we sought the isle of the immortals.

184
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,947
In the end, I suspect we
made the same mistake you did.

185
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,178
What mistake?

186
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,105
Coming here.

187
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,008
So you were attacked by
these same wolves as well?

188
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,458
Shortly after we first arrived.

189
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,973
We would have left, but we'd
already stripped our boat for wood.

190
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:30,340
It wasn't long after we were forced to

191
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,935
reinforce the walls with
whatever we could find.

192
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,286
And then?

193
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,727
And then we prayed they wouldn't get in.

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,966
Those are not creatures of this realm.

195
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:44,739
Not one night passes without the
howl of those demons at our door.

196
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,377
Please,

197
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,891
I beg of you, leave this
place while you still can.

198
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,554
Take us with you.
Before they return.

199
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,560
Ah, I've heard enough.

200
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,511
Ulfrich.

201
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,107
Ulfrich!

202
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,450
What's the matter with
you? Where are you going?

203
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:09,643
We shouldn't be sittin' here
listenin' to such absurd tales--

204
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,519
creatures from other realms? Demons?

205
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,887
Aegir is still out
there. He may yet live.

206
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,315
Thor saw one of these
things with his own eyes.

207
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,969
You yourself saw the damage
inflicted on that skull.

208
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,037
Oversized wolves. Nothing more.

209
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,005
A meal that will finally fight back.

210
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,054
Well, I say bring them on.

211
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,663
Until we know what we're
up against, we would do well

212
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:36,460
to heed that woman's warning.

213
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:40,045
What's more, these
people are our cousins.

214
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,686
These people are not our cousins.

215
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,896
Hiding? eating grubs?

216
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,071
They are weak and pathetic
and of no consequence--

217
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,315
whether you like it or not,
they are north men just the same.

218
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,079
Waste your time with 'em if you like.

219
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,656
I'm goin' after Aegir.

220
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,857
Hermoid, Heimdall, with me!

221
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,763
You forget your place, Ulfrich.

222
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,126
Forgive me...

223
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,209
Brother.

224
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,373
You ask for that which is not needed.

225
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,630
You're right.

226
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,248
Borr, Bragi. The rest
of us will continue on.

227
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:28,785
You and your brothers will
stay here and guard the village.

228
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,126
With our lives, Baldur.

229
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,301
We should hope it won't come to that.

230
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:24,424
Thor.

231
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,479
What ails you?

232
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,121
...felt like fire was
coursing through my veins.

233
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,034
I can't explain it.

234
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:35,473
It was as if I was dreaming,
yet I did not sleep.

235
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,574
What did you see?

236
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,354
A great warrior!

237
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:45,004
A poisoned sky, a sea
serpent of unimaginable size.

238
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:49,616
This warrior, did he
wield a strange weapon?

239
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:51,918
A hammer.

240
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:55,183
Yet it was a hammer I'd never
laid my eyes upon before.

241
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:56,979
How do you know of this?

242
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,335
I believe you saw ...

243
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,121
the hammer of the gods.

244
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,625
Of course.

245
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,246
The warrior, he bore a serpent shield.

246
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,834
believe it was you, brother.

247
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,248
Oh, yeah, clearly,

248
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,580
as Baldur alone wears the serpent.

249
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:26,385
Now, are we here to find our kinsmen,

250
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:29,452
or sit here debating the
meaning of Thor's dreams?

251
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:39,947
You all right?

252
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,226
You're wearing a hole in the earth.

253
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,522
Apologies if my duties
are arousing your slumber.

254
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:07,857
Be still, if you're so sorry.

255
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,766
Did you hear that?

256
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,756
There it is again.

257
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:43,344
Bragi, did
you see any--

258
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,768
by the giants. Must you do that?

259
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,356
I'll happily return to
my post if you'll shut--

260
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:54,677
where'd the others go?

261
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:09,842
Njord!

262
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:14,196
Tonight ...

263
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,590
we drink at Odin¡¦s side, Borr!

264
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:20,786
Let's not keep him waiting!

265
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:27,768
Baldur!

266
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:29,239
What?

267
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:37,169
Borr, Bragi!

268
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:38,925
Do you really think?

269
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,399
Everyone back to the village. now!

270
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,062
Hel!

271
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:44,119
Garmur!

272
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,232
Garmur!

273
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,170
We're too late. They've been taken.

274
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,014
Four men, dragged away by wolves?

275
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,565
I told you. These are not
wolves as you and I have known.

276
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:29,399
Hel, Garmur, show
yourselves if you still live!

277
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,322
I'm so sorry.

278
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:44,145
There was nothing we could do.

279
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:47,831
Everyone inside!

280
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:53,914
Everyone.

281
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:09,557
Clearly, these are not simple wolves.

282
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,465
This is an enemy unlike
any we've ever known,

283
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,828
and a situation none of
us could have foreseen,

284
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,776
not even you, Freyja.

285
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:21,013
Or you, Thor.

286
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,981
We're only here 'cause of my
damn notions of glory and destiny.

287
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:26,964
Sentiment is noble, youngest,

288
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:30,007
but the burden lies
solely on my shoulders.

289
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,761
I brought us here, not you.

290
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:34,674
That's all fine and good, Baldur,

291
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,368
but what are we gonna do now?

292
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:38,326
I've already told you.

293
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:39,957
We need to leave.

294
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:43,665
No. We should fight these
things with our full force,

295
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,908
before they thin our ranks any further.

296
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,946
If you listened to me before, Borr
and his brothers would still live.

297
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,900
Mind your words, Ulfrich.

298
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,327
Baldur might tolerate your insolence,

299
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,949
but I have neither his
patience nor his virtue.

300
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,928
We have underestimated
these wolves once.

301
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,499
Not again.

302
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:04,988
We're going back to the ship.

303
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:07,830
We're to leave, then?

304
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:09,245
No.

305
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:11,700
We're not going anywhere
until we find the others.

306
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,223
We'll collect those at the
beach, and once we're 14 strong,

307
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:18,172
we'll come back, find our kinsmen,

308
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,308
and kill anything that gets in our way.

309
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,558
And what of these people?

310
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,770
They survived without us for months.

311
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:25,783
Let them survive another few days.

312
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,092
Thor!

313
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,725
Give him room, woman.

314
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,336
What is it now, brother?

315
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:08,539
I'm beginning to think you
have no threshold for pain.

316
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,979
Another vision?

317
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,693
Worse this time.

318
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,937
Much stronger.

319
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,526
Baldur slaying another monster?

320
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,308
Not exactly!

321
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,889
He was standing there

322
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:27,062
at the mountain's peak.

323
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:30,906
He held the hammer to the heavens
and called down the lightning itself.

324
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,693
I felt the lightning.

325
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:36,350
And it burned through
me like Sol's flame.

326
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,974
Thor.

327
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:41,913
I believe these visions are
leading you to the hammer.

328
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,676
It's up there somewhere
on that very mountain.

329
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,826
The visions may be mine,

330
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,028
but the hammer's for Baldur
alone there...

331
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:54,265
to find.

332
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,287
We'll come back for you.

333
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,942
Not till we've vanquished
all these creatures.

334
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:05,882
And find my hammer.

335
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,473
Your hammer?

336
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:13,438
Let's make haste,
you flat-footed mares!

337
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,665
They've been gone for hours.

338
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:31,615
Safe to say they've either
ventured inland for the night

339
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,340
or they're dead.

340
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,376
Either way we'll be
needing the tent, then.

341
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,678
Freyja, you and Geirrod see to it.

342
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:41,913
Tyr, you and I will go
find something worth eating.

343
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,657
I'm sure we can find something
without having to wander too far.

344
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:55,391
- What is it?
- Thor!

345
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,162
A man!

346
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:00,474
Long dead.

347
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,253
Imagine being so frightened
as to choose dishonorable death

348
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:05,848
rather than face what lay beneath.

349
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,675
I damn nearly can.

350
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:10,974
I pray none of us
face such a dim choice.

351
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,170
These visions of yours,

352
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,787
I don't believe they're of Baldur.

353
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,957
Baldur is the greatest
warrior I've ever known.

354
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,098
How could you of all
people question this?

355
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,576
Because...

356
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,423
I have foreseen his destiny.

357
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,514
And?

358
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,649
It lies along another path.

359
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:40,825
Well...

360
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,527
you're wrong.

361
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:43,770
You'll see.

362
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,250
Now, forget this nonsense and move.

363
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,417
Is it wise venturing
back into these woods

364
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:58,491
after what happened to Thor and Aegir?

365
00:28:58,492 --> 00:28:59,938
A man's got to eat.

366
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,785
I'm not going hungry on
account of a few wolves.

367
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,816
If anything, I'll feast on them.

368
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,469
Tyr?

369
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,440
Get up, you lazy bag of bones.

370
00:29:16,165 --> 00:29:17,593
Odin's fury.

371
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:23,710
Come on, you. Time to
meet the end of my blade.

372
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:28,418
Thokk's tears.

373
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:41,854
I knew Hodur and Tyr wouldn't
let that spit go to waste.

374
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,701
Go give them a hand with the kill.

375
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,362
And hurry up already.

376
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:51,229
Hodur!

377
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:53,153
I'm ravenous.

378
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:01,219
Geirrod?

379
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,335
Not good.

380
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,332
No!

381
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,246
I can't believe it!

382
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,850
Believe It.

383
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:45,309
We're pretty well wracked now.

384
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:48,351
How? How?

385
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:51,357
How do wolves take
entire ships, I ask you?

386
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,494
Thor, did you happen to
see a vision about that?

387
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:56,355
Don't take your fury out on Thor.

388
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:57,827
This isn't his doing.

389
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:01,153
You told me earlier if I wanted to lead,

390
00:31:01,154 --> 00:31:03,906
I needed to set aside my
selfishness and think of others.

391
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,102
Let me do that now, Baldur.

392
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:12,451
It is clear to me now that we
are not alone on this island,

393
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,160
and I'm not speaking of
demon wolves or puny villages.

394
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:20,287
There's something going on here.

395
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:21,695
Agreed.

396
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:25,410
If we find our friends, I
believe we'll find our ship.

397
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,994
That's the first sensible
thing you've said this day.

398
00:31:30,632 --> 00:31:32,322
It'll be dark soon.

399
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,822
Let's gather our supplies,

400
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,705
make our way back to the village.

401
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:39,431
We camp there tonight.

402
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,439
We take back what's ours tomorrow.

403
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,998
Here we are.

404
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:13,830
I don't understand.

405
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,200
Where'd they go?

406
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:19,269
Did they flee? Or attempt to catch us?

407
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,606
Perhaps they were
attacked and finally taken.

408
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:26,725
They survive on their own for months,
only to succumb the day we arrive?

409
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,350
Exactly.

410
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,338
Something's not right.

411
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:32,384
If they were taken, why no blood?

412
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:35,880
We believe there to be
something else to this.

413
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:37,864
I think we're getting
closer to the truth.

414
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:39,236
But what truth?

415
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:41,026
I still don't understand.

416
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,600
Nor do I.

417
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:44,671
Only somehow these people play a part.

418
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,045
In the meantime, the sun is nearly set.

419
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:48,868
We'll prepare to stay the night here.

420
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,945
I despise the notion of hiding.

421
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,326
There's no honor in it.

422
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,690
We risk drawing the
ire of the Valkyries.

423
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,484
He's right.

424
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,339
I'd rather go down fighting.

425
00:32:58,571 --> 00:33:01,385
Aye. Or we'll never see Valhalla.

426
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:04,130
How well do you see
in the dark, Hermiod?

427
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:05,926
Or you, Heimdall? As well as a wolf?

428
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,384
They've been preying on the fact
that they can thin our numbers

429
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:10,912
and catch us off guard.

430
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,937
Well, no longer!

431
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,557
We will hold this position tonight,

432
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,031
but make no mistake.

433
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:18,146
We won't be hiding.

434
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,244
If they're fool enough
to try and overtake us,

435
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,330
they'll fail.

436
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,644
And then tomorrow?

437
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,240
We will bring the fight to them!

438
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,719
For odin!

439
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,521
- For odin!
- For odin!

440
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,226
To honor the soon dead.

441
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,883
They dragged away their dead.

442
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,388
Not all!

443
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:03,558
But will they dare return?

444
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,647
They're fare no better.

445
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,653
We'll crush them into the ground!

446
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,208
You fought well today, brother.

447
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,163
It's a shame you didn't die.

448
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,783
Not before my proper time.

449
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,318
Skirnir did die well.

450
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:44,108
We'll need a vessel for the ash.

451
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,385
Baldur, you must see this at once.

452
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,154
What in Odin¡¦s name?

453
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,199
I was hoping you could give
me some insight into that.

454
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:42,892
Creatures that revert back to men,

455
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:45,161
such sorcery should not be possible.

456
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,367
You never believed the villagers,
surely you believe your own eyes.

457
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,666
Thor cut down no man today, only beast.

458
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,482
And yet here a man's head rests.

459
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,437
Those damn villagers may be right,

460
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,394
but they don't know half
of the horrible truth.

461
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,531
The creatures walked
amongst them as well.

462
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,585
But I recognize this man.

463
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:03,274
He was here in this very hall.

464
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,636
He's right. I'd never
forget this man's face,

465
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,232
but I'd sure like to try.

466
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,483
Must this be in here?

467
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,785
Hermiod, do something with this.

468
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:12,906
What exactly?

469
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,669
Anything. Just get it out of here.

470
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,163
I believe it's far worse
than you imagine, Thor.

471
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:19,501
The urn, what was so special about it?

472
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:21,292
It bore an encryption on the inside.

473
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:23,826
And what did it say?
Before you broke it.

474
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:27,023
Beware the sons of Loki.

475
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,062
- The God.
- The trickster.

476
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:31,441
- The same.
- What do you think it means?

477
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,097
Loki had
two sons--

478
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:36,881
Jormungand, the Midgard
serpent, and Fenris, the wolf.

479
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:38,639
Jormungand,

480
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,653
that's what I saw in my vision.

481
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,664
That's the snake that Baldur's
gonna slay with the hammer.

482
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,159
One thing at a time, youngest.

483
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,884
I'm more concerned with this wolf.

484
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:51,184
It said the blood of Fenris
will grant everlasting life

485
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:53,357
and the ability to
shape-shift like Loki.

486
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,395
Wait, you're saying the
villagers were the wolf creatures?

487
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:58,224
They were one and the same all along?

488
00:38:58,225 --> 00:39:00,202
And just a fraction of
them, from what we've seen.

489
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:01,993
None of this seems real.

490
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:04,075
Shall I fetch back the head?

491
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,063
You sought out the gods, Freyja.

492
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:07,795
Appears we've found them.

493
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:08,809
So what now?

494
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:11,891
Tomorrow we find out if
all your visions are true,

495
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,157
or just the ones that
get us into trouble.

496
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:45,228
He waits to see you.

497
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,471
The invaders still persist.

498
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:59,019
They have proven most
determined and most formidable.

499
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:02,578
There is one among
them, a young warrior,

500
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,784
he fights like no man I've ever seen.

501
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:08,301
They now quest for the hammer.

502
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,189
Forgive me.

503
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,420
I have failed you.

504
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,819
So, the warrior has returned.

505
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:20,306
Bring him to me. Kill the others.

506
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:23,536
Do not fail me again.

507
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,289
Tell me, Northman,

508
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,837
why is the one known as Ulfrich
in disfavor with the others

509
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:47,635
if he is eldest?

510
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,286
Why does this Baldur lead in his place?

511
00:40:55,608 --> 00:40:56,535
Skoll.

512
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:04,877
Should I call on Hati as well?

513
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,908
You've got a warrior's spirit.

514
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,461
You deserve to die holding your sword.

515
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,829
If you only had arms.

516
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,417
How talkative are you feeling?

517
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:26,454
More than your friend, I hope.

518
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:29,265
His mother.

519
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,644
Yes?

520
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,844
A thrall from the south.

521
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:36,144
A slave girl.

522
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,058
A bastard son.

523
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:41,711
Intriguing.

524
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,118
Thank You.

525
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,671
What you lookin' for?

526
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:05,689
Grubs? Worms?

527
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:10,616
No, I'm retracing my steps,
learning from my mistakes.

528
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,307
There.

529
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:15,384
I favored my spear side
too heavily during a lunge.

530
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,716
I'm no good with spears.

531
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:19,736
I prefer shorter weapons, I believe.

532
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,571
You really just lookin' at dirt?

533
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:27,953
What else weighs on
that mind of yours, Thor?

534
00:42:30,108 --> 00:42:31,765
It's just dirt, Sif.

535
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,719
It's dirt.

536
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,704
Thor!

537
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:40,431
I warned you

538
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,652
for the last time.

539
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:43,161
You're stirring yourself over nothing.

540
00:42:44,507 --> 00:42:45,936
Stolen glances.

541
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:47,448
Hidden touches.

542
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:50,130
I've seen my fair share of nothin'

543
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,829
from you, Sif,

544
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,289
and you, brother.

545
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,015
Have you nothin' to say for yourself?

546
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,910
At least have the self
respect to deny it, woman.

547
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,969
Then you leave me no choice.

548
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:14,964
I challenge you, Thor.

549
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:16,725
Here?

550
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,907
Now you can't be serious.

551
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:20,890
I'd raise your sword, brother.

552
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:22,329
I believe he is.

553
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:24,727
Are you just gonna stand
back and do nothin'?

554
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:27,793
Deferring to one's younger
brother is humiliation enough.

555
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:29,689
don't expect you to
understand such things.

556
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:32,213
I'm not gonna lose my woman as well.

557
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:35,187
Don't do this, Ulfrich.

558
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:38,357
The days of you tellin'
me what to do are over.

559
00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:44,214
Prepare yourself.

560
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:43,391
Do you really believe this is what we
should be concerning ourselves with?

561
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:57,566
Enough!

562
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,653
How dare you?

563
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,591
You dishonor the codes.

564
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,492
You speak of honor and codes when you
challenge your own brother?

565
00:46:09,194 --> 00:46:10,693
You know nothing of these.

566
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:17,194
Oh I see. I am your brother
when the purpose suits you.

567
00:46:19,496 --> 00:46:22,095
We don't have time for
petty squabbles!

568
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,196
These demons could return
at any moment.

569
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:31,097
Ulfrich!

570
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:39,298
I hope you grow old...
and rot together.

571
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,499
Please, Ulfrich, you can't leave.

572
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:50,500
No, Baldur, that's one thing I can do.

573
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:53,501
Ulfrich!

574
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:58,502
Sif, give him time.
He'll be back.

575
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:02,203
But what of the wolves?
He's not safe.

576
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:05,704
He's made his decision,
as we all must.

577
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:09,105
We'll give him an hour to return.

578
00:47:09,107 --> 00:47:11,506
If he's not back by then,
we move out.

579
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:19,807
We can't afford to lose a man
of Ulfrich's skill.

580
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,808
That's not what concerns me.

581
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,009
What concerns me is if that skill
were turned against us now.

582
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:54,586
Stay back.

583
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,478
I mean you no harm.

584
00:47:56,996 --> 00:47:59,068
We gave you a chance to leave.

585
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:00,674
Two, actually.

586
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:02,880
You lied to us, demon.

587
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:07,137
I may have left out some details,
but what I told you was true enough.

588
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:10,433
Northmen came to this
isle seeking the gods.

589
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:13,569
Well, they've found them.

590
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:18,363
I see now destiny has brought you
here for a reason, Lord Ulfrich.

591
00:48:19,493 --> 00:48:21,532
Stop speakin' in riddles.

592
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:22,922
Why did you want us to leave,

593
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:25,725
and what is this destiny
of which you speak?

594
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:28,700
You'll have all the answers in due time.

595
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,428
All you need to know now

596
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:33,151
is I can offer you the
things you've always wanted

597
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,075
and always been denied.

598
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:37,404
Go on.

599
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:40,255
Come with me and drink from his blood,

600
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:43,838
and you'll not only have
power and immortality,

601
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:47,936
but a woman who treats you the
way you deserve to be treated,

602
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,627
like a king.

603
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:52,093
Whose blood?

604
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:53,471
Fenris?

605
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,017
And what would you require in return?

606
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,437
Nothing you wouldn't give.

607
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:10,306
Willingly.

608
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:34,271
No point in wallowing.

609
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:35,930
We're all to blame.

610
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:37,956
He'll come around.

611
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:40,448
Or he won't.

612
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:42,725
Comforting.

613
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:45,093
Would you prefer I'd
let them kill each other?

614
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:46,596
'Course not.

615
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,509
Well, take comfort in that.

616
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:50,177
It's all I've got.

617
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:57,436
Unless you wanna spend
another night here,

618
00:49:57,437 --> 00:49:59,232
I suggest we get moving.

619
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:04,482
Thor, any new visions
we should know about?

620
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:06,622
All I know is we need to go there.

621
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:10,437
Then there we'll go,

622
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:13,825
and if the god's will it, we'll
cross paths with Ulfrich again.

623
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,604
What is it, Thor?

624
00:50:38,184 --> 00:50:39,645
I'm uncertain,

625
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,278
'cause there's something ...

626
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,556
familiar about this place.

627
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:46,336
- We were here just yesterday.
- No, no, it's not that.

628
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,437
I can't quite explain it.

629
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:51,838
How far do you think it?

630
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,978
Nearly a day's journey to
the base of the mountain.

631
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,912
I don't know how I know that,

632
00:50:59,145 --> 00:51:00,289
but I do.

633
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,731
Let's get moving, then.

634
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:14,307
Stop!

635
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:16,128
On your guard.

636
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:17,825
I fear we're no longer alone.

637
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:32,255
Ulfrich?

638
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:35,139
Brother, tell me you're not
in league with these demons.

639
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,576
Ah, spare me your reproach, Baldur.

640
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:44,294
I was little more than a servant to you.

641
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:48,963
Little more than nothin' to you.

642
00:51:50,795 --> 00:51:52,616
It doesn't have to end like this.

643
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:56,328
I concur, youngest.

644
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:59,587
Come with us, Thor,
and the others may go.

645
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:01,762
You'll find your ship
awaits you at the shore.

646
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,203
No.

647
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,578
It's just a trick,

648
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,072
another way to thin our
ranks. Keep the line, Thor.

649
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:09,478
I've nothing against Hermiod or Heimdall

650
00:52:10,315 --> 00:52:11,492
or even Freyja.

651
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:13,057
But make no mistake!

652
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:17,319
This is your last chance to leave this
place with your sword in your hand.

653
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:25,155
When you reach the
river of blood, Baldur,

654
00:52:25,156 --> 00:52:26,948
remember this moment,

655
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,519
the moment you failed
to follow your pride,

656
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,890
the moment you damned yourself
and everyone you loved.

657
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,042
Run.

658
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:39,233
- Run! Get them out of here.
- Go!

659
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:43,615
My entire life I have hated you.

660
00:52:45,836 --> 00:52:47,396
Then you better summon it all.

661
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,628
- Baldur!
- Freyja, let's move!

662
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,292
Run!

663
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,366
Run!

664
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,817
Take Thor.

665
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:32,522
Kill the rest.

666
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:24,270
Baldur, no!

667
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:13,574
Go!

668
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,006
We have to keep moving!
Can't afford to stop!

669
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:25,509
No, we can't afford not to.

670
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,915
They'll catch up to us soon,

671
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:30,023
and then Baldur's sacrifice
will have meant nothing.

672
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:32,010
Well, what would you suggest?

673
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:35,463
We'll use their strength
and speed against them.

674
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:40,558
We'll channel them down this slope,
and then they won't be able to stop

675
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,053
until they're met by our steel.

676
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:45,484
We set a trap for them this time.

677
00:55:45,485 --> 00:55:48,103
You're damned right.
We don't have much time.

678
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:53,354
Gaze upon your destiny, Ulfrich!

679
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:57,167
For this sword shall cleave
your head from its shoulders

680
00:56:57,168 --> 00:57:00,268
- before this day is through!
- We'll See.

681
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,184
We'll See.

682
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:09,898
I never believed him
capable of such things.

683
00:57:10,323 --> 00:57:11,468
We should follow.

684
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:13,969
He can't escape what's
coming to him now.

685
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:15,723
They didn't collect their dead.

686
00:57:17,364 --> 00:57:20,265
I don't believe these beasts can
truly be killed like you or Ii.

687
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:23,210
- They bleed well enough.
- That much is certain,

688
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:26,511
but I saw one with a paw that
looked like it was growing back.

689
00:57:26,836 --> 00:57:29,224
No matter how many we think we kill,

690
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,663
they just get back up
again once they've healed.

691
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,765
I know of no living thing,

692
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:38,032
beast, man, or god that
heals from a severed head.

693
00:58:27,477 --> 00:58:29,582
These sons of the bitch.

694
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:38,932
I didn't survive all this
time just to die like this.

695
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:40,530
Where are you from, old man?

696
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:43,508
We voyaged here several months ago,

697
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:45,297
built a small village even,

698
00:58:45,527 --> 00:58:47,053
but then they attacked.

699
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:49,332
We were just looking for a new home.

700
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,659
Now I'm
afraid I'm--

701
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,585
I'm all that's left of my people.

702
00:58:53,879 --> 00:58:56,016
Forgive us if we've
heard that one before.

703
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,771
It's just another trick.

704
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,020
- Kill him!
- No! Wait! Wait!

705
00:59:00,021 --> 00:59:01,330
I, I. ..

706
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,770
I can prove it.

707
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:03,885
I can prove it!

708
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:06,868
Th--these creatures, their
limbs, they grow back,

709
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,973
so take one of my fingers.

710
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:12,595
Take one of my fingers. If it
grows back, so strike me down.

711
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,828
No, it's all right. Just do it quick.

712
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,492
Remind me to apologize
if I don't kill you.

713
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,141
When you do, apologize that is,

714
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:30,099
the name is Vali.

715
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:32,213
If what you say is true,

716
00:59:32,214 --> 00:59:34,448
how is it you've survived all this time?

717
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:37,429
I haven't left the protection
of the tree for months.

718
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:40,309
Apparently it's a theme on this island.

719
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:41,844
Well, let's move.

720
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,534
We're wasting time.

721
00:59:43,535 --> 00:59:45,746
We are leaving, aren't we?

722
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,138
Not until we kill everything
on this entire island.

723
00:59:49,528 --> 00:59:50,672
Move!

724
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:59,957
So, you plan to retrieve Mjolnir,

725
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:03,152
the hammer of the gods.

726
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,640
How do you know of the hammer?

727
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:11,831
You youngsters, you never make time
anymore for the old stories, do you?

728
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:15,574
No one ever makes time for
the old stories anymore.

729
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,289
Vali.

730
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:22,676
They say the hammer fell from the sky,

731
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,683
a mighty gift from Odin himself,

732
01:00:25,684 --> 01:00:29,744
its power so great that only
one mortal man could harness it.

733
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:32,721
Baldur.

734
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:35,861
His name has been lost through the ages,

735
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,482
but he already wielded it once.

736
01:00:38,483 --> 01:00:41,520
It is said he will
return and wield it again.

737
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:44,759
Don't you see?

738
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,194
Baldur will return.

739
01:00:46,195 --> 01:00:47,475
Let me finish.

740
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:49,938
Please.

741
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,488
Loki had
two sons--

742
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:55,568
Jormangand and Fenris, we know.

743
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,592
But did you know that Jormungand

744
01:00:57,593 --> 01:01:00,560
was felled on this very
island by the great champion?

745
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:04,243
He struck down upon him with the hammer,

746
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:07,567
but not before the great
serpent had bit him.

747
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:11,634
So he was victorious,
but at terrible cost--

748
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,392
his life.

749
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:17,367
Odin was pleased, though,
so it was prophesied

750
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:19,829
- this champion would one day return
- Can't resist!

751
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,680
and reclaim his place amongst the gods.

752
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:25,395
Don't let go, Thor.

753
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,733
You must see it through.

754
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,480
See the warrior's true identity!

755
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,033
Face your destiny!

756
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:35,887
No!

757
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:43,216
Thor, can you speak?

758
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,265
It's not possible.

759
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:47,188
Who did you see?

760
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:51,897
It was me... all along, not Baldur.

761
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,676
But I don't understand it.

762
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,728
It doesn't make any sense.

763
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:59,479
Baldur is dead, Thor.

764
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:03,032
It's hard to believe, I know,

765
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,542
but you must finally accept
that you were the chosen warrior.

766
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:12,152
You were the champion.

767
01:02:13,052 --> 01:02:14,513
And you still can be.

768
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:20,336
That's why they wanted you.

769
01:02:21,564 --> 01:02:22,970
Fenris.

770
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:26,102
I killed his brother, so
he killed both of mine.

771
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:31,478
He and his minions, they live
here in mortal fear of the hammer,

772
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:35,321
the only thing in existence that
can truly end their immortality,

773
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:37,363
so they guard it, ever vigilant,

774
01:02:37,364 --> 01:02:40,305
for all times against...

775
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:43,477
Your return.

776
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:47,762
But he can't resist his
desires for vengeance.

777
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:49,590
He means to kill you,

778
01:02:50,109 --> 01:02:52,890
even if it puts his own life at risk.

779
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:55,577
Well, he'll have his chance.

780
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:58,076
Thank you, Freyja.

781
01:02:58,494 --> 01:02:59,638
I'm in debt to you.

782
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,667
And you, can you fight?

783
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,477
I'm middle-aged. I'm not dead.

784
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:10,617
Well then, the hammer awaits.

785
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:21,371
- We'll never get through that way.
- We'll die trying.

786
01:03:21,372 --> 01:03:22,451
Wait.

787
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:23,898
There's another way.

788
01:03:24,862 --> 01:03:26,171
We'll go around.

789
01:03:26,814 --> 01:03:27,991
Show us.

790
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,092
Come here.

791
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,609
I guess your people weren't
the first ones here, either.

792
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,393
Our ship is down there somewhere.

793
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:55,672
There, I can see it.

794
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:59,416
Secured for departure.

795
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:06,487
Let's move.

796
01:04:29,152 --> 01:04:30,809
Could have stabbed you in the back.

797
01:04:33,088 --> 01:04:34,778
Sneakin' around, Thor,

798
01:04:35,457 --> 01:04:36,732
that's not very becoming.

799
01:04:37,888 --> 01:04:41,432
Probably nothin' new for you or Sif.

800
01:04:42,561 --> 01:04:43,574
Vali!

801
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:45,947
Take them through the passage.

802
01:04:46,977 --> 01:04:48,089
Sif!

803
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:49,912
Find our friends.

804
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:51,993
What of you?

805
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,743
I'll follow when I'm done here.

806
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,165
Go!

807
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:14,975
A noble sentiment,

808
01:05:14,976 --> 01:05:16,892
sparing them your demise.

809
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,230
Don't worry.

810
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,183
I will deal with them soon enough.

811
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:23,350
What has become of you, brother?

812
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:27,006
You are not the man today
that I've known my entire life.

813
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,599
The man you knew is dead.

814
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,255
He was weak, a coward.

815
01:05:32,577 --> 01:05:34,399
And I loathed him.

816
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,735
You've thrown your
life away, and for what?

817
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:39,062
To live among these demons?

818
01:05:39,063 --> 01:05:41,024
Power changes a man, brother,

819
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:42,968
and for the first time

820
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:47,994
- I truly know how it feels.
- You had power, Ulfrich.

821
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:49,564
Not like this.

822
01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:53,052
Even now it courses through my veins.

823
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:55,196
You've no idea.

824
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:59,231
There can only be one of us, though.

825
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,985
Let's get this over with.

826
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:35,072
Now, brother, you'll see true power.

827
01:08:27,142 --> 01:08:28,287
You're right.

828
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:31,813
There can be only one.

829
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:44,092
Are you sure this is the way?

830
01:08:44,093 --> 01:08:45,824
It's not much farther.

831
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,317
How will Thor find us?

832
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:51,205
If he truly has been here
before, he'll have no trouble.

833
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:52,481
Trust me.

834
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:21,885
So, this warrior, what if he returns?

835
01:09:21,886 --> 01:09:23,388
Aye, what then?

836
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:26,175
That teek.

837
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:27,326
What's going on?

838
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:30,812
Perhaps your friend was taken prisoner.

839
01:09:32,393 --> 01:09:33,570
Impossible.

840
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,781
Thor didn't lose.

841
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:39,235
You must come at once.
The bastard son has fallen.

842
01:09:39,236 --> 01:09:40,961
Ulfrich has been slain.

843
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,319
Before they come back.

844
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:02,083
Aegir.

845
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,777
Sif.

846
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,136
- My sword.
- Of course.

847
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:10,081
Freyja.

848
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:22,912
Hold on.

849
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:27,873
Tonight you feast on the Saehrimnir,
and drink at Odin¡¦s table.

850
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,863
Shame. He won't keep as long dead.

851
01:11:01,836 --> 01:11:05,632
By the way, you really should
watch what you say around wolves.

852
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,001
We have pretty good hearing, teek.

853
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:13,025
You.

854
01:11:13,026 --> 01:11:14,823
Surprised to see me?

855
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:18,120
He won't let you have it. You know this.

856
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:21,121
You'll be rid of me soon enough.

857
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:22,721
Vali, what's going on?

858
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:28,354
You think Thor is the only
one who seeks the hammer?

859
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,816
You foolish old man.

860
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:40,227
Sif!

861
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:43,501
Do what you came to do. Find the hammer!

862
01:12:44,685 --> 01:12:45,895
Go!

863
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,965
I will return.

864
01:13:25,646 --> 01:13:30,251
I can't tell you how long I've
awaited your return, son of Odin.

865
01:13:30,799 --> 01:13:33,699
I am Fenris, son of Loki.

866
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,580
The wolf-god. I know.

867
01:13:36,581 --> 01:13:39,654
Then you must also know why you're here.

868
01:13:39,655 --> 01:13:41,316
Aye.

869
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:44,076
- But do you?
- Of course.

870
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:47,240
You are here to die, brave warrior.

871
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:49,573
Are you ready?

872
01:13:49,574 --> 01:13:51,848
Your mortal heart betrays you.

873
01:13:52,431 --> 01:13:56,806
It pleases me that I should
be the one to teach you fear.

874
01:13:57,168 --> 01:14:00,812
The hammer, the instrument
of my brother's demise,

875
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,388
and the only thing that
could ever render me mortal,

876
01:14:04,389 --> 01:14:07,560
so I keep it close right here.

877
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:10,665
- Why?
- Because you can't help yourself.

878
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,871
You are drawn to the hammer.

879
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:15,943
Your lust for it insatiable.

880
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,279
Well, thank you for tending it for me,

881
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,066
but I'll be needing it back now.

882
01:14:22,672 --> 01:14:24,526
Come and take it.

883
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:01,808
Well, that wasn't so bad.

884
01:15:17,874 --> 01:15:21,801
To kill a brother's slayer
is a rare opportunity, indeed.

885
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:24,046
He killed me as well, they say.

886
01:15:24,047 --> 01:15:27,505
Except he was not a
favored son of the gods,

887
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:33,512
so while he rots in the underworld,
you dishonor him by staying here.

888
01:15:34,002 --> 01:15:37,547
Well then, he and Ulfrich
can honor each other.

889
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,168
Freyja!

890
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:22,412
I guess she didn't see that coming.

891
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:49,226
Wait!

892
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:50,475
What?

893
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:12,012
I'll see you again.

894
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:13,546
on the plains of Asgard.

895
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:16,180
Until then, sister.

896
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:37,330
Nothing can save you now, brave warrior.

897
01:17:37,331 --> 01:17:40,464
I only hope my brother isn't insulted.

898
01:17:40,465 --> 01:17:43,531
This is almost too easy.

899
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:48,144
Just the same, say hello to him for me.

900
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:51,507
Tell him yourself.

901
01:18:53,112 --> 01:18:54,421
We have to go.

902
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,527
Vali's path. We'll go around.

903
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:02,766
No!

904
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:04,626
Wait here.

905
01:19:04,627 --> 01:19:05,936
Are you sure?

906
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:40,591
You did it, Thor.

907
01:19:42,298 --> 01:19:43,573
Freyja?

908
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:46,958
She died well.

909
01:19:47,385 --> 01:19:50,418
Reunited with Baldur. As it should be.

910
01:19:53,369 --> 01:19:54,863
...the hammer.

911
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:57,519
May I--

912
01:19:58,266 --> 01:19:59,542
may I hold it?

913
01:20:00,122 --> 01:20:02,292
How can I guarantee you
wouldn't use it against me?

914
01:20:04,282 --> 01:20:05,525
I still owe you a finger.

915
01:20:08,218 --> 01:20:11,566
Only you can wield it, remember?

916
01:20:12,411 --> 01:20:13,456
I'll think about it.

917
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:40,046
And so...

918
01:20:40,047 --> 01:20:42,512
they sailed away from Midgard's edge,

919
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:46,132
each lost in their own
silent contemplation.

920
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:48,852
Though they'd won the day,

921
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:52,501
they left more on that
isle than they'd taken.
