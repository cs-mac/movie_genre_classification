00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,670
You let him to leave alone.You should stay with him.<br>You should go accompany him!

17
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,930
Hurry up!<br>You should go with him together

18
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,190
Hurry up!

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,080
Tell me, how to do with this?

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,360
How come she's still asleep?

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,920
Yue Ya reason for not able to wake up.<br> Because

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,310
Because of this paper's person spell.<br>Yue Ya is under her control

23
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,170
trapping her in a dream

24
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,970
What?

25
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,060
a dream?

26
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,030
Young Lady!

27
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,870
Young Lady!

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,010
Young Lady!

29
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,530
Young Lady!

30
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,370
Young Lady! what's wrong?

31
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,710
Where is the one named Duan?

32
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,150
San lang

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,540
San Lang died

34
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
died?

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,900
San lang died!<br>How did he die?

36
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,370
Young Lady!

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,480
Young Lady wake up

38
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,090
Because in a dream encounter is a different things.

39
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,320
Yueqi Luo said

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,410
If the paper person ruined, Yue Ya will also be dead.

41
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,110
It seems to be in the wake of<br> like a person sleepwalking.

42
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,060
Then what do we do now?

43
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,760
We can't just wait for this.

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,380
You say, who knows when she wake up?

45
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,440
Master

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,360
You said that Yue Qiluo path to travel <br>actually is outstanding.

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm afraid this Yue Qiluo <br>really have this ability to take people's mind away.

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,660
You say, this Yue Qiluo want to kill Yue Ya?

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,050
Why did she want to do that?

50
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,710
Misuse of time and effort wasted again.

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,810
I doubt she's afraid of the same thing.

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,950
What is that?

53
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,520
This is the town of one hundred years <br>of her character. I guess Yue Qiluo will fear this.

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,780
So she didn't dare to close Yue Ya body, <br>I thought of this approach.

55
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,720
Paper by the hands of people to control Yue Ya.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,960
This stuff, how come is really good.

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,130
No.

58
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,330
Then you also give me a whole chant. Huh?

59
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Your home well have a few good one too.<br>If you want get your own.

60
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,010
No. You...

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,830
San lang

62
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,090
San lang already died

63
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,890
not possible

64
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,550
How would I?<br> How would I commit suicide?

65
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,390
You shouldn't be like this

66
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,340
But he really is dead.

67
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,490
Your lover died

68
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,050
How can you live alone?

69
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,320
It's not right! The person I love, <br>he is not going to commit suicide.

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,900
He is not that kind of person!

71
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,570
As long as rewarding to be alive.<br>He died on nothing.

72
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,410
People who commit suicide, they are coward.

73
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,900
He is not! <br>I'm not also!

74
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,770
You're not just more than a coward. <br>You simply have a heart of stone. <br>Watched the person you love to die.

75
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,900
Actually indifferent.<br>-I'm not!

76
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm not!<br>You caused his death

77
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,390
It was you

78
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,370
It wasn't me

79
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,840
It was you<br>you made him die

80
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,900
You're a murderer!

81
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,510
Murderer

82
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,390
Murder

83
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,680
Murderer

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,550
To accompany him to die together

85
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,510
To accompany him

86
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,580
Die with him

87
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,630
On his funeral day, you go to pull him.

88
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,130
He was killed in his coffin.

89
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,800
You can go together with him.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,150
This way, he will know that you love him

91
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,220
love him

92
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,250
What are you up to?

93
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,800
I've thought of something

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,330
You have to think about this approach.<br>Don't complained it to God.

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,520
There's a light in my hand

96
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
Huh?

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,610
What light?

98
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,290
Found from paper person of Yue Qiluo spell.

99
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,900
You can't see through it.

100
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,580
We didn't see Yueya wake up for a little bit before isn't it?

101
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,290
If she continues to fall asleep

102
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,470
I'm thinking if in real life Yueya can't wake up, then

103
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,040
How about going to her dream?

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,900
In the dream she will wake up.

105
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
What do you mean?

106
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,830
What I mean is, since this light can bring<br> Yueya into a dream

107
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,920
Isn't it said that can also bring other people<br> into a dream.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm going to try.

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,820
Do it,faster

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,990
What now?

111
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,070
What is it? Hurry up

112
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,370
Hey, can't you do it?

113
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,540
What are you doing?

114
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,610
I guess I'm afraid, I'm not ordinary person <br>to do this after all.

115
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,740
That's also right.

116
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,990
Isn't it said that It will work on ordinary person.

117
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,270
No. What do you mean with this?<br> Don't look at me.

118
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,450
I'm not a normal person

119
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,950
I'm a person with identity!

120

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,830

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,950
Take a look at him.

126
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,920
He has no braids.

127
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,690
This person is not wearing the same clothes as us.

128
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,420
Yes, He is a monster.

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,030
He looks quite nice.

130

i gotta find Yueya

131
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,860

I gotta find Yueya

San Lang died.

I'm going to accompany him

157

What San lang are you talking about?<br> Right now you're in a dream, Wake up!

158

If you don't wake up,<br> your brother will have a sudden death.<br>Yueya!

Lord Gu

Yueya, what's wrong?

164
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,310
I'm called Yueya?

165

If you're not called Yueya then what is it?

166

No, this isn't right

167
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm Yueqi Luo

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,330
What Yueqi Luo?'

169
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,670
Yueqi Luo

170
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,600
She is Yueqi Luo!

171
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,670
Catch her and give her to me!<br> Don't let her run!

172
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,820
My son died because of her!

173
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,710
Run quickly!

174
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,680
Get her!

175
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,530
Out of the way!

176
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,110
Don't run!<br> Catch him!

177
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,880
It's bad.

178
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,780
You have to wake up.

179
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,960
Yueya, listen up<br> you are not Yueqi Luo, you are Yueya

180
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,750
This is all a dream, you will soon wake up

181
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,120
Wake up, your brother is waiting for you

182
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,590
Yueya!

183
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,790
You're called Yueya,not Yueqi Luo<br> Remember!

184
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,010
Quickly wake up!<br> You're Yueya!

185
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,170
You're not Yueqi luo, you're Yueya!

186
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,180
You're not Yueqi luo, you're Yueya!<br> Who am I?

187
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
Who am I?

Don't run! Catch her!

189
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,320

Catch this bitch to go back!

191
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,730
Okay. <br>Go! Go!

192
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,100
You're not Yueqi luo, you're Yueya!

193
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,270
I am Yueqi Luo

194
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,780
Who am I?

195
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,920
Who am I?

196
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,800
Yueya!

197
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,310
Who am I?

198
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,290
Did you see Lord Gu?

199
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,380
Wake up<br> Yueya

200
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,370
Yueya!

201
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,740
Wake up!

202
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,760
Yueya!

203
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,620
Things are like this

204
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,600
Right now Yueya thinks she is yueqi luo

205
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,930
Yueya in fact is trapped in Yue Qiluo memories.

206
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,630
So it is like this

207
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,880
Hey,

208
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,560
If you really want to recall, <br>actually have to terminate her sleep.

209
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,190
That is recall to end it.

210
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,160
Yueya isn't it will wake up?

211
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,490
No, Lord Gu.<br>Yueya now is experiencing

212
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,900
Yue Qiluo's past period.

213
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,270
You forgot what kind of fate <br>Yue Qiluo have in the end?

214
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,910
The end?

215
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,790
Alive nail in the coffin and sleep for a hundred years.

216
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,990
Could it be that Yueya will sleep for a hundred years?

217
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,960
Furthermore,

218
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,540
Yue Qiluo, she's to set about

219
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
You thought is it was simply just to let her sleep?

220
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,180
You also say it.

221
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,370
Yueya want to commit suicide <br>wholeheartedly in her dream.

222
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,670
What I'm most worried about right now..

223
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,800
If she dies in her dream,

224
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,750
In real life she will also.

225
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,780
What happened?<br> Something wrong with Yueya. <br>Quickly called a doctor!

226
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,220
What?!<br>Yueya breathing and pulse are weak!

227
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,780
Quickly called a doctor!<br>You wait for me! I'll be right back!

228
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Hurry up!

229
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,760
Go in!<br> Go in! Wicked scoundrel!

230
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,280
Little slut! Kill a person!<br> Pay it with your own life!

231
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,080
You wait and see!

232
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,600
No! No!

233
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,860

I'm begging you, let her go

<i>What do you think of the house?</i>

<i>Is your house I'm staying?</i>

248

Let me out!<br>Help me!

336
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,720
Why are you glanced sideways?

337
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,520
You're not afraid your eyeball fly!<br> What's the matter with her?!

338
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,340
Old man...Old man really have no ability.

339
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,640
What did you say?

340
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,620
If your sister wake up,

341
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,170
I'm afraid that...

342
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,320
I'm afraid that is only a stick of incense.(small chances)

343
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,000
It's kind of you to say it again one more time!

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,240
You said it again one more time!<br> Say!

345
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,380
Commander, I have tried another way again.

346
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,550
If she really wake up again. <br>I...

347
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,770
You remember, you have already handle this for years.<br> Dogs have long to go up right itself!

348
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,390
Let me tell you. If you don't cure my sister,<br> I will shoot you!

349
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,940
Commander Gu..

350
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,360
Spare me!<br> Spare me Commander Gu!

351
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,310
Spare me!<br>Take a hike! Quickly go away!

352
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,810
Let me tell you. <br>Do not let me see you in Wen County!

353
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,990
Yes! Yes! Yes!

354
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,290
Let me out!

355
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,120
let me out!

356
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,050
It's all over.<br> Let me out!

357
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,420
Why are you still good at struggling?

358
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,900
The more struggling, the more pain.

359
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,480
Only dead is a real relief.

360
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
Dead

361
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,190
On what it is settle?

362
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:48,790
Also no worries,<br>No fear, <br>No pain.

363
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,110
Whats the use?

364
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,900
Even if you fine one, Yueya still wont wake up

365
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,340
She is not sick

366
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,430
How would the doctor know how to treat it?

367
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,150
Then, why you let me go to find a doctor?

368
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,650
I can't just watching her straight in here.

369
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,910
Yue Qiluo said. Once the paper is ruined,

370
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,340
Yueya will also died.

371
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,530
Now, the paper person increasingly <br>have a weak spot.

372
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,120
Yueya pulse also has become increasingly weak.

373
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,100
I'm really afraid in case this <br>little bit of light will die out.

374
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,030
Yueya won't ever wake up

375
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,160
Earlier, I used my own blood when burning the paper person.

376
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,450
Yueya could also feel the pain.<br> There is also sign of awake.

377
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,270
But

378
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,150
But what?

379
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,080
But if Yueya will wake up to every

380
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,410
rays of light if we re-light<br> the paper person to shine.

381
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,140
No, what do you want to say?

382
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,220
What I want to say is<br> this paper person before have a strong light.

383
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,690
It prove that it is full of energy.<br> So it can suppress it to live.

384
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,040
Yueya!

385
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,190
Did you see lord Gu?

386
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,320
Who am I?<br> Wake up

387
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,020
Yueya!

388
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,620
Who am I?

389
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,820
The paper person is now have a very weak energy.<br>Maybe, this is the time to let go and gamble it.

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,170
what are you doing?<br>Calm down, dont be rash

391
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,690
I'm not fooling around. This is the only way.

392
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,980
Now, the paper person energy is very weak.<br> I still can wake her up if later then it may be too late.

393
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,870
You ruined the paper person.

394
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,330
Is my sister not going to be destroy?

395
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,570
Isn't it exhausted?

396
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,940
Dont lie to yourself anymore

397
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,110
You're tired

398
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,270
Just sleep

399
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,730
Death is not terrible.

400
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,680
But entering it's nothing, just a quiet sleep.

401
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,400
Dead. <br> It is all free.

402
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,860
The paper person ruined, Yueya will die.<br>You can do nothing then. Yueya certain death!

403
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,360
Let go!<br>Calm down, there must be another way

404
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,030
you..

405
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,320
Yueya is not breathing.

406
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,970
Also not even the pulse.

407
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,680
this..what should we do?

408
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,360
I don't believe.<br>I will not let you get away.

409
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,980
Yueqi Luo, return Yueya to me!

Die you will get nothing.

I cannot die

Why are you so persistent?

Why are you not obediently die?

429
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,800
You are Yue Qiluo.<br>Yue Qiluo in this respect blocked in the well.

00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,450
No

You've now seen my life

439

Don't you think I'm very pitiful?

440
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:10,280
You and I meet by chance on the street.<br>You can take me home for my room and board.

441
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,350
But now, you see my destiny is so tragic.

442

Don't you think, I should also have <br>one chance to live again?

443
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,630
The man you like,I also like

But he didn't even look at me<br> because you're standing in the middle.

No!

<i>Lyrics translation: musicindividual86 </i>

585
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,380
♫ The wind brings him along for the longest journey, ♫

586
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:45,940
♫ Following the rays of night, never once stopping. ♫

587
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:53,520
♫ Embracing the warm starlight, it’s also kissed the flower of the night before. ♫

588
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,240
♫ All along the way, the melody wanders. Does it still remember its hometown? ♫

589
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,680
♫ Let life wisp through the corners of time as it wills. ♫

590
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,780
♫ It silently watches people love and hate. ♫

591
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:22,470
♫ It drifts along with time, no matter if it has forgotten or remembered. ♫

592
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:29,670
♫ The memory of him leaving her continuously lives on. ♫

593
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:37,340
♫ Let life wisp through the corners of time as it wills. ♫

594
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:44,350
♫ It silently watches people love and hate. ♫

595
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:51,740
♫ It drifts along with time, no matter if it has forgotten or remembered. ♫

596
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:59,230
♫ The memory of him leaving her continuously lives on. ♫

597
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:10,020
♫ The memory of leaving her continuously lives on. ♫
