1
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,329
Why does the wind blow?

2
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,095
It wipes the tracks
where we have passed..

3
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:40,434
so that no one can tell
whether we still exist.

4
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,145
Long ago when warriors
of Light and Darkness..

5
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,709
clashed on the Bridge of Justice..

6
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,257
and blood was spilled..

7
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:03,159
the great Gesser's heart
could not bear it..

8
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,027
and he stopped the battle.

9
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:11,229
But in due time, when the night
is longer than the day..

10
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,500
a new Great One will come.

11
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,838
The world will be
plunged into darkness..

12
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,378
and nothing can save it..

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,382
except the Chalk of Fate..

14
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:29,114
which is kept
in an impenetrable fortress.

15
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,750
And all who come for it
and pass through the gates..

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,919
perish in its endless maze.

17
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,396
So had it always been..

18
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,558
until Tamerlane came.

19
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,549
Mercy!

20
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,108
Mercy! Mercy!

21
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,952
Please! I have done you no wrong.

22
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,287
Don't kill me!

23
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,884
The temple holds the Chalk.
It's in there.

24
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:44,215
Long and hard have you
fought to be here, Tamerlane.

25
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,251
I will control
the fate of the world-

26
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,017
You can't even
control your own fate.

27
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,370
What should I write?

28
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,531
- What is it you want?
- To live.

29
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,609
Then write that.

30
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,019
The temple holds the Chalk.

31
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,691
You said that before.

32
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,136
Don't kill me.
Don't kill..

33
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,723
"From that time on, Tamerlane made no
more mistakes that he could not correct."

34
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,656
You knew that?

35
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,662
Trainee Nazarova, just do me
a favor and put the book away.

36
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,567
Could it be?
The Chalk exists?

37
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,069
Anything you want to change?

38
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,662
Would you move the knee away?

39
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,902
Why do you always talk to me
like I did something wrong, huh?

40
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,774
That's enough. Just move your knee.

41
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,896
I'm starving.

42
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,435
Well, then.. can I
take you out to dinner?

43
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,198
Yeah? Like where?

44
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,535
Here. Chinese.

45
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,439
Chinese? Sounds good.

46
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,910
Tomorrow at 6:00-no, 7:00.

47
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,641
- Yes?
- Yeah.

48
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,740
Um, all right.
We will then.

49
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,285
- If nothing happens.
- That goes without saying.

50
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,686
Is anyone out there near the Expo Center?

51
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,986
Gorodetsky. I'm about five
minutes away from there.

52
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,062
Report of a human being attacked.

53
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,428
Another old woman.
Same pattern as before.

54
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,502
Stabbed with a large needle.
Attacked from behind.

55
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,565
The needle was placed so it entered
under the victim's shoulder.

56
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,233
What's happening?

57
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,783
The attacker is sucking
the victim's energy.

58
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,920
No I.D. on this one.
Be careful. He's very dangerous.

59
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,927
Sorry. Can't go there.
I'm with a trainee.

60
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,091
Read you.
14-85, on our way.

61
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,831
Thanks, Anton. I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

62
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,499
Someone really needs
to deal with those Dark Ones.

63
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,380
Do not go into the Gloom without me.

64
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,815
- Hmm?
- Move slowly in there and breathe deeply.

65
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,011
And the second level
is out of bounds.

66
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,020
- What's in there?
- Don't know. Never been there.

67
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,556
They say mosquitoes.

68
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,059
- Even mosquitoes don't live there.
- Boris Ivanovich said they did.

69
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,460
Well, of course, if he said so.

70
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,466
Only use the flashlight
for lighting, okay?

71
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,367
- What's it do?
- Don't touch this.

72
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Right there!

73
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,349
Sveta. Sveta!

74
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,924
Sveta!

75
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,090
What the hell do you
think you're doing, huh?

76
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,431
Hey, Sveta! Who said you could
get out of the truck?

77
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,402
- And then, uh..
- Stop yelling at me.

78
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,564
He hurt me.

79
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,370
My shoulder hurts me.

80
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,775
He stuck me under the shoulder.

81
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,713
And then..
then I fell over and..

82
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,444
You there! Hold it!
Freeze!

83
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,181
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Sveta!

84
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,688
- Stop!
- Sveta!

85
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,190
Easy, grandma.
Just hold on one second.

86
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,954
Okay? Easy. Hold on.

87
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,529
The bastards.
They all got away.

88
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,531
- Come on! Out of the way!
- Come back!

89
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,362
Move it! Make way!

90
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,732
Sveta!

91
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,475
Stop!

92
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,320
Freeze! Don't move!

93
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,291
Hey!

94
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,641
Don't!

95
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,180
Stop! No!

96
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,614
Come back here!

97
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,381
Come back here!

98
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,230
Svetlana!

99
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,297
Come back!

100
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,403
Behind you!

101
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,672
Hurry!

102
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,078
Hurry up!

103
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,250
Behind you!
Behind-

104
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,566
Hold it! Hey!

105
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,265
- Stop!
- No!

106
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,842
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

107
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,689
Oh, God.

108
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,693
What's with this
insubordination, huh?

109
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,730
Why did you have to stop me?
I almost had him.

110
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,097
I'll deal with him, understand?

111
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,966
How do you know that one?

112
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,437
I just do.

113
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,440
But he's a Dark One.

114
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,442
Dark, Light?
Who cares?

115
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,910
How did this happen to you, eh?

116
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,712
Just a lot of nice people
in the world.

117
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:39,324
As long as this ring is
on you, you will do as I say.

118
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,916
It hurts.

119
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,587
And is that bad?

120
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
Till death do us part.

121
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,002
- Sign here, please.
- What is this?

122
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,803
A contract.

123
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,813
- Another one?
- Well, obviously, you haven't
been able to sign one yet.

124
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,940
- Excuse me?
- It's for the hall.

125
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,677
- The cost?
- A thousand.. per hour.

126
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,681
For this?

127
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,091
You must have no shame at all.

128
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,130
- These are the times we live in.
- Uh-huh. Not for long.

129
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,764
Zavulon!

130
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,535
Yegor?

131
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,679
What happened to you?

132
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:39,046
You said to me that only Great Ones
can go into the second level of Gloom!

133
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,721
Give me a weapon!
Give it to me!

134
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,190
A few minutes ago..

135
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,784
near the Expo subway,
a murder was prevented.

136
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,557
A Dark One attacked a human
in full public view.

137
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,395
- Did you make an arrest?
- No, we didn't.

138
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,561
- No case, no trial.
- We've recovered some physical evidence.

139
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,401
What kind?

140
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,407
Now you've done it.

141
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,977
Who the hell was she?

142
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,063
Rogova, do you not tell
your students that

143
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,071
committing murder happens
to be a crime now?

144
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,082
No! No! No way!

145
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,320
Where's your hat?

146
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,586
This is it? The best evidence you've got?

147
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,596
Yeah.

148
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,531
- What'd he look like?
- Don't remember.

149
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,534
- You don't remember, huh?
- No.

150
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,367
Okay, let's give it to the
lab and let them worry.

151
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,929
Come on.

152
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,408
Anton, let me have
your car keys, will ya?

153
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,239
Forty-nine years
since I rode the subway.

154
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,837
- Yeah, happy to give'em to you, man.
- I got all day.

155
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,310
Here.

156
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,755
And how are you doing, Sveta?
You feeling okay?

157
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,222
Uh-huh.

158
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,555
You need to get something to eat.

159
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,788
Let's find a restaurant.

160
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,422
Why didn't you tell Semyon
you knew the kid?

161
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,694
So now what do we do?

162
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,417
Where are you going?

163
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,291
If this damn hat's a problem,
why don't we just steal it, huh?

164
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,828
Oh, what's that? Hobo steaks again?

165
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,954
Of course not.
Willing donors.

166
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,464
I have a small request.

167
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,900
- My son, he just got his first
blood license in the mail.
- Congratulations.

168
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,940
- But he doesn't drink.
- By now they've already closed
the Night Watch lab, Zavulon.

169
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,264
Where do they store the
evidence over there?

170
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,510
In the archive.

171
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,171
You can have until the morning.

172
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,049
All right. How do you
want me to get there?

173
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,841
Quickly.

174
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,385
Kostya was out,
so I signed for it..

175
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,386
but.. but I didn't know.

176
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,752
Is there a way we can
take care of this problem?

177
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,190
- Your son is not a natural Other?
- Um, but, uh..

178
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,846
No. He bit the kid himself.

179
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,422
Because he had pneumonia,
sir, in both lungs!

180
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,499
Guess Mom had pneumonia too.

181
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,829
You bitch!

182
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,999
- I'm sorry.
- It happens.

183
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,808
He needs to wait a bit.
You can do that.

184
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,373
Yeah? I'll do anything.

185
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,114
Anything you need.

186
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,723
Anything, hmm?

187
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,816
That would be illegal.

188
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,698
You get that?

189
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,067
Get what? The Night Watch archive,
how am I getting the hat?

190
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,504
How? How?

191
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,576
Well, let's try asking the dad.

192
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,376
All right, food folks,
we need something for a growing boy.

193
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,212
All right! On the double!
On the double! Hustle it up now!

194
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,387
Here. Bottoms up.

195
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,481
Drink it.

196
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,725
- Yeah?
- Mr. Gorodetsky, I'm Yegor's teacher,
Galina Rogova.

197
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,925
- Your son lost his hat..
- Sorry. Wrong number.

198
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,097
You see hats like that
all over Moscow.

199
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,437
Well done.

200
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,875
You'll go far.

201
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,277
- Diving into the second-level Gloom.
- That's not much.

202
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,010
I couldn't push in there.
Barely got my hand in.

203
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,586
Can we get a menu
so we can get some food?

204
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,587
You ordered already.

205
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,089
Hmm. Don't remember.

206
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,752
Good.

207
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:53,037
Why are you so.. dirty?

208
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,941
You're worse than me.

209
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,111
It's Boris Ivanovich.

210
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,753
Well, Boris Ivanovich.

211
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,762
So, what are you doing?

212
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,732
Oh, we're just sitting here
waiting for our dumplings.

213
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,804
- Don't you have a lecture?
- Do I?

214
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,966
I forgot.
Uh, not tonight then.

215
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,568
- Tomorrow. 7:00.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,982
Anton, you understand
that engaging in..

217
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,682
informal relations with
trainees is forbidden.

218
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,759
Well, it's a little late
for that. Isn't it?

219
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,760
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

220
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,524
As-salaam alaikum, Zoar.

221
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,758
Haven't seen you for a while.

222
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,994
Everything going well for you?

223
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,002
It all goes just as it should.

224
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,334
See you later, Zoar.

225
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,377
Anton, she'll soon be a Great One.

226
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,076
There is no room for two
Great Ones in this city.

227
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,483
You're talkin' about me.

228
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,420
No, Anton.
I mean your son.

229
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,220
If Yegor and Sveta cross paths..

230
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,726
the world will be lost to darkness.

231
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,428
Look at you.
You are a Light One..

232
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,504
drinking dark beer.

233
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,041
Real nice talk, you know?

234
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,313
Go ahead.
Eat, Yegor. Eat.

235
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,047
Tomorrow's going to be a big day.

236
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,385
You're going to need your strength.

237
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,391
- What's going on tomorrow?
- Mmm.

238
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,427
We'll be seeing a lot of guests.

239
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,428
Granny Darya is being released..

240
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,794
so she'll be there with Mashenka.

241
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,867
There will be presents.

242
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,232
So, anything you might like?

243
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,836
- It's early for this.
- I won't go.

244
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,940
We won't force you.

245
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,747
Don't want that to happen.

246
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,016
"On his deathbed,
Tamerlane told his servants..

247
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,114
"to bury him with his fist clenched.

248
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,126
His order was carried out."

249
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,432
I need these dumplings
to take away, Zoar.

250
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,441
I'm going home.

251
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,977
- These are manti.
- Yeah, whatever.

252
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,778
Ah, "The Lives
of Remarkable People."

253
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:57,048
Mm-hmm.
A remarkable life I've got, boy.

254
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,316
A son who is dark and unhappy..

255
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,619
and a girlfriend
with more talent than me.

256
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,957
Tamerlane had trouble with his son.

257
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,963
In those days, just how bad could
his problems have really been, huh?

258
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,863
He was killed.

259
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,698
You shouldn't
drink any more, Anton..

260
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,604
or you'll really run into trouble.

261
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,142
You have a heart of gold, Zoar.

262
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,075
- What do I owe you?
- A hundred.

263
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,511
Here.

264
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,325
You were warned.

265
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,606
"The location of
Tamerlane's burial site..

266
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,768
"long remained a mystery.

267
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,507
"In 1941,
under Professor Gerasimov..

268
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,676
"an expedition was organized
and went to Samarkand.

269
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:05,314
"But the war interfered, and all the
records of the expedition were scattered..

270
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:10,225
to various archives and research centers
dedicated to Central Asia."

271
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,489
"Your house is connected."
What is this nonsense?

272
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,736
Listen, Gorodetsky.

273
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,813
Seems your boy is in trouble.

274
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,008
They'll disintegrate him.

275
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,176
I told you, wrong number.

276
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,120
What a sad excuse for a father.

277
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,091
It's Yegor's birthday tomorrow.

278
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,560
Did you remember that?
Huh?

279
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,654
- Get a present.
- Oh, a present?

280
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,563
- A hat.
- A head warmer?

281
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,832
Like this one.

282
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,009
You know how many there are
in Moscow like this?

283
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,012
I absolutely can't help you.

284
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,378
- Can't or won't?
- Yeah.

285
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,111
- I'll write to the Inquisition.
- Oh, please. Write who you like.

286
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,551
Drop dead, will you?

287
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,732
Today we face an extremely strong rival.

288
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,431
The entire nation
is watching this match.

289
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,566
Dangerous.
There's the strike!

290
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,440
- Oh!
- And Ovchinnikov makes an amazing save!

291
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,208
Our team makes an immediate
counter-offense.

292
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,216
Long pass.

293
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,583
Hey! Hey, come on!

294
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,588
Hey!

295
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,818
The kick is good. Goal!

296
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,225
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

297
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,777
Two time-outs.
That's 15 minutes.

298
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,584
And then they take the penalty kicks.

299
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,591
- So we've changed the score.
- Goal! Goal! Goal!

300
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,593
- The balance has shifted..
- On the attack.

301
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,595
And the difference
is a dramatic one.

302
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,043
- Yes! Strike!
- Goal! Yeah!

303
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,050
This is the turning point.

304
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,855
The main thing now is not
to go back to defense but attack!

305
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,522
And attack with great care.
Both these teams are strong.

306
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,979
Around back! There's the strike!
It's in! Goal!

307
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,688
"Central Asia, Special Vault."

308
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,211
"CHALK OF FATE"

309
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,890
"Request permission for a
Samarkand expedition..

310
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,692

311
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,461
"where, according to our research,
Tamerlane is buried..

312
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,595

313

Denied."

314
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,406
Once again our team attacks. The strike!

315
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,777
It's in! It's in!

316
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,113
A 4-2 victory!
But the price it cost was the nerves..

317
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,379
of not only the players
but you and me as well.

318
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,116
It's a great moment for us!

319
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,306
Oh, you're good.

320
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:10,150
He gave me such a look, Alicia.
It scared the hell out of me.

321
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,661
- You mean no one's covering you?
- I'm alone.

322
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,494
- Want me to come over?
- Thank you, but I'll be all right.

323
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,500
You be careful, okay?

324
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,537
Hello? Galya?
What is it?

325
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,631
Oh, sorry.
I'm just so exhausted.

326
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,439
- Call me later?
- You call me.

327
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,673
Yeah.
I need to get home.

328
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,650
Galina!

329
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,655
Who's there?

330
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,815
Enough with the jokes.

331
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,224
Who is this?

332
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,820
A judge.

333
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,297
Yes? And who would be on trial?

334
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,892
You are.

335
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,740
This is 741.

336
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,709
Forensic team is on the scene.
Paramedics are gone.

337
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,279
They left a report.

338
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,508
Galya! Galya! Galya!

339
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,778
- Let me through!
- Let's set up as close as we can.

340
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,616
- She's my daughter!
- I'm sorry, but this area is closed.

341
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,622
The team is working.

342
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,079
There are no wounds in evidence.
Why would you think it's a homicide?

343
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,781
We know who killed the woman.

344
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,295
Let me tell you where you're going to go!
Do you understand what I'm saying?

345
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,460
- Quit arguing! Go get me Zavulon!
- He's unavailable.

346
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,936
- Did you tell him it was me?
- I did.

347
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,839
- Who's with him?
- He can't be disturbed.

348
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,699
You can't go in there! No!

349
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,139
I did what you asked. You
said you would help.

350
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,415
Go on to work. I'll tell you
what to do next tonight.

351
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,093
- Hello.
- Don't you worry about a thing.

352
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,429
Ever heard of knocking?
You might try it.

353
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,316
Oh, well, look who's here!

354
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,648
You know, for some reason,
I can't seem to get hold..

355
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,120
- of your girlfriend, what's her name.
- Rogova is dead.

356
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,288
Bastard!

357
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,669
You know who did it?

358
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,740
The man's gone totally insane.

359
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,605
Galina met with Gorodetsky.

360
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,941
Evidence is what we need
to prove it.

361
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,015
- You think..
- Now get some!

362
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,217
- All right, I..
- Go now!

363
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,426
Can I take the wheels?

364
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,367
Chalk of Fate.

365
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,375
Samarkand.

366
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,741
Tamerlane's tomb.

367
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,739
Samarkand. Select.

368
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,943
Username: Anton.

369
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,886
Enter.

370
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,924
"YOU'VE GOT NEW MAIL
FROM USER ZAVULON"

371
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,063
"Thanks. You've helped your
son and the rest of us.

372
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,296
"Destroy the evidence right away.

373
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,532
And don't forget
it's Yegor's birthday."

374
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,557
Ah.

375
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,354
Ready?

376
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,708
Enough. What's the deal?
Have a bad night?

377
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,413
Are my eyes red?

378
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:08,040
Mm-hmm. Come on. We are
going to see Gesser.

379
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,341
- Why?
- Come on. Come on. Move. Move.

380
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
There is a major influx
of Dark Ones in the city.

381
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:18,254
Checking by districts, we're done
in Dimitrovka, Yaroslavka and Fili.

382
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,917
But, uh, in Bibirevo, uh,
we haven't, uh..

383
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,426
- we haven't gotten..
- Start.

384
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,554
A start yet.

385
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,100
No start yet. We simply don't have
enough men to cover it.

386
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,726
- How's it going?
- Shh.

387
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,295
There are just too many
of these Dark Ones gathering.

388
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,568
It's getting dark during the day.

389
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,645
They are getting ready
for something big.

390
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,876
Ilya, do you remember Galina Rogova?

391
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,645
- Rogova?
- Yes, Rogova.

392
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:53,019
My opinion is, um, she's dangerous.

393
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,752
- She could, uh, shatter the Truce.
- No, not anymore.

394
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,728
This morning Galina Rogova
was found dead.

395
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,426
She was discovered
in the hallway of her apartment.

396
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,464
There were no wounds anywhere.

397
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:13,476
Apparent cause of death:
total removal of life force.

398
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,332
Uh, all right, young lady,
use care now.

399
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,872
What's she called?

400
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,108
Mashenka.

401
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,873
Masha Rogova.

402
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,881
This man familiar?

403
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,611
Uh, no.

404
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,324
If you will allow it,
I am going to talk with Masha.

405
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,297
- Hello, Mashenka.
- Hi.

406
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,267
Oh, that's a nice turtle.

407
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,203
He's almost like a real one.

408
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,706
Do you know who this is?

409
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,777
N-No.

410
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,041
Your mama is gone.

411
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,913
My mama is gone.

412
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,546
She went on a long trip.

413
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,621
Your mama didn't go anywhere, honey.

414
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,697
Your mama is dead.

415
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,599
What do you mean, dead?

416
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,694
She's dead and gone.

417
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,077
Grandma! Grandma!

418
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,738
Ah, now what's the matter?
What is it, dear?

419
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:01,784
Grandma, Mama is dead.
Mama is dead and gone forever.

420
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,719
Oh, my poor darling angel.

421
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,790
Where did you hear that, huh?

422
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,018
The lady told me it was true.

423
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,359
What lady?
There's no one here.

424
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,797
Oh, my dear.

425
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,599
It was your mama, wasn't it?
She came to say good-bye.

426
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,565
The bottom line is that
we're being accused..

427
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:30,010
of a situation
which is.. unfortunate.

428
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,208
A Light Other who either
doesn't know that there is a truce..

429
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:36,650
or worse, is ignoring it.

430
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,916
This is the state we find ourselves in.
Have a question?

431
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,229
No?

432
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:51,995
Thank you. You're all free to go,
except for Semyon, Olga..

433
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,903
Ilya.. and Anton.

434
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,969
Thank you for the compliment,
Boris Ivanovich.

435
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,457
I have to conduct
an inside investigation.

436
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,198
Write your reports.

437
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,702
Where you were that night and..

438
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,830
whether your alibis
can be confirmed or not.

439
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,600
Ha!

440
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,953
Can I have the ball?

441
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,029
Come on.

442
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,689
- What is your major?
- Biology.

443
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,393
Mm-hmm.

444
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,664
Not drinking human blood,
is that what you study?

445
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,072
You're really kind of cute.

446
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,151
Shame you're a vampire.

447
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,412
We might have been friends.

448
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,511
So you think we won't?

449
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,817
Okay, maybe.

450
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,325
Easy there.
Tell me a story.

451
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,992
Your friend next door,
he around lately?

452
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,570
Why do you say he's my friend?

453
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,506
- Come on back!
- Hey, I really can't judge you.

454
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,100
- You can do whatever you want to do.
- Let's go!

455
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,373
You're a Dark Other.

456
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,608
You could even make friends
with Light Ones.

457
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,549
Thank you, miss.
Your humor's interesting.

458
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,556
You got the ball. Come on.

459
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:58,025
Last night, Galina Rogova
was killed at her home.

460
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,892
What's that got to do with me?

461
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,629
Her daughter is five years old.

462
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,941
Kostya, we're waiting!
Come on!

463
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:17,002
I saw her last night
talking to Gorodetsky.

464
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,379
Give us the ball at least!

465
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,384
Thank you.

466
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,922
Kostya!

467
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,692
- What have you got?
- Last night she met Gorodetsky.

468
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,738
- How did you find that out?
- A witness.

469
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,333
Hmm. Vampire Junior.

470
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,571
How did you know that?

471
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,307
Why don't you come on over?
I miss you.

472
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,417
Send Gorodetsky in.

473
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,457
When they killed Rogova,
Gorodetsky was in the archive.

474
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,925
- Hmm.
- Yes?

475
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,292
So he has an alibi.

476
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:11,096
But he won't confess to
it, and quite right.

477
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:15,935
And so we'll have no choice
but to turn him over to the Dark Ones.

478
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,476
What will they do with him?

479
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,977
I don't know,
but they won't get him alive.

480
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,979
You've thought of something?

481
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,482
Yes!

482
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,852
- Olga, have you seen the boss?
- Sit down.

483
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,674
I'm sorry, Olga.
I have to do this.

484
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,179
- What?
- I know you do.

485
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,182
Well, I don't.
But the problem..

486
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,530
Are you completely out of your mind?

487
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,890
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:20,123
Anton, you never
would've agreed to it.

489
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,538
Anton.

490
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,780
It'll be all right.

491
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,451
I need Gesser for a minute.

492
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,987
Get lost, you and Gesser.

493
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,354
Anton, no one gave you
permission to leave.

494
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,021
- What do we do with the voice?
- Not a problem.

495
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,224
Should be working. Give it a try.

496
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,858
Yes? Yes?

497
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,903
Yes. Hmm. Great. Now I'm a tranny.

498
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,995
You don't like it?

499
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,371
How do you walk?
These are important details.

500
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,376
Anton, remember, I don't smoke.

501
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,746
Look, you've smudged
your makeup already.

502
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,038
I'll manage.

503
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,048
Pay attention.
Nothing in your pockets.

504
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,983
That's why you carry a bag.
Another thing..

505
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,486
You're a woman now.
You need to keep your back straight.

506
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,556
Then why is my ass wiggling?

507
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,818
- Reflex reactions.
- You!

508
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,360
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

509
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,362
- Boris Ivanovich.
- Ilya, hello.

510
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,364
- See you later.
- I was trying to, uh..

511
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,434
- Nothing to worry about.
- Nothing.

512
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,005
How long do I do this?

513
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:10,030
Two or three days. Until
we find the killer.

514
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,846
So where do I stay?

515
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,576
Work something out.
Call one of the guys.

516
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,373
Hey, look, Semyon.
Semyon, hey, can I crash with you?

517
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,380
- Okay. Starting..
- Today.

518
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,382
- Oh.
- No, no, no. Forget it.

519
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,746
- Boris.
- Sorry.

520
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,787
- We could try Svetlana, eh?
- Good idea.

521
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,924
What do I say?

522
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,984
Say that Boris Ivanovich
has a snoring problem.

523
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,791
Hold on!
Do I snore?

524
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,592
To sum up..

525
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,570
you have all now
learned the technique..

526
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:47,872
of detecting objects
hidden from us behind a barrier.

527
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,539
Svetlana..

528
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,550
show us the miracle of introscopy.

529
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,916
Tell us who is at the door.

530
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,616
It's Anton Gorodetsky.

531
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,495
Hello.

532
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,157
Excuse the interruption.

533
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,791
Please, Olga, not at all.

534
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,564
We're privileged that you join us.

535
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,902
- Thank you.
- We're studying the basics of introscopy.

536
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:22,809
- Since you're here, maybe you'll
show us a demonstration?
- Um..

537
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,938
- Just a small one.
- Well, timing's not good now.

538
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,346
Just something. Anything.
It would mean a great deal to us.

539
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:31,785
Really. Sorry. Now's not good
for me. I'm here for Sveta.

540
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,119
You smoke now?

541
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,489
Excuse me.

542
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:41,758
Poor Svetlana.
What's she going to do with him now?

543
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,666
Thank you. Let's go.

544
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,519
- Pretty soon Anton should be here.
- He's not coming.

545
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,885
- How do you know?
- He got stuck somewhere.

546
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,424
We were supposed to meet here
and go to a restaurant.

547
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,654
No time for that now.
I'll tell you why later.

548
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,396
Uh, I have a question for you.

549
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,988
Mm-hmm?
Yeah, ask me.

550
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,433
How much do you like Anton?

551
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,575
You like him?

552
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,844
He's a little
strange sometimes..

553
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:12,786
as if he were afraid of me.

554
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,491
Not as a woman, you know.

555
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,888
And not so much, uh, afraid.

556
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,091
- He just..
- Maintains his distance?

557
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,361
Uh, yeah.

558
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,462
Something like that.

559
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,475
No surprise there.

560
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,477
You're destined
to become a great witch..

561
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,037
and he's category three,
at a stretch.

562
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,050
I don't care what his category is.

563
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:45,883
It's all the same to me
as a woman. I love him.

564
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,086
Olga!

565
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,838
Careful there.

566
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,850
You be careful!
You're insane!

567
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,187
Look, I really know it's
none of my business,

568
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,446
but when you take a look
at it, it's obvious.

569
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,423
I think he loves you
very, very much.

570
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,485
A lot! He's just afraid.. afraid
that one day there'll come a time..

571
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:29,258
when you'll be too far away
for anything to happen.

572
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,164
Okay, yes, it's possible.
Someday something could happen..

573
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,169
but right now,
in the present, I'm here!

574
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,466
Come on, Sveta.
Can't you see that time is now?

575
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,598
It's now.

576
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,700
Ladies, you all right?
We'll be there in a minute.

577
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,042
Stay right where
you are. We're on our way.

578
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,574
Come on.
Let's go.

579
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,847
Then at night I called him.
Come in.

580
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,446
He wasn't home.

581
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,753
I called his mobile,
and he hung up on me.

582
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,055
- Not important.

583
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,859
- So maybe he was busy.
- Or maybe he has someone.

584
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,094
He hasn't had anyone for 12 years.

585
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:12,303
Really? Then he's got
some kind of complex.

586
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,673
"Biocomplex.

587
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:18,339
"Amazing natural way to enhance
all of your health characteristics..

588
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,348
and sex drive."

589
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,350
- Here.
- Thanks.

590
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,816
Why are you looking at me?

591
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,825
I'm going to have a shower.
Would you put on the kettle?

592
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,657
Why hasn't he had
a girlfriend for 12 years?

593
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,732
Bad time.

594
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,536
Strange.

595
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,725
Really. Why?

596
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,204
Sveta, listen.

597
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:22,071
Oh, God, how can I
possibly explain it?

598
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,147
Olga.

599
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,216
- Sometimes life throws a curve..
- Olga.

600
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,311
- And then everything is changed forever.
- Olga!

601
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,322
- Why forever?
- Olga!

602
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,051
Huh?

603
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,650
Bring me a towel, please.
They're in the cupboard.

604
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,407
- Not Olga.
- What?

605
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,870
What did you say?
I can't hear you.

606
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,748
What are you doing?

607
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,011
Not Olga. Anton.
I love you.

608
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,055
What is it?

609
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,025
What are you doing?

610
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,733
Not Olga. Anton.

611
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,861
They switched our bodies.

612
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,176
How dare you do this to me,
you bastard!

613
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,907
What made you think you could do a thing
like this to me now? I want you out!

614
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,178
You hear me? Out of my house! How could
you take advantage of me like this?

615
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,220
You.. I don't ever want
to see your face again!

616
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,346
You're a real bastard!

617
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,186
Are you crazy? Get out!
Just get out of here now!

618
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,547
- Whoa!

619
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,844
- ..nowhere near his best today.
- Oh!

620
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,851
Sergei Federov is not at his best.

621
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,944
He's got possession of the puck,
goes for the pass.

622
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,920
No, no, no!
Come on! Come on!

623
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,924
Pass back.
Markov grabs it.

624
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,392
Clear ice.
Body check.

625
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,464
- Oh!
- No flag on that play.

626
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,033
Our team is taking
some big risks out there.

627
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,001
- Come on! Come on! Go, go!
- No!

628
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,935
You morons.

629
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,099
What are they doing? They're not thinking.

630
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,268
You should show this body
a little care.

631
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,972
What am I doing that's bad?
I'm making sure it gets food.

632
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,243
Lines up and shoots.
No goal. Puck's back in play.

633
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,648
Each ounce of extra weight on her..

634
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,244
she'll remove a full pound
of flesh from you.

635
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,424
That lock doesn't work.

636
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,998
Gonna say hi?

637
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,611
Hi there, vampy.

638
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,058
Yes, yes, yes!

639
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,021
Look at that shot! It's amazing!
Look at this!

640
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,853
That was a game! Ah!

641
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:34,225
Amazing how men will think of
anything not to keep a promise.

642
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,822
What do you mean?

643
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,198
We made serious plans to go
to a restaurant.

644
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,204
Slapshot. Almost another goal.

645
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,072
- I'm not allowed.
- That was close.
Not a very pleasing moment..

646
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,757
I need your son.

647
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,497
Uh, Kostya.

648
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,609
- Hi there, Kostya.
- Yeah, hi.

649
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,447
Come.

650
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,852
Uh, who's this?

651
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,618
Papa, no.

652
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,541
Have you seen Gorodetsky?
Because we can't find him.

653
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,118
Too bad.

654
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,621
We think he switched bodies
with a young lady.

655
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,254
It's really amazing
what people get up to.

656
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,393
To you. May you get out of
this mess as soon as possible.

657
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,891
Look, a Dark One.

658
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,541
What kind of Dark is he?

659
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:05,473
That boy at the Expo Center,
he means a lot to you, doesn't he?

660
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,482
You help him so much.

661
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,882
Are you trying to break me down?

662
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,187
Once again
I see what you are..

663
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,189
an idiot.

664
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:24,198
Off to suck someone's blood..

665
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,261
and say a few incantations.

666
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,641
What do you want?

667
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,678
Would you know him
in a different body?

668
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,181
Hmm. Don't know.

669
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,260
Haven't tried it.

670
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,196
Mine, for example.

671
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,938
Mean something?

672
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,488
Yeah. And this car is unreal.

673
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,427
I'm going.

674
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,900
- I need a minute.
- Don't mix up the doors.

675
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,097
The one with the boy's
picture on it - not for you.

676
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

677
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,410
Oh! Damn it.

678
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:41,696
They set me up.

679
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,954
Good work, Anton. Now they
have the proof they want.

680
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,185
I didn't do it.
It's a coincidence.

681
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,352
It's not a coincidence.
It's a frame-up.

682
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,293
But Anton wasn't there.

683
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,302
You shouldn't have left the house.
You shouldn't have been there.

684
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,377
Now they have the opportunity..

685
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,004
to do whatever they want with you.

686
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,384
Why aren't we moving?

687
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,063
- Next time say "please."
- Zavulon!

688
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,123
I'm listening, Zavulon.

689
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,927
I am bringing a formal
charge of murder..

690
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,298
against the Night Watch agents..

691
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,874
Anton Gorodetsky.

692
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,944
Are you?

693
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,105
- Well, maybe we can find him.
- Oh, we'll take him right now.

694
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,581
He's not here.

695
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:39,121
The one we accuse
of committing murder..

696
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,622
is in the body of that young woman.

697
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,284
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

698
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,123
You don't have
the right to interfere.

699
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,290
Stop this! Why aren't you
doing anything?

700
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:54,233
Why? Why aren't you doing anything?

701
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,348
- No!
- That's enough!

702
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,359
Listen to me.
We cannot interfere.

703
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,725
If you break the Truce,
they'll kill you.

704
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,798
It will achieve nothing.

705
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,833
Line 22.

706
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,698
Why is the trolley here?

707
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,594
You have to stop this!

708
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,756
Step on it. Step on it. Come on.

709
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,917
Let's go.

710
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,296
You're an actor, right?

711
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,132
If you can't prove
before dawn..

712
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:49,735
that Gorodetsky is innocent in regard
to the deaths of the Dark Ones..

713
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,837
providing suitable evidence..

714
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,323
we will issue a warrant..

715
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,591
for his elimination.

716
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:13,465
Day Watch has already filed
the procedural request.

717
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,129
Here is a copy.

718
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,650
We won't turn him over to you.

719
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,847
I'm writing an official
note of protest.

720
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,856
If you refuse to comply
with this order..

721
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,858
the result will be war.

722
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,487
This is a provocation
by the Day Watch.

723
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,556
The Supreme Powers will not
be on your side in this.

724
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,695
The charges brought by
the Day Watch are quite real.

725
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:53,138
Your protest will be turned down.

726
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:29,342
- Hello.
- Alisher. It's Gorodetsky in Moscow.

727
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,811
- Ah! Anton, friend. How are you?
- Hey.

728
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,382
Okay. I'm going to be
flying in soon..

729
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,849
and I need a way to
get to Tamerlane's tomb..

730
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,852
- without anyone knowing.
- Here you go.

731
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,581
- Thank you.
- Yes. You're welcome.

732
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,623
- Hello? What was that?
- I wasn't talking to you.

733
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,625
- Can you help me with this?
- Of course.

734
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,857
For Gorodetsky, it's do or die.
Just come in, we'll fix it all for you.

735
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,364
Yeah. Say hi to Semyon.

736
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,231
- Salaam alaikum, Zavuloroka.
- Salaam.

737
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,531
Zavulon, there is a Gorodetsky
coming here.

738
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,131
Gorodetsky going to Samarkand?
Thank you, Mahmud.

739
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,540
So I'm flying to Samarkand?

740
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,613
Hold on.

741
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,144
His plane..

742
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,346
what if it fell out of the sky?

743
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,722
What do you mean?

744
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:21,092
Hmm. We should let the parrot fly.

745
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,433
Okay.

746
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,400
Yep.

747
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,569
- There.
- And this is..

748
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,668
His ride, of course.

749
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,475
To the airport.

750
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,207
Yes?

751
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,209
- Olga?
- How are you?

752
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,711
Bad. We gotta switch back.

753
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,375
I'll meet you at the airport
in a half an hour.

754
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,009
Late passengers,
please proceed directly to the gate.

755
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,610
Let's walk.

756
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,452
Let's take the lift.

757
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,719
- My body.
- Going someplace?

758
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,490
- Mm-hmm. I need it.
- My body's not good enough for you?

759
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,497
Don't want it to get messed up.

760
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,499
In what way?

761
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,805
Excuse us.

762
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,897
You can stop staring now.

763
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:07,560
Uh, we should walk.

764
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,785
- What's this?
- It's a belt.

765
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,917
No, it's not.
It's a weapon.

766
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,719
Purpose of visit?

767
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,799
To study monuments in the ancient
Uzbek capital. And listen.

768
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,236
Right now I'm really
running late for my flight.

769
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:40,596
Why Samarkand?

770
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,470
- Return flight's in the morning.
- Right. Yeah, yeah.

771
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:52,209
How many monuments
can you see in only one night?

772
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,743
One.

773
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:07,560
Hold on.

774
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,153
No daydreaming on duty.

775
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,703
- Flight to Samarkand?
- Yes.

776
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,273
- Thank you.
- Anton, where are you off to?

777
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,305
- Seats, please. We're leaving.
- Yeah, sure. One minute.

778
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,939
- Please take your seat now.
- Okay. Okay. I'm sitting.

779
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,882
- You have any of those candy mints?
- Yes, I've got them. Sit down.

780
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,146
Great. Thanks a lot.

781
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,318
- I'm sticking with you on this.
- Just buckle in. Okay?

782
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:40,088
Tower, come in. This is 593.
We are ready for takeoff.

783
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:43,130
593, copy. Use Runway 2. Conditions are..

784
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,161
Take off.

785
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,475
If you open the tomb, it'll be war.
And you will not make it out.

786
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,336
I'll be careful then.
Okay?

787
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,539
Just stick my pinky in.

788
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,208
No, that won't fly.

789
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,515
- What was that?
- Under control.

790
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,214
Go, please, now.

791
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,685
Proceeding.

792
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,160
No. No can do.

793
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,027
593, what is it?

794
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,997
Conditions seem normal, but no can do.

795
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,467
Listen here.

796
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:25,006
Listen. You all want to
fly to Samarkand, right?

797
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,541
Yes! Yes!

798
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,135
They all want to go.
Understand?

799
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,582
Off we go.

800
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,812
- Losing runway. Yes or no?
- Wheels up.

801
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,180
We're not gonna make it.

802
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,379
We need more thrust!

803
01:12:47,482 --> 01:12:50,280
Get her nose up!
Pull her up!

804
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:55,552
Get the damn landing gear up!

805
01:12:58,493 --> 01:13:01,257
Oh, my God.

806
01:13:03,998 --> 01:13:06,558
593, we need a status report.

807
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:19,908
I didn't send for you.

808
01:13:22,117 --> 01:13:24,415
Why aren't we doing anything?

809
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:44,295
Want some?

810
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,240
No.

811
01:13:47,342 --> 01:13:51,073
Once a man of ours
found himself in danger.

812
01:13:52,181 --> 01:13:55,116
And he broke the Truce.

813
01:13:55,217 --> 01:13:57,117
And..

814
01:13:57,219 --> 01:14:01,383
when he found himself
facing the inevitable punishment..

815
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:05,449
there was a girl who tried to help him
in this, much as she could.

816
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:10,687
Oh. It was Olga.

817
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:13,529
Later he was acquitted, and..

818
01:14:13,635 --> 01:14:15,830
the Inquisition let him go.

819
01:14:15,938 --> 01:14:20,399
- But the witch..
- Hasn't changed at all.

820
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:25,174
The one we Light Others needed
very greatly just then..

821
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:27,249
she was sentenced.

822
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,113
That's a sad story..

823
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:35,589
Boris Ivanovich.

824
01:14:36,893 --> 01:14:39,020
She was the real target..

825
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:42,258
and I was only the bait.

826
01:14:42,365 --> 01:14:44,595
She was the Great One.

827
01:14:45,635 --> 01:14:48,331
The Chalk isn't in Tamerlane's tomb.

828
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:51,999
How do you know?
Have you been there?

829
01:14:52,108 --> 01:14:56,568
In '41, Boris had problems,
and I needed the Chalk.

830
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:01,013
I arranged with archaeologists to organize
an expedition and went with them.

831
01:15:01,117 --> 01:15:06,054
In Samarkand, an old man
came to me called Zoar.

832
01:15:06,155 --> 01:15:10,182
He said if we opened the tomb,
it would start a war.

833
01:15:11,861 --> 01:15:17,027
But I knew that I would have the Chalk
and I could change everything.

834
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:19,568
When we opened the tomb,
there was an inscription.

835
01:15:20,838 --> 01:15:23,272
"I held the whole world
in my hand..

836
01:15:23,374 --> 01:15:26,537
but I can't take it
where I'm going."

837
01:15:26,644 --> 01:15:28,942
The Chalk was not in his right hand.

838
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:37,815
- What was Zoar doing?
- He worked in the government.

839
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:39,822
Ideology section.

840
01:15:39,924 --> 01:15:42,017
And with Tamerlane?

841
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:45,755
Pretty much the same thing.
Zoar as right-hand man.

842
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:54,130
Right-hand man?

843
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:56,206
Oh, Zoar.

844
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:01,444
You sly dog.

845
01:16:01,545 --> 01:16:03,513
- Olga.
- Hmm?

846
01:16:03,614 --> 01:16:07,175
Let's turn the plane around.
I know where the Chalk is.

847
01:16:07,284 --> 01:16:09,252
Zoar's got it.

848
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:30,001
Zoar, give me the Chalk.

849
01:16:34,045 --> 01:16:35,945
Here it is.

850
01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:39,881
You don't get it.
I mean the magic Chalk.

851
01:16:39,985 --> 01:16:42,510
It's the magic Chalk.

852
01:16:45,423 --> 01:16:48,119
- And where do the markings go?
- Well, here.

853
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:50,558
- On the blackboard.
- And does it work?

854
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:52,892
Every day.

855
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:59,470
What do I write?

856
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:02,369
Whatever you want.

857
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,055
How is it? How is it
that you're here now?

858
01:17:51,157 --> 01:17:54,024
I was just passing by
and happened to look in.

859
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:56,026
You were just passing by?

860
01:17:56,128 --> 01:17:58,028
You think you were just passing by?

861
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,530
No, no. Yegor, it worked!
Don't you understand?

862
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:03,796
- It really worked!
- What did? What worked, Papa?

863
01:18:03,903 --> 01:18:05,928
The Chalk. The Chalk.
It worked!

864
01:18:06,038 --> 01:18:08,006
What a blessing
that you've come back.

865
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:10,541
Wait. Why are you so cold?
You're frozen.

866
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:13,544
Now wait. Wait a second. Come on.
We'll get you something to eat.

867
01:18:13,646 --> 01:18:16,046
That'll warm you up.

868
01:18:16,148 --> 01:18:19,141
Zoar, get me something good and hot,
because I have a son today!

869
01:18:19,252 --> 01:18:21,982
Oh, sit. Sit. Sit down.
Please sit down. It really worked.

870
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,149
Maybe we should
wash your trousers too.

871
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,728
Then what am I going to wear?

872
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,561
- Hmm?
- And where are you going to
this time of night, huh?

873
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,794
No. Go away. Go away.

874
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:38,200
- Go away. I'm busy.
- What, are you ticklish?

875
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:13,104
Oh.

876
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:17,507
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for your neighbor.

877
01:19:19,147 --> 01:19:21,308
You're not alone.

878
01:19:24,952 --> 01:19:27,250
Thank you.

879
01:19:32,093 --> 01:19:34,527
You have to be careful, Svetlana.

880
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:37,931
A vampire?

881
01:19:40,468 --> 01:19:42,368
Yes, I'm a vampire!

882
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,131
That's me!

883
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:49,405
Excuse him. Please.
Really. No laws are being broken.

884
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:52,001
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- Look.

885
01:19:52,113 --> 01:19:54,206
- I.. I'm not.
- We have the registration.

886
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:56,215
- I'm not accusing you.
- Here is a permit, see?

887
01:19:56,317 --> 01:19:58,182
And everything in
the fridge is good.

888
01:19:58,286 --> 01:19:59,719
- There's some cheese, milk.
- I'm sorry.

889
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,515
- Potatoes.
- Papa, go inside.

890
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:03,852
- Don't do this to yourself!
- Kostya! Kostya!

891
01:20:14,969 --> 01:20:17,494
- Hello?
- Hello. Anton?

892
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:21,568
- Who is it?
- It's me, Svetlana.

893
01:20:21,677 --> 01:20:25,511
Svetlana. You know he has a family.

894
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:28,448
A son.

895
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:30,677
Please don't call him anymore.

896
01:20:57,045 --> 01:21:00,481
Riceplov.
You eat it with your hands.

897
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:09,190
You like it?

898
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,885
Uh, Papa, will you
come and eat with us?

899
01:21:11,994 --> 01:21:16,328
- And who would that be?
- With me.. and Mom.

900
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:18,730
Yegor, I can't come with you.

901
01:21:18,835 --> 01:21:22,236
I have another.. Life.

902
01:21:24,007 --> 01:21:25,941
Yegor, understand..

903
01:21:27,844 --> 01:21:30,438
You'll come anyway!

904
01:21:55,571 --> 01:21:58,005
Zoar, why didn't it work for me?

905
01:21:58,107 --> 01:22:00,041
I put it where you told me to.

906
01:22:00,143 --> 01:22:03,772
This is the place
where my fate happens.

907
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,111
Plov - that's 150 rubles.

908
01:22:07,216 --> 01:22:10,549
And your fate is somewhere else.

909
01:22:10,653 --> 01:22:14,282
You can't change
the fate of another.

910
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:18,019
Every living person
must answer for his own.

911
01:22:18,128 --> 01:22:21,097
Do you remember where it was..

912
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:23,792
you broke your own destiny?

913
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:28,866
You waited.. till now to say this?

914
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:31,497
You didn't ask.

915
01:22:33,377 --> 01:22:35,277
And so it's my fault?

916
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:37,813
I am sorry, Anton.

917
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:40,817
What's the matter?

918
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:49,421
He took the Chalk.

919
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:07,040
- Hello.
- Sorry. Uh, I know it's late..

920
01:23:07,144 --> 01:23:10,545
- but could I speak with Yegor?
- Are you crazy?

921
01:23:13,183 --> 01:23:17,119
It's 1:00 in the morning.
Yegor's asleep.

922
01:23:44,682 --> 01:23:46,650
Listen. Can you take me
to the Expo Center?

923
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:00,228
Zavulon! We found him!

924
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:03,129
Go on! Finish him off!

925
01:24:03,234 --> 01:24:05,896
You idiots! I need him alive.

926
01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:10,270
Just run him around
for a while, okay?

927
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:46,104
- Anton.
- Boris, I'll look over this way.

928
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:48,112
Is anyone here? Anton.

929
01:24:50,216 --> 01:24:51,808
Zoar?

930
01:24:51,917 --> 01:24:53,441
There isn't anyone here.

931
01:24:55,454 --> 01:24:57,979
- What's that?
- I think it's his phone.

932
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,452
But why is it broken?

933
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:03,119
The Dark Ones want the Chalk too.

934
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:04,560
The big game begins.

935
01:25:47,641 --> 01:25:50,940
What do you think you're doing?

936
01:25:51,044 --> 01:25:53,012
What station is this?

937
01:25:59,486 --> 01:26:01,249
I'm gone.

938
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:16,358
Okay. What's going on?
Stay there!

939
01:26:16,469 --> 01:26:17,800
I mean it!

940
01:26:17,904 --> 01:26:19,202
Stay there!

941
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,638
Freeze!

942
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:23,107
Don't move!
Don't move!

943
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:25,110
Stop!

944
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:40,792
Who was it you spoke to?

945
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,557
I don't know. They told me
not to call there again.

946
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:44,653
Yegor.

947
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,001
- Why was he here?
- The Chalk's with him.

948
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:03,415
- What is it?
- What?

949
01:27:03,517 --> 01:27:05,985
Just a sec.

950
01:27:07,788 --> 01:27:09,983
- Remember Yegor's address?
- Got it.

951
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,991
- Then let's go.
- Right.

952
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,118
- Please get her.
- Sveta.

953
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:20,828
Sveta?

954
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:28,474
Flushed out.

955
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,805
Wanted to get out of the cold, huh?

956
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:03,474
Take me anywhere.

957
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,047
Sure thing.

958
01:28:50,293 --> 01:28:54,229
Uncle Zavulon,
why are we the Dark Ones?

959
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,788
Imperfections are hidden
in darkness, Yegor.

960
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:01,668
And people..

961
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:04,103
always have their imperfections.

962
01:29:06,743 --> 01:29:11,578
It allows us the luxury
of doing what we want.

963
01:29:13,282 --> 01:29:15,876
Of being exactly who we truly are.

964
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:19,912
Gives us the gift of love.

965
01:29:26,563 --> 01:29:29,157
Look what I found, Uncle Zavulon.

966
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:30,893
The Chalk of Fate.

967
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:38,031
- Hello.
- Zavulon.

968
01:29:38,142 --> 01:29:40,110
- What now?
- Have you got the Chalk?

969
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:41,837
No.

970
01:29:43,747 --> 01:29:47,342
- You do not have the right to touch it.
- I know that.

971
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:50,079
So, what's up with your shindig?

972
01:29:50,187 --> 01:29:53,918
- You are inviting me?
- No, but I'll take some pictures.

973
01:29:56,193 --> 01:29:58,991
Slow down, Semyon.

974
01:29:59,096 --> 01:30:02,827
I want you to get everyone
over to the Hotel Cosmos.

975
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:05,197
- Where are you going?
- Ah, I need to change.

976
01:30:09,807 --> 01:30:11,707
Alicia.

977
01:30:11,809 --> 01:30:15,404
You could correct your mistakes with it.

978
01:30:15,512 --> 01:30:18,640
- No. Why don't you keep it?
- What about you?

979
01:30:18,749 --> 01:30:20,518
I don't need it.

980
01:30:20,531 --> 01:30:22,311
I n your whole life,
no errors were made?

981
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:25,446
- I just don't regret them.
- Then what should I do with it?

982
01:30:25,557 --> 01:30:27,491
You could give it to Alicia.

983
01:30:31,563 --> 01:30:33,531
What does she regret?

984
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:37,234
What do women normally regret?

985
01:30:39,604 --> 01:30:41,936
Loving wrong.

986
01:30:52,851 --> 01:30:54,819
Sure you're making
the right decision?

987
01:30:54,919 --> 01:30:57,137
I just can't live like
this, scared to death

988
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:59,379
of shadows, fearing
every phone call.

989
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:01,458
Not me.

990
01:31:02,794 --> 01:31:05,024
I'm not afraid of anybody.

991
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:16,502
Even if you're like us,
you're still a human being.

992
01:31:20,145 --> 01:31:21,874
Human, Papa?

993
01:31:24,984 --> 01:31:26,952
Can you turn me back into a human?

994
01:31:30,723 --> 01:31:32,782
No. No.

995
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:35,417
But listen.

996
01:31:39,298 --> 01:31:42,199
Son. Son!

997
01:31:42,301 --> 01:31:45,293
Listen here.
Wait a minute.

998
01:32:19,405 --> 01:32:22,102
- Alicia, are you coming?
- Yes.

999
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,301
- We're starting.
- On my way.

1000
01:32:24,411 --> 01:32:26,470
And don't fiddle with the ring.
It hurts.

1001
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:38,691
Kostya.

1002
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:46,591
Why did you come here?

1003
01:32:46,592 --> 01:32:47,559
Why did you come here?

1004
01:32:48,794 --> 01:32:51,388
Not welcome?

1005
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:55,023
You are.
Close the door.

1006
01:33:03,175 --> 01:33:05,973
- Hello.
- Hello.

1007
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,673
I'm going to take you from here.

1008
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:22,050
Zavulon.

1009
01:33:23,096 --> 01:33:24,893
Coming.

1010
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:27,967
- I said..
- Good evening. I..

1011
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:29,830
Come back later.

1012
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,338
- I'll go.
- Kostya, wait.

1013
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,577
No.

1014
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:36,738
There's something I
have to explain to you.

1015
01:33:36,843 --> 01:33:38,162
No need.

1016
01:33:38,175 --> 01:33:39,505
I can't do this. He
feels everything I feel.

1017
01:33:39,612 --> 01:33:41,580
Do you understand?

1018
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:46,751
- I can't take it off.
- I'll help you.

1019
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:51,021
Don't. He'll kill you.

1020
01:33:51,124 --> 01:33:53,558
- I'm not afraid.
- I am.

1021
01:33:55,028 --> 01:33:59,055
I believe I told you to come back later!

1022
01:33:59,165 --> 01:34:01,599
- Listen. I said..
- Come on. Time to go.

1023
01:34:02,735 --> 01:34:05,499
- And who's this?
- Neighbor of Gorodetsky.

1024
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:08,904
- Knows him in any disguise.
- Hmm.

1025
01:34:09,008 --> 01:34:13,274
- So, where's your dad?
- Uh..

1026
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,461
The person you're calling
is not in range now.

1027
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,770
Does that hurt?

1028
01:35:24,252 --> 01:35:26,812
Come on.

1029
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:30,015
Come on. Stay. Stay.

1030
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,923
Come on.

1031
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:34,961
Okay. Okay.

1032
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,332
You have no right to do this.
This is against the law.

1033
01:35:37,345 --> 01:35:39,625
Stop it! You can't do this!

1034
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,702
There we go.

1035
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:47,237
Okay. Let's see now.
What have we got?

1036
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:50,641
- I'm just following orders.
- Oh, yes. I understand. Absolutely.

1037
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,475
I do just what I'm told.
Good bird. That's Gosha.

1038
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:58,177
- Gosha's going to the hotel
for some kid's birthday.
- That's it.

1039
01:35:58,286 --> 01:36:02,848
What idea do you have?
What idea do you have?

1040
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:05,585
No. You won't get away with it.

1041
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:08,958
Everybody knows exactly
what your ugly face looks like.

1042
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:11,031
But.. But..

1043
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:19,231
Not my style, of course.

1044
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:29,739
- Sorry. Running a little late.
Where's the party going on?
- Top floor.

1045
01:37:32,515 --> 01:37:35,313
- Parrot's on his way to you.
- Right.

1046
01:37:38,355 --> 01:37:41,119
- How's the food?
- Not bad.

1047
01:37:41,224 --> 01:37:43,124
Hurry or you'll miss out.

1048
01:37:43,226 --> 01:37:46,320
Uh, Victor, give me your coat.

1049
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:54,997
Hey, Victor.

1050
01:37:55,105 --> 01:37:58,836
How's it going?

1051
01:38:01,211 --> 01:38:04,510
Don't "Victor" me.

1052
01:38:05,615 --> 01:38:07,139
Oh.

1053
01:38:17,027 --> 01:38:19,188
That's not you.

1054
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:30,166
Where is he then?

1055
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:33,942
You know?

1056
01:38:47,925 --> 01:38:49,893
Yegor!

1057
01:38:50,628 --> 01:38:52,562
Yegor!

1058
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:05,409
Yegor!

1059
01:39:07,011 --> 01:39:09,411
Yegor!

1060
01:39:19,190 --> 01:39:21,420
Yegor!

1061
01:39:26,365 --> 01:39:29,300
Who's there?

1062
01:39:30,635 --> 01:39:33,399
Yegor.

1063
01:39:56,895 --> 01:39:59,420
Quiet. Quiet.
Let his dad say a few words.

1064
01:40:00,866 --> 01:40:04,302
Did you forget
it was his birthday? Shame.

1065
01:40:04,403 --> 01:40:07,031
Let's punish the man.

1066
01:40:21,686 --> 01:40:24,281
Come on, Anton.
Say something.

1067
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,290
He waited for you.

1068
01:40:26,392 --> 01:40:28,952
You're a Light One.
You guys are good at this stuff.

1069
01:40:29,062 --> 01:40:31,030
Come on.

1070
01:40:50,249 --> 01:40:52,149
I, uh..

1071
01:40:52,251 --> 01:40:54,481
want to wish you..

1072
01:40:54,587 --> 01:40:56,487
happiness and good health.

1073
01:41:03,229 --> 01:41:06,255
Is that it?

1074
01:41:06,365 --> 01:41:08,856
And that everything..

1075
01:41:08,968 --> 01:41:12,768
in your life is.. good.

1076
01:41:22,616 --> 01:41:25,107
I'll tell you the rest later.

1077
01:41:25,219 --> 01:41:27,187
- Let's leave here.
- No.

1078
01:41:27,287 --> 01:41:29,380
Say it now.
Later will be too late.

1079
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:32,288
Yeah. Sure.

1080
01:41:42,169 --> 01:41:45,730
For you, I wish only one thing:
that you learn how to forgive..

1081
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:49,070
and that no one
you know ever tells you..

1082
01:41:49,176 --> 01:41:51,736
Bravo!

1083
01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:14,756
You need to forgive him.
Your dad's tired.

1084
01:42:43,898 --> 01:42:45,798
He's been poisoned.

1085
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,570
- I'm trying to exit. Do you mind?
- Intercept that vehicle immediately!

1086
01:42:55,677 --> 01:42:57,110
Got it.

1087
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:59,646
You're cutting me off!

1088
01:43:08,489 --> 01:43:11,583
So that's how the salad
came together, sonny.

1089
01:43:11,693 --> 01:43:15,060
- Now try a bite.
- What is it?

1090
01:43:15,163 --> 01:43:18,997
Which is more essential?
The ingredients or the effect?

1091
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:23,401
Grandma, you ruined my
life, so just back away.

1092
01:43:23,505 --> 01:43:25,939
- You did the same to me.
- Yeah?

1093
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:29,772
Yeah. Thanks to you,
I got 12 years in the zoo as a toad.

1094
01:43:32,014 --> 01:43:34,414
Fancy that.

1095
01:43:34,516 --> 01:43:36,746
So what are we supposed
to be doing for you now?

1096
01:43:36,852 --> 01:43:38,911
Forgotten why you came here?

1097
01:43:39,021 --> 01:43:40,921
Maybe.. Chalk?

1098
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,826
Chalk, you say?

1099
01:43:56,505 --> 01:43:59,941
But there's nothing to write on since
they tore down your apartment house.

1100
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:02,510
You're right.

1101
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:04,943
The wall's still there though.

1102
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,720
Come here, you.

1103
01:44:14,423 --> 01:44:17,881
How about a grape?
Want a grape, huh?

1104
01:44:17,993 --> 01:44:21,690
No? Yeah. Just get me the Chalk,
and I'll give it to you.

1105
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,891
- She won't take it.
- Well-trained, huh?

1106
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,333
- Very well-trained.
- Not eating.

1107
01:44:27,437 --> 01:44:30,270
- Yeah. Not eating.
- Well, I am.

1108
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:32,364
Well done.

1109
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,375
- Eating it all.
- Excellent.

1110
01:44:36,746 --> 01:44:39,681
Right now. Everything!

1111
01:45:20,724 --> 01:45:22,919
I think we're
really close to him now.

1112
01:45:33,204 --> 01:45:34,899
Oh. Oh.

1113
01:45:35,005 --> 01:45:37,371
He got a license?

1114
01:45:39,009 --> 01:45:40,442
Look out!

1115
01:45:40,544 --> 01:45:42,944
Are you a complete idiot?

1116
01:45:43,047 --> 01:45:44,742
Fine!

1117
01:45:46,684 --> 01:45:49,915
Stop it, Semyon. Pull yourself together.

1118
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:07,965
What are you doing?

1119
01:46:08,072 --> 01:46:10,836
Don't. Step on it!
We're late.

1120
01:46:37,803 --> 01:46:40,363
Shall I call the Inquisition?

1121
01:46:40,472 --> 01:46:44,875
No hurry.
We are missing a guest.

1122
01:46:55,787 --> 01:46:59,484
Zavulon, my friend!

1123
01:47:01,159 --> 01:47:03,650
Let's have a beer.

1124
01:47:03,762 --> 01:47:05,730
Come on now. No joking.

1125
01:47:05,831 --> 01:47:08,391
One beverage.

1126
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:13,562
Watch it now, Gorodetsky.
The Inquisition's taking you.

1127
01:47:13,672 --> 01:47:17,574
Me? I don't think so.
Not at all.

1128
01:47:19,077 --> 01:47:21,068
I didn't kill anyone.

1129
01:47:22,113 --> 01:47:23,911
And you know it.

1130
01:47:24,016 --> 01:47:26,041
Then who's the right one?

1131
01:47:26,152 --> 01:47:29,121
Like in a detective story..

1132
01:47:29,222 --> 01:47:31,747
it could be the man
who does the floors.

1133
01:47:42,735 --> 01:47:44,726
Or a butcher.

1134
01:47:46,606 --> 01:47:48,506
Valery Sergeevich!

1135
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,169
What brings you here tonight?

1136
01:47:52,278 --> 01:47:55,543
I've come to get my son.

1137
01:47:55,648 --> 01:47:59,049
He came here for his boy too.

1138
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,586
Kostya got a license.
First one.

1139
01:48:04,624 --> 01:48:06,717
Good for him.

1140
01:48:06,826 --> 01:48:08,726
You know, that's not him.

1141
01:48:08,828 --> 01:48:11,228
Okay. Then what?

1142
01:48:12,598 --> 01:48:14,566
He's harmless.

1143
01:48:14,667 --> 01:48:16,635
The son of his mother.

1144
01:48:16,736 --> 01:48:19,364
She was special, you know.

1145
01:48:19,472 --> 01:48:21,838
More like his dad, I'd say.

1146
01:48:21,941 --> 01:48:24,467
Dark Ones.

1147
01:48:24,578 --> 01:48:26,273
Pay attention!

1148
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:30,544
Would you like to know
who murdered Galina Rogova?

1149
01:48:41,495 --> 01:48:43,963
She was murdered..

1150
01:48:44,064 --> 01:48:47,295
and the one who did it..

1151
01:48:47,401 --> 01:48:51,599
Uh, that man is you.

1152
01:48:51,705 --> 01:48:54,071
Why me murder those folks?

1153
01:48:54,174 --> 01:48:56,233
Huh.

1154
01:48:56,343 --> 01:48:57,776
Those?

1155
01:48:58,879 --> 01:49:01,040
A very good thing to ask about.

1156
01:49:02,749 --> 01:49:04,944
Now, why were they killed?

1157
01:49:05,052 --> 01:49:06,986
Huh? Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1158
01:49:07,087 --> 01:49:09,248
You know who put him up to it?

1159
01:49:09,356 --> 01:49:11,415
That's the good part.

1160
01:49:16,897 --> 01:49:19,024
Now you die!

1161
01:49:19,132 --> 01:49:22,431
Papa, no. No, Papa.

1162
01:49:22,536 --> 01:49:25,301
With this very knife.

1163
01:49:25,406 --> 01:49:29,001
I wanted.. so much..

1164
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:31,408
for you to be human.

1165
01:49:43,257 --> 01:49:45,623
No circumstances..

1166
01:49:45,727 --> 01:49:50,323
can ever justify the crime
of breaking the Great Truce.

1167
01:49:50,431 --> 01:49:53,867
So, do you confess your guilt now?

1168
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:57,836
Yes. I do.

1169
01:49:57,939 --> 01:50:00,032
Last words?

1170
01:50:03,111 --> 01:50:05,079
What is, is.

1171
01:50:05,179 --> 01:50:09,206
The Inquisition declares the innocence
of Anton Gorodetsky.

1172
01:50:11,519 --> 01:50:14,579
You are free to go now.

1173
01:50:14,689 --> 01:50:18,785
Thanks, but I'm good here, you know.

1174
01:50:22,497 --> 01:50:25,490
- Papa.
- Kostya, I'll explain it all.

1175
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:30,101
Alicia, did you call them?

1176
01:50:30,205 --> 01:50:32,105
No.

1177
01:50:32,274 --> 01:50:35,334
Zavulon! Keep your word!

1178
01:50:35,444 --> 01:50:38,242
Hey, granddad.
Don't spoil the mood.

1179
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:41,908
- Just go away.
- They set him up. It's not right.

1180
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:45,009
Only one man set him up.

1181
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,464
Tango!

1182
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:16,575
- Oh. Quiet. Quiet.
- Kostya.

1183
01:51:16,685 --> 01:51:18,448
Just give me the Chalk.

1184
01:51:18,554 --> 01:51:21,648
Quiet. Quiet.

1185
01:51:24,259 --> 01:51:26,228
Leave me alone!

1186
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:28,424
Ooh!

1187
01:52:21,117 --> 01:52:22,778
One is lost.

1188
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:26,189
One is found.

1189
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:28,986
One goes.

1190
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:32,720
Another arrives.

1191
01:52:33,798 --> 01:52:37,290
She's here.
Now the guest list is full.

1192
01:52:38,769 --> 01:52:41,533
You've got to stop her,
Uncle Zavulon.

1193
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:44,233
There's no stopping her now.

1194
01:52:44,341 --> 01:52:46,036
And death would be..

1195
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:49,203
Melodrama, Yegor, is not my style.

1196
01:52:49,313 --> 01:52:51,213
I'll do it.

1197
01:52:51,315 --> 01:52:53,909
Hmm. She's stronger, so be prepared.

1198
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:56,816
Don't do it.

1199
01:53:10,668 --> 01:53:12,397
- Svetlana.
- Anton!

1200
01:53:12,503 --> 01:53:15,336
Go. Just go home. Okay?

1201
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:18,931
Look. I'll explain all of it.

1202
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:22,444
Everything. Later.
It'll be better if you go.

1203
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:25,414
You know? Hey,
don't be offended, huh?

1204
01:53:25,517 --> 01:53:28,008
Oh.

1205
01:53:28,119 --> 01:53:32,055
It's all just great here now.

1206
01:53:32,157 --> 01:53:34,250
Go home, please.

1207
01:53:34,359 --> 01:53:36,987
Uncle Zavulon, he doesn't love her.

1208
01:53:37,095 --> 01:53:39,723
- He's a Dark One now.
- No, Yegor.

1209
01:53:39,831 --> 01:53:41,856
Just casting shadows.

1210
01:53:41,967 --> 01:53:45,266
- Then what do we do?
- Hmm. Think, Yegor. What is there?

1211
01:53:50,075 --> 01:53:52,134
I stuck a needle in her.

1212
01:53:52,244 --> 01:53:54,769
In the Gloom the other day.

1213
01:53:56,348 --> 01:53:57,975
I could drink her now.

1214
01:54:36,589 --> 01:54:39,752
125. Three minutes to target.

1215
01:54:39,859 --> 01:54:42,521
- 320. Seven minutes.
- Thirty-four. Six minutes.

1216
01:54:42,628 --> 01:54:44,858
540. Two minutes.

1217
01:54:44,964 --> 01:54:46,864
518? 518?

1218
01:54:46,966 --> 01:54:49,730
518. One minute away from target.

1219
01:54:51,804 --> 01:54:55,103
On no account should anyone
start any heavy action without us.

1220
01:54:55,207 --> 01:54:58,768
Hold your position, all units.
Repeat. Hold your position.

1221
01:55:21,734 --> 01:55:24,862
They've got us surrounded.

1222
01:55:34,081 --> 01:55:35,981
There's no answer.

1223
01:55:43,490 --> 01:55:45,185
Sveta.

1224
01:55:45,292 --> 01:55:47,988
It's me. Look at me.
Don't close your eyes, Sveta.

1225
01:55:48,095 --> 01:55:49,585
I'm losing you.

1226
01:55:49,696 --> 01:55:52,256
- Do not close your eyes.
- Hello?

1227
01:55:52,366 --> 01:55:54,561
Easy. Just help me out a little.

1228
01:55:54,668 --> 01:55:57,000
- If you can give me a little help..
- Hey, stupid!

1229
01:55:57,104 --> 01:56:00,005
- Come on, man! Open the door!
- I want you to stay on the line.

1230
01:56:00,107 --> 01:56:01,574
Open the damn door!

1231
01:56:01,675 --> 01:56:03,267
It's been nice!

1232
01:56:05,112 --> 01:56:07,910
Don't stop breathing.

1233
01:56:08,015 --> 01:56:09,846
Up you get, Sveta.
You're doing well.

1234
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:12,544
- Get that ramp in place!
- In front?

1235
01:56:12,652 --> 01:56:14,847
Yeah!

1236
01:56:14,955 --> 01:56:17,253
Talk to me. Come on, Sveta. Talk to me.

1237
01:56:17,357 --> 01:56:20,724
Tell me what's happening.
Stay with me now.

1238
01:56:29,137 --> 01:56:31,867
They're crazy. Nuts.

1239
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:38,405
Well done, Sveta.

1240
01:56:38,513 --> 01:56:42,210
Great. Breathe. Breathe.
That's good. Now, let's get up.

1241
01:56:42,316 --> 01:56:45,149
You're a beauty.
Now come on, Sveta.

1242
01:56:45,253 --> 01:56:47,653
We're standing up.
Come on. Come on.

1243
01:56:47,755 --> 01:56:50,155
Up. Let's go. Let's go.

1244
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,145
Sveta.

1245
01:57:14,248 --> 01:57:17,411
- Yes? Hello?

1246
01:57:23,024 --> 01:57:24,992
Hello?

1247
01:57:25,093 --> 01:57:27,153
Olga?

1248
01:57:27,262 --> 01:57:31,164
- We're almost there. Wait.
- I found Anton.

1249
01:57:33,836 --> 01:57:36,430
Only he's drunk.
H-He doesn't want to go anywhere.

1250
01:57:36,538 --> 01:57:38,938
Go practice now.

1251
01:57:44,246 --> 01:57:46,441
He was drugged?

1252
01:57:46,548 --> 01:57:48,755
You have to get out of there.
It's a trap. And

1253
01:57:48,768 --> 01:57:50,985
you stay away from Yegor.
Do you hear me?

1254
01:57:51,086 --> 01:57:53,111
I understand.

1255
01:57:53,222 --> 01:57:55,918
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you.

1256
01:58:00,496 --> 01:58:02,487
What do you want?

1257
01:58:05,234 --> 01:58:09,034
- I need Anton Gorodetsky.
- I need him too.

1258
01:58:10,772 --> 01:58:13,502
- We need to talk.
- No.

1259
01:58:13,609 --> 01:58:15,577
You're a liar.

1260
01:58:15,677 --> 01:58:17,941
You really came to
take him away from me.

1261
01:58:18,046 --> 01:58:20,014
No.

1262
01:58:20,115 --> 01:58:22,310
He loves you too much.

1263
01:58:24,453 --> 01:58:26,354
And you.

1264
01:58:27,857 --> 01:58:29,324
Ladies and gentlemen..

1265
01:58:29,325 --> 01:58:31,156
Ladies and gentlemen..

1266
01:58:31,261 --> 01:58:35,891
it's finally time for the main event
of our celebration..

1267
01:58:35,999 --> 01:58:39,730
which we've been patiently
waiting for a thousand years.

1268
01:58:39,836 --> 01:58:43,203
Today, a Great Other
appeared before us!

1269
01:58:43,306 --> 01:58:45,274
I'm not going to fight with you.

1270
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:47,275
You don't have a choice.

1271
01:59:05,295 --> 01:59:07,229
You strapped in?

1272
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:13,692
We've chosen to start the battle.

1273
01:59:13,803 --> 01:59:16,897
And this time, we'll be victorious!

1274
01:59:21,444 --> 01:59:23,571
Damn, he's big.

1275
01:59:54,945 --> 01:59:57,743
Because if a single drop
of Dark blood..

1276
01:59:57,848 --> 02:00:03,013
is spilled anywhere,
I will tear the Truce apart!

1277
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:07,489
And it is time to create
a brand-new world where we're on top!

1278
02:00:18,235 --> 02:00:21,830
We made it.

1279
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:36,309
How long are we supposed to
keep hiding in corners?

1280
02:00:36,421 --> 02:00:39,788
Who's breaking a law here?
Is it us or them?

1281
02:00:39,891 --> 02:00:42,621
That's the point, men.

1282
02:00:42,727 --> 02:00:45,457
- We know the faces of every one of them.
- That's right!

1283
02:00:45,563 --> 02:00:48,327
Every single Dark, horrible one!

1284
02:00:48,433 --> 02:00:52,369
The people believe in our cause! If we
don't give them protection, who will?

1285
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:55,240
Because there is no longer
anyone left anywhere

1286
02:00:55,253 --> 02:00:58,033
who is able to change
the shape of fate!

1287
02:00:58,143 --> 02:01:01,078
Because that fate is now
here in our hands!

1288
02:01:01,179 --> 02:01:03,238
- And that's the point!
- Listen!

1289
02:01:03,348 --> 02:01:06,317
Listen to me!
They want to start a war!

1290
02:01:06,484 --> 02:01:08,145
And over the world..

1291
02:01:08,253 --> 02:01:09,140
there will be darkness,
like eternal night!

1292
02:01:09,153 --> 02:01:10,050
Hey.

1293
02:01:10,155 --> 02:01:11,554
And nothing can..

1294
02:01:11,656 --> 02:01:13,851
The two of them
in there, fighting..

1295
02:01:13,958 --> 02:01:16,518
- Now I'll leave.
- Not happening.

1296
02:01:30,176 --> 02:01:32,076
What is this?

1297
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:57,396
Blood! Blood!

1298
02:01:57,503 --> 02:02:00,097
Blood!

1299
02:02:00,206 --> 02:02:04,006
- So.
- So what?

1300
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:06,977
- It's started.
- Oh, no.

1301
02:02:07,079 --> 02:02:09,741
Blood! Blood!

1302
02:02:29,536 --> 02:02:31,834
- It's begun.
- Gesser.

1303
02:02:31,938 --> 02:02:34,236
Let's go!

1304
02:02:44,851 --> 02:02:47,479
- Everybody out. Evacuate!
- Out!

1305
02:02:47,587 --> 02:02:51,353
- We have to evacuate the top floor now!
- Everyone out! Fire!

1306
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:55,758
- Everyone! Evacuate!
- Fire. What the hell?

1307
02:02:57,063 --> 02:02:58,530
Fire! Fire!
Everyone leave now!

1308
02:02:58,632 --> 02:02:59,963
- Come on!
- Fire.

1309
02:03:00,066 --> 02:03:02,034
- Get out. Hurry up.
- What's going on out here?

1310
02:03:02,135 --> 02:03:04,035
Someone tell me.
What's going on?

1311
02:03:04,137 --> 02:03:06,037
Everybody out!

1312
02:03:12,779 --> 02:03:15,942
Anton.
Anton, where are you?

1313
02:03:17,918 --> 02:03:19,852
Anton.

1314
02:05:09,197 --> 02:05:13,190
Panic in the streets as the people of
Moscow try to find some kind of safety..

1315
02:05:13,302 --> 02:05:16,931
for themselves and their families
in the midst of this devastation.

1316
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,320
They're on the way back.

1317
02:05:32,422 --> 02:05:35,983
There's a fire on this floor.
Everyone stay ca..

1318
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,419
- What is happening?
- There's a fire. Run!

1319
02:05:39,529 --> 02:05:42,464
Right, right, right!
I'm running! I'm running! I'm running!

1320
02:06:00,249 --> 02:06:01,944
The destruction
is tremend..

1321
02:06:26,743 --> 02:06:28,871
Getting good shots?

1322
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:32,813
- A little dark.
- Hmm. The end of the world.

1323
02:06:35,152 --> 02:06:37,143
There's always hope.

1324
02:06:38,222 --> 02:06:40,190
Stepan.

1325
02:06:41,291 --> 02:06:44,590
Find Alicia.
Get the Chalk from her.

1326
02:07:19,663 --> 02:07:23,064
- Alicia! Where is she? Do you know?
- Alicia? That way, I think.

1327
02:07:27,337 --> 02:07:28,532
Alicia.

1328
02:07:29,874 --> 02:07:31,842
Alicia, stop.

1329
02:07:33,645 --> 02:07:36,239
I'm too old to run around after you.
What are you doing?

1330
02:07:36,347 --> 02:07:39,077
Hold it. Stop.

1331
02:07:39,184 --> 02:07:42,347
Run. Anton, run!

1332
02:07:43,388 --> 02:07:45,549
Now you.

1333
02:07:45,657 --> 02:07:47,249
Stay there.

1334
02:07:58,203 --> 02:07:59,568
You die!

1335
02:08:26,631 --> 02:08:29,032
Come back here, you.

1336
02:08:29,135 --> 02:08:31,968
You little freak.

1337
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,188
Stop.

1338
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:52,484
Stop, you little bastard!

1339
02:08:52,591 --> 02:08:54,684
Shh. Shh. Shh.

1340
02:08:54,794 --> 02:08:58,025
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1341
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,098
Hey!

1342
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:02,167
Are you going to show me
where Alicia is?

1343
02:09:02,268 --> 02:09:03,963
Okay?

1344
02:09:05,671 --> 02:09:08,401
Okay.

1345
02:09:08,507 --> 02:09:10,372
Take me to her.

1346
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:12,034
Kostya.

1347
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:19,982
I'm sorry.

1348
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:22,849
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

1349
02:09:23,856 --> 02:09:25,084
Kostya.

1350
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,319
Kostya.

1351
02:09:31,698 --> 02:09:35,327
Give it to me. Give me the Chalk.

1352
02:09:35,435 --> 02:09:37,198
No.

1353
02:09:37,199 --> 02:09:39,704
- Bastard! Go away!
- You can't do it, Alicia.

1354
02:09:39,806 --> 02:09:43,242
- Believe me. There is no way
you can bring him back.
- I can change it!

1355
02:09:43,343 --> 02:09:45,709
You can't fix it,
no matter how you try.

1356
02:09:45,812 --> 02:09:49,339
- Why not?
- Because it's not your fault.
Now hand the Chalk over to me!

1357
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:52,009
- Then whose fault is it?
- What difference does it make now?

1358
02:09:52,118 --> 02:09:55,417
I'll tell you!
None at all!

1359
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:14,973
I am to blame.

1360
02:10:54,749 --> 02:10:56,944
Anton. Anton.

1361
02:10:57,051 --> 02:10:59,747
- Is that you? Are you there?
- Okay. Okay.

1362
02:10:59,854 --> 02:11:03,017
- Moment here. Moment.
- Anton, please help.

1363
02:11:03,124 --> 02:11:05,115
- I got you, Sveta.
- I can't see.

1364
02:11:05,226 --> 02:11:07,490
Shh, shh. It's.. it's okay.

1365
02:11:07,595 --> 02:11:09,529
Let go! Let him go!

1366
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:12,326
- I'm not giving him to you! You hear?
- Don't let go of me!

1367
02:11:16,304 --> 02:11:18,795
Anton, don't let go!

1368
02:11:18,906 --> 02:11:20,806
Anton, hold on to me!

1369
02:11:20,908 --> 02:11:22,603
Hold on!

1370
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:25,144
Anton! Don't leave me!

1371
02:11:59,348 --> 02:12:01,873
- Anton! Don't leave me!
- Yegor!

1372
02:12:01,984 --> 02:12:04,248
- You let go of him!
- Yegor!

1373
02:12:10,525 --> 02:12:12,049
No!

1374
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,559
No!

1375
02:12:13,662 --> 02:12:15,562
Let go, Yegor!

1376
02:12:31,447 --> 02:12:33,847
What a mess you've made, Anton.

1377
02:12:38,054 --> 02:12:40,545
I, uh.. I found..

1378
02:12:40,656 --> 02:12:42,590
the Chalk, Boris Ivanovich.

1379
02:12:44,227 --> 02:12:46,821
- That building's gone.
- Yeah.

1380
02:12:48,865 --> 02:12:51,095
There's still a wall there.

1381
02:12:53,036 --> 02:12:55,732
Farewell, Anton.

1382
02:12:55,838 --> 02:12:58,398
You need to run.

1383
02:12:58,508 --> 02:13:01,409
The camera's only good
for a short exposure.

1384
02:13:01,511 --> 02:13:04,446
I'm grateful, Boris Ivanovich.

1385
02:14:15,652 --> 02:14:19,349
All right.
So, do you agree?

1386
02:14:21,258 --> 02:14:22,623
Well..

1387
02:14:27,498 --> 02:14:29,933
No.

1388
02:14:30,034 --> 02:14:33,299
I think I can handle this.
On my own.

1389
02:14:37,242 --> 02:14:40,336
No case, no trial.

1390
02:14:42,046 --> 02:14:44,014
I'm sorry.

1391
02:14:50,421 --> 02:14:52,651
Got a smoke?

1392
02:14:57,629 --> 02:14:59,529
You sure?

1393
02:14:59,631 --> 02:15:01,599
I don't smoke.

1394
02:15:04,669 --> 02:15:07,035
- Nothing?
- You sure?

1395
02:15:09,641 --> 02:15:11,609
I'm sure.

1396
02:15:11,709 --> 02:15:14,041
He's human again.

1397
02:15:45,477 --> 02:15:47,377
He won't know her.

1398
02:15:47,479 --> 02:15:49,379
Yes, he will.

1399
02:15:55,187 --> 02:15:59,214
- No pushing them now.
- And no blocking, eh?

1400
02:15:59,325 --> 02:16:01,657
Guess who's wrong.

1401
02:16:13,038 --> 02:16:15,097
Hey. Wait.

1402
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:21,470
Who's your daddy?

1403
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:23,548
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1404
02:16:23,649 --> 02:16:26,743
Have we possibly met?
Somewhere else?

1405
02:16:28,087 --> 02:16:30,022
- Maybe we did.
- Yeah?

1406
02:17:22,275 --> 02:17:23,902
Oh!

1407
02:17:35,756 --> 02:17:38,156
They're all over.

1408
02:17:41,762 --> 02:17:45,391
Trendy too. Incredible.

1409
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:54,874
Good job.

1410
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,100
Hey!

1411
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:06,600
