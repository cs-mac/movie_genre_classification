1
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,736
- Congratulations, Mr. Novak.
- Would you autograph my program?

2
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,565
- Surely.
- Are there any recordings of your playing?

3
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,106
I made in Europe years ago but I'm
afraid they weren't sold over here.

4
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,710
- Have you ever been in America before?
- No, never.

5
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,608
- When did you arrive?
- Four weeks ago.

6
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,715
- only four weeks?
- Were you in Europe?

7
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:27,907
- Yes.
- May I ask...

8
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,949
...what were your impressions of the war?

9
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,518
Well, it's over, isn't it?

10
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,417
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, please.

11
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,784
I'm Terry Spencer, music editor of our Bugle.

12
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,292
I've been studying four years and
I'd like to ask you a question.

13
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,930
Were the cadenzas in the
Haydn "Concerto" your own?

14
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,497
- Partly, yes.
- oh.

15
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,134
very effective. And most interesting.

16
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,394
You're most kind.

17
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,971
Mr. Novak, which of the living
composers do you think I ought to admire?

18
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,700
- Yes.
- Well, there is no greatest...

19
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,275
...among the really great.

20
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,174
- Whom do you like best?
- Hollenius?

21
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,941
- Shostakovich?
- Well, let me see.

22
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,607
Stravinsky, when I think of the present.

23
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,276
Richard Strauss, when I think of the past.

24
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:06,752
And of course, Hollenius...

25
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:09,915
...who combines the rhythm of
today with the melody of yesterday.

26
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,926
Thank you, sir. The Bugle will
be very impressed with your opinion.

27
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,458
- We'll miss the symphony.
- I'm glad to have seen you.

28
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,361
- Goodbye, Mr. Novak.
- Thank you, sir.

29
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,126
From now on, you're my cellist.

30
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:26,464
- Quiet, please.
- Mr. Novak, I hope you play again.

31
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,166
I know. It's so good.

32
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,574
Shh. Quiet, please.

33
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,530
I thought you were dead.

34
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,139
I thought they'd killed you.

35
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,968
I saw you being killed, lying there.

36
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,701
Darling.

37
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,805
Karel...

38
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,751
...can it be true you're here?

39
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,883
We're together.

40
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,537
Make myself...

41
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,246
...look decent.

42
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,914
You're the same, Schatzi.

43
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,056
Schatzi.

44
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,061
It's been so long since I've heard that.

45
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,438
What?

46
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,564
Something I was afraid to see.

47
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,443
Ah.

48
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,646
No rings.

49
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:21,346
You still play, still compose?

50
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,719
Don't let's talk here. Where do you live?

51
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,688
I've a room on West 94th Street but it's...

52
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,957
Come to my place.

53
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,055
Extra!

54
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,023
Extra! Extra!

55
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,856
Extra!

56
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,223
Extra!

57
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,199
Extra! Extra!

58
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,336
People don't do this in New York.

59
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:15,971
What don't they do?

60
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:17,369
This.

61
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,515
But we do.

62
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,752
Did you get my letters I
wrote and wrote and wrote?

63
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,755
Just two in 1940.

64
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,959
Then none.

65
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,588
Well, here we are.

66
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,636
- Do people live here?
- on top. Artists. People like us.

67
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:52,178
This light is never on.

68
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,422
Has it been very hard for you?

69
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:04,719
It was at first.

70
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,489
Music students just back from Europe
were hardly in overwhelming demand.

71
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,559
I was afraid of that when you left.

72
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,065
I had jobs. You know,
things that get you by.

73
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,602
I didn't mind except the
being away from my music.

74
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,864
But you got back to it.

75
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,734
- Yes.
- And you're succeeding?

76
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,141
Musically I am but financially...

77
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,679
- Not so good?
- Mm.

78
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:32,117
I'd do better cooking, if I
could cook as well as I play.

79
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,221
But, darling...

80
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,156
...come in.

81
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,355
I can't carry you over.

82
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,969
Give me your hat.

83
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,606
No, no, hang it up yourself.

84
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,674
You're home now.

85
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,744
This is where we put our things.

86
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,043
Now, which side?

87
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,582
This side or that side?

88
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,310
This side.

89
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,522
And not one inch over.

90
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:28,835
I want you to say how you like everything.

91
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,045
Tomorrow I'll get you a tremendous,
great cup for your coffee.

92
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,705
Now, let's see.

93
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,045
Which chair for your special chair?

94
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,814
This one, it's the biggest. Sit down.

95
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,428
Let me get you some slippers.

96
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,963
You look tired, dearest.
You've had a long day.

97
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:56,834
Darling, a long, long day.

98
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,634
And I could have missed seeing it so easily.

99
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,505
- So easily.
- Seeing what?

100
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:03,736
The advertisement.

101
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,905
I was eating tonight and they
gave me a copy of the Town Crier.

102
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,313
There was a column of
those college programs...

103
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,615
...and I was glancing down it, not reading,
you know, and I turned the page over.

104
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:18,192
I sat there, I realized something shattering
had happened, I couldn't think what it was.

105
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,693
I kept seeing the letters
of your name in print.

106
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:24,560
I realized it might have been on the
page I turned over, it couldn't have been.

107
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,793
It must have been some other name like it...

108
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,336
...and I sat there afraid to turn
the page back, just looking at it...

109
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,837
...well, and then I...

110
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:35,204
Good heavens, I never paid my check.

111
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,869
I walked right out of that
place and never paid for it.

112
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:46,477
If only one know in advance
that a miracle was going to happen.

113
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,317
I tried everything to find
you as soon as I landed.

114
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,460
I looked in the phone book, the directory...

115
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,187
But, darling, I took a professional name.

116
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:57,127
- I'm Christine Radcliffe now.
- Radcliffe?

117
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,493
Mm-hm.

118
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,467
You know, sometimes it was
nice to not feel like myself.

119
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,830
We might never have found each other.

120
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:10,175
And all the time you've been here,
playing in those little colleges.

121
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:13,509
Well, and lucky to get the chance.
After all, I'm not known here.

122
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,912
But what does it matter? To
play, that's the great thing.

123
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,849
Sooner or later the
right people will hear me.

124
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,057
Even if I don't earn much at
first, we can be happy, you and I.

125
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,059
Darling, there is something I must tell you.

126
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,829
- Yes?
- And I hope you won't misunderstand.

127
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,569
Music's different in America, Karel.

128
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,673
They care about it here deeply.

129
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,139
But like everything else it
must be done in a big way.

130
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,940
over there you can play in some hole
or corner and people will find you.

131
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,444
But here, if you start in some
school or suburban concert hall...

132
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,883
...oh, it's much too difficult.

133
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,454
It takes too long.

134
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,318
I know.

135
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,522
And you have had such a bad time.

136
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:02,926
But no more. After all, I know people.

137
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:07,398
I shall make them hear you and when they
do, you shall be where you should be.

138
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,800
You'll have everything.

139
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:15,237
Karel, it's so painful to be so happy.

140
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,449
Tell me, what do you want
when we are very rich?

141
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,280
I don't know.

142
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,619
A place in the mountains, perhaps.

143
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,783
You want a mountain. How big?

144
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,395
You know, you said I always
made them out of molehills.

145
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,299
To go out on skis for days and days.

146
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,993
With nothing to shut you in.

147
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,230
If I could do that.

148
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,300
What else?

149
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,739
That and you.

150
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,277
I go without saying.

151
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,108
Except I like to say it.

152
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,943
This way.

153
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,509
I'm yours, aren't I?

154
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,881
If it isn't too good to be true.

155
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,613
oh.

156
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,319
of course, if you... If
you need to be convinced...

157
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:09,623
...if you want everything
signed and sealed, we could...

158
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,198
Don't you think we could be married?

159
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,666
At once.

160
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,965
The first day we can.

161
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,303
Is there any objection?

162
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:27,609
Well, don't you think we really ought
to get to know each other all over again?

163
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,842
How do you do, Mr. Novak?

164
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,714
Darling, how stupid of me.

165
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,549
You must be famished. I should
have thought of it sooner.

166
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,987
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.

167
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,194
The bread's none too fresh, shall I toast it?

168
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,735
I had some smoked turkey.

169
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,373
Well, I guess the cleaning
woman had it for her lunch.

170
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,599
Here's some pâté.

171
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,007
Chock-full of vitamins. Just what you need.

172
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,711
Schatzi.

173
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,411
Yes?

174
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,746
This place? Is it...?

175
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,924
Is it lent to you?

176
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:14,354
Lent? oh, no, it's mine.

177
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,465
I mean, it's ours now, darling.

178
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,899
But...

179
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,235
...it must cost a great deal.

180
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,679
Not so much.

181
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:38,218
I got it on a long lease
when things were still cheap.

182
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,648
Schatzi.

183
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,982
Come here.

184
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,329
Yes, Karel.

185
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,967
This isn't a place of an artist...

186
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,040
...of a poor struggling musician
who could earn more as a maid.

187
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:06,307
Here, a Tang Horse, fit for a museum
and paintings and furs and your dress...

188
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,949
...and this.

189
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,077
What sort of a place is it? Answer me.

190
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:14,780
- What sort of a place is it? Answer me!
- Don't. Don't.

191
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,469
Forgive me.

192
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,435
I'm not myself.

193
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,278
But tonight...

194
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,280
...the concert was a strain.

195
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,286
The shock of seeing you...

196
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,555
...such hope, such...

197
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,920
You see...

198
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,832
...there, in that place where I've been...

199
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,698
...there was no refuge anywhere but in sleep.

200
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,839
Oh, Karel.

201
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,808
Do you know what kept me alive?

202
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,046
The hope of finding you.

203
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,440
And finding...

204
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,482
...it wasn't true.

205
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,918
Karel. Karel, don't talk like that.

206
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,921
You're ill.

207
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,194
I knew you had no money.

208
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:29,353
I knew what happened after the last war.

209
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:33,365
Yes, I saw it when I was a boy.
I saw what happened to the girls.

210
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,696
Decent girls like you.

211
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,473
I should never have come here.

212
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,642
Karel. Karel, are you mad?

213
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,641
There's nothing.

214
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:49,511
I didn't want to have to
tell you but I took pupils.

215
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,752
Rich and untalented pupils, I'm afraid...

216
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:57,324
...but I gave in and I've been teaching.

217
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,289
Which we swore we would never do, remember?

218
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,020
- Pupils?
- Yes.

219
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:05,963
And over here, rich pupils give
presents you just can't imagine.

220
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,030
Schatzi.

221
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,795
Darling.

222
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,298
Aren't you ashamed?

223
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:16,009
I've always been so
frightened of your jealousies.

224
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,669
And you promised me you never would be.

225
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,371
Here.

226
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,892
Things seem too good to be true one moment.

227
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,993
The next minute they seem too black.

228
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,425
Karel, look at me.

229
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:44,068
There's nothing in the whole
world except us, is there?

230
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,200
Nothing.

231
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,772
Nothing.

232
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,606
Nothing.

233
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,730
Hello?

234
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,970
Thank you.

235
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,736
Hello, Alex.

236
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,073
You're calling very early.

237
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,876
What time is it in California?

238
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,715
Heh. Alex, you shouldn't have nightmares.

239
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,518
Wrong? of course not.

240
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,253
But that isn't true.

241
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,058
There is something, not wrong but...

242
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,295
Well, I had intended to
write to you about it.

243
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,130
I hardly know how to tell you.

244
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,171
Something quite overwhelming has happened.

245
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,405
I'm going to be married.

246
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,277
Someone I've known for years.

247
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,819
Someone I love very much.

248
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:13,089
Alex, I implore you, don't take it like this.

249
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,695
But I can't help it. How else could I say it?

250
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,857
However I'd say it, it would be wrong.

251
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:24,937
That's impossible, Alex. We're
going to be married at once.

252
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:31,338
I know I've messed this up
terribly. I'm truly sorry.

253
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:34,639
I never should have told you over the phone.

254
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,911
Hollenius.

255
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,019
Hollenius?

256
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,624
- Hollenius?
- Yes.

257
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:49,661
Hello, darling.

258
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,933
- Hollenius, the composer?
- Yes, I have to finish dressing, Karel.

259
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,498
You know him?

260
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,735
Well, he's been teaching, sort of.

261
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:04,310
The piano?

262
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,947
Nonsense. Not Hollenius.

263
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:11,575
Well, composition more, or...
or, I don't know, just music.

264
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:17,123
He's been awfully good to me, so I thought
I really ought to let him know about us.

265
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,421
But tell me, was there
anything wrong over the phone?

266
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,657
Wrong? What would be wrong?

267
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,897
Karel.

268
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:31,205
How sweet of you.

269
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,776
Remember, remember Marie, the
flower seller on the Ringstrasse?

270
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,607
And all the cunning
little bunches of flowers?

271
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,544
He hung up, didn't he?

272
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,777
Yes. I'll put these in water.

273
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,257
Darling, they are sweet.

274
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,419
Now, let's see.

275
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,932
My coat and hat.

276
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,661
Was he? Was he angry?

277
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,161
I expect he thinks you've kidnapped me.

278
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:10,505
Probably thinks you have a large
black mustache and dance the rumba.

279
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,473
We've lots to do. We must tell
people. We must go to the city hall.

280
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:17,277
The quicker we know what day
we're going to be married...

281
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,046
...the quicker we can
invite people to the party.

282
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,087
Haven't you someone you want to invite?

283
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,316
- Just one.
- Who?

284
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,017
You.

285
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,762
Karel.

286
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:06,592
Ladies and gentlemen,
to the bride.

287
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,759
Happiness, Christine.

288
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,495
And to the groom.

289
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,537
Congratulations.

290
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:17,644
And may they know every happiness
that can spring from talent and love...

291
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,579
...and trust.
- That's sweet of you, Mr. Day.

292
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,849
Music, please.

293
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,662
A party indeed.

294
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:43,195
- Hollenius.
- Madame. How do you do, Harnitz?

295
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:46,704
- Thank you.
- Crispin, I'm delighted to see you.

296
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:50,806
Well, I hope I'm welcome, my dear.
You look as if you were seeing a ghost.

297
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,446
How did you get here so quickly?

298
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,081
Quickly?

299
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,149
I have the impression I'm too late.

300
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,843
That object, I presume, is a wedding cake.

301
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,352
Champagne, all very fitting.

302
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,457
I infer a husband.

303
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,115
Make me acquainted with him.

304
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,490
Karel. My husband, Karel Novak.

305
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,156
My dear sir...

306
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:17,863
...I wish you all the joys that we less
fortunate men must be content to imagine.

307
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,403
- Thank you.
- This, of course, is Hollenius.

308
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:23,009
- Thank you.
- You do us a great honor, Mr. Hollenius.

309
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,908
Oh, no, she's my daughter, my ewe lamb.

310
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:28,714
It'd look very odd if I
were not at her wedding.

311
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,442
Uh-huh.

312
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,347
The Louis Roederer, no?

313
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:35,490
Yes, we opened it for
this evening.

314
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,420
For all and sundry.

315
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,925
I don't know where there's another
dozen of that year procurable.

316
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:43,189
Still, it's a great occasion.

317
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,693
A great occasion.

318
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:49,303
- And yet I wish she'd put it off a little.
- Put it off?

319
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:53,134
- Why?
- So that I might have given her away.

320
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:54,332
- Pollard.
- Don't go.

321
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:56,568
So to speak, her nearest male relation.

322
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,341
After all, what could be closer than
the relationship of master and pupil?

323
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,481
Except, of course, husband and wife.

324
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,483
Are you gonna give me that champagne...

325
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:08,054
...I went to such incredible
trouble to get hold of?

326
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:09,815
Yes.

327
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:16,089
They tell me that bridegrooms
are a very nervous kind of cattle.

328
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,664
You look extremely nervous, if I may say so.

329
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,266
- Do I?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,773
My dear, you know I never
drink on an empty stomach.

331
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,275
- Get me something to eat, my child.
- Cake?

332
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,436
No, no, no,
not that ridiculous thing.

333
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,549
Now, if there's some caviar?

334
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,775
Yes, yes, in here.

335
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,921
Is it decently chilled?

336
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:43,888
And I abused the poor creature
so abominably over the telephone.

337
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,551
- You did? - Mm-hm.
An outburst of fury.

338
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,987
Uncontrolled possessiveness.

339
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,725
Call it jealousy, if you will.

340
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:56,701
You know, I remember well the
day when she first came to me.

341
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,930
Four years ago, wasn't it, Christine?

342
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:00,506
Yes.

343
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,666
All eyes and talent.

344
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:06,644
You can't imagine how skinny she was then.

345
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,380
But of course, you knew her. Yeah.

346
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,984
You were in love already.

347
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,983
The little minx concealed it from me.

348
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,215
Why should I have interested
myself in such a creature?

349
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,882
- I ask you. Why?
- Well, why?

350
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,153
- You said I had promise.
- And I was right.

351
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,356
Four years of coaxing, bullying,
pleading, suggesting, implanting...

352
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,797
...and there's a quality.

353
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,937
She's... She's an artist.

354
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:33,871
It was no trifle to be told, just as she
was coming into existence musically...

355
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,169
...that she's in love, she's marrying...

356
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,108
- You haven't any champagne.
- Nothing else matters to her.

357
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,010
I was prepared to excommunicate her.

358
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,279
Anything. That, of course,
was before meeting you.

359
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,955
After all, why shouldn't she have a
husband? You have him, my dear.

360
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,583
Have a dozen of them. Sooner or later
you'll come back to your old teacher.

361
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,060
You'll realize that
nothing matters but music.

362
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:59,359
Everything passes but music. And me.

363
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:06,998
We are more optimistic, Mr. Hollenius.

364
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:09,541
We shall see. You play
something for him, my child.

365
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,771
Something he hasn't heard before.
I'm sure you have still much...

366
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,312
...to reveal to him.

367
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:16,347
Shall I, darling?

368
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,179
Please, Schatzi.

369
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,718
What shall I play?

370
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,081
You know.

371
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,782
of course.

372
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,689
But I haven't played it for such a long time.

373
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:30,330
- Schatzi.
- Tell me, are you a musician?

374
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:31,897
Cellist, yes.

375
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,591
Extraordinary thing, teaching a person.

376
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:36,862
- Pygmalion and all that.
- Yes, I was surprised to hear you did it.

377
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:38,528
I found it stimulating.

378
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,299
A labor of love, so to speak.

379
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:43,672
I told her to take a pupil, she
might learn more than she taught him.

380
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:47,747
But no, said she'd absolutely vowed
not to. obstinate, you'll find out.

381
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,009
- I've been asked to play.
- Wonderful.

382
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,751
Something tender it should be, and pathetic.

383
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,759
A little absurd, Chopin perhaps.

384
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:05,094
Karel has asked me to
play the "Appassionata."

385
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:10,604
I haven't
tried it for a long time...

386
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,605
...so you'll have to bear with me.

387
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,875
Has everyone a comfortable place to sit?

388
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,875
Good.

389
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,545
Hollenius, let me see.

390
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:07,949
Like all women, white as a sheet at
the sight of a couple of scratches.

391
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:13,920
Calm and smiling like a hospital nurse
in the presence of a mortal wound.

392
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,758
Good night.

393
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:27,268
You will go on playing, won't you, Chris?

394
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:31,811
That's sweet of you, Norma, but I
think champagne is more in order.

395
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,278
Pollard, will you see that
everyone has champagne.

396
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:38,351
It's already late. Again let
me wish you every happiness.

397
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,351
- It isn't late.
- Yes, it is.

398
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,888
Thank you and good night.

399
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,615
Good night.

400
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,024
- Good night, Norma.
- Good night, dear.

401
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,527
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,062
- Good night.
- Good night.

403
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,289
- Good night.
- Good night.

404
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,265
- Nice party.
- Thank you.

405
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,602
I'm very glad you could come. Good night.

406
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:02,809
- Christine, darling. Thank you.
- Good night.

407
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,672
- Good night.
- Good night.

408
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,357
oh. That will be all, Pollard, for tonight.

409
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:20,892
Just put out the candles in the
dining room, come back in the morning.

410
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:23,428
- Very well, madam.
- Thank you.

411
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:31,031
He gets terribly upset by music sometimes.

412
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:33,173
And everything else he said before?

413
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:36,208
That was just Hollenius.

414
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,770
- He was hinting I'd taken you from him.
- Hinting?

415
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:44,544
Good heavens, he said it
straight out half a dozen times.

416
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:47,846
I thought it was quite
wonderful of him to admit it.

417
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:51,321
You must remember, Karel,
he's a very great man.

418
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,655
Too great, I should have thought,
to be jealous over a pupil.

419
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,629
Well, he's not the sort of teacher who
gives a lesson once or twice a week.

420
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,827
To Hollenius, music is everything.
The whole world, part of his life.

421
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:04,966
He took me into his life.

422
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:08,597
We ate together, we traveled
together more than once.

423
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,237
When he was working or
talking to other composers...

424
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:15,610
...I sat in a corner
and listened and learned.

425
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,977
He liked having me there.

426
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:22,088
As though I were... Well, as though
I were a cat or a dog he was fond of.

427
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:27,887
Why did your friends look so frightened
and so gleeful when Hollenius came in?

428
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:31,793
Well, I just told you,
I was part of his life.

429
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:34,833
- Good night, Pollard.
- Good night, Mrs. Novak.

430
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:38,138
I suppose there has been
a certain amount of gossip.

431
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:40,035
I don't know.

432
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,101
What does it matter?

433
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,338
To be honest, I think the old rascal...

434
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,981
...rather liked giving the impression.

435
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,677
And...

436
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,687
...this I'm sure you'll never understand.

437
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:01,122
Heavens, I seem to be
taking off every shred I...

438
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:04,526
Well, I confess I was a
little vain of it myself.

439
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,723
I understand that.

440
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,461
Do you really?

441
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:11,799
You brighten me so.

442
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,464
Do you love me terribly?

443
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:22,745
Darling, don't you think we could
forget Hollenius just for tonight...

444
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,283
...in view of the occasion?

445
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:29,880
While we drink the champagne he gave you?

446
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,389
He's a terrible old emperor.

447
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,222
He gives cases of the most incredible
wines and brandies to all his friends...

448
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,125
...and makes no bones about it.

449
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:41,200
"So that I shall have something
fit to drink when I visit you."

450
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:46,268
A picture fit to look at when he visits you.
The finest piano in the world to listen to.

451
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,001
The most expensive clothes.
He gives those to everybody?

452
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,737
- I told you how I came by those.
- Yes, from pupils.

453
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,175
- Wealthy pupils.
- Yes.

454
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:55,713
Unfortunately, he told
me you never had a pupil.

455
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,680
Well, to his knowledge, perhaps no.

456
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,878
To his knowledge? When you
spend all your time with him?

457
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:04,718
When he calls you obstinate
for refusing to take a pupil?

458
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,554
No, Schatzi, you kept that
vow at least. Don't deny it.

459
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,131
Poor Karel. And I tried too.

460
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,067
Now you'll never believe me.

461
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,503
And you're right, of course.

462
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,439
It was all so perfectly innocent.

463
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,344
So many lies to cover something innocent?

464
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,414
Nothing in your eyes has been innocent.

465
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,448
In the old days you were always jealous.

466
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:31,676
And you were wrong.

467
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:33,980
You were completely
proven wrong, weren't you?

468
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,816
Weren't you? Proven wrong.

469
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,083
And you were just as sure as you are now.

470
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,386
A few miserable gifts.

471
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,392
Christmas.

472
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:46,029
Last Christmas. It's all so simple.

473
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,127
My birthday this year.

474
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:52,202
My birthday the year before.

475
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,637
He's rich, immensely rich, he's like a king.

476
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,369
When he likes people, he
transforms their lives.

477
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:02,244
one day, I played a composition of
his and he liked it, the next day this.

478
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,577
How can he know someone who's poor?

479
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:07,585
How can he go about with
someone whose clothes offend him?

480
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:10,485
He can't visit you in a lodging-house room.

481
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:14,219
I tell you, he furnished my life
as he would a back hallway...

482
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,296
...that he passed through
once a year. And he likes me.

483
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,400
He told you himself I
was his daughter, his pet.

484
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:23,036
Isn't it understandable?

485
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:27,870
The more understandable, the
more strange you didn't tell me.

486
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:33,207
I wanted to when you first came in here
but you looked so... So hurt and so ill.

487
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,414
And afterwards?

488
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,708
Afterwards, I couldn't.

489
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,412
Don't you remember what happened?

490
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,350
You can't choke the truth out of someone.

491
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:04,171
Promise me you'll never,
never think of it again.

492
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,139
But you will.

493
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:14,984
You see, Schatzi...

494
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:20,788
...the thing that tortures me is when
I feel you're not telling me the truth.

495
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,869
Hello.

496
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:46,980
Uh... Tomorrow morning?
No, I'm afraid I couldn't.

497
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:50,817
Wouldn't it do later on in the week?

498
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:54,652
All right.

499
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,624
All right, Alexander, I'll try.

500
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,459
Yes, all right.

501
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,742
- Good morning, Jimmy.
- Good morning, miss.

502
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,942
- Where is the master?
- In the study, miss.

503
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,556
It's wonderful.

504
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,593
Extraordinary, isn't it?

505
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:40,826
That music can exist in the same world
as the basest treachery and ingratitude?

506
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:44,103
So you remember the concerto
I started last winter.

507
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,434
- Well, I finished it.
- You haven't been to bed.

508
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:50,702
That is no longer any business of yours.

509
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,011
- What are you here for?
- You insisted I come.

510
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:56,979
To exult over the damage you've done.

511
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,813
Have you changed your mind
after a single day of marriage?

512
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:03,252
Some people find it easy
to change their minds.

513
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,552
or has he seen you for what
you are and thrown you out?

514
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:08,854
Not yet, eh?

515
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:12,159
Doesn't he know?

516
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,233
No.

517
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,070
Amazing creature.

518
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,503
She deceives everybody.

519
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:22,904
- Don't talk like that.
- I'll talk as I please.

520
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,072
But I didn't summon you here to bully you.

521
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:29,908
Come on, sit down.

522
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,454
I've been thinking about this miserable
business all night. You're insane...

523
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,057
...and you must be humored.

524
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:41,490
We must be reasonable
and we must be realistic.

525
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,357
I gave you a great deal.

526
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,829
- I know.
- I wonder if you do.

527
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,126
I'm not exactly a simple personality.

528
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,498
They call me a great man.

529
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,775
It's the loneliest animal in the world.

530
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:59,405
I need you extremely badly, my dear.

531
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:02,716
Tell me, was it all a pretense?

532
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:04,908
You know perfectly well it wasn't.

533
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,750
- I'm not repulsive to you?
- of course not, Alex.

534
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:12,188
This other thing, this ridiculous
resurrection of calf love.

535
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,987
This... Why, I've shown you what life is.

536
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,687
I've shown you music and
I've given you understanding.

537
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,102
Is this infatuation so precious to you that
you can turn your back on understanding?

538
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:27,934
I know, I'm not a youth. I'm
not a savage, a little wavy hair...

539
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:30,373
...why should I deny it you?

540
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,047
If you'd only come to me.

541
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:39,516
If you'd told me quite frankly that you
couldn't live without this latest luxury.

542
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,313
You can have both.

543
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:45,654
Hollenius, what are you?

544
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:46,952
What you made me.

545
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:50,222
- It's too hideous.
- But you can't.

546
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,024
You can't leave me.

547
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,363
For this gut scraper.

548
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,697
This puppet of people like myself.

549
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,239
Who, if I write pbbt plays pbbt,
and if I write pbbt plays pbbt!

550
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:04,070
- I'm going.
- Now, you listen to me.

551
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:06,712
What more can you possibly
have to say after that?

552
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,941
I have it in me, Christine,
to remove this impertinence.

553
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,583
You wouldn't.

554
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,120
Then don't provoke me.

555
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:34,236
- You're making a terrible mistake.
- I made my mistake years ago...

556
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,343
...when I first met you. See,
I thought I was buying his life.

557
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:38,535
- From me?
- Yes.

558
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,236
- You never mentioned him.
- I know.

559
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,310
So you betrayed me even then.

560
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,508
Yes, and him too.

561
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:48,751
I was half mad that winter trying to
get him over here. I didn't know anybody.

562
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,256
I didn't have money, you were rich
with all the influence in the world.

563
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,394
- He knows nothing about this?
- Nothing.

564
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:55,893
I see.

565
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:58,964
It's all very lofty, all very noble...

566
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,760
...and all very unscrupulous.
- No.

567
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,402
No? Why are you lying to him?

568
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,835
Because he's not well enough to
know. He's suffered enough already.

569
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,967
When you looked at him so
contemptuously last night, Hollenius...

570
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:13,012
...I realized how much he'd changed.

571
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,542
If you'd only known him when I first met him.

572
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:20,448
He was young and strong
and gay and so full of hope.

573
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,454
He was the most promising
young cellist in Europe...

574
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,720
...and we were so happy and so much in love.

575
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,454
Then the war came and we were swept apart...

576
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,226
...and I came back here and I
did everything to get him over.

577
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:39,737
I went from office to office, I even
wrote letters to people I didn't know.

578
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:42,535
And always a blank wall.

579
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:44,176
A blank wall.

580
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:48,481
And he was on the other side of it, lost.

581
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:52,750
And after a while, I was afraid he was dead.

582
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,785
He's been through horrors.

583
00:42:56,223 --> 00:43:00,421
And now that he's back, do you think I'll
let anything in the world hurt him? No.

584
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:06,263
He's something of a genius you tell me?

585
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:09,300
If the term can be applied to a performer.

586
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:13,566
For the malady of a genius, whatever it is,
there's only one cure and that's success.

587
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,741
Which is to be found here only in New York.

588
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:19,435
I know.

589
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,149
- But I'd rather he'd miss that than...
- Than have me make trouble?

590
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,779
Frankly, have you found
me to be a little man?

591
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:30,719
Great men can be very petty and very cruel.

592
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:32,754
And very vain.

593
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,222
The last is more like my weakness.

594
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,966
Can you believe I wanna lose you altogether?

595
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,945
Come on, my dear, you better go.

596
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:57,545
Does he know about this visit?

597
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,485
Well, when you telephoned me last
night, I told him it was a girl I knew...

598
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,886
...a date I couldn't get out of.

599
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,955
My dear...

600
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:09,726
...I sincerely pity you.

601
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,273
Jimmy.

602
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:40,354
All right, Jimmy, you can come in.

603
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:43,926
I want you to take this to Mr.
Carter at the record library...

604
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:48,967
...and bring back any records he
may give you as quickly as you can.

605
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:12,153
- Well, what is it?
- There is someone here, sir.

606
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:14,385
- A Mr. Novak.
- A who?

607
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:16,119
Mr. Novak.

608
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,161
Mr. Novak.

609
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:23,102
Don't you know who Mr. Novak
is? Schatzi's husband, no less...

610
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,932
...and Schatzi is Miss Christine.

611
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:29,609
Married yesterday, suddenly.

612
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:33,809
Show him in.

613
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,148
Schatzi.

614
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:43,649
Mr. Novak, sir.

615
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,852
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

616
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:53,633
I was passing and I thought I'd
drop in to ask about your hand.

617
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,929
That's a fuss about
nothing, but thank you.

618
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:59,299
Is Christine here?

619
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:01,998
No, did she tell you she was coming?

620
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,736
Did you telephone her last night?

621
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:05,936
No.

622
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,708
- No?
- You know, I behaved very badly...

623
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:11,009
...at your party. I'm glad you called.

624
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,676
I'm glad to have an opportunity to apologize.

625
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,118
I'm not worrying about
what happened at the party.

626
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,149
But I am.

627
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:19,882
very much indeed.

628
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,997
You know, I arrived after perhaps the most
unpleasant journey I've ever undertaken.

629
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:29,067
Firmly convinced all the way that Christine's
committing some catastrophic folly.

630
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:34,740
She hadn't told me who you were
or that she had known you before.

631
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,270
And to be perfectly frank, I was
so overwrought when I got there...

632
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:43,974
...that neither your name nor your
personality was sufficiently impressive...

633
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:48,451
...to arrest the pent-up feelings
that had accumulated on the way.

634
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,484
I should be grieved.

635
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:55,625
Deeply grieved.

636
00:46:56,163 --> 00:47:02,625
If my bad behavior could have
possibly have given rise to any...

637
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,931
How shall I put it delicately,
any misunderstanding?

638
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,472
Oh, no.

639
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:09,836
It was that, wasn't it?

640
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,205
Well, it...

641
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:16,182
...sounded as if...

642
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,284
on the telephone last night when she...

643
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:23,349
I have had a very charming
companion this morning.

644
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:26,823
But masculine, my dear fellow, masculine.

645
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,833
How on Earth did you get hold of that?

646
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,908
I did it how long?

647
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:45,237
Seven years ago for a
little company in Europe.

648
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:48,575
Half a dozen of us subsidized a
library, just for the good things...

649
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:52,412
...that don't get on to the
popular market. We don't miss much.

650
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:55,180
- Schubert.
- What melody.

651
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,949
Your cello seems to appreciate it.

652
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:01,591
I certainly was light of heart in those days.

653
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,194
Now?

654
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:07,925
Well, one... one develops.

655
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,261
- Of course, I...
- Had a bad time, huh?

656
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:13,472
Why?

657
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,144
Wouldn't play for them.

658
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:23,815
Anyway, you kept your fingers.

659
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,717
Well, if that's how you play, I'd like
you to listen to something I have here.

660
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,358
After which, perhaps, we
can have a little chat.

661
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:36,646
How on Earth?

662
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,814
Fortunate woman.

663
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:42,985
- The wife of a successful artist.
- Karel. Karel, you're mad.

664
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:50,261
His own manuscript.

665
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,467
- Who gave it to you?
- He did.

666
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:57,175
- Hollenius?
- Who else?

667
00:49:57,344 --> 00:50:00,575
- But why? What for?
- To play, naturally.

668
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,477
On the 21st of next month
and he's to conduct it himself.

669
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,780
- Guest conductor, just for his own piece.
- What?

670
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:11,646
Karel, tell me quickly exactly what happened.

671
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:15,317
- I went to see him. He gave it to me.
- But why?

672
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:19,022
It's just possible, you know,
he may have liked my approach.

673
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,528
It seems so strange.

674
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,102
After last night, I mean.

675
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:29,106
Well, it bears out what you said about
him last night, about his princely gifts.

676
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:33,073
or don't you think so?

677
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:34,873
Of course.

678
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:39,109
Tell me, did he talk about
anything else but music?

679
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,117
Everything is music to him.

680
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:45,054
We talked about life and love and you.

681
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:48,888
About me? What did he have to say about me?

682
00:50:49,096 --> 00:50:50,825
Something very interesting.

683
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:56,166
He said if you had courage, you'd
be a very great person indeed.

684
00:50:57,738 --> 00:50:59,069
only that?

685
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:02,072
Nothing else as profound as that.

686
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:05,234
Where is the excitement
about this great news?

687
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:07,937
I hear no cries of joy. Aren't you pleased?

688
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:09,844
Yes. Yes, of course.

689
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:15,079
It's just that, well, all day long I've
been thinking myself how I could help you...

690
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:17,655
...and well, now suddenly...

691
00:51:19,426 --> 00:51:21,018
Jealous?

692
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:27,994
You wanted to help your
broken-down husband, didn't you?

693
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,127
Well, it's much better not to
have a broken-down husband at all.

694
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:34,671
Schatzi, this makes such a difference.

695
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,138
And I can do it.

696
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:38,140
I was scared out of my wits at first.

697
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:40,472
You were scared too. I
saw it when you came in.

698
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:43,172
But I've been playing it
all the afternoon. I have it.

699
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,409
It's so wonderful. What a creation.

700
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:49,021
It's something I never
hoped for or dreamed of.

701
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:54,457
You think I can't do it?

702
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:56,653
Is that what's bothering you?

703
00:51:57,063 --> 00:52:00,521
- No.
- No? Then what?

704
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:04,698
Why did you go to see Hollenius?

705
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,242
Oh, I...

706
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:14,079
I didn't believe you.

707
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:17,307
I thought it was Hollenius
who called you last night.

708
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:20,942
It sounded like it, what you were saying.

709
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:24,413
When you told me it was a girl...

710
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:26,251
...I thought you were...

711
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:27,620
Lying.

712
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:30,763
I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed
to have gone to him...

713
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:33,661
...and to have asked if you'd been there.

714
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:38,532
Are you angry?

715
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:41,570
No.

716
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,574
A little sad perhaps.

717
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:46,569
But it doesn't matter.

718
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,739
All that matters is that you have
the concerto and he gave it to you.

719
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,648
And you must think of nothing
else but playing it wonderfully.

720
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:57,881
- You really think I can?
- of course, darling.

721
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:00,219
of course you can.

722
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:02,356
You shall.

723
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,356
Now, tell me, how are you going to work?

724
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:09,866
Well, he suggested I should plug away
alone for the rest of this week and next.

725
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:13,335
And then we are to meet for dinner
and afterwards I'm to play it.

726
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:15,497
And he's to see how he likes it.

727
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,700
And if he doesn't like it, is it all off?

728
00:53:17,878 --> 00:53:21,041
Well, he didn't say so, but
with anyone as unknown as I am...

729
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:24,706
...he has a right to protect
himself, obviously. But he'll like it.

730
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:26,785
I know he'll like it.

731
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,947
It's like breathing a new air to talk
to someone with that feeling for music.

732
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:35,253
You're right about him, he gives,
it's royal, he gives one a life...

733
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:38,864
...years of happiness,
casually, as if it were nothing.

734
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:40,928
But he knows.

735
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,467
He knows what he is doing.

736
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,300
- Monsieur Hollenius.
- Marcelle.

737
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,637
I've been away.

738
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,739
Madame? My dear, I hope I'm not late.

739
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,144
Well, a little.

740
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,979
Karel. I trust I'm gonna
hear a remarkable performance.

741
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,984
- Are you confident?
- And impatient.

742
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,419
So am I, for dinner.

743
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:07,186
-Madame.
- Good evening.

744
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,157
Mr. Hollenius.

745
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,595
Christine?

746
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:17,328
Monsieur?

747
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,835
Thank you.

748
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,802
Thank you, Alex.

749
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:25,308
Thank you, Andre.

750
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:28,174
Andre, this is my husband.

751
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:35,884
- What about you, Karel?
- No, thank you.

752
00:54:36,056 --> 00:54:38,490
- Louis, un martini.
- Yeah.

753
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:40,091
Andre.

754
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,227
Well, my dear,
what are you gonna have?

755
00:54:42,395 --> 00:54:47,094
Same as usual, a lecture on
eating and then what you decide.

756
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:48,427
Karel?

757
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,865
Tonight, really, I can't think about food.

758
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,164
You're mistaken.
The greater the pleasure...

759
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,535
...the more important to
preface it with a meal.

760
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:58,433
We should eat very well
tonight, though simply.

761
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:01,045
I wouldn't dull my perceptions for anything.

762
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,738
What have you got up your sleeve?

763
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,854
But in condition?

764
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,523
What do you think? I
think so, don't you? Hmm?

765
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,532
Yup. They might get three of
these fellows ready for us.

766
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:26,103
And do you know what I think
will go well before them? A trout.

767
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:30,140
A nice brook trout. Not too
large. From a good stream.

768
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,011
A trout and a partridge.

769
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:37,672
Could anything be more simple?

770
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:41,548
You know, I ask only one thing
of a meal, that it be excellent.

771
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:43,780
As with a musical performance, my dear Karel.

772
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:46,221
I hope I shall do as well as the chef here.

773
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:48,384
You haven't tasted his product yet.

774
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:51,155
Nor, now I come to think
of it, have I heard yours.

775
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:53,390
We both have a pleasure to look forward to.

776
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,727
You have a pleasant surprise in store, Alex.

777
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:58,427
You're not very complimentary
to your husband, my dear.

778
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,039
Nothing would surprise
me but a disappointment.

779
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:05,541
However, my tastes are very simple.
A good, straightforward performance.

780
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:08,272
A trout and a partridge.

781
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:14,881
The only question is plain, the partridge,
à l'anglaise, or roasted with truffles?

782
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:16,488
Eh, Christine? or aux choux?

783
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:19,181
No, of course, that would take rather a time.

784
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,156
Something that wouldn't take too long.

785
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:24,194
So you're eager to exhibit your prowess, eh?

786
00:56:24,364 --> 00:56:27,458
Why, I believe you're
nervous. Well, never mind.

787
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,034
Andre here will tell you
I'm very easily pleased, no?

788
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:37,271
Perfection. That goes without saying.

789
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:41,346
very well. Not to waste too much time,
the partridges roasted with the truffles.

790
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:44,216
You know, with a forcemeat
of pork and pullet livers.

791
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,079
Alex, that will take an eternity.

792
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:51,417
But mix into that forcemeat a half
glass, no more, of Madeira, not too dry.

793
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,525
Just to, uh... Hmm, you know.

794
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:59,156
A little advice to you. When ordering a
meal, even a frugal snack of this kind...

795
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,994
...always start with the piêce de résistance.

796
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,601
An ashtray, Andre.

797
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:08,969
Food or music, start always with
the keynote, the foundation stone.

798
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:11,906
With that thing of mine. I'm
sure you found it necessary...

799
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:16,845
...to begin with the fugato at the end
before making any study of the opening.

800
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,176
I'm right, am I not?

801
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:21,345
As a matter of fact, no.

802
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:23,321
No?

803
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,490
- Are you joking?
- No.

804
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:28,752
- I began to study it at the beginning...
- He plays it to perfection.

805
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:31,624
Which you will hear if we
ever get this meal over with.

806
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:33,095
You think I'm too slow?

807
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:35,757
I've been trying to tell
you, I don't know how long...

808
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:38,233
...Karel wants to play, not eat.

809
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:40,099
Schatzi. Schatzi. Schatzi.

810
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:42,070
Don't upset me.

811
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:46,008
You know, Karel, sometimes I'm positively
terrified of this wife of yours.

812
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:48,272
I hope you never have any occasion to be.

813
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:51,440
Christine thinks I'm getting nervous. I am.

814
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:55,179
Well, then to business.
And to begin with, soup.

815
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:57,050
or a little canapé, do you think?

816
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,554
- Oh, canapé.
- Soup.

817
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:02,320
Now, please, let us at least agree
on what we're going to begin with.

818
00:58:02,495 --> 00:58:03,484
- Soup...
- Canapé.

819
00:58:03,663 --> 00:58:06,063
Let me make up your minds for
you or we shall never have done.

820
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,927
Tell me, Andre, have you Parmentiers?

821
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:09,500
If not, a petite marmite.

822
00:58:12,605 --> 00:58:15,870
Good. Then all that remains
is to consider the wine.

823
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,509
Alex, we don't want any wine.

824
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:19,167
But I do.

825
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:22,640
Darling, pretend it's yesterday
and you still have 24 hours to wait.

826
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:24,578
Mm-hm. Now...

827
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:30,712
...should one, with a partridge, take
an Hermitage or a very soft Burgundy?

828
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,417
I do hope the great haste in which
we're assembling this slapdash repast...

829
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,119
...is not gonna affect me
and render me incapable...

830
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:39,561
...of appreciating good music.

831
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:42,098
I do wish we had begun
with the fugato at the end.

832
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,099
It's the key to the whole thing.

833
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:51,006
We are having these birds stuffed
with truffles and a soupçon of Madeira.

834
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:54,305
Darling, believe it or not, there
are places here in New York...

835
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,439
...where you can put a nickel in the
slot and something comes out immediately.

836
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,678
Therefore, I shall plump
for the Hermitage. Fourteen.

837
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:03,845
And you'd better decant it.

838
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:07,818
- Darling, relax.
- Don't keep soothing me. Do you mind?

839
00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:11,087
- I was only thinking of you.
- Don't, please.

840
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:16,861
Now, now, children, temper, temper. It
plays the very devil with the digestion.

841
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:19,300
We'll end with the
simplest salad in the world.

842
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,771
And some little sweet kickshaw
for you if you desire it.

843
00:59:22,942 --> 00:59:25,137
The only question is the Hermitage.

844
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,903
- Alex, really.
- I don't know.

845
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,707
I really feel most uncertain.

846
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,712
Darling, you may as well have a drink.

847
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:32,680
All right. Scotch and soda, please.

848
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:38,222
Supposing, after all, we had a vosne Romanée?

849
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:41,952
But then with a partridge aux truffé...

850
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,325
But if, on the other hand, we had...

851
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,863
...a woodcock.

852
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:52,835
A woodcock. A becasse flambé, or
a la Vatel, or a la Perigord...

853
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,203
...then we could have a vosne
Romanée. A Romanée-Conti even.

854
00:59:56,376 --> 01:00:01,177
very well, then, a woodcock. Now,
with a woodcock, with a woodcock...

855
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:04,849
Bon soir. Bon soir.

856
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:10,686
Schatzi, do me a favor
and don't come tonight.

857
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,349
I can stand my own anxiety but not yours.

858
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,654
All right, if you'd rather I didn't.

859
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,228
I'm sorry I upset you.

860
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:20,389
- That's all right.
- Well, you two, ready?

861
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:21,624
The cello.

862
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,735
Christine is tired. She's going home.

863
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:28,033
I hope that excellent saddle of
venison we had hasn't disagreed with her.

864
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,074
Maybe we should have had the woodcock.

865
01:00:33,313 --> 01:00:34,405
Here, darling.

866
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,208
- Thank you.
- Well, come along, my dear. We'll drop you.

867
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,080
Alex, I think I'd rather walk. Good luck.

868
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:02,308
This concludes
the 1 AM edition of worldwide news.

869
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:03,942
The following is transcribed.

870
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:17,578
Remember, folks, when you
spell Drawrof backwards, it reads forward.

871
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:24,147
A power complex, that's what it is.

872
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,781
The insolence of a megalomaniac.
A paranoiac, a dictator.

873
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,622
- Darling.
- Have we abolished dictators in politics...

874
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:34,324
...to find them cropping up in
music? I've had enough of dictators.

875
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,468
An egomaniac. Insulting into the bargain.

876
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:39,002
As an artist and as a
human being, he insulted me.

877
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,131
Arrogance. Insolence. But never
again, I tell you. Never again.

878
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:47,211
The man is crazy. Not that I
mind. All composers are crazy.

879
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,543
Nobody minds them being crazy.
Everybody expects them being crazy.

880
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:58,013
But this man, this man deliberately
upset a performance of his own music.

881
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,022
- I knew it.
- I knew what he was up to...

882
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,560
...the way he sat down at the piano.
Then interruptions, interruptions.

883
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,390
out of sheer perversity.

884
01:03:05,932 --> 01:03:10,335
of course I played badly. I played
horribly, atrociously, but he made me do it.

885
01:03:10,503 --> 01:03:11,902
But no more of that. No more.

886
01:03:12,071 --> 01:03:14,539
I put up with his vanity,
with his airs and graces.

887
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,767
But spoiling my performance,
that's something I won't stand for.

888
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:19,070
I'm glad.

889
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,436
- Glad?
- Yes.

890
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:24,242
Because you're so right. I'm
so happy to hear you say it.

891
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:27,909
What does it matter, Hollenius and
his concerto? To us they're nothing.

892
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:31,181
We'll forget them. We'll go to San Francisco.

893
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:33,257
There's a whole world of music there.

894
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:37,385
And we'll start together with
nothing, nothing but each other.

895
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,721
What on Earth are you talking about?

896
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,926
Well, you are not going on with it, are you?

897
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:47,038
- Who said so?
- Well, you did.

898
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:48,264
- I?
- Yes.

899
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:52,434
I said no such thing. I said I wouldn't
stand for nonsense from Hollenius. Nor will I.

900
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:55,775
He's a spoiled baby masquerading
as a little tin god. He's a...

901
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:59,543
But his concerto. It's made
for me. The adagio section.

902
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:03,086
- If he's going to snatch it away from you?
- I'd like to see him try it.

903
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,121
It's a bit late for that. Why should he?

904
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:07,788
What put that extraordinary
idea into your head?

905
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,190
What have you been talking
about all this time?

906
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:13,264
I said that he was crazy. And so he is.

907
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,060
I didn't say he was crazy
enough to take his concerto...

908
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:18,795
...from the only person who can play it.

909
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:27,439
Christine, I'm asking you.

910
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:30,912
Why should he?

911
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,411
Why should he?

912
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:39,117
He's not to be trusted, Karel.

913
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:45,219
This was a row between a
very arrogant composer...

914
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:47,525
...and a hot-tempered instrumentalist.

915
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,166
Why do you read more into it than that?

916
01:04:50,336 --> 01:04:51,963
He's capable of anything.

917
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,902
Capable of spoiling the first
performance of his concerto...

918
01:04:55,074 --> 01:04:57,008
...because his pupil gets married?

919
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,335
No.

920
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,606
Not over a pupil. over
something else perhaps.

921
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:05,114
Karel, you promised me
not to speak of that again.

922
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:07,582
But I think of it. Promise or no promise.

923
01:05:07,753 --> 01:05:11,416
Karel, I tell you I misunderstood
you when you first came in.

924
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:14,453
- If he has any such idea in mind...
- But he hasn't.

925
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:17,061
You said yourself you
played atrociously tonight.

926
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:19,026
That's true. With the orchestra...

927
01:05:19,198 --> 01:05:21,723
...I shan't play atrociously.
I shall play well.

928
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:26,031
- And then, then if he makes trouble...
- But he won't, Karel, he won't.

929
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:28,673
Stop clenching your hand.

930
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,706
And give it to me.

931
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,677
Come on.

932
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,741
Poor darling.

933
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:47,419
of course Hollenius is not going
to take the concerto away from you.

934
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,457
It was stupid of me even to think of it.

935
01:05:53,232 --> 01:05:57,134
You're going to play
wonderfully at the rehearsal.

936
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,080
Good morning, Jimmy.

937
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,318
- Is the master in?
- He's not at home, miss.

938
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,980
I see.

939
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:21,490
I've come to pick up Mr. Novak's cello.

940
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:24,892
It's just gone off, miss.
By special messenger.

941
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:28,433
Well, I'll use the phone
then, if you don't mind.

942
01:06:50,189 --> 01:06:52,623
What's this contemptible
lie about not being at home?

943
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:58,293
When have you condescended
to hide from a woman?

944
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:00,659
I suspected this was
some dirty trick of yours.

945
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:03,768
To be faced by a virago at
this hour of the morning.

946
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:07,099
Christine, my constitution simply
will not stand this sort of thing.

947
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,639
- You asked for it.
- How?

948
01:07:10,076 --> 01:07:12,374
Are you referring to your
husband's appalling exhibition...

949
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:14,103
...of temperament last night?

950
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,771
- Miracle you're allowed to live.
- Listen to the woman.

951
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,678
I think it should be I who complains.

952
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:23,715
And in the morning to be confronted by
a bawling fishwife, bristling with fury...

953
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:27,450
...because I fail to appreciate
the genius of her male.

954
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,924
Alex, I have come here
to warn you. To warn you.

955
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:31,757
Threats, eh? My dear, if you knew...

956
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:36,197
...how many daggers I've had flourished
before me by hysterical ladies of the opera.

957
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:37,960
At an earlier period of my life.

958
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,128
Some of them I now use for paper knives.

959
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,968
There's one thing that lends
a threat some dignity, Alex.

960
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,168
- What's that?
- An inflexible resolve to carry it out.

961
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:49,644
You know, there's a female in this opus...

962
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,648
...who is really not entirely unlike yourself.

963
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:56,517
Listen, my dear, isn't it about time
we started talking a little sense?

964
01:07:56,689 --> 01:07:58,953
What is it exactly that's bothering you?

965
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,387
What you're doing to Karel.

966
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,720
I was giving him the chance of a lifetime.

967
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:04,760
Yes, which you mean to take away again.

968
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,524
- Why should I do that?
- Out of spite, perhaps.

969
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,466
To break him because I've told you
he's not well enough to stand it.

970
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:13,867
You're a strange man, Alex.

971
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,634
It could be that you have some vague
notion in that inflated ego of yours...

972
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:22,975
...of abolishing him. You know, the
godlike gesture to get me back again.

973
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:25,208
You flatter yourself, my dear.

974
01:08:25,384 --> 01:08:27,852
But if that's what you think, you go to him.

975
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,954
Tell him to throw the thing up himself.

976
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:33,017
- Tell him why.
- You swine.

977
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,253
That is a very coarse expression coming
from so smartly dressed a young woman.

978
01:08:37,429 --> 01:08:39,090
I'm referring to that handsome coat.

979
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,262
Take it back. You...

980
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:47,367
I seem to remember the dress too.
But restrain yourself, my dear.

981
01:08:47,973 --> 01:08:49,770
Jimmy might come in.

982
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:53,871
The poor little creatures.
They frisk about, you know.

983
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:58,813
They have their little love affairs
and suddenly they're trapped.

984
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:00,281
You idiot.

985
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:04,445
A young woman with talent and intelligence
behaving like the biggest fool alive.

986
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:06,523
You want to keep your husband in the dark.

987
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:10,219
So you tell me you're lying to him.
You tell me he's a nervous wreck.

988
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:14,158
You put the only weapons with which I
could attack him right into my hands.

989
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,630
Huh! What tactics.

990
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:20,101
And to insult me into the bargain.
Do you think I have no feelings?

991
01:09:20,272 --> 01:09:22,263
Do you think Karel has no feelings?

992
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:26,307
- What about last night?
- I think I behaved very handsomely.

993
01:09:26,478 --> 01:09:28,241
I gave the man my composition.

994
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,281
I presume I have the right to
assure myself he's competent?

995
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,112
You deliberately made him play badly.

996
01:09:34,286 --> 01:09:36,186
You were impossible last night at dinner.

997
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:38,789
Delaying him, upsetting
him, playing on his nerves.

998
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,927
And you think he needs no nerves
to play before 2000 people?

999
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:46,030
Let me tell you, I have a duty, not
to you, not to him, but to music.

1000
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:49,892
As a matter of fact, I think his
nerves are better than his temper.

1001
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:52,833
I believe at the orchestra
rehearsal he will do very well.

1002
01:09:53,005 --> 01:09:54,267
of course he will.

1003
01:09:54,974 --> 01:09:56,601
If he's there.

1004
01:09:58,675 --> 01:10:00,302
Alex, if I could only believe you.

1005
01:10:00,677 --> 01:10:03,908
That is a luxury beyond
your present means, my dear.

1006
01:10:04,081 --> 01:10:07,346
If you want to believe other people,
you better give up lying yourself.

1007
01:10:07,518 --> 01:10:09,179
You take my advice, go home to him.

1008
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:13,085
- Tell him the truth.
- But I can't. He'd leave me.

1009
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:15,418
That's what you want, isn't it?

1010
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:19,227
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
- Yes, you did.

1011
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:20,687
But tell him.

1012
01:10:20,864 --> 01:10:23,992
And have him throw up the concert?
or would you rather take it away?

1013
01:10:24,168 --> 01:10:27,899
I don't know why I should have
pity on a liar and a coward and a fool.

1014
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:31,199
But lest you drive yourself
completely insane, I assure you...

1015
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:35,709
...I promise you, the
concerto will be played.

1016
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:42,150
If only I could believe you.

1017
01:10:42,953 --> 01:10:46,081
I'm so frightened and so
miserable, I don't know what I'm doing.

1018
01:10:46,256 --> 01:10:48,850
You're doing your best to
turn a friend into an enemy.

1019
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:50,755
But I know how merciless you can be.

1020
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:53,761
Thank you. You'd better go.
Besides, I have somebody coming.

1021
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:57,896
Alex, I'm sorry I'm such an idiot.

1022
01:10:58,268 --> 01:11:00,566
My dear, I have no taste for the abject.

1023
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:04,138
- But don't...
- I am now going to get up.

1024
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:16,385
I have an appointment for 11:00.

1025
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:21,754
- May I take your coat, Mr. Gribble?
- Thank you.

1026
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:31,762
oh-oh. I usually carry
that myself, thank you.

1027
01:11:31,935 --> 01:11:34,267
As you wish, sir. Please follow me.

1028
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:42,335
Yes. Yes, that's right, into the study.

1029
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:45,175
Jimmy, did you send that cable
to the London Philharmonic?

1030
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:47,749
- Yes, sir.
- Good. You can go away now.

1031
01:11:47,918 --> 01:11:49,078
Hello, Brunhilde.

1032
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:53,245
Yes, yes, Mr. Gribble.

1033
01:11:53,423 --> 01:11:54,549
Bertram Gribble.

1034
01:11:54,725 --> 01:11:57,785
Yes, yes. Now, let me see, you've
been first cellist for 10 years.

1035
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:00,521
Twelve and a half, if you'll
be kind enough to remember.

1036
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:04,224
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, tell me, how
did you like that concerto of mine?

1037
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:05,891
It's a masterpiece, Mr. Hollenius.

1038
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,060
- Superb. It's a work of genius.
- Huh?

1039
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:10,331
- It's monumental.
- You liked the thing?

1040
01:12:10,507 --> 01:12:12,202
I thought it was absolutely wonderful.

1041
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:14,776
I can't tell you how
anxious I am to hear you play.

1042
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:16,537
I can't tell you, how anxious...

1043
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,422
Never mind the beginning,
Gribble. Just start with the fugato.

1044
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,117
Gribble. Gribble.

1045
01:12:56,286 --> 01:12:59,119
- Good morning.
- I must talk to you.

1046
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:01,917
Get in, I'll take you to rehearsal.

1047
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:18,907
This is exceedingly kind of you. Most kind.

1048
01:13:19,076 --> 01:13:22,409
I couldn't let you drown, now could I?

1049
01:13:22,579 --> 01:13:24,069
Well, I greatly appreciate it.

1050
01:13:24,247 --> 01:13:26,112
Nonsense. What would the orchestra do...

1051
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:30,447
...if its principal cellist should
happen to catch pneumonia and die?

1052
01:13:30,621 --> 01:13:33,146
- What would the public say?
- Mrs. Novak.

1053
01:13:33,323 --> 01:13:34,813
What would Hollenius say?

1054
01:13:34,992 --> 01:13:38,393
Hollenius? I doubt whether he'd
be more than momentarily concerned...

1055
01:13:38,562 --> 01:13:40,154
...over my premature demise.

1056
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:43,925
On the contrary, I happen to know
he has a very high opinion of you.

1057
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:45,227
Has he?

1058
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:48,803
Well, didn't he ask you to play his
concerto for him only last Sunday?

1059
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:50,701
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1060
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:52,466
Well, he liked it, didn't he?

1061
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:56,841
I must say he was kind enough to
congratulate me on a perfect performance.

1062
01:13:57,014 --> 01:14:00,142
If you're really interested I
can tell you his exact words.

1063
01:14:00,317 --> 01:14:02,785
- May I?
- Please.

1064
01:14:02,953 --> 01:14:05,319
I noted them down in my diary.

1065
01:14:05,489 --> 01:14:09,050
Little tributes, it's so
pleasant to remember them.

1066
01:14:09,226 --> 01:14:10,693
"Perfect performance," he said.

1067
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:16,629
"Not a single mistake, no nerves, no
nonsense, no hysteria, no anything."

1068
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,701
No one can be more gracious than
the master. Said my phrasing...

1069
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:24,364
Perhaps he was so gracious as to
promise you could play the part tonight.

1070
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:26,304
- Me?
- You.

1071
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:29,775
- You don't mean the solo part?
- Yes, the solo part.

1072
01:14:30,247 --> 01:14:33,307
- Isn't your husband...?
- It's a trick, Gribble, to ruin my husband.

1073
01:14:33,483 --> 01:14:34,916
- No.
- Yes.

1074
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:38,452
Gribble, it was not an accident
my picking you up this morning.

1075
01:14:38,622 --> 01:14:40,249
- Really?
- I had to talk to you.

1076
01:14:40,424 --> 01:14:43,587
I've always heard you spoken
of as a man of great integrity.

1077
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,728
Well, I hope so.

1078
01:14:45,896 --> 01:14:47,796
How do you know? Why should Hollenius...?

1079
01:14:47,964 --> 01:14:50,432
Why should Hollenius hate my husband?

1080
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,694
You've lived long enough in the
musical world to know the answer.

1081
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:56,862
I assure you, Mrs. Novak,
I never concern myself...

1082
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,304
What's all this got to do with the concerto?

1083
01:14:59,476 --> 01:15:03,071
Karel doesn't know about Hollenius and me.

1084
01:15:03,246 --> 01:15:04,770
I see.

1085
01:15:04,948 --> 01:15:06,643
Karel's life has been a tragic one.

1086
01:15:06,817 --> 01:15:09,047
He's suffered a good deal
in the past few years.

1087
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:13,553
He's... Well, he's like a man who's
coming out of the darkness into the light.

1088
01:15:13,724 --> 01:15:16,522
And, well, Hollenius wants to
put him back into the darkness.

1089
01:15:16,693 --> 01:15:18,923
First he offers him this
wonderful opportunity.

1090
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,189
- He's gonna take it away.
- I can't believe it.

1091
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:24,731
But it's true. If Hollenius
does this to Karel, he'll...

1092
01:15:24,901 --> 01:15:27,734
Well, he'll know why and
he'll find out about me.

1093
01:15:27,904 --> 01:15:30,372
And that will leave him
nothing, don't you understand?

1094
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:35,804
Mrs. Novak, I'm a musician and if
the master considers me worthy...

1095
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:38,504
You're not such an idiot
as to think that, are you?

1096
01:15:38,682 --> 01:15:40,946
I see no need to get personal.

1097
01:15:41,284 --> 01:15:44,742
I was under the impression I was to
understudy in case anything goes wrong.

1098
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:47,481
But something will go wrong.
Hollenius will see to it.

1099
01:15:47,657 --> 01:15:50,990
- Why didn't you tell me all this before?
- I'm telling you now.

1100
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:54,221
It will happen today when Hollenius
takes over the dress rehearsal.

1101
01:15:54,397 --> 01:16:00,666
Now, I could hardly expect you to pass
up such a great opportunity for nothing.

1102
01:16:00,837 --> 01:16:04,603
I'll give you a thousand dollars if
you won't accept Hollenius' offer.

1103
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:07,539
How many thousand would Mr.
Novak give up his opportunity?

1104
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:10,441
But that's completely different.
Karel is a great musician.

1105
01:16:10,614 --> 01:16:13,674
Indeed. You think I'm less
of an artist than your husband?

1106
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,841
- No, I didn't...
- Thank you, Mrs. Novak.

1107
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:22,982
Extra! Extra!

1108
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,951
Extra! Extra!

1109
01:16:26,129 --> 01:16:28,154
Extra! Extra!

1110
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:29,593
Gribble.

1111
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:34,396
Gribble, I beg you. I'll give you $2000.

1112
01:18:53,576 --> 01:18:55,009
The flute is ahead.

1113
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:56,907
Have you no feeling for rhythm?

1114
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:01,884
once more, please, the flute passage.

1115
01:19:02,052 --> 01:19:05,112
Letter K, on the upbeat.

1116
01:19:05,522 --> 01:19:08,013
And the first bar a little slower.

1117
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:25,530
Same mistake.

1118
01:19:25,709 --> 01:19:26,698
Me?

1119
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:28,707
Yes, you, sir. once more, please.

1120
01:19:28,878 --> 01:19:30,368
The first bar a little faster.

1121
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:55,732
I was under the impression
I had stopped the orchestra.

1122
01:19:55,905 --> 01:19:58,465
I was under the impression
this was a dress rehearsal.

1123
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:01,109
Never in my life have I
known fantastic interruptions.

1124
01:20:01,277 --> 01:20:03,802
This is a cello concerto,
not a flute concerto.

1125
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,108
The conduct of the rehearsal
is not your business.

1126
01:20:07,283 --> 01:20:10,343
Kindly confine your performance
to your instrument, if you please?

1127
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,751
Gladly, if you let us. You'll get
no performance from me or anyone...

1128
01:20:13,923 --> 01:20:16,551
...if you go on like this.
It's too much for any man.

1129
01:20:16,726 --> 01:20:19,820
It will be stood, Mr. Novak...

1130
01:20:19,996 --> 01:20:23,397
...by anyone who is going to play
under my direction. Please sit down.

1131
01:20:23,566 --> 01:20:26,558
No, I insist upon playing it
through once without interruptions.

1132
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:28,033
very well, sir.

1133
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:29,330
Kindly leave the stage.

1134
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:32,606
This is...

1135
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:36,834
Kindly leave the stage.

1136
01:20:38,848 --> 01:20:40,372
very well.

1137
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:46,984
- Mr. Gribble.
- Yes, Mr. Hollenius.

1138
01:20:47,157 --> 01:20:48,920
I want you
to take over the solo...

1139
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:53,586
...since our temperamental Mr. Novak seems
unable to endure the strain of a rehearsal.

1140
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:02,805
After all, his own performance
needs no improvement.

1141
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:06,999
We mustn't exhaust the delicate
creature for this evening's performance.

1142
01:21:07,177 --> 01:21:08,769
So you'll continue his part...

1143
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:11,209
...while I polish more
details with the orchestra.

1144
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:12,643
Now, gentlemen.

1145
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:20,079
or perhaps, since these exhibitions
of temperament are so very wearing...

1146
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:23,716
...we'd better let the
concerto rest until after lunch.

1147
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:25,955
- Mr. Neilsen.
- Yes?

1148
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:28,791
- Would you like to rehearse your Beethoven?
- By all means.

1149
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:31,832
Thank you for your preparation
of the orchestra the past week.

1150
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:33,025
It was a pleasure.

1151
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:34,295
- Jimmy.
- Yes, sir.

1152
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:37,770
Thank you. You. Go home.

1153
01:21:37,941 --> 01:21:40,171
Put some ice on your head. Take a sedative.

1154
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:44,035
Get yourself into a rational mood
for this evening's performance...

1155
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:46,481
...which will be without interruptions.

1156
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:51,181
Gentlemen, the
"Seventh," second movement.

1157
01:21:55,525 --> 01:21:57,322
Alex. Alex, forgive me.

1158
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:00,128
What do you mean?

1159
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:02,560
I thought you meant to ruin Karel.

1160
01:22:02,732 --> 01:22:05,599
- How should I ruin him, if you please?
- By putting Gribble in.

1161
01:22:05,768 --> 01:22:09,465
Gribble? I use Gribble as an understudy.
I didn't trust your husband's nerves.

1162
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:14,201
I know, but I thought you meant to put him
in anyway, no matter how well Karel played.

1163
01:22:14,377 --> 01:22:18,336
You know, I have encountered a
variety of infatuated women in my time.

1164
01:22:18,515 --> 01:22:22,178
None, so far, has had the effrontery to
suggest that I would employ my music...

1165
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:24,217
...as an instrument of revenge.

1166
01:22:24,387 --> 01:22:25,786
You're right. I'm ashamed.

1167
01:22:25,955 --> 01:22:29,083
Moreover, if I wished to
obliterate such a rival...

1168
01:22:29,259 --> 01:22:32,228
...as your talented but
highly neurotic husband...

1169
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:34,454
...I should employ simpler measures.

1170
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:37,464
I would raise his unstable mind
to the highest of pinnacles.

1171
01:22:37,634 --> 01:22:40,000
I might allow my music to do that.

1172
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:46,234
And then strike him down with
unlovelier but more appropriate weapons.

1173
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,403
Weapons. What weapons?

1174
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:52,878
His own weakness, my dear,
and his charming wife.

1175
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:56,314
Let him play the concert. Let
him soar to the utmost heights.

1176
01:22:56,486 --> 01:22:59,649
And then, after the
concert, maybe at supper...

1177
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:02,882
...casually one of those
little phrases, you know.

1178
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:07,228
- Careless reminiscence of a year or two ago.
- No, Alex.

1179
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:10,833
A tiny, innocent-appearing bombshell.

1180
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,991
But you wouldn't.

1181
01:23:14,103 --> 01:23:15,934
You think not?

1182
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:37,884
He certainly scared the
life out of me for a moment.

1183
01:23:40,396 --> 01:23:43,160
You see, his bark's worse than his bite.

1184
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,764
I wonder if it's still raining.

1185
01:23:52,242 --> 01:23:53,675
Now...

1186
01:23:55,478 --> 01:23:57,343
...don't you fidget.

1187
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:01,781
There.

1188
01:24:01,951 --> 01:24:04,385
Darling, hold your head still.

1189
01:24:05,655 --> 01:24:07,714
Please, how can I do this?

1190
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:09,255
There.

1191
01:24:09,892 --> 01:24:11,621
How does it look to you?

1192
01:24:12,362 --> 01:24:13,454
Wonderful, superb.

1193
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:15,621
See that you look up at me
before you begin to play.

1194
01:24:16,966 --> 01:24:18,866
Darling, don't tense your hands.

1195
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:21,333
- Eight o'clock, you must be off.
- Dear, goodness.

1196
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:22,903
Here.

1197
01:24:23,072 --> 01:24:27,008
There. Here's your scarf and your gloves.

1198
01:24:28,578 --> 01:24:30,273
There.

1199
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:33,006
Let me look at you.

1200
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,483
Not bad for a rented suit, is it?

1201
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:42,387
Darling.

1202
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:45,652
Now, remember, you look at me
the last thing before you start.

1203
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:48,388
And the first thing afterwards.

1204
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:56,898
Lipstick.

1205
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,007
I'm sorry.

1206
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:05,712
- But you're not ready, not nearly ready.
- Don't worry about me. I'll follow in a cab.

1207
01:25:06,115 --> 01:25:07,582
Here...

1208
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,913
...your hat and your gloves.

1209
01:25:11,421 --> 01:25:13,446
And your scarf.

1210
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,217
Play well.

1211
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:22,492
More lipstick. Go on.
Karel, you should have an umbrella.

1212
01:25:22,665 --> 01:25:25,759
Good heavens, no. Don't you be late.

1213
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,139
Show her in.

1214
01:26:14,484 --> 01:26:16,748
He's in the dining room, ma'am.

1215
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:36,696
Good evening, my dear.

1216
01:26:36,873 --> 01:26:38,773
Why, you look positively majestic.

1217
01:26:39,242 --> 01:26:41,676
I think I'd better remain seated.

1218
01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:45,743
I thought you might be coming
along. Like a little Scotch?

1219
01:26:45,915 --> 01:26:49,248
There's hardly time, is
there? We'll miss the symphony.

1220
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:53,078
Compose a piece yourself, my dear.

1221
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:56,623
And see how it sounds to you
after listening to Beethoven.

1222
01:26:57,593 --> 01:26:59,026
Do you mind?

1223
01:26:59,462 --> 01:27:03,626
No, I expected you wouldn't go.

1224
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:07,268
You know, one scene a day is quite my limit.

1225
01:27:08,304 --> 01:27:10,568
I mention this because
there is that about you...

1226
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,970
...that suggests one of your peculiar moods.

1227
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:17,738
Excuse me. I've laid out your dress coat in
your room. Your other things are in the hall.

1228
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:20,382
All right. You can
stay out as late as you please.

1229
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,677
If it's really all right, sir.

1230
01:27:22,852 --> 01:27:25,753
Thank you, sir. Good
night, sir. Good night, ma'am.

1231
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:26,980
Good night, Jimmy.

1232
01:27:28,424 --> 01:27:30,858
He has a lady friend.
Slightly furtive about it.

1233
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:34,993
Extraordinary how people try
to keep their little secrets...

1234
01:27:35,164 --> 01:27:36,563
...which can never be kept.

1235
01:27:36,732 --> 01:27:40,600
But of course, you think they
can, don't you? Well, you'll find out.

1236
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,897
Are you sure you won't have a drink?

1237
01:27:43,072 --> 01:27:44,562
No, thank you.

1238
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:48,141
Well, personally, I intend to
have as much as is good for me.

1239
01:27:51,214 --> 01:27:52,841
And I'll tell you exactly why.

1240
01:27:53,015 --> 01:27:58,180
First of all, I'm unusually nervous
tonight. What's more, I'm worn-out.

1241
01:27:58,354 --> 01:28:04,122
Rehearsals, fuss, temperament, not even
an appetite for dinner, if you please.

1242
01:28:04,293 --> 01:28:05,851
Moreover...

1243
01:28:07,864 --> 01:28:10,196
Do you believe in premonitions?

1244
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:14,530
- Premonitions?
- Yes.

1245
01:28:14,704 --> 01:28:18,105
You know, I've always had
a great sense of tomorrow.

1246
01:28:18,274 --> 01:28:23,234
I mean, when I'm dressing or
eating or brushing my teeth...

1247
01:28:23,412 --> 01:28:27,075
...at the back of my mind, there's
something else going on, you know.

1248
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:31,550
I find that I'm thinking about
what I'll be doing next Saturday...

1249
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:36,215
...or next month or next year.
In a vague kind of way, I mean.

1250
01:28:36,392 --> 01:28:37,859
Well...

1251
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:44,027
...tonight, before you came, I
was aware of something missing.

1252
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:49,133
I realized I wasn't thinking of
next month or even next Saturday.

1253
01:28:49,772 --> 01:28:52,570
When I tried to think of
them, nothing came. Heh.

1254
01:28:52,742 --> 01:28:55,302
It sounds absurd but I
found it most disconcerting.

1255
01:28:57,146 --> 01:29:01,173
- So you're afraid of death, Alex?
- Devilishly.

1256
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:06,581
They say never confess a weakness
to a woman but I am, devilishly.

1257
01:29:06,756 --> 01:29:08,951
You've a lot to lose.

1258
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:12,117
Well, it's true. I've
lost a great deal already.

1259
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:15,959
To pretend otherwise would
be extremely ungracious of me.

1260
01:29:17,433 --> 01:29:20,596
Did you mean what you
said today after rehearsal?

1261
01:29:21,437 --> 01:29:23,997
You mean when I called you
an offensive imbecile? Yes.

1262
01:29:24,173 --> 01:29:26,869
No. When you said you were going tell Karel.

1263
01:29:29,312 --> 01:29:31,075
Christine...

1264
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,210
...I'm extremely tired of this subject.
- Did you mean it?

1265
01:29:34,383 --> 01:29:39,377
Judge for yourself. I don't wish to be
rude but I'd rather listen to Beethoven.

1266
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:41,654
Promise you won't.

1267
01:29:41,824 --> 01:29:44,622
This is one of those occasions
when my nerves are taut...

1268
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:48,054
...when foolery drives me very nearly mad.

1269
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:50,494
You must promise me.

1270
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:53,396
Could you believe me if I promised?

1271
01:29:56,405 --> 01:29:57,963
I'm going upstairs for my coat.

1272
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:55,330
What the devil...?

1273
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,936
What's the matter with you?

1274
01:31:07,677 --> 01:31:10,043
What in heaven's name have you got there?

1275
01:31:10,212 --> 01:31:14,114
You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.

1276
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:16,776
For my protection, you said.

1277
01:31:16,952 --> 01:31:20,479
You give me that nonsensical object.
I've seen this sort of thing before.

1278
01:31:20,656 --> 01:31:22,146
- Give it to me.
- You keep away.

1279
01:31:22,324 --> 01:31:25,088
Don't you try to intimidate me.

1280
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:26,888
You are not going to tell Karel.

1281
01:31:27,229 --> 01:31:29,561
You are not going to see
him after the performance.

1282
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:32,724
You're not ever going to see
him again. Swear to me you won't.

1283
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:38,135
I'll swear nothing. I'll do what I please,
see whom I please, say what I please.

1284
01:31:44,113 --> 01:31:46,013
You fool.

1285
01:31:46,348 --> 01:31:48,839
You cowardly, hysterical fool.

1286
01:31:50,753 --> 01:31:52,744
You and your...

1287
01:34:15,464 --> 01:34:17,056
Ladies and gentlemen.

1288
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:20,964
The management regrets to announce
that Mr. Hollenius has not yet arrived.

1289
01:34:22,004 --> 01:34:28,239
Since his new cello concerto is being
broadcast from this hall at 9:30...

1290
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:32,744
...Mr. Neilsen has kindly
consented to conduct in his place.

1291
01:35:45,554 --> 01:35:47,146
Mrs. Novak.

1292
01:35:47,323 --> 01:35:50,952
Mrs. Novak. You haven't heard
anything about Mr. Hollenius, have you?

1293
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:52,218
Isn't he here?

1294
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:54,362
No, Mr. Neilsen's taken over.

1295
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,897
Well, I saw him in his
home just a short while ago.

1296
01:35:58,067 --> 01:35:59,830
What could have happened?

1297
01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:03,165
I haven't the slightest idea, Mr. Swansen.

1298
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:08,547
- Congratulations, Mr. Novak.
- Thank you.

1299
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:10,651
Well, Mr. Novak, it isn't very often...

1300
01:40:10,819 --> 01:40:13,049
...that New York gives a
newcomer a reception like that.

1301
01:40:13,222 --> 01:40:16,817
- It was brilliant. A superb performance.
- Thank you, you're very kind.

1302
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:20,723
It is a relief that the absence of the
composer didn't affect your performance.

1303
01:40:20,896 --> 01:40:22,921
Uh, did you find out
what happened to Hollenius?

1304
01:40:23,098 --> 01:40:26,625
- I've been phoning his home. No answer.
- Karel.

1305
01:40:27,302 --> 01:40:28,963
Schatzi.

1306
01:40:29,137 --> 01:40:32,402
In 16 years, I've never heard
such a brilliant cellist.

1307
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:35,134
We must give him a return engagement.

1308
01:40:35,577 --> 01:40:37,977
Mrs. Novak, you must be
very proud of your husband.

1309
01:40:38,146 --> 01:40:39,943
I am indeed.

1310
01:40:40,115 --> 01:40:44,415
Would you forgive me if I borrowed
my husband for just a moment?

1311
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:46,747
Why, certainly.

1312
01:40:52,794 --> 01:40:53,954
Well...

1313
01:40:54,129 --> 01:40:56,029
...was it worthwhile?

1314
01:40:56,765 --> 01:40:58,733
Worthwhile?

1315
01:40:59,534 --> 01:41:00,558
Yes.

1316
01:41:00,736 --> 01:41:03,466
Schatzi, this means
a new life for both of us.

1317
01:41:03,639 --> 01:41:05,266
Have you ever heard such applause?

1318
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,738
I want to play this
concerto all over the world.

1319
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:10,343
Can't you see us going
from one place to another?

1320
01:41:10,512 --> 01:41:13,037
Taking it with us, giving
it to people everywhere.

1321
01:41:13,215 --> 01:41:15,342
Yes, our troubles are over.

1322
01:41:15,517 --> 01:41:17,246
Thanks to Hollenius.

1323
01:41:17,419 --> 01:41:20,718
Have you any idea what happened
to him that he didn't come tonight?

1324
01:41:21,356 --> 01:41:25,850
I have something rather distressing
to tell you about Hollenius.

1325
01:41:26,028 --> 01:41:27,928
Distressing? What is it?

1326
01:41:28,096 --> 01:41:33,056
Well, after you left he telephoned
and asked me to come by for him.

1327
01:41:33,235 --> 01:41:36,762
So that's what made you
so late. He's not ill, is he?

1328
01:41:36,938 --> 01:41:40,374
When I got there, he was in a strange mood.

1329
01:41:40,542 --> 01:41:44,273
He'd been drinking, not like himself...

1330
01:41:44,446 --> 01:41:46,573
...like a savage.

1331
01:41:46,748 --> 01:41:51,515
He talked about... About death.

1332
01:41:52,087 --> 01:41:56,922
His death in the strangest way imaginable.

1333
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:02,259
And well, and then...

1334
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:03,864
...he told me he loved me.

1335
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:06,262
- What?
- There's no need to be angry, Karel.

1336
01:42:06,435 --> 01:42:10,337
It was nothing you could have
minded, nothing of that sort at all.

1337
01:42:10,505 --> 01:42:13,474
He spoke about, I don't know...

1338
01:42:13,642 --> 01:42:17,544
...about giving up, going
away, abroad perhaps.

1339
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:21,279
It seemed that he suddenly realized,
when he heard about our marriage...

1340
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:25,352
...that it was all a delusion, being
a teacher and a father and all that...

1341
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,286
...and he had found out
that he was in love with me.

1342
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:31,085
And what did you say to that?

1343
01:42:31,259 --> 01:42:34,558
Well, I tried to treat it lightly
but it seems that was a mistake.

1344
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,254
- Why?
- It seemed to drive him mad.

1345
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:41,198
He shouted something like, "I'll
show you." And rushed upstairs.

1346
01:42:42,104 --> 01:42:43,594
And, well, then I...

1347
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,935
This was very silly.

1348
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:49,806
I got frightened.

1349
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:55,214
The house seemed so empty and so strange...

1350
01:42:55,717 --> 01:42:58,185
...as if something were about to happen.

1351
01:42:59,454 --> 01:43:01,479
I ran away.

1352
01:43:01,656 --> 01:43:05,854
As I slammed the front door behind me
I had the impression he was calling me.

1353
01:43:06,027 --> 01:43:09,155
Standing on the stairs, shouting after me.

1354
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,690
A taxi was passing...

1355
01:43:14,736 --> 01:43:16,727
...I stopped it...

1356
01:43:17,372 --> 01:43:18,999
...and came here.

1357
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:30,909
Why did he choose tonight of all
nights to make such a fool of himself?

1358
01:43:31,553 --> 01:43:34,113
When everything was going so well.

1359
01:43:36,925 --> 01:43:40,417
I suppose I can't blame him
for being in love with you.

1360
01:43:44,232 --> 01:43:45,756
But, Schatzi...

1361
01:43:46,168 --> 01:43:48,534
...don't you see what this means?

1362
01:43:48,703 --> 01:43:51,365
Now I understand why he behaved
like that at our wedding.

1363
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,734
Why he broke the glass.

1364
01:43:52,908 --> 01:43:56,400
This proves everything,
everything you told me.

1365
01:43:56,745 --> 01:43:58,212
So...

1366
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,473
...it took this to make you believe me?

1367
01:44:00,649 --> 01:44:02,879
I was a jealous fool.

1368
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:07,044
You don't know how many ways jealous
people can torment themselves.

1369
01:44:11,226 --> 01:44:12,887
Forgive me.

1370
01:44:14,896 --> 01:44:18,195
It's nothing. Nothing at all.

1371
01:44:19,601 --> 01:44:23,264
It's finished and done with.

1372
01:44:23,772 --> 01:44:28,869
And you're not going to be jealous anymore,
because you know it was all nonsense.

1373
01:44:29,044 --> 01:44:31,274
And you're a success.

1374
01:44:31,947 --> 01:44:35,576
And you can live as you like...

1375
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,843
...and play what you like...

1376
01:44:38,019 --> 01:44:40,385
...and have anything you want.

1377
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:43,424
Even your mountain.

1378
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:48,694
I think we ought to go by and see him.

1379
01:44:51,132 --> 01:44:53,293
- To his house?
- Yes, of course.

1380
01:44:54,102 --> 01:44:57,299
Come. We'll say good night to our
friends outside and we go there...

1381
01:44:57,472 --> 01:44:58,871
No.

1382
01:44:59,808 --> 01:45:01,070
Karel, I don't want to.

1383
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:03,239
I know it's embarrassing for you.

1384
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:07,040
But we three should be able to
understand one another better than that.

1385
01:45:07,215 --> 01:45:10,116
one extreme or another. This
morning you were at daggers drawn.

1386
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:12,310
And now it's absolute adoration.

1387
01:45:12,487 --> 01:45:14,682
You seem to forget how
badly he's treated you.

1388
01:45:14,856 --> 01:45:18,792
- I don't forget he gave me the concerto.
- Because you are the best person to play it.

1389
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,589
He gave it to me because of you.
Because I needed it so badly.

1390
01:45:22,764 --> 01:45:24,891
He drove you nearly mad through that dinner.

1391
01:45:25,066 --> 01:45:27,057
And quite mad at the audition afterwards.

1392
01:45:27,235 --> 01:45:30,568
Yes, it is maddening to
realize that one isn't perfect.

1393
01:45:30,739 --> 01:45:33,105
But I wasn't, I'd lost
too many years for that.

1394
01:45:33,275 --> 01:45:36,335
But, Karel. Karel, you don't
know how malicious he was.

1395
01:45:36,511 --> 01:45:40,174
Yes, and sadistic, arrogant
and heaven knows what.

1396
01:45:40,348 --> 01:45:43,283
But what of it? He's a great artist.

1397
01:45:43,451 --> 01:45:45,976
- But you don't know about Gribble.
- Gribble?

1398
01:45:47,322 --> 01:45:51,383
The understudy. Yes, yes,
that was funny, wasn't it?

1399
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,925
Yes.

1400
01:45:53,094 --> 01:45:55,221
Yes, that was funny.

1401
01:45:55,397 --> 01:45:57,058
What about him?

1402
01:46:01,169 --> 01:46:02,898
What about him?

1403
01:46:03,471 --> 01:46:04,938
Nothing.

1404
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:09,442
Nothing, I suppose. That's right.

1405
01:46:11,513 --> 01:46:13,947
He was just the understudy.

1406
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:24,425
He said if he wanted to, he could break us.

1407
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:30,429
If he wanted to, he could break us.

1408
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:35,133
That's right, he said if...

1409
01:46:36,237 --> 01:46:37,795
If he wanted to.

1410
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,405
If.

1411
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:46,205
Why do you look at me like that?

1412
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:52,518
Karel, you do love me, don't you?

1413
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:55,053
It wasn't altogether for nothing, was it?

1414
01:46:55,223 --> 01:46:58,158
- What was for nothing?
- I killed him.

1415
01:47:00,228 --> 01:47:01,627
No.

1416
01:47:01,896 --> 01:47:03,056
No.

1417
01:47:03,231 --> 01:47:04,289
Tonight.

1418
01:47:04,466 --> 01:47:09,904
All the time, since you first asked me
about him, I've told you nothing but lies.

1419
01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:11,962
You mean...

1420
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,404
...you and Hollenius?

1421
01:47:15,477 --> 01:47:21,973
One lie, one small lie at first,
to be explained next day I thought.

1422
01:47:22,183 --> 01:47:24,674
And then it was nothing but lies.

1423
01:47:24,853 --> 01:47:27,014
You see, I thought you'd
leave me if you knew.

1424
01:47:27,188 --> 01:47:30,885
I thought you'd give up the concert.
I thought you'd have nothing.

1425
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:35,689
But to kill him, how
could you? How could you?

1426
01:47:37,732 --> 01:47:39,529
I don't know.

1427
01:47:39,701 --> 01:47:41,464
I don't know.

1428
01:47:43,672 --> 01:47:46,106
I thought he meant to ruin us.

1429
01:47:46,441 --> 01:47:48,807
Today after the rehearsal...

1430
01:47:48,977 --> 01:47:51,104
...he threatened to tell you about us.

1431
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:53,338
I was sure he meant to.

1432
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:56,211
I was wrong. I see that now.

1433
01:47:57,419 --> 01:47:59,444
He always told me...

1434
01:47:59,621 --> 01:48:05,082
...I'd be afraid of him and of
you until I told you the truth.

1435
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:11,192
I went there tonight to beg
him not to tell you about us.

1436
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:13,891
To threaten him that if he did, I'd...

1437
01:48:14,436 --> 01:48:16,666
He said he'd do as he pleased.

1438
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:21,606
So I shot him.

1439
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:25,877
And then I thought...

1440
01:48:26,247 --> 01:48:29,410
...if I made it look as though
he'd done it himself, I...

1441
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:35,182
The concert's over. They're waiting for you.

1442
01:48:35,824 --> 01:48:38,952
Darling, I heard you play
tonight. That's all that matters.

1443
01:48:39,127 --> 01:48:41,095
That's what you've got to hold on to.

1444
01:48:41,262 --> 01:48:44,720
What I am or was doesn't
matter compared to that.

1445
01:48:44,899 --> 01:48:48,198
Let me go out of your life. Forget me.

1446
01:48:49,471 --> 01:48:51,439
No one saw you leave?

1447
01:48:54,843 --> 01:48:56,367
No.

1448
01:48:56,945 --> 01:48:58,913
So if you say nothing...

1449
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:01,446
...if you let them think what they like...

1450
01:49:03,985 --> 01:49:05,748
No, Karel.

1451
01:49:06,221 --> 01:49:08,689
How could we have a life together?

1452
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:13,126
We could never look at one another again.

1453
01:49:17,232 --> 01:49:18,665
No.

1454
01:49:23,004 --> 01:49:25,404
I must go to the police.

1455
01:49:27,408 --> 01:49:31,401
I beg you, think it over till the
morning. Till we can talk to a lawyer.

1456
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:36,380
It matters so much what you tell
them. These things have to be planned.

1457
01:49:36,551 --> 01:49:38,041
I've planned everything up to now.

1458
01:49:39,387 --> 01:49:41,116
- Mr. Novak?
- See what it's brought us?

1459
01:49:42,757 --> 01:49:45,419
They're getting impatient, Karel.

1460
01:49:51,266 --> 01:49:53,427
Remember the other dressing room?

1461
01:49:55,303 --> 01:49:57,601
Then I had just found you.

1462
01:49:59,274 --> 01:50:00,707
Now I...

1463
01:50:03,278 --> 01:50:04,745
You'll never lose me.

1464
01:50:06,247 --> 01:50:08,078
Strange...

1465
01:50:08,249 --> 01:50:11,980
...in all the weeks we've been
together, we've never been so close.

1466
01:50:15,123 --> 01:50:17,114
We must go, Karel.

1467
01:50:17,725 --> 01:50:19,158
Yes.

1468
01:50:22,964 --> 01:50:24,727
Forgive me.

1469
01:50:35,143 --> 01:50:36,735
- Magnificent.
- Wonderful.

1470
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:38,970
- Nice.
- Karel, you were wonderful.

1471
01:50:39,147 --> 01:50:40,614
What a splendid performance.

1472
01:50:40,782 --> 01:50:42,977
I haven't heard
anything as fine in years.

1473
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:44,243
Good night, Mr. Swansen.

1474
01:50:44,419 --> 01:50:46,683
If you and Mrs. Novak are
not engaged for supper...

1475
01:50:46,855 --> 01:50:50,018
I'm afraid we can't. As a matter
of fact, we have to leave at once.

1476
01:50:50,191 --> 01:50:52,386
- That's too bad.
- I'm extremely sorry.

1477
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,825
Well, I want to thank
you all for your kindness.

1478
01:50:55,997 --> 01:50:57,191
I really have to go.

1479
01:50:57,365 --> 01:50:59,060
- Good night.
- Good night. Good night.

1480
01:51:01,636 --> 01:51:03,934
It was wonderful, it
was absolutely wonderful.

1481
01:51:04,105 --> 01:51:06,938
I wouldn't have missed
it for a thousand dollars.

1482
01:51:07,108 --> 01:51:08,973
Thank you, Mr. Gribble.

1483
01:51:09,744 --> 01:51:13,475
Christine, you must be the
happiest woman in the world.
