1
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,431
Good morning, Quark.

2
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,165
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara...

3
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,210
...to ask me if I had a date to the dance.

4
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,713
No, they broke up for religious differences.

5
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,362
She thought she was God
and he disagreed.

6
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,012
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.

7
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,764
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.

8
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,954
Maybe. Yeah.

9
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,480
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around
a while and keep an eye on Nick.

10
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,669
He likes to take things apart.

11
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,739
Well, that's why I watch it at your
house. Things'll cool off after today.

12
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,477
Dad has his big show-and-tell at the lab.

13
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,807
Zap.

14
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,837
It works. I-It really works.
- Nick, get real.

15
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,793
The subject has disappeared.

16
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,519
No, no, it's not that.

17
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,565
No. Mom and Dad had
an argument last night...

18
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,552
...and Mom spent the night at Grandma's.

19
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,596
I think she just needed a rest.

20
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,785
Right, her and me both.

21
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,362
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.

22
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,753
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

23
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,271
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

24
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,407
If only Dad could get that machine to work.

25
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,623
Breakfast.

26
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,445
I need a couple minutes here.

27
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,838
'I'll be down in five minutes.'

28
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,763
Typing with his gloves on again.

29
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,334
Oh, no, not again.

30
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,119
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?

31
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,633
Szalinski, give it a rest.
It's Saturday.

32
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,954
It's construction, honey. You of
all people should understand that.

33
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:55,251
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

34
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,587
And I think he should have
consideration for other people.

35
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,562
Mm, give the guy a break.

36
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,946
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm.

37
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,117
Honey.

38
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,475
Szalinski.

39
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,602
But, honey, you are much bigger than he is.

40
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,541
Szalinski.

41
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,066
Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.

42
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,068
Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?

43
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,738
Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod.

44
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,214
Stop. Dad.

45
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,829
Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.

46
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,999
Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

47
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,800
Super Glue.
- Super Glue?

48
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:39,253
Gotta mark those trespassers, Dad.

49
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father.
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.

50
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,134
Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

51
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,762
What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

52
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,457
Attila the Hun was 12 once, too, you know.

53
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,684
Oh, come on.

54
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,873
He's sounding.

55
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,128
Weird family.

56
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,373
Dad?

57
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,459
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?

58
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,714
That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.

59
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,259
If you took all the molecules in this house...

60
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,634
Listen, Nick, I gotta get

61
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,752
Why don't you go help your sister?

62
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,182
Stay back, boy.
This thing works...

63
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,185
...this'll put us up there with
the invention of electricity...

64
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,160
...first man in space.

65
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,336
First dog in space.

66
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,503
Come on. Shrink.

67
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,169
Shrink.

68
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,102
Please, please, shrink.

69
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,276
Please, shrink.

70
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:07,282
On the other hand, we've come up with an
interesting way of making applesauce.

71
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,034
You got it, honey.
- Sure?

72
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:11,781
Positive.

73
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,119
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

74
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:21,207
Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.

75
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,397
Darn right.

76
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,256
Well, look who's decided to
join the land of the living.

77
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,050
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

78
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,942
Not really, Dad.
- Not really?

79
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,973
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

80
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,179
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.

81
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,064
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?

82
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,444
There... I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

83
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,826
Russell, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was cut from...

84
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,989
...the football team yesterday.

85
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,789
What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't...

86
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,409
...need right now is to hear from you.

87
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,511
He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...

88
00:09:58,615 --> 00:09:59,329
Captain of the team.

89
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,956
And if my father'd wanted me to go on
a fishing trip, I would've been gra...

90
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,834
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.

91
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,628
He is not too small for football.

92
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,506
Honey, when you say things like that,
you make him feel about this big.

93
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:14,333
If he wants to feel big,
he should act big.

94
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,324
Elbows up.

95
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,939
What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.

96
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,129
No toxic waste.
- Fine.

97
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,258
Here, Quark.

98
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,098
Eat it, Dad,
before it gets cold.

99
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,960
Mm, did you get the machine to work?

100
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,297
Yeah. A few more bugs to get out, but...

101
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,565
What about the conference?
- Meow.

102
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,763
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

103
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,651
Dad. Dad, wait. Dad.

104
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,936
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

105
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,605
Dad, don't forget my dress from
the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...

106
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,691
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.

107
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:14,226
Wish me luck. I need luck
getting out of this door.

108
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,758
House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.

109
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,789
Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.

110
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,417
He's just leaving for the conference.

111
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,012
Dad, it's Mom.

112
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,188
Where?
- On the phone.

113
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,298
Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?

114
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,428
Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.

115
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,431
Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.

116
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,558
I'm gonna meet him at the mall later today.

117
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,747
Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

118
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,947
Hiya.
- Hi.

119
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:47,645
Nick.

120
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,083
I called to wish you luck at the conference.

121
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,858
Look, Diane, if things go well...

122
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,694
...this morning, everything'll change
around here, I promise you.

123
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,550
Okay. I have a house to show...

124
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,907
...and then I'll be home this
afternoon and we'll talk.

125
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,009
Good luck today.
- Thanks. Bye, honey.

126
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,719
What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make...

127
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,166
...this place spick-and-span, okay?

128
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,815
Nick, I want you to mow the lawn. Amy...

129
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,316
...good luck.

130
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,104
I'm helping my Dad with this
real important new invention.

131
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,996
So, mm...

132
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,069
I'll... I'll let you mow half my yard.

133
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,258
No, thanks.

134
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,783
Wow. With that?

135
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,785
Yeah...

136
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,536
...and...

137
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,726
...this.

138
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,991
Oh, it's a remote control.

139
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,548
Tell you what. You thrown in
a box of cookies...

140
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,134
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

141
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,138
Uh, but I have to go
and meet Newt right now.

142
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,532
Uh, could I do it later?

143
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,538
I don't think so, because, you know,
my Dad's gonna come home and...

144
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:12,355
Aw, come on.

145
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,775
Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.

146
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,501
No problem.
- See you later.

147
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,550
Nothin' like a hard day's work.

148
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,814
French fries.

149
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,104
Tater Sticks.

150
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,863
Meat loaf.

151
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,188
Veal 'parmedjian.'

152
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,138
Hey, Dad, wanna go play some baseball?

153
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,113
Hmm, baseball.

154
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:52,290
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

155
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,245
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

156
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,793
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

157
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,353
Nope.

158
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,098
Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.

159
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,346
Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald.

160
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,535
Lug your stuff.

161
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,704
Later, worm.

162
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,165
Russell, gimme a hand here.

163
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,176
Russell. Gimme a hand here.

164
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,841
Dad, it's early.

165
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,565
The early worm catches the fish, Russell.

166
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,188
Remember that.

167
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:02,783
The Forresters are coming by after
lunch, so come on. Quick march.

168
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:25,379
Something here between us
is something that I can't resist

169
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:33,464
A physical attraction
Feel it every time we kiss

170
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,644
Weird family.

171
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:40,436
Oh, you got me so excited
Still it's not enough

172
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:45,352
I'm gonna try to fight it
till I know if this is love

173
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,531
Turn it up...

174
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,823
Yeah.
- Turn it up, ooh hoo

175
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,740
I love to hear

176
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,292
Russell...

177
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,358
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today...

178
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,447
...but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.

179
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,896
I know, Dad. You've told me
about a million times.

180
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,242
All right. Just hear me out.

181
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,620
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.

182
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:19,083
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds
of pure, unadulterated...

183
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,503
...blitz-the-quarterback
and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

184
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:27,717
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months...

185
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,346
...you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster...

186
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,122
...and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

187
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,684
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.

188
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,178
Um, Dad, you... you know that
weights aren't my thing.

189
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,895
Fishing isn't your thing.

190
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,420
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

191
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,686
I don't know, but I'll keep you posted, okay?

192
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,574
Fine. Until you do,
you're trying these.

193
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,485
And you're coming fishing
with the family. Is that clear?

194
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,163
I can't hear you.

195
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,928
Yes, sir.

196
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,384
Better.

197
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,726
Now, uh, lift with your legs,
not with your back.

198
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,269
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

199
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,524
Russell, you're not smoking
a cigarette, are you?

200
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,908
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

201
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,293
Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

202
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,304
Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?

203
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:29,964
Tubular.

204
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,760
He's only 12, and he's already
thinking about construction.

205
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:40,245
Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.

206
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,734
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of
the ninth. It's a clutch situation.

207
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,880
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.

208
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,617
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh.

209
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,286
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

210
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,498
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.

211
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,687
Grand...

212
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,733
...slam.

213
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,176
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

214
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,431
Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.

215
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,554
Nobody saw it but you.

216
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,891
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.

217
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,186
You're not supposed to fink
on your own brother.

218
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,022
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that
you spend your allowance on... Uuh.

219
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,212
Come on, Russ.

220
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,420
Look, either you tell them
or I tell them, okay?

221
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,845
Okay. You tell 'em.

222
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,225
Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...

223
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,885
Tell them.

224
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,402
What's going on?
- Hi. Um...

225
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,476
I-I'm Russ Thompson from next door, uh...

226
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,270
Um...

227
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,648
Uh, my brother has something to
tell you, or else I could tell her.

228
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,943
Okay. See, I was playing
with my ball, right?

229
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,362
Well... Well, actually,
it's not my ball exactly.

230
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,239
It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.

231
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,743
It never would've happened
if their house wasn't so close.

232
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,869
He hit a baseball
through your attic window.

233
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:24,370
He what?

234
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:27,498
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day.

235
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,226
We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take
it out of his allowance, all right?

236
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,336
My allowance? Dream on.

237
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,088
Okay, we'll just have Dad pay for it, huh?

238
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,341
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.

239
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,281
Until you pay,
no man shall pass.

240
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,045
You got nothin' to say about it, space boy.

241
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:43,723
Cool it.

242
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,809
Nick, take him upstairs and get him
his ball. And clean up the mess.

243
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,109
What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't...

244
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,694
...have time to mess around.

245
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:57,403
Come on. This is what's wrong with
the American system of justice.

246
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:01,256
So, y... You like to dance, huh?

247
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,423
How do you know?
- Well...

248
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,373
You could see me?
- No.

249
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:13,617
Uh, no, I... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. I...

250
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,174
Awesome.

251
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,798
So your Dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

252
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,899
And given that my machine can
substantially reduce...

253
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:40,627
...the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies...

254
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,449
...the savings to the space programme
would be staggering.

255
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,827
Mr. Szalinski, are you trying to tell me that...

256
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,413
...suddenly size is no longer relative?

257
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,665
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is...

258
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,042
...made up of not only density,
but of empty space.

259
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:55,545
And if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space...

260
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,506
...in any given object, we can
thereby shrink the object.

261
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,695
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?

262
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,139
When Einstein came up with
the atomic bomb, did they ask...

263
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,346
...him to prove that it worked?

264
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,907
You, Mr. Szalinski,
are hardly Einstein.

265
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,665
I picked a name.
- You have, however,

266
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,230
managed to shrink one thing...

267
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,566
...the size of this audience.

268
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,431
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know
about you, but I'm going to lunch.

269
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,225
Wayne. Wayne.

270
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,916
Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

271
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,587
It will take time to convince
people without proof.

272
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,261
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

273
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,260
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

274
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,180
The extension cord was a bad idea.

275
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:53,134
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.

276
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,751
Nick.

277
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:58,818
Nick...
- Ron?

278
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,401
if you guys are hiding up here...

279
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,664
...it's not funny.

280
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,906
Nick, you know what Dad said.

281
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,733
You're not supposed to be playing up here.

282
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,935
Where are we?

283
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,022
God, what happened?

284
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,774
Amy.
- Russ.

285
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,330
Amy.

286
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,509
Nicky.
- Ron?

287
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:53,371
Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers.

288
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,849
Be quiet, Quark.

289
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,588
Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball.

290
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,841
Shut up, wimp.
- We have to get Dad.

291
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,030
He'll know what to do.

292
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:14,022
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

293
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,785
Can somebody get that?

294
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,425
What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

295
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,880
Amy? Nick?

296
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,018
Hello?

297
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,148
It's not for you.

298
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,522
What is it, Quark?

299
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,853
Nick.

300
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,845
Listen.
- Are you guys home?

301
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,181
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

302
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,858
Mr. Szalinski. Up here.

303
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,519
Up here, Dad.
- Quick, over there by the door.

304
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,189
Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?

305
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:04,306
Nick.
- Get off and give us a hand.

306
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,674
Nick? Amy?

307
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,207
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

308
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,718
Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack.

309
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,849
Hurry up. He's coming.

310
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,750
Right here.
- Szalinski.

311
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,940
Dad. Dad.

312
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,333
Down here.
- Help.

313
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,844
Help.
- Help.

314
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,990
Help.

315
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,479
Where's my couch?

316
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,424
What is he, deaf?

317
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:14,048
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.

318
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,080
Dad.

319
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,422
I don't believe this.

320
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,779
What a day.

321
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,969
Ow.

322
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,347
This is all your fault.

323
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,330
Five years...
- No, Dad, it works.

324
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,377
Szalinski, don't do it.
- No. Mr. Szalinski.

325
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:42,665
Dad.

326
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,855
You don't even work.

327
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,940
Don't.

328
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,071
Run.
- Run.

329
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,027
Run, Nicky. Keep up.

330
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,373
Dad.

331
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:12,575
Stay there.
There's glass everywhere here now.

332
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,927
No.
- Dad. Run, Nicky.

333
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,928
No. Back the other way.

334
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,535
Go.

335
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,194
Help.
- Help.

336
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,954
No.

337
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,596
Help. Somebody.

338
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,239
Not now, Quark.

339
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,357
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash
the same day they get ours?

340
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,067
Ow. Nick?

341
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,321
I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?

342
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,157
I don't know, but I'm not waitin'
around to find out. Move over.

343
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,096
Ow. Watch it.
- Look out.

344
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,571
Oh, my God.

345
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,924
Reminds me of the backyard.

346
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,309
Something tells me we're
not going fishing this weekend.

347
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:10,021
That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

348
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,231
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?

349
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,123
I... I think so.

350
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,446
Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.

351
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,296
I'm never goin' back to your house.
I'm goin' home.

352
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,140
Come on, Russ.

353
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,396
Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

354
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,213
Could your Dad help us?
- Russ. We're supposed to go fishing.

355
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,774
Yeah, right.
How are you going, as bait?

356
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,568
What a witch.

357
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,790
Russ, you comin' down, or what?

358
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,096
Well, we can't stay here.

359
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:04,501
Well, I think we should stick together.

360
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,719
Well, come on.

361
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,064
Nicky.

362
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,026
I don't think we're
in Kansas any more, Toto.

363
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,004
I don't think we're in
the food chain any more, Dorothy.

364
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,662
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.

365
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:54,310
What? You let a girl tell you what to do?

366
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,878
Look, Ron, down here,
you're gonna listen to me.

367
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:01,027
From now on, you're gonna
do what I say. Run.

368
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,860
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

369
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:23,751
Knock it off, Ron.

370
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,282
We're now a quarter of an inch tall...

371
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,755
...and 64 feet from the house.

372
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:33,680
That's the equivalent of 3.2 miles.

373
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,668
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

374
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:41,673
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,
get big and get to the mall.

375
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:43,862
Now get moving.

376
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:50,034
That butterfly had a wingspan of 42 feet.

377
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,204
Nick.

378
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,157
Hi.

379
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,347
Hi.

380
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,287
Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...

381
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,415
I sold a house.
- Really? That's great.

382
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,710
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

383
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,337
I only had to show it to them 12 times.

384
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:25,425
How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.

385
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,635
Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.

386
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,098
I-I... I'm just gonna get my old job
back, if I can get my old job back.

387
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,517
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

388
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,707
Different.

389
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,751
Right.

390
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,506
Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them...

391
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,945
...since I left this morning.

392
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:49,160
Well, did you tell them I was coming home?

393
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:50,408
Yeah, that's why

394
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:54,501
I see. Oh, they're probably just at the mall.

395
00:32:56,643 --> 00:33:00,209
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

396
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,973
The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:16,643
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags us...

398
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:20,365
Nick, don't you ever pick up your toys?

399
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:24,207
What a wimp.
- Been looking for that guy.

400
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,459
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.

401
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,849
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,

402
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:37,163
but it's years to the rest of the world?

403
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,957
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

404
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,669
Impossible. Time doesn't exist,
except as a...

405
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,005
Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?

406
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,231
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,

407
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,637
and it'd look like a river to us.

408
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,493
Let's swim it.

409
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:02,402
Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

410
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,984
Hey. Hey, if we could get some rope...

411
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,747
...we could make a log bridge.

412
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,236
If... If we... If we had some logs.

413
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,496
Quark.
- Your dog?

414
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,091
Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.

415
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,167
Yeah, he can.
Dogs have great ears.

416
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:26,504
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

417
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,694
Whistle.

418
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,209
What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

419
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,548
Let's get higher up.

420
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:58,562
You know how to whistle. You just
put your lips together and blow.

421
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:11,424
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

422
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,614
Let's climb.

423
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,434
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

424
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,855
Just have Amy call me if
you hear from her. Thanks.

425
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,901
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at
the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.

426
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,487
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

427
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,579
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.

428
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,432
Nick, be careful.

429
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,438
Yes, Mother.

430
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,609
I'll go up with them.

431
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,167
It's Quark.

432
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,566
Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?

433
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,778
It's that stupid cat of theirs.
- Our cat is not stupid.

434
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:17,865
It just chased Quark away.
- It's Russ' stupid cat.

435
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,802
Hang on, Nick.
- I can't. I'm slipping.

436
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,598
Nicky.

437
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:29,102
Nicky. Get out of there.

438
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,859
You're allergic to pollen.

439
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,560
It's too big.

440
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,490
I'm too little to breathe it in.

441
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,398
Diane.

442
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,358
Hi, Mae.

443
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,528
We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.

444
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:58,573
You haven't seen Ronnie
or Russ, have you?

445
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,826
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.

446
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,329
If you see them, would you
send them home right away?

447
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:08,067
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing if you see mine.

448
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,462
Russell, the Szalinski kids are missing too.

449
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,214
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

450
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,508
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

451
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,469
Ronald?

452
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,658
Russell?

453
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,082
Amy?

454
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,710
Nick?

455
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,777
Amy?

456
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,717
What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.

457
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,918
Sounds more like a swarm of...

458
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,683
Bees.

459
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,893
Amy. Get him off of me.
- Nicky.

460
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,554
Get him away.
- Hold on, Nick.

461
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:01,982
Russ.
- Nicky.

462
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,992
Nick, give me your hand.

463
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,651
Nick, hold on.
- Russ.

464
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:13,147
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault.

465
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,265
Shut up.
My brother's up there too.

466
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:19,083
Help.

467
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,297
Russ, don't let go.

468
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:26,140
Hold on.

469
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,857
Help.

470
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,765
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go
to the mall and look for the kids.

471
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,560
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back?

472
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,749
Okay.

473
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,878
Hey, Szalinski.

474
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,695
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

475
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,824
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

476
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,661
You know, the jungles
are receding everywhere.

477
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,851
Dad.

478
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:16,216
Don't.
- Stop. Stop, please. We're on the bee.

479
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,214
Wh... Where is it? Come on.

480
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,953
Stop. Don't kill us.
- Dad, don't kill us.

481
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,690
Stop it. Whoa.

482
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,455
Hold on, Nick.
We're goin' down.

483
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,511
Wayne...

484
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,619
...if the Boorsteins come by,
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

485
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,382
You think you can handle that?

486
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,834
There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

487
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,778
Wait a second.

488
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,505
Nick doesn't play baseball.

489
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,518
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.

490
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,520
This is all a bad dream.

491
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,523
Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare.

492
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,858
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.

493
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:23,632
I'm warning you.

494
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:29,546
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.

495
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,204
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

496
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:37,436
But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow.

497
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,308
Get up.

498
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,672
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

499
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:46,942
Yeah, I hope your face
ends up on a milk carton.

500
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,698
My chair.

501
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,589
My couch.

502
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,596
It works.

503
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,264
Nick? Amy?

504
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,442
Can you hear me?

505
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,237
Nick.

506
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,209
Mm-hmm.

507
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,551
Nick.

508
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,731
Nick.

509
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,362
Nick?

510
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,361
Are you okay?

511
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:01,279
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

512
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,500
It didn't take too long.

513
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,339
I'm scared, Russ.

514
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,972
We could be anywhere now.

515
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,867
I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?

516
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,036
Any other yard,
the grass would be shorter.

517
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,205
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.

518
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,791
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.

519
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,500
After all, she's the one who paid
for it. That makes her an accomplice.

520
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,712
You know what it's like in jail?

521
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,089
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up.

522
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,175
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?

523
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,896
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,

524
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,472
you smacked me around.

525
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,224
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

526
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,004
The whole Szalinski family's
gonna be in jail for life.

527
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,353
Look.

528
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,896
My dad's machine works.

529
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,775
When we get home and he fixes us all,
we're gonna be so rich.

530
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,964
You'll regret this.

531
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,615
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.

532
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,617
I mean, your dad's a real nice guy.

533
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:03,085
He's not as weird as I thought he was,
and I love you and Nick...

534
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:06,202
...like my own brother and sister.

535
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:25,186
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

536
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,570
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

537
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:45,190
Amy.
- Ron, where are you?

538
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,525
Run, Nick.

539
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,365
Whoa. Oh. Ow.

540
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,872
Russ. Russ.
- Get up.

541
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,516
Get in there.

542
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,060
Get out of there.

543
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:43,944
Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?

544
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:45,892
Uh, we're the Boorsteins.

545
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,081
Get off the grass.

546
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,751
Get off the grass.

547
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:58,133
Up there.

548
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,396
Nicky.

549
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,463
Amy.
- Get under that ledge.

550
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:02,189
It's very delicate, the lawn.

551
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,430
You don't want to overwater, really.

552
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,003
Get her.

553
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,600
Amy?

554
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,735
Get away.

555
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,821
Please don't die.

556
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,011
Amy.

557
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:48,533
No, Cathy, I just thought
they might have stopped by.

558
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,244
Okay, listen. If you see them,
would you send them home?

559
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,007
Okay. You have a good weekend.

560
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:01,030
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

561
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:06,321
Oh, no.

562
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,725
You had to bring the dog. I don't want
to hear any more about the cat.

563
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,935
It's the Forresters.
What are we gonna tell 'em?

564
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,897
How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

565
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,087
Don.

566
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,601
How 'bout catching some...

567
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,742
Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.

568
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:33,384
Say good morning, Sushi.

569
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:35,969
Well, the fishing report
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust...

570
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,457
...while the sun still shines, huh?

571
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,069
I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.

572
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:40,543
He's says they're jumpin' in the boat.

573
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:43,030
Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.

574
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:45,089
Donald, that man over there is flying.

575
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,967
Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.

576
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,834
I don't think we're gonna be able to make it.

577
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:51,220
Maybe you oughta go on ahead.

578
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,886
What do you... What do you mean you don't
think you're gonna be able to make it?

579
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,974
We're caravanning, good buddy.

580
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,435
Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria.

581
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,229
And besides, if you're not there
by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.

582
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:02,419
Confidentially...

583
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,095
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

584
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,755
Plumbing.

585
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,928
'Plumbing'?

586
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,243
Well, this isn't
the Big Russ Thompson I know.

587
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,580
I mean, plumbing would not stop
the Big Russ Thompson I know...

588
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,874
...especially with an $80 deposit on the line.

589
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:23,264
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

590
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,994
Don?

591
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,479
Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...

592
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,272
Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?

593
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,462
Come on.

594
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,093
Mm-hmm.

595
00:50:57,307 --> 00:51:00,059
You tell him the truth?
- Honey.

596
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,271
They take it okay?
- Mae.

597
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,732
Eighty bucks, Mae.
Non-refundable.

598
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,947
Those kids are grounded.

599
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:24,314
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

600
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:29,558
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

601
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,782
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

602
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,256
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.

603
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,640
Yeah, I know, Nick.

604
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:47,863
Where'd you learn artificial respiration?

605
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,601
French class, kid.
- Oh.

606
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,574
'French class'?

607
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,678
How 'bout a truce, okay?

608
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,767
Okay.

609
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:34,092
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

610
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,261
You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.

611
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,451
Let's go.

612
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,501
French class.

613
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,288
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

614
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:08,558
...with chocolate sprinkles,
and a banana split.

615
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,380
I could eat a corn dog the size of a truck.

616
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:17,713
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

617
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:21,681
I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house.

618
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,241
I saw it first.
It's mine.

619
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,811
I got dibs on the cream filling.

620
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:29,663
Nick, it's one of your cookies.

621
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,783
They're never gonna believe this at school.

622
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,786
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

623
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,330
'Dear Miss Mason:

624
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:49,422
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note.'

625
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,646
Guys, quick. Over here.
- Where?

626
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:00,311
Right there.
- Nicky, hurry.

627
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,433
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.

628
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,538
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.

629
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:12,315
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.

630
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:16,527
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.

631
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:18,360
Just one ant.
- When is the last time...

632
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:19,530
...you saw just one ant?

633
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:22,918
He's a scout. The rest of them
will be here any minute.

634
00:54:23,022 --> 00:54:23,284
Wait.

635
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,787
You ever see how fast ants go?

636
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:29,415
We could ride him and get back
to the house in no time.

637
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,605
Forget it, Nick.

638
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:34,921
Amy, he could take us all.

639
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:38,299
Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?

640
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:41,094
That's like bench-pressing a bulldozer.

641
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,721
Yeah, so think of what he could do to us.

642
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:45,723
Let's go before he brings the rest of them.

643
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:49,018
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

644
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,208
Russ?

645
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,400
I say that ant is ours.
- Yeah.

646
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,234
Come on, you guys.

647
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,911
Geronimo.

648
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,415
Get him.

649
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,366
You guys. Nicky.

650
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,832
Get him.
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt.

651
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:06,869
Ron, be careful.

652
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,705
Yee-ha.

653
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,540
Nick, get over there. Over there.
- You guys...

654
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:13,016
Get behind it.

655
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,239
Get back here, Nicky.
- Watch out.

656
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,230
Look out.
- Nick, the others...

657
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:24,550
...could come any second.

658
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,193
Nicky.
- Go, Nick.

659
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,978
Nicky, no. Get off of him.
- Nick, the wrong end.

660
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:36,173
Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.

661
00:55:36,277 --> 00:55:37,442
Go over there.

662
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:40,205
Nicky, get away.
- Ron, get on.

663
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,849
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.

664
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,630
Ron, go for it.

665
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:52,269
Hey. Hello.

666
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,105
Ant.

667
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,254
Here.

668
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,276
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

669
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,243
You guys, come on.

670
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,954
Somebody take this cookie.

671
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:13,081
Nicky, take this thing.

672
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,958
Help. Nicky.

673
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,123
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.

674
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,404
Nicky, help me.
- She did it.

675
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,724
Somebody, help me.
- Yeah.

676
00:56:25,803 --> 00:56:28,117
Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky.

677
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,307
For a girl.
- Of course.

678
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:52,869
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.

679
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,576
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.

680
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,689
Quark, get away from there.

681
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,878
Quark. Here, boy.

682
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,840
Quark. Quark.

683
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,626
Get away, boy. Drop it.

684
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,659
Oh, whoa. Whoa.

685
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,550
Whoa.

686
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:18,145
Whoa.

687
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,255
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

688
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,601
Oh, okay, it's 646...

689
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,535
That guy's got serious problems.

690
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,949
Mrs. Thompson? Hello?

691
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,075
646 Sycamore. Yes.

692
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,111
Great idea, Russ, even if
the boy genius didn't think of it.

693
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,301
Low bridge.

694
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:53,244
At this rate,
we'll be home by dinner.

695
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,741
Maybe I can still go out...

696
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,645
...with Patty.

697
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,420
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

698
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,829
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

699
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:07,738
We are camping, Ron,
only better.

700
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:10,395
This is like a safari.
- Hey.

701
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:13,222
Yeah, I never thought
of it that way, you know.

702
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,412
Onward.

703
00:58:31,804 --> 00:58:33,889
Amy?

704
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,058
Nick.

705
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,186
Wayne?

706
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:51,094
Uh, yeah, um, I would like
to report, um, two missing children.

707
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:52,749
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it,

708
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:53,805
why don't you go out and...

709
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:57,058
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

710
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,310
You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.

711
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:02,187
You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.

712
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,564
Quit? I thought he was cut.

713
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:06,317
He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...

714
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,903
What do you mean he was afraid to tell
me? He could tell me anything he wants.

715
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:09,946
You know me. I'll always listen.

716
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,864
Mm-hmm.

717
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,783
What's 'Uh-huh' supposed to mean?
- Russell.

718
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:17,161
No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.

719
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:19,419
You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways to...

720
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:20,915
Whoa, my kids did not run away.

721
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,479
They are happy kids,
and there's no way you can...

722
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,420
...make me believe that they ran away.

723
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:28,297
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?

724
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:29,632
Mm-hmm.

725
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:31,922
Russell.
- Why do I feel like

726
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,095
I'm the one on trial here?

727
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,556
Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?

728
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,142
Well, I think we have enough to get started.

729
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:41,936
Please give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

730
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,126
Fine.

731
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,740
Don't they need a warrant or something?

732
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:58,494
Russell, there's a few things
about yourself I think you should know.

733
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,296
Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.

734
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,837
Oh, another missing children report.

735
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,484
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.

736
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,179
I've called the police.
What's on your head?

737
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:18,556
I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

738
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,933
They're in the backyard.
- They are?

739
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:24,020
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

740
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:27,049
That is the couch from the attic.

741
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:29,728
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.

742
01:00:29,832 --> 01:00:30,568
I found it on the floor.

743
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:33,080
It's my thinking couch.

744
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:35,260
Wayne...

745
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,590
Are you trying to tell me...

746
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,495
You did it?

747
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,802
It works?
The machine works?

748
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,918
Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.

749
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,003
That's great.
- No, it's not that great.

750
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:51,349
Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

751
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,007
What?
- And the Thompson kids too.

752
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,387
They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.

753
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:55,760
What?

754
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,616
Threw them out with the trash.

755
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,182
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

756
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,393
Yes?

757
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:07,219
Did, uh, you report some missing children?

758
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:14,039
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?

759
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,385
She's w... Thank you.

760
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,933
Mm-hmm.

761
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:35,691
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?

762
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,753
What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

763
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,714
Here. You deserve this.

764
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,072
We're not gonna make it before dark.

765
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:01,868
Yeah. Even if we did,
the mall would be closed.

766
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:06,136
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.

767
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,524
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family...

768
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:12,754
...might be worried about him.

769
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:16,903
It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

770
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:19,469
Help me get off the harness.

771
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:30,292
You can go now.

772
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:38,462
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

773
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,278
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

774
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:44,952
You're free.
You get home now.

775
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,142
Shoo.

776
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,712
Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know...

777
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:55,296
...what's best for him.

778
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,477
Go on. Go home.
Mom will never let me keep you.

779
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,267
Amy? Nick?

780
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,353
Nick?
- Are you there, kids?

781
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,543
Nicky.

782
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:14,628
Where are you?

783
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,537
Any luck?
- No.

784
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:36,733
Nick?

785
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,153
Amy?

786
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:47,034
You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.

787
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,398
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.

788
01:03:50,664 --> 01:03:52,953
Keep looking. Nick?

789
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,127
Amy?

790
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,379
What was that?
- Ow.

791
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,554
Watch out.

792
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:09,057
Come on.

793
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:21,064
Ugh.
- Where did that come from?

794
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:31,434
Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.

795
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:36,981
Oof. Looks like he started up again.

796
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:42,315
No. He only smokes when he's
really worried about something.

797
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:45,719
Nicky, be careful.

798
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:50,349
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.

799
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:08,789
Cool. Now we can see in the dark.

800
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:17,105
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.

801
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,483
I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.

802
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,236
But you always make
a big deal out of sports.

803
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,240
Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.

804
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,201
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...

805
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:33,674
Wayne?
- Yeah?

806
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:36,603
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

807
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:49,846
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

808
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,265
How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

809
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:55,435
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?

810
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:58,313
Well, the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound...

811
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,403
...and then through laser inversion,
it takes all the...

812
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:01,190
Wait, Wayne, wait.

813
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:05,106
I think the Thompsons
need to see the couch.

814
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:08,165
This guy is a waste of skin.

815
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,798
This is a microscope.
- I know.

816
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:15,851
Look in there.

817
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,270
All right.

818
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:21,190
You see, that's the couch that
used to be sitting right over here,

819
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:22,337
until the machine shrunk it.

820
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,714
All right, so there's
some doll furniture. Big deal.

821
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,633
They sell that kind of stuff at swap meets.

822
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,636
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

823
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,847
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

824
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,932
Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?

825
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:36,309
No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.

826
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:40,930
If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be piece of them everywhere.

827
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:41,439
Wayne.

828
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:45,360
Sorry, I... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?

829
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,203
The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one...

830
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:48,446
...who needs a shrink, Szalinski.

831
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,159
Russ.
- You are a nutcase,

832
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:51,908
and I'll tell you something.

833
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,535
I have got an air hammer in my attic...

834
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,140
...and if you did do something to my kids,
there's gonna be pieces of you...

835
01:06:57,244 --> 01:06:58,122
...all over the neighborhood.

836
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,312
Come on, honey.

837
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:09,175
I think that went well.

838
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,844
I think we should
have them over more often.

839
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,347
Yeah, well,
it's a priority for me.

840
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,934
Now, why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

841
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,123
Find my kids.

842
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,185
I thought you didn't believe him.

843
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:37,474
Oh, I don't.

844
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:40,602
Electricity's cheap.

845
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,122
Come on. Look at this.

846
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:10,492
We don't have to sleep on the ground.

847
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:15,330
What is it?
- One of my Legos.

848
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:17,973
Give me a boost.

849
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,645
Hey.

850
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,523
Not bad.

851
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:31,789
Yeah. I don't even have to brush my teeth.

852
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:34,789
Quit pushing.
- Move over.

853
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:36,978
You move over.

854
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:40,391
Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

855
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:43,420
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.

856
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,381
Night, Antie.

857
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,869
Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.

858
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:14,488
You think you'll be warm enough?

859
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:22,830
Good night, Russ.

860
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:26,208
Good night, Amy.

861
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,382
Good night, Amy.

862
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,323
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

863
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:39,550
Meow.

864
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,947
Are you okay?

865
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,783
I'm scared.

866
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,851
Somehow I feel like this is all our fault.

867
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:07,040
No, it's my fault.

868
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:13,192
I start working on something, and I...
I don't think about anything else.

869
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:18,437
I should have been more careful
with that thing. I'm sorry.

870
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,846
That's not what I meant.

871
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,912
You know, it's not important...

872
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:27,638
...if I sell another house...

873
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:31,539
...or if you get a grant this year or next.

874
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:36,648
We've just got to get
this family back together.

875
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:40,699
I feel the same way.

876
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,982
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

877
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:56,944
We've got to get up early
and come out here and look for them.

878
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,134
No, I couldn't sleep.

879
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:03,076
Not with my babies out here all alone.

880
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,162
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

881
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,352
They'll be fine.

882
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:12,043
That's another thing I'm worried about.

883
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,769
Amy in the dark...

884
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,839
...with little Russ Thompson.

885
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:19,029
Get some rest.

886
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,454
They'd better behave themselves.

887
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,523
It's funny.

888
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:36,401
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

889
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,506
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

890
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,972
Why? Does he pick on you
about your size?

891
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,912
The bigger the guy,
the bigger the moon.

892
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:50,804
It's just the way he thinks.

893
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:52,980
Russ?

894
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,542
Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

895
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:00,487
Well...

896
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:05,138
I mean...

897
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:08,725
...you talked to me once or twice last year.

898
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:13,083
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...

899
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:17,775
I just always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

900
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,361
I was too popular to notice.

901
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,886
I was stupid.

902
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,711
Get down. Hurry.
- Get down. Hurry.

903
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,907
Ron, get down.

904
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:52,080
Run.

905
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,504
Russ. Help.

906
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:03,048
Russ, help.
- Help him.

907
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,219
Russ.

908
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,930
Stay here.

909
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,046
No.

910
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,100
Ron, get out. Quick.
Get away.

911
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:37,741
Come on, Ron. Hurry.
- Come on.

912
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,921
He-He'll get killed.

913
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:48,819
We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.

914
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:50,939
Sit down.

915
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:58,134
We gotta help him.

916
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:13,120
Now.

917
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,818
Get him.
- Get him.

918
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:27,217
Let him go.
- Look out.

919
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:34,892
Back.

920
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:54,536
Where's Antie?

921
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,538
Antie.
- There.

922
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,926
Oh, my God.

923
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:11,094
He looks hurt.
- No.

924
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,516
You saved my life.

925
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,852
No, he's gonna be okay.

926
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,801
Where you going?

927
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:44,980
Nature calls.

928
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:55,303
Boys on the right,
girls on the left.

929
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:58,311
I must look absolutely gross.

930
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,249
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

931
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,381
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.

932
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,676
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

933
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,019
Something's very weird here.

934
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:35,707
What is it?
- Earthquake.

935
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:39,464
No, worse. Lawn mower.

936
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,999
Nicky.

937
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:39,254
What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope...

938
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:41,219
...whatever lived here has moved out.

939
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:44,097
This is the burrow of
a Lumbricus terrestris.

940
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:47,421
A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant...

941
01:19:47,525 --> 01:19:49,610
...this time of year.

942
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,376
Plug that in.

943
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:55,492
We're almost done here.

944
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,591
Is that a chain saw?

945
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:03,402
No, it's more like our lawn mower, I think.

946
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,288
Tommy, stop the lawn mower.
- Tommy.

947
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:18,569
Tommy, stop.

948
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,135
Tommy.
- Tommy.

949
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,679
Tommy. Don't go on the grass.
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here.

950
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:25,733
Tommy.
- Tommy.

951
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:26,806
All right, together.

952
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,391
One, two, three.

953
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:31,864
Tommy. Tommy.

954
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:38,203
I think we'll be safe in here.

955
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:44,157
Nicky.

956
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:46,346
Come on. Come on.

957
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:52,340
No. No.

958
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:56,893
Hold on to me, Russ.

959
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:00,694
Amy, don't let go.

960
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:04,907
Amy.

961
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,328
Hold on.
- Give me that thing.

962
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,527
Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?

963
01:21:21,632 --> 01:21:24,447
Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

964
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,658
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

965
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:30,744
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.

966
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:33,289
Go on through the house. It's safer.

967
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:35,479
'Safer'?

968
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,719
I thought my folks are weird.

969
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,035
My knee.

970
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,058
Is everyone okay?

971
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,467
I feel like a banana whip.

972
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,706
Nick? Nick, are you all right?

973
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:09,221
Nicky.

974
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:16,270
Dad?

975
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:19,002
Mom.

976
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:20,878
Down here.
- Mom. Mom, Dad.

977
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:23,339
Dad. We're down here.
- Over here.

978
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,899
Mr. Szalinski.
- Down here.

979
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:28,194
Dad.
- Mr. Szalinski.

980
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,569
We'll make it, Nick.

981
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:46,321
They're never gonna find us.

982
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:48,990
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us.

983
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,242
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?

984
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:55,867
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked.

985
01:22:57,227 --> 01:22:59,313
Quark.

986
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:02,101
Come on, everybody.
Grab on.

987
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:05,606
Go inside, Quark.
Find Dad.

988
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:28,842
Nicky.

989
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:32,627
Quark, what's gotten into you?

990
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:37,080
Dad.
- I think he just misses the kids.

991
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,269
Dad. Stop.

992
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:42,940
No.

993
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:48,007
Dad.
- I'll tell you, at their size...

994
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:48,988
Dad.
- Mr. Szalinski.

995
01:23:49,093 --> 01:23:50,510
that backyard is like ten miles.

996
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,699
Giant blades of grass.

997
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,347
Huge insects.

998
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,787
It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head...

999
01:23:57,891 --> 01:23:59,352
...right for the house.

1000
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:00,853
It's us.
- Dad.

1001
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,231
Yeah, you're probably right.

1002
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:05,420
No.

1003
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:11,364
We're down here.
- Mr. Szalinski.

1004
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,554
No, Dad.

1005
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:19,400
Dad.
- No.

1006
01:24:19,504 --> 01:24:20,748
Dad.

1007
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:23,543
We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help.

1008
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:25,732
Don't eat me.

1009
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,114
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

1010
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:35,860
No, Dad. Dad.

1011
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,074
It's Nick.
- Oh, Nicky.

1012
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:41,529
Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.

1013
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:45,440
Look. It's the rest of them.
- Yeah.

1014
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:47,442
Yeah.
- We're saved.

1015
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:51,712
I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.

1016
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:56,701
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

1017
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:00,663
Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.

1018
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:02,691
So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...

1019
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:02,999
I know.

1020
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:06,104
these kids aren't you.
- Baseball.

1021
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,588
Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball.

1022
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:11,617
I can't make it out.
- Let me see.

1023
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,360
The baseball, Dad.

1024
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:17,753
What are you saying, Nick?

1025
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,144
Swinging?

1026
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:25,897
Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

1027
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:28,457
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping.

1028
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,841
Pitching.
- Um...

1029
01:25:29,946 --> 01:25:30,777
Throwing.

1030
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:34,001
You're out. You're out.
- Baseball.

1031
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:35,576
Dad.
- Right.

1032
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:37,367
The baseball.

1033
01:25:37,471 --> 01:25:40,176
Baseball?
- Good, honey.

1034
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:45,426
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.

1035
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,004
I got it. The ball
came through the window...

1036
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:54,509
...and activated the machine,
and they got in the path of the laser.

1037
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:58,012
Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.

1038
01:25:58,116 --> 01:25:59,317
Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.

1039
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:00,848
That's why everything was blowing up.

1040
01:26:00,953 --> 01:26:03,393
Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.

1041
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:05,281
Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.

1042
01:26:05,385 --> 01:26:06,020
Hold it, Szalinski.

1043
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:11,481
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids...

1044
01:26:11,585 --> 01:26:14,195
...until you try it on something living.

1045
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,155
You know something,
maybe I should do it on myself.

1046
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,752
I'll show you how to work
the machine. It's not that hard.

1047
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,157
I don't know.

1048
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:22,036
I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no. Do it on me.

1049
01:26:22,141 --> 01:26:24,226
Are you sure, honey?

1050
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,895
How'd those get there?

1051
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:48,364
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.

1052
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:53,172
No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?

1053
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,792
Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.

1054
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:12,378
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

1055
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:28,866
Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

1056
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:49,718
So, if this works,
you wanna go to the dance on Friday?

1057
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:53,524
Can you dance?

1058
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,735
Not really.
- I'd love to.

1059
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:20,445
Oh.
- Russ. Ron.

1060
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:21,155
Dad.

1061
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,539
Oh, I knew my boys wouldn't run away.

1062
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,619
Are you and Dad okay?

1063
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:28,043
Yeah, honey.
...all the way...

1064
01:28:28,148 --> 01:28:29,497
...across the yard, for miles.

1065
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,499
Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

1066
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:34,043
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.

1067
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:36,597
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.

1068
01:28:36,701 --> 01:28:37,171
She's all right.

1069
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:39,674
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

1070
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:42,677
You were right.
You were brilliant.

1071
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:46,108
I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.

1072
01:28:46,213 --> 01:28:47,390
I know, Ronnie, I know.

1073
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:50,226
Dad, if you really want me
back on the team...

1074
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:53,563
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.

1075
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,419
Proud of you.
- I got better.

1076
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:59,694
I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.

1077
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,830
Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.

1078
01:29:10,934 --> 01:29:11,984
Good idea.
- Oh, great.

1079
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:12,874
Oh, I love toasts.

1080
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:15,960
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis
and many more dinners together.

1081
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,227
Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be...

1082
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,756
...having leftovers for a while.

1083
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,869
I wonder what's for dinner, right, Russ?

1084
01:29:20,974 --> 01:29:21,424
Who wants bread?

1085
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:22,736
Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta...

1086
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,843
...carve this thing, huh?

1087
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:26,304
Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
- Do we have butter?

1088
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:29,265
Who wants bread?
- Save some room for cake.

1089
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:32,278
Oh, we got cake for dessert?
- Yeah.

1090
01:29:32,382 --> 01:29:34,467
Who wants bread?

1091
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,610
Hey, wait.

1092
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:42,528
I get it.

1093
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:45,669
French class. Ha-ha.
