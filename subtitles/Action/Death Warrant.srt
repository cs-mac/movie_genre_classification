1
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,320
I think he's inside.
I'm gonna check it out.

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
<i>Burke, wait for backup. </i>

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,320
He killed my partner.

4
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm not waiting.

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>Listen, Burke, 
this is L.A., not Canada. </i>

6
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,080
<i>We have procedures here. 
You can't handle this alone. </i>

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
What's the problem?

8
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,280
Hey, man, what you doing here?

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,480
I'm busy. Scram.

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in manners.

11
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm gonna get you, man!

12
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
Like I said, I'm going in.

13
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,600
Time to go to sleep...

14
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
and join your old partner.

15
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm the Sandman.
You can't stop me.

16
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,560
You're under arrest.

17
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,600
Detective Burke.
Have a seat.

18
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
Tom Vogler, attorney general.

19
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,960
On my right is Ben Keane,
on your left is Sam Waldon.

20
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,200
I represent the governor.
I'm heading his task force on prisons.

21
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm with State Board of Corrections.

22
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
- And who are you?
- Amanda Beckett.

23
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,160
- She works for me.
- Detective Burke.

24
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,440
Specialized in undercover work with
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police...

25
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,680
stationed in Quebec.

26
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,560
You followed Christian Naylor,
"the Sandman," to L.A.

27
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,880
We've had some problems in one of
our prisons... Harrison Penitentiary.

28
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,320
It's a local piece,
small-town news.

29
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,160
The assistant warden was murdered.

30
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,480
Now a guard's intimated...

31
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,040
that it might be linked
to the deaths of some prisoners...

32
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
nine in the last few months.

33
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,560
We've got a gubernatorial election
coming up this fall.

34
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,680
Prisons are already an issue. We don't
want this to become a part of it.

35
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,360
The governor's put me in charge
of rectifying this little mishap.

36
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,400
We wanna send you undercover
into Harrison as a prisoner.

37
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
You're from Quebec.
No one in jail will recognize you.

38
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Only this committee
will know you're an officer.

39
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,880
You'll be sentenced to Harrison
for armed robbery.

40
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Armed robbery is
a respectable crime among inmates.

41
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,600
It's implicitly violent.

42
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,360
They respect violence.

43
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,520
We're also assigning
a partner of sorts.

44
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,840
Amanda will act as your liaison.

45
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,360
She'll be posing as your wife.
Amanda will relay information.

46
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,680
Through her, we'll be able
to closely monitor the operation.

47
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, Detective, what do you say?

48
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll let you know.

49
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Would like me to file the papers
for you first thing in the morning?

50
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,760
I think the sooner, the better.
I know you always do a good job.

51
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,800
- We'll see you tomorrow night then?
- Yeah.

52
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
Have Helen call me
if she wants me to bring anything.

53
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,880
- I will.
- Bye.

54
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,800
A pleasure meeting you, Mr. Burke.

55
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

56
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,000
He's really been like a father to me.

57
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,480
I've been working for him
ever since I graduated law school.

58
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,600
When was that?

59
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,200
Last year.

60
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Is there a problem, Detective Burke?

61
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
You don't have enough experience
to be on this case.

62
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Let's get something straight here.

63
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm no girl Friday.

64
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,080
I graduated top in my class
at Stanford.

65
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,960
If you're uncomfortable with the fact
that I'm a woman...

66
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,360
then that's your problem, not mine.

67
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,120
Okay.

68
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,240
Check the files of any serial killers
at Harrison Prison.

69
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,040
Then you'll take the case?

70
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
I'll see you Tuesday.

71
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,960
I'll get to work.

72
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
You're getting wet.

73
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,600
Listen up!

74
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,240
Clasp your fingers in front of you.

75
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,000
And don't move.

76
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
I am Sergeant DeGraf.

77
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
I decide when you eat...

78
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,680
when you shower...

79
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,840
when you have visitors.

80
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,760
You are fish.

81
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,320
New arrivals.

82
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,520
People will try to hurt you...

83
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
rob you...

84
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,040
even rape you.

85
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
He said, don't move.

86
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Very good.

87
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
It's important...

88
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,520
that you obey my rules...

89
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,160
rules to make the difference
between your life and your death.

90
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm Dr. Gottesman.
Any communicable diseases?

91
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
Not yet.

92
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
Excuse me?

93
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,520
You're Burke, right?

94
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,720
You have AB negative blood.
That's very rare.

95
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Okay, take it into
the next room, please.

96
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Come on. Move it.

97
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,920
Your identification number's 72688.

98
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,600
Memorize your number... 72688.

99
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,880
This is your identification card,
Mr. 72688.

100
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,320
Your new home is C level,
cell C-71.

101
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,560
Next.

102
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
- It's dead.
- Excuse me?

103
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,520
The eye.
You were looking at it.

104
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,960
It's dead.
Got stabbed in it.

105
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,240
In the eye?

106
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah, I got stabbed in the eye.

107
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,640
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

108
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,320
Meal shift starts
every morning at 6:10.

109
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,680
Lunch is noon straight up.
Dinner is at 6:30 p.m.

110
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
You can take a shower once a day,
check yourself for fungus and body lice.

111
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,680
Any questions?

112
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Your identification number is 72689.

113
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,160
Memorize your number... 72689.

114
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,200
72689. Right.
My name is Burke.

115
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,320
Here's your I.D. card, Mr. 72689.

116
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,000
Your new home is C level.
Cell C-68. Next.

117
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,040
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

118
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,040
What are you doin' here?
And what do you think you're lookin' at?

119
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm new here.

120
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,640
I don't care what you are.
You think you can sleep here?

121
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,720
Real estate.
Cost you $500.

122
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,640
Don't have any money.

123
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,240
You don't have any money?
Well, that's okay.

124
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,000
- You can punk.
- Excuse me?

125
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,160
You can get down
on your hands and knees...

126
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,760
and you pay,
just like any other cherry.

127
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
I don't think so.

128
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,720
You don't think so?

129
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,440
Possibly...

130
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,960
you might wanna reconsider.

131
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,040
I don't pay, I don't punk.

132
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

133
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,920
I was jerking you around.
Don't have a hair ball about it.

134
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,240
- You want the top bunk, take it.
- The bottom would be nice.

135
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,440
- Better yet. You got it.
- Thanks.

136
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,680
72689, remember?

137
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Don't eat that.

138
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,320
What's wrong with my food?

139
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,400
Hey, nigger.

140
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>Are you talkin' about me, ese? </i>

141
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,760
We keep to ourselves now.

142
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,280
- We don't give a shit about you people.
- Oh, yeah?

143
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
- Hey, listen.
- Hey, it's on me!

144
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,960
<i>- Let him go. Let him go.
- It's cool, ese. </i>

145
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
<i>You're dead, ese! </i>

146
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,280
<i>You're fuckin' dead, ese! </i>

147
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,040
You're dead!

148
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,280
Let me go, homes.

149
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
I'll talk to you later.

150
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
Hawkins.

151
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I know... always the nigger's fault.

152
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
You're not gonna last too long.

153
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,240
Is that a threat?

154
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,680
No.

155
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
That's a promise.

156
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,560
It never happened!

157
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,160
Back to dinner!

158
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,040
<i>You're a rata, ese. 
Fuckin' dead.</i>

159
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,000
What's the matter with you?

160
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,560
Can't you see this is a black table?

161
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,320
Stick with your own kind.
Trust no one.

162
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
What about you?

163
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,840
What about me?
You don't know who I am.

164
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
You don't know anything.

165
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Hey, fish.

166
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Why don't you sit with us, fish?

167
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Sit down, bright boy.

168
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,360
- So what are you in for?
- I was a bad boy.

169
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
And you?

170
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,560
Me and Keel here,
we got the big bitch.

171
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
Habitual.

172
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,800
See these?

173
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
Those are the people he's killed.

174
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,640
That's very special.

175
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,840
Lock 'em up, Dick.

176
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Begin count.

177
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,960
Tier 2-C, 69.

178
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Tier 2-C, 68.

179
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,080
Pruno.

180
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
Make it ourselves.

181
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,320
It's good for what ails you.

182
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,840
I saw you helpin' out
that nigger Hawkins.

183
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,560
Not good.
It's bad mojo.

184
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Most of the time, you can't even
trust your own kind in this place.

185
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
Hey, Konefke.

186
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,040
How long have you been here?

187
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,680
Maybe six years.

188
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,560
I hear a lot of guys are dying.

189
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,520
Yeah, maybe.

190
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
But I don't see so well no more.

191
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,000
Like one of those monkeys
you hear about.

192
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,880
Hear no evil, see no evil.

193
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Hi, Louis.

194
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,680
That's a nice outfit.

195
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,120
Thank you.

196
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,040
Are you trying to get me killed?

197
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,840
You're supposed to be my wife,
not a princess.

198
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,240
I didn't realize.

199
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,120
Pay attention next time.

200
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,800
I ran your M.O. check
on serial killers here.

201
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,200
Nothing matches up.
I checked all the death certificates.

202
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,040
All the victims died of puncture wounds
to the back of the skull.

203
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,360
Maybe it's a serial killer,
but I'm thinking maybe it's gangs...

204
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,080
or, like, ritual killings.

205
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,280
Let's concentrate on the big tips.

206
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,160
Last one was Alvin Barrett.

207
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,800
His cell mate, I'll talk to him.

208
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
You did good.

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,720
Thanks.

210
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,800
I need you to give me some money.

211
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I'll have the office credit
your prison account this afternoon.

212
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,320
That's no good. I need real cash
to get anything done here.

213
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
Inmates aren't allowed to have cash.

214
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,640
You'll find a way
to bring me the money easy.

215
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,320
I don't know if I can do that.

216
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,200
This is my life we're talking about.

217
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,080
I'll get you the money.

218
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,800
Tell the kids Daddy loves them.

219
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm telling you,
I won't condone it.

220
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,080
If you won't authorize the money,
I'll give it to him myself.

221
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,280
Don't play games with me,
Miss Beckett.

222
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,320
You are a liaison on this case
and nothing more.

223
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,640
Take it easy.

224
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,440
Don't let him get to you.

225
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,960
Another one of your lovely peers?

226
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Hi, Helen.

227
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,440
Thank you, Rosarita.
I'll do it.

228
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,320
I stopped asking Tom about
these investigations years ago.

229
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,640
It's all so sordid anyway.

230
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,000
- I thought politics interested you.
- No, not anymore.

231
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,200
Since I got out of the hospital,
things have taken on a new perspective.

232
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,000
Remember me?

233
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,880
I want you to meet my homey.
Bruce!

234
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
He likes to kick the shit
out of white trash like you, boy.

235
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,040
So what you gonna do? Huh?

236
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,600
Where'd you get all those books?

237
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,560
My wife.
We like to read a lot.

238
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,120
Shit. The only thing I read
is girly magazine letters.

239
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
Get back.

240
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,760
Listen to this one.

241
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,960
"Dear Sirs.

242
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,440
I never thought this would happen to me,
but I was workin' the late shift...

243
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,360
when this big-titted mama
comes up to me."

244
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
You think any of this stuff
ever really happens?

245
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
- Don't know.
- Never happened to me.

246
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,280
Hawkins... you know him?

247
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,360
Thanks.

248
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Hello, guys.
You miss me?

249
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,240
It's the Lone Ranger.

250
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,840
Hi-ho, Silver.
What's up, Kimosabe?

251
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,080
The man just waltzes
right on in here...

252
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,280
visits with the happy, old negros.

253
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,240
You're Lobo, Burke.
You know that.

254
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,800
- I'm Lobo?
- Yep.

255
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,320
You know how wolves stake out
their territory pissin' on things?

256
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,640
I figure you pissed on
just about everything around here.

257
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,400
- You know everything, right?
- Been here a long time.

258
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,520
What are you in for?

259
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
Murder.

260
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,400
Let me guess.

261
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,920
You're innocent, right?

262
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,720
I choked the son of a bitch
just as sure as I'm sittin' here.

263
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,680
Been here over ten years.
That's a long time...

264
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,840
to be rollin' smokes
and countin' cockroaches.

265
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
What's that?

266
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
Makin' shot for zip guns.

267
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,600
Scary times. People gettin'
spiked in the head and shit.

268
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
Gotta learn to defend yourself...

269
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,000
- So you don't get dusted.
- I heard that, man.

270
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,360
You probably figure I owe you something
'cause of what you did the other day.

271
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,040
Barrett... who killed him?
He was my friend.

272
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,800
Let me tell you something.
I don't owe you jack shit.

273
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,960
You wanna know what happened
to your friend? See the Priest.

274
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
The Priest?

275
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
That's all I'm sayin'.

276
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,600
<i>I'm tellin'you, the lower you go, 
the funkier it gets in this place. </i>

277
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,040
Down where we're goin',
the guards won't even come down here.

278
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,080
This guy I'm gonna introduce you to...

279
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,600
Priest, man.
He's part fuckin' snake.

280
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
I know you think I'm shittin' you,
but I'm not.

281
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,840
Wait till you see his eyes.
Don't look at 'em too long.

282
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,080
It gives me the fuckin' creeps.

283
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,960
You gotta cover your ass down here,
and I mean that literally.

284
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,280
It's gonna blow your mind, man.

285
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,200
You gotta see this.

286
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,040
What?

287
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
What are you talkin' about?

288
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,000
- Look, that's not the deal we made.
- Priest...

289
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,960
Listen! Look.

290
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,960
I want my stuff now.

291
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,600
Like I started saying before...

292
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,800
Priest, this is Burke.

293
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,560
Yeah.

294
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,960
I heard you went airborne on Perez.

295
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,040
You want a lady?

296
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,800
He thinks he's too good for me.

297
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,720
What's wrong with my ladies?

298
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,760
Nothing.

299
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,200
I just need some help.

300
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,760
I help lots of people.

301
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,800
I get Jersey hormone pills.

302
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,440
Is that the kind of help you want?

303
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,000
Alvin Barrett... who killed him?

304
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,320
Someone punched a hole in his head.

305
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,320
Why?

306
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,480
I can't just tell you these things.

307
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,800
I give you a little,
you taste it.

308
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,040
That's how things work.

309
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,120
You could talk to Myerson,
Barrett's former cell mate.

310
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
He's in solitary now...

311
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,000
but he works in the infirmary,
night shift.

312
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,720
He can fill prescriptions
if you got the money.

313
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,880
Sure you don't wanna sample my goods?

314
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,840
I'll take a rain check.

315
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Got another one.

316
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,480
He won't be home for dinner.

317
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,960
- What is this?
- Goddamn medical waste.

318
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
Medical waste.

319
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,360
- You Myerson?
- What do you want?

320
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,560
I need some medicine.

321
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
I got prescription drugs...
morphine and uppers. What do you need?

322
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,720
I hear you were Barrett's cell mate.
He was a good kid, huh?

323
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,080
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

324
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,440
On drugs. Bad news.

325
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,240
No way.

326
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,160
He was as green as grass.
He never did nothin'.

327
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,280
Convenience store robbery,
and that's it.

328
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,280
Maybe he was in a gang then.

329
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,160
I said he was clean.
What are you so curious about?

330
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,920
He was my friend
who got spiked in the head.

331
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,520
Maybe you know who did it.

332
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,120
- I'm not saying another word.
- Yes, you are.

333
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,560
Hey, fuck you!

334
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,040
What is this?

335
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,560
It's soda pop.

336
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,640
You're gonna drink this.

337
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,720
Please, man, don't!
I didn't do nothing! Christ!

338
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,200
Look, they'll kill me if I talk.
A guard let 'em in, not me.

339
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Lockup, five minutes.
Move it!

340
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,160
I'll talk to you.

341
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,840
<i>- Hello?
- It's Burke. </i>

342
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,440
<i>I've got something. </i>

343
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,440
Hang on a second.

344
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,960
<i>Okay, I'm ready. </i>

345
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,200
Barrett's cell mate is scared.

346
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,680
Whatever's going on,
the guards are involved.

347
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,360
<i>I need to see the victims'files. </i>

348
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,240
The files haven't been transferred
to computer yet.

349
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,160
Harrison's files
are all still at the prison.

350
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,840
What are you doing?

351
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,680
Right now?

352
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,120
Eating dinner.

353
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,120
Is there anything else?

354
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,920
<i>I'll be in touch. </i>

355
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Have a nice little chat?

356
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,960
I need the key to the records room.

357
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,720
That can be arranged.

358
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,560
- Hey!
- What?

359
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,440
What do you got here?

360
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,200
A load of shirts
for the reception desk.

361
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,160
Okay, you got me.

362
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,640
I was takin' some pruno
over to the guys in storage.

363
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Now, you know I'm gonna have
to take that.

364
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,080
Sure.

365
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,920
You ever actually taste that stuff?

366
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,560
- I don't think so.
- All right.

367
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,600
Well, maybe.
Let me try some.

368
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Oh, man!

369
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,480
Well, you're gonna have to develop
a taste for it.

370
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
You just can't go
wading into the shit, you know.

371
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,960
New arrival.

372
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,680
- What was that?
- What was what?

373
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,040
I must be going crazy.

374
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,760
Lot of old ghosts
hangin' around this place.

375
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
Let's get out of here.

376
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,400
Only the murder victims
have the "SL" notation.

377
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,680
The victims are brand-new...
no drugs, no gangs.

378
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,840
All different ages and race.

379
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,120
I can check with the mainframe system.

380
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,600
Maybe "SL" is some sort of
departmental abbreviation.

381
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,600
I've got the guy for you.

382
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
I've worked with him before.
He's a real pro.

383
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,280
He'll do the hacking for you.

384
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,760
And don't tell Keane about this, okay?

385
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,160
You know this is illegal,
don't you?

386
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,040
Sort of illegal.
Do you mind?

387
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,280
Are you kidding?
I love it.

388
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,800
See, I like to think of myself
as a renegade.

389
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,160
You know, like a cowboy.

390
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,880
Yeah, I'm a computer cowboy.
That's what I am.

391
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,240
- Well?
- Well, what? It's checking.

392
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,280
"SL" can stand
for virtually anything...

393
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,240
or nothing at all.

394
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,880
So, you got a boyfriend or something?

395
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,600
The computer looks for combinations
of words beginning with "SL."

396
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,840
Then it sees if there are
any files in the system named that.

397
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,520
<i>Shit. I'm missing Star Trek. </i>

398
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,480
<i>You wanna watch Star Trek? </i>

399
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,680
All right. So...

400
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,680
We got something here.

401
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,320
Now we see where the files
are most commonly accessed from.

402
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,320
- Bingo!
- That's it. That's the file.

403
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,160
Shit! We need the password.

404
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,560
That's okay.
It's a start.

405
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,240
Give me a day or two...

406
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,960
and I can locate any terminals
it's been accessed from.

407
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,960
You'll find out whose file it was.

408
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,000
Great. I'll take you home.
Your parents'll kill me.

409
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,720
Who needs parents?
We're both adults.

410
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,480
Aren't we?

411
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,280
I'm an adult...

412
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,000
and you're a kid.

413
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,600
Your hormones are workin' overtime.

414
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,000
Come on.
I'll take you home.

415
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,840
I'd rather not tell Keane about
what I'm doing with the computers.

416
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,640
Burke thinks we can get it done
a lot quicker without his interference.

417
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,760
I wonder if Detective Burke isn't
interfering with your work habits.

418
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,680
We have procedures for a reason.

419
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,640
I know what I'm doing.

420
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,320
I hope you do.

421
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

422
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
Don't worry.

423
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,080
Damn it!
It took you long enough.

424
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,880
You want to talk now?

425
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,920
Look, I found out some things...
about what they did to Barrett.

426
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,040
He didn't deserve
what they did to him.

427
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,240
We used to smuggle out
some drugs from overstock.

428
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, I was in surgery last night...

429
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,280
Shit. That's...

430
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,160
If he finds his keys missing,
I'm a dead man.

431
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,200
Relax.

432
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
Don't worry.

433
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,120
I need protection.

434
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,000
Another guy got spiked last night,
and this is serious shit!

435
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Quiet.

436
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
I've got to get this key
back to Priest.

437
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,440
Protection.

438
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,240
I need protection.

439
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Lady-killer.

440
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,120
Just thought you'd like to know...

441
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,680
I think somebody's
gonna pay you a visit tonight.

442
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,600
I'd think twice about sleeping.

443
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,880
Thanks.

444
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,640
I just hate to see
a good man go to waste.

445
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,440
I finally figured out the password.

446
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,320
I've had the computer running
word variations for hours.

447
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Of course, you know, it was
a special program I devised myself.

448
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,120
You know, I was reading
this article in a men's magazine...

449
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,800
about the virility of men
in their middle to late teens...

450
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,600
- Right.
- Just do it.

451
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,640
Right. Here we go.

452
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,080
Morpheus was the Greek god of sleep.

453
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm a whiz at mythology.

454
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,120
Criminals have a sense of humor.

455
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,080
Yes! We're in.

456
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,280
You're kidding me?

457
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,600
No. Is there anything else you need?

458
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,280
Print it out.
Can you make a copy of this file?

459
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,280
- Sure I can.
- Great.

460
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,280
What the hell is it doing?

461
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,360
Someone is destroying it
from the other end.

462
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,640
- Well, stop it.
- I can't.

463
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,240
We just have to hope
it started the print copy first.

464
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,360
Where's this file accessed from?

465
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,600
The infirmary, for one.
I checked up on the other abbreviation.

466
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,520
"H-L-E" is a coding system
for a tissue type.

467
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,160
I'm still checking on
that other point of access.

468
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,160
It's definitely someone
outside the prison.

469
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,800
That's our key player.

470
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,600
This is my beeper number.
Call me as soon as you find it out.

471
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,880
Tisdale, you are a stud.

472
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,080
All the Sleep file contained was
a list of prisoner I.D. numbers...

473
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,000
strung together along with
the prisoners' blood types.

474
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,480
Every person who was on that list
has been killed.

475
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,600
<i>- It's a hit list.
- Exactly. </i>

476
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,840
<i>Each victim had a physical
days before they were killed. </i>

477
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,000
Each one came up clean.

478
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,560
No diseases, no drug addiction,
nothing.

479
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,920
I think someone from the outside
is working with the guards.

480
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,080
Keane would have access to the files.

481
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,760
There's something else.

482
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,240
Your number's next on the list.

483
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,480
What's going on in here?

484
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
Help me.

485
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,120
- Grab him.
- Help me!

486
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,200
What are you doing in my prison?

487
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,000
Is something wrong with your mouth?

488
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,400
You killed Konefke.

489
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,920
I didn't do it.

490
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,160
I know.

491
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,560
Strip him.

492
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,680
<i>When I know you</i>

493
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,240
<i>When I know you</i>

494
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,000
<i>When I know you like I know</i>

495
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,000
You got a big mouth, Jersey.

496
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,520
I didn't say no names.

497
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,400
I didn't say you.

498
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,880
Who's there?

499
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,600
What's going on?
What do you want?

500
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,360
We wanna talk, just like Burke.

501
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,640
I didn't talk to Burke.
I didn't say nothing.

502
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,840
Who said I talked to Burke?
This is bullshit.

503
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,600
What is that?

504
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,960
Shit. Oh, God.

505
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,080
Hey, wait a minute.
You can't do this.

506
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,240
You gotta hear my side of it.
Somebody's lyin', man!

507
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,480
Somebody's fuckin' lying on me!

508
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,360
You can't do this, man!

509
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,680
Oh, God. Just stop.
Wait a minute.

510
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,240
Just wait one second!
Oh, God.

511
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,400
What did you say to Burke?

512
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
Who said I talked?
How did you find that out?

513
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,120
That's bullshit, man!

514
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,680
I swear to God I didn't talk!
Stop it! What are you doin'?

515
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,240
You're crazy, man!
People will find out!

516
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

517
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,280
I'll give you anything!
What do you want?

518
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,000
You're a liar, Myerson.

519
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,480
Don't! Please!

520
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,760
This is ridiculous.

521
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,960
Do you wanna see your husband?

522
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,160
The purse.

523
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,640
Then bring in a female guard.

524
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,640
None seem to be available.

525
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,880
Up with the arms.

526
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,640
I don't know.

527
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,960
I'm sorry, missy...

528
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,600
but you're gonna have
to remove your clothes.

529
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,120
Your husband is waiting.

530
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,840
Clean up and get dressed.

531
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,800
Your pretty little wife
wants to see you.

532
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
You have a half hour, Burke.

533
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,960
Have a good time there, buddy.

534
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,640
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

535
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,760
- Who did this to you?
- The guards.

536
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,320
They let two prisoners into my cell.

537
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,560
One of them had an ice pick.

538
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,960
At least we know
who's been spiking people.

539
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,480
What about you?

540
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,640
Nothing.

541
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
You look like hell.

542
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,920
So do you.

543
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,040
I checked on Dr. Gottesman, and...

544
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,000
And?

545
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,600
He didn't get into med school here.

546
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,240
He went to South America.

547
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,840
South America?

548
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,880
- And, um...
- And?

549
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,800
There were a couple...

550
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,400
of, um...

551
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,400
malpractice suits.

552
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,280
You're so beautiful.

553
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,200
You guys are all spooked 'cause
you think there's some big conspiracy.

554
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,720
Priest, you know as well as I
what's going on.

555
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,160
Brother got his brains scrambled
just last night.

556
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,160
Straight through the skull
like a piece of meat.

557
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,280
It could be me next,
could be you.

558
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,160
So big, white Superman's
gonna save our asses?

559
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,560
What makes you think
we wanna be saved?

560
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,640
Burke needs our help.

561
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,560
He needs a distraction.

562
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,960
- Good work, Hawkins.
- Thank the Priest.

563
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,000
- Shit!
- Yeah, it's locked.

564
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,360
They cart this medical waste
in and out of here day and night.

565
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,760
- Where?
- I don't know.

566
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,360
They got a special pickup for it.
It's hazardous.

567
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,320
Oh, yeah?

568
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,480
Let's see what's inside.
Watch your eye.

569
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,160
Funny. Hurry up.

570
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,120
Hold this.

571
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,000
It's a human heart.

572
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,720
Oh, God.

573
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,120
What's going on?

574
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,040
New dude being brought in.

575
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,960
All this for a new fish?

576
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,280
Man, this ain't no fish.
This is the man.

577
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,240
Long time no see, Burke.

578
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,160
Would you like to know
what's out there, Burke?

579
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,160
Would you like to know
what's on the other side?

580
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,320
You know what prisoners hate
more than anything else, Burke?

581
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,000
Prisoners hate cops
more than anything else.

582
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,600
Fucking pigs!

583
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,480
Every killer in this prison...

584
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,400
is gonna know who you are.

585
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,880
And you're not gonna know
when it's coming.

586
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,600
Let him go.

587
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,920
Bring me a dream, Burke.

588
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,200
Bring me a dream.

589
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,880
Hey, you belong to me!

590
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,080
He's a cop!
The only good cop...

591
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,680
I'm gonna rip your eyes out!

592
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,640
Get me some chitlins.

593
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,440
I gotta get outta here!

594
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,720
Get me out of this pen!

595
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,640
You pig!

596
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,800
That's a load of shit you were
giving us. Barrett wasn't your friend.

597
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm trying to stop
what's going on here.

598
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,000
Doesn't that make a difference?

599
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,280
In the cage, man,
a cop is worse than a...

600
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,200
baby raper.

601
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,520
Why are you still here?

602
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,440
You're a dead man.

603
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,640
I need your help.

604
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,520
It's too late.

605
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,360
Miss Beckett,
I've been looking for you.

606
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,640
You stay the hell away from me.

607
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,800
Tom. Excuse me.
I need to speak with you.

608
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,640
- What's wrong?
- It's urgent.

609
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,240
It's about Keane.

610
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,160
Let's go inside.

611
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,840
Now, you want to tell me
what's going on?

612
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,760
We have to get Burke out of there.

613
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,400
Keane has been in on this
the entire time.

614
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,840
Wait. This has to do with it.

615
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,520
<i>- Yeah, Tis, it's me.
- Amanda, listen. </i>

616
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,280
<i>I tried the other point of access. 
The number's 555-6799.</i>

617
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,040
<i>Vogler's house! </i>

618
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,920
I'm sorry, Amanda.
I never wanted this.

619
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,360
Helen and I
really did care about you.

620
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,240
If Helen found out,
it would kill her.

621
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,600
We have to...

622
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,520
keep the bad parts
of our lives private.

623
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,480
Burke proved so resourceful...

624
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,640
that when the others
didn't take care of him...

625
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,720
I had the Sandman transferred there.

626
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,440
Why?

627
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,800
I did it to save her life.

628
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,840
Helen got sick.
She needed a liver.

629
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,240
She couldn't get one.

630
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,880
It didn't matter
how much money I had.

631
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,800
The list was too long.

632
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,560
So I found a doctor.

633
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,120
He said he could get one.

634
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,560
Once he started...

635
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,960
he found you could make
a lot of money selling life.

636
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,480
We're killing criminals.

637
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,080
Garbage.

638
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,280
And after a while...

639
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,680
you stop thinking of them as humans.

640
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,880
Oh, Tom, there you are.

641
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,040
What's going on?

642
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,040
Why don't you tell her, Tom?

643
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,400
Tell her how you murdered for her.

644
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,920
Hey, Burke,
Sandman's comin' to see ya.

645
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,800
You don't have the guts
to come in this cell.

646
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,840
What happened?

647
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,400
- What happened?
- He got Keller!

648
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,120
Jesus Christ!
Secure this door! Grab him!

649
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,280
Bring him too. Come on.

650
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,320
Gene, secure the infirmary.

651
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,520
Well, well,
look who we have here.

652
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,200
Great. Now we have
all the assholes in one room.

653
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,640
You've caused us a great deal
of trouble, Detective Burke.

654
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,080
You scum.

655
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,720
Let me do it.

656
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,480
It's gonna be messy if you
kill an undercover officer.

657
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,240
Go ahead, dust him.

658
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,360
Blow his fuckin' head off!

659
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,440
Come on! Stop playin' around!
Let's get the hell out of here!

660
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,960
Why did you do it?

661
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,880
I don't know.

662
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,520
Maybe I'm goin' soft
in my old age.

663
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,760
Let's just say
I owe somebody somethin'.

664
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,920
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go through the kitchen.

665
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
Quick! The elevator to the kitchen!

666
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,520
Oh, God.

667
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,000
You're just in time
for surgery, Doc.

668
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,560
Let's do it.

669
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,440
- Easy.
- Thanks.

670
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,720
It's going to hurt now, okay?

671
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,640
Yeah. Stop yacking at me.

672
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,400
It's secure.
We're okay for a while.

673
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,360
Can you make it?

674
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,840
- I don't think so.
- He's better off here.

675
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,840
I have to get to the outside.

676
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,680
I'll be back for you.

677
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,640
Just hang on.

678
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,440
Go with him, man.
Make sure he gets to the outside.

679
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,360
Go on! Go on!

680
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,800
I know you're in here, Burke.

681
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,120
You know why?

682
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,400
'Cause I can smell the nigger.

683
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,000
Kiss your black ass good-bye.

684
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,040
Go fuck yourself, you pudgy bastard.

685
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,840
I knew you needed me, brother.

686
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,800
You make a deal with the Priest,
it's for keeps.

687
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,760
It's okay.
You need me more than he does.

688
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,320
Follow me.

689
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,040
We have to take the catwalk
through the boiler room.

690
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,320
That's the only way
to get out to the yard.

691
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,600
Come on, Burke!

692
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Come to Papa!

693
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,400
I'm up here, Burke!

694
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,240
If you leave, Hawkins dies!

695
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,040
Come on!

696
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,040
You like that, Burke?

697
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,440
This is the part I love.

698
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,880
Move, move, move!

699
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,080
Wakey, wakey, Burke.

700
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,800
Time to bleed.

701
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,960
Come on!

702
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,400
Welcome to hell!

703
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,800
Can't kill me, Burke.

704
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,720
I'm the Sandman.

705
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,200
- Let the man through.
- Let him go, man.

706
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,360
- He just dusted the Sandman.
- Open up, man. Let him out.

707
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,480
Let him go by.

708
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,440
You did it, man.

709
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,360
You really did it.
You dusted him.

710
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,200
Open up, man. Open up.
He just kicked up the Sandman.

711
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,960
<i>Back up, vatos. </i>

712
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,840
Clear it out back there.

713
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,880
You got it, homes.

714
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,720
Easy.

715
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,200
This is Hawkins.
He saved my life.

716
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,120
I had to, Burke.

717
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,480
I took a life.
I gave one back.

718
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,800
Maybe now I'm even.

719
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,480
Just watch your ass, 72689.

720
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,400
I won't be there the next time.
