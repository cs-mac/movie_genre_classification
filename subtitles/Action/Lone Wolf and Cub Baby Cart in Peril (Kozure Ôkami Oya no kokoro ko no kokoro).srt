1
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:36,382
Apúrense, cabrones! Rápido!

2
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:41,303
Pásale! Pásale! Échale!

3
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,606
Órale! Échale! Échale!

4
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,630
Órale, muchachos!

5
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,650
Apúrense, muchachos.

6
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,532
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.

7
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,915
You are all under arrest
for horse stealing. Drop your guns.

8
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:34,377
Échale con tu chingada madre, cabrón!

9
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,892
(shouting in Spanish)

10
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:24,427
You gonna steal these horses
back from me? Huh? Policeman?

11
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:27,556
These are my horses!

12
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:31,812
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...

13
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,349
Órale!

14
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:38,108
You'll never get away with this. You can't
kill a policeman. They'll hunt you down.

15
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,561
Hijo de perra!

16
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,781
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

17
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:49,490
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

18
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:56,790
Some of these guys
are a lot taller than me.

19
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,506
A whole head taller.

20
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,839
Pues de la chingada!
Qué está pasando?

21
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:17,056
Hey, you, cabrón! You're hurting my cars,
pendejo! Why you do that?

22
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:20,561
This is JJ McQuade, Texas Ranger.

23
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:22,697
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:25,065
Put 'em down.

25
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,235
- Do not move.
- "Do not move." (cackles)

26
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:36,085
Hey, you. Stand up like a man
so I can see you.

27
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,143
Puta!

28
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,516
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

29
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:04,363
There! You think I care
about your pinche friend now?

30
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,407
Put down your weapon
or I'll shoot this man!

31
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:10,701
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!

32
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:15,498
Better listen to me, cabrón!

33
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:18,544
Right now! Come down!

34
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:22,834
Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! Qué quieres?

35
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:26,917
Ain't no one ever killed no Texas Ranger
and lived to tell it.

36
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:33,591
He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honoured guest some respect.

37
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,767
(laughs)

38
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,791
Echa, hijo puta!

39
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:25,902
I've never seen
a Texas Ranger up close before.

40
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,691
You know,

41
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:32,071
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

42
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:35,074
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

43
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,525
Don't shoot me.

44
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,453
Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

45
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:19,749
Like father, like son.

46
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,751
Come on.

47
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,918
(shouts in Spanish)

48
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:29,010
Get back, kid.
Stay there and I'll cut you loose.

49
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:33,300
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.

50
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:38,094
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.

51
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,016
Chinga a tu madre, puto.

52
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,686
Come on. I'm gonna fix your teeth.

53
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,902
(continues shouting in Spanish)

54
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:04,668
(siren)

55
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:13,342
- (PA) We present to you, Dakota Brown...
- (cheering and applause)

56
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:25,480
For 38 years of unrivalled performance
as a Texas Ranger...

57
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,693
for over 2,000 felony arrests...

58
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,783
(cheering and applause)

59
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:46,212
For serving the great state of Texas
with fearless devotion...

60
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,587
this gold watch...

61
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,097
and honorary plaque.

62
00:12:56,224 --> 00:13:01,432
(Dakota) Hey, how about that?
How about that? Ain't that somethin'?

63
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,603
Dakota.

64
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:07,015
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,065
(snores)

66
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,484
It's a real honour.

67
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:13,615
Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.

68
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:23,664
Thank you, folks. Drive careful
goin' home now, you hear me?

69
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:32,084
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?

70
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:35,303
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.

71
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:38,218
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.

72
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,268
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?

73
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,846
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.

74
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:48,481
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.

75
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,612
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?

76
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,609
My office in ten minutes.

77
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,829
"And you, McQuade..." (laughs)

78
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:06,041
Hey, McQuade.

79
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,134
Hi, there.

80
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:36,652
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.

81
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,989
You think you're pretty damn good,
don't you, McQuade?

82
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:49,416
In case you didn't know it there's more to
being a Texas Ranger than making busts.

83
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:52,797
- You gotta look good doing it.
- (toilet flushes)

84
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,965
Style.

85
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,258
The best always have style.

86
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,736
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.

87
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:22,986
Now, in terms of
unassisted felony arrests,

88
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,159
I admit your record is unrivalled.

89
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:32,746
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.

90
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:37,675
He lives clean
and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.

91
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,260
Read it.

92
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:47,015
It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

93
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,812
I quote: "Ranger JJ McQuade
is a walking symbol

94
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:56,186
of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete and
discriminatory nature of Rangers today."

95
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,865
Unquote.

96
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:05,663
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude
is gonna change.

97
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:12,043
You're going to start cooperating with the
state and federal agencies. Understand?

98
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,379
(knocking at door)

99
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,550
Come in.

100
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:23,386
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.

101
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,385
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.

102
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:31,021
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.

103
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:35,737
You gotta be kidding.

104
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,312
(clears throat)

105
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:41,825
- It'll be an honour workin' with you.
- Forget it, kid. I work alone.

106
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:44,159
Where'd you get that piece?

107
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:47,373
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?

108
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,295
Stay with it, son.

109
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:36,215
Our Russian friends have failed us. We
will have to finance the coup ourselves.

110
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,547
(speaks Spanish)

111
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:41,631
The shipment has to be in Havana
before Wednesday.

112
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,803
Splendid.

113
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,976
Would you like to count it, Senor Wilkes?

114
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:54,641
Trust is the most important thing
in our business.

115
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:57,018
Of course it is.

116
00:17:57,487 --> 00:18:00,275
Now, have the plane loaded at once.

117
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:03,990
I am in a hurry
to get back to Havana, Senor Wilkes.

118
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,779
Quickly, now.

119
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:25,176
That quick enough?

120
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:33,645
Bury them.

121
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,249
Ranger?

122
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,798
Ranger?

123
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,777
Good dog. Good wolf.

124
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,579
Good boy. Good wolf.

125
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,831
(whistles)

126
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,588
Chingao.

127
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:41,669
What a pisshouse.

128
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:46,840
Ranger?

129
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,986
What are you doing here?

130
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:05,858
I came to wake you up.
I'm your new partner, remember?

131
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,830
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.

132
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:12,031
But Captain Tyler...

133
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,917
Tell Tyler to shove it!

134
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,952
Chinga a su madre!

135
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,874
Holy shit.

136
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,870
Hey, Ranger, I'd like to apologise.

137
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:35,075
I didn't mean to barge in on you
this morning.

138
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,968
You can't outrun me. I got superchargers.

139
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,138
Oh, yeah?

140
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,894
Supercharge this.

141
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:04,312
(Kayo) Damn!

142
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:09,613
Oh, piss.

143
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,950
Dammit, Ranger!

144
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,290
Aaah! Oh, sh... Aaargh!

145
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,308
La pura pinche madre!

146
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:39,226
Pinche cabrón, Ranger.

147
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,863
Daddy!

148
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:56,665
- Daddy, hey!
- Hey, sugar.

149
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:02,045
Hey, what's this, huh?

150
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:05,919
- About time you stopped by.
- I thought you might like to go riding.

151
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,208
- You mean it?
- I'm takin' the day off.

152
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,253
All right!

153
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,795
- I didn't know you took days off.
- Hi, Molly.

154
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:16,680
- Where have you been, stranger?
- I've been real busy.

155
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,559
- Oh, boy. Same old trouble?
- My kinda trouble doesn't take vacations.

156
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:25,019
- Aren't you gonna tell Dad the big news?
- Oh, honey.

157
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:26,812
Mom, I...

158
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,697
What news?

159
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:34,569
- Jim, I got a real good job in Las Cruces.
- Las Cruces?

160
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,195
We're gonna move there in two weeks.

161
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:41,959
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.

162
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:45,372
I'm an independent woman now
and I got my own life to live.

163
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:48,341
I know, but you can
make your life right here.

164
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,385
- Oh, Jim.
- (car pulls up)

165
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:55,973
One day you're gonna meet some real
nice gal who won't mind sitting up nights,

166
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,312
waitin' to see if you're
gonna come home in one piece.

167
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:04,103
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's a nice town, it'll be good for Sally.

168
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,565
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.

169
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,614
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Bobby Drew.

170
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,118
Boyfriend?

171
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:21,449
I heard a lot about you. You were in the
Marines, won a Silver Star and everything.

172
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,540
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

173
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:35,588
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope
you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?

174
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,716
Uh, yeah, sure.

175
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,805
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

176
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,401
Bye. See you later.

177
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,484
Bye, Mom! See ya!

178
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,314
(Sally) I'm ready to take Foxy out now.

179
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,611
- (Dakota) Just be patient.
- OK.

180
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,567
All right. I'm ready to go.

181
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,986
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

182
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,406
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

183
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,458
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

184
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,123
Hey. How'd you like to
bite that in the butt,

185
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:53,381
develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?

186
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,428
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

187
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,299
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

188
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,184
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

189
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,649
just before he got himself squashed
in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

190
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:10,724
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

191
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,938
But nobody can prove it.

192
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:17,651
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.

193
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,870
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

194
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,408
- Sally!
- Foxy!

195
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,589
- Sally!
- Help me!

196
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,675
Help!

197
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,438
It's all right. It's OK.

198
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,735
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

199
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,445
Thank you.

200
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,284
- What's your name?
- Sally.

201
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,701
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

202
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:13,459
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

203
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:17,043
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

204
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,088
(car horn)

205
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:34,027
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

206
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,155
And now you're my partner.

207
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,153
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

208
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,492
Pretty good.

209
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,408
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

210
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,032
Is that right?

211
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,041
Ranger Brown. Sally.

212
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,256
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

213
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:04,847
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

214
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:09,686
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

215
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:14,311
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

216
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:16,817
Good.

217
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:36,546
Hey, Foxy.

218
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,960
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

219
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:45,806
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

220
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:48,177
Gallop. Let's go.

221
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,193
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

222
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:06,154
But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see

223
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:13,661
There's a woman from El Paso and I
know she will be comin' here this evening

224
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:21,294
She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'

225
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:26,057
There's another girl from Dallas...

226
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:31,596
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

227
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:33,771
Forget it.

228
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:37,103
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

229
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:54,418
(woman) It's Rawley showing off.

230
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:05,839
This should be very interesting.

231
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:14,867
I see we are graced with the presence
of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.

232
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,548
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

233
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:33,517
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

234
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:55,497
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.

235
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:58,165
You are a greaser, aren't you?

236
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:23,401
Excuse me a minute.

237
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:28,360
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

238
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,570
Let me show you.

239
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:35,872
Come on, tough guy.

240
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:02,610
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

241
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,524
Do you wanna join the fun?

242
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:17,369
This is not my idea of fun!

243
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,211
Please let me apologise. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

244
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:29,428
Maybe you need some new friends.

245
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,092
Music! Play!

246
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:38,143
(cackles)

247
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:48,531
This was my party.

248
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,700
We should have booked those bastards.

249
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,666
If I locked up every guy who took a swing
at me, half the county'd be behind bars.

250
00:33:59,794 --> 00:34:04,207
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

251
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:08,588
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

252
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,472
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

253
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:23,690
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

254
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,075
I'll drive.

255
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,831
Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.

256
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,461
Not too popular, are you?

257
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,969
They understand me.

258
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,934
Por favor.

259
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:01,604
Una botella de mezcal, dos limones
y si me puede limpiar la mesa. Gracias.

260
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,305
- Mezcal?
- Yes.

261
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:11,152
How about a kiss, baby?

262
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,449
Excuse me.

263
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:20,287
Time to leave.

264
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,086
Watch out!

265
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:42,182
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.

266
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:47,607
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.

267
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:50,442
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.

268
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,907
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.

269
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:56,443
OK.

270
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,073
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!

271
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:01,290
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.

272
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,418
(trucks starting up)

273
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:08,674
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.

274
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,757
Stay here.

275
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,925
Bobby?

276
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,484
(gunfire)

277
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:31,771
Holy shit.

278
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,491
Let's get out of here.

279
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,624
Get down.

280
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,669
What do you guys want?

281
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,257
No!

282
00:36:57,391 --> 00:37:00,060
Bobby! No!

283
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:06,144
(screaming and sobbing)

284
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,528
See you around.

285
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,234
(woman on radio) Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?

286
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:42,825
- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, 6R1.

287
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:47,417
We've got a multiple fatality and injury
on I-10 south of Estelline.

288
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,667
I'm going home. Is there anyone closer?

289
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:54,125
Negative. You'd better go. We've been
notified that your daughter's involved.

290
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:56,298
- My daughter?
- (siren)

291
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,268
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.

292
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:11,564
Ranger! Wait!

293
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,358
Please. She needs rest.

294
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:23,944
She was very lucky.

295
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,836
Bobby...

296
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,143
Bueno.

297
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,689
(siren)

298
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:10,835
Howdy, Ranger.

299
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:13,797
The feds. They've taken over.

300
00:40:13,923 --> 00:40:16,496
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.

301
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:19,339
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.

302
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,673
I'm sorry about your daughter,
but this is a federal case.

303
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:25,096
From now on, it's out of your jurisdiction.

304
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:28,097
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.

305
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,557
Excuse me. Get it to the lab. I want a
ballistics report. Let's see what we got.

306
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:37,529
I guess this is his show.

307
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:42,483
There were pages blowin'
all over the place when I got here.

308
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:45,489
I kept this one.

309
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:48,457
It's a logbook page from an army convoy.

310
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,622
Fort Nelson.

311
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:52,623
Ranger?

312
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:06,048
- Hello. Lieutenant Dade, Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.

313
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:11,938
I'm calling to verify that shipment
number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

314
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:13,690
Yes, sir, it certainly did.

315
00:41:13,817 --> 00:41:17,731
- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.

316
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:19,939
- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.

317
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:22,279
- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.

318
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,283
(knock at door)

319
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:27,661
- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?

320
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,743
- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?

321
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,118
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?

322
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:35,958
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?

323
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:39,209
I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.

324
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:42,344
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

325
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,597
Follow me.

326
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:59,186
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

327
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:02,441
- Who?
- The military central computer.

328
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:06,904
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

329
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:18,377
- Shit. - If you get it figured
out, kid, let me know.

330
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:22,719
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

331
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:26,635
I got it.

332
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:33,640
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

333
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:37,932
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

334
00:42:41,697 --> 00:42:45,861
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

335
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:10,933
(McQuade) Here's our little Judas goat.

336
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:20,599
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

337
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:23,144
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

338
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:26,982
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

339
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:35,786
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

340
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:37,830
Let's go.

341
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,098
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

342
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,767
What?

343
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,287
You're learning, kid.

344
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:31,470
I see I got a lot more to learn.

345
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,435
Come on, kid.

346
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:36,601
Son of a bitch.

347
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,120
Whoops.

348
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,711
Senora?

349
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:09,426
Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?

350
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:12,888
Gracias.

351
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,255
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

352
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:52,547
Watch it!

353
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:19,822
Round the front.

354
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:27,251
Muchas gracias.

355
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:11,840
Goddammit! Shit!

356
00:48:04,232 --> 00:48:06,059
Don't!

357
00:48:11,406 --> 00:48:14,323
- No! No!
- Come on!

358
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:16,906
(Snow moans and whimpers)

359
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:28,833
Come on.

360
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:32,216
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

361
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:36,970
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

362
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:48,270
You're gettin' more slippery all the time,
ain't you?

363
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:52,613
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

364
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:59,412
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

365
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:06,460
(Snow) You son of a bitch!

366
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:08,793
Can I borrow that contraption?

367
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:13,551
Sure.

368
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:33,273
What are you gonna do?

369
00:49:47,169 --> 00:49:48,913
Stop! Wait!

370
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:53,749
(Dakota) Got something to say, pissant?

371
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:57,799
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

372
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,508
Emilio Falcon?

373
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,807
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

374
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:06,518
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

375
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:11,440
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

376
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:21,493
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico, to
Central America, to terrorists and stuff!

377
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,029
All over the place.

378
00:50:24,165 --> 00:50:26,122
I don't know.

379
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:30,663
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

380
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:34,586
Please? Please?

381
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:37,588
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

382
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:43,724
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

383
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:53,393
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.

384
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:56,233
It has been my pleasure, JJ.

385
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:02,949
Hang onto him till I get back.

386
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,614
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Senor Falcon.

387
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,664
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

388
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,835
Bueno.

389
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:20,304
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

390
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:25,555
(Snow) What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.

391
00:51:43,204 --> 00:51:45,243
(singing)

392
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,953
What the hell...?

393
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:54,127
Damn!

394
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:58,838
(singing and sound of vacuum cleaner)

395
00:52:08,312 --> 00:52:10,768
(she sings loudly)

396
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,767
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

397
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:19,853
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

398
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:25,614
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

399
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:27,739
What's this?

400
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,913
Vitamins.

401
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:34,495
Where's my beer?

402
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:38,337
In the garbage.

403
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:55,559
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

404
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:00,736
Lady...

405
00:53:00,865 --> 00:53:05,492
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

406
00:53:14,963 --> 00:53:18,130
Fine. That's just fine.

407
00:53:18,258 --> 00:53:20,298
Adios.

408
00:53:24,556 --> 00:53:26,383
(door slams)

409
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,261
Shit.

410
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:38,193
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

411
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,115
Look, uh...

412
00:53:47,454 --> 00:53:50,539
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

413
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,749
What I mean is...

414
00:53:57,131 --> 00:53:59,586
Lola, I...

415
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:04,092
I'm sorry.

416
00:54:07,975 --> 00:54:12,851
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

417
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,980
Yeah, I know.

418
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,238
(she sobs)

419
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:36,374
Hey! I'm not the trash.

420
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:45,178
OK, you're asking for it.

421
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:54,227
OK. Here.

422
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:30,388
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

423
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:32,344
Hey.

424
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:52,320
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

425
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:55,740
As you can see, mine's bigger.

426
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:58,414
Mine's loaded.

427
00:55:58,545 --> 00:55:59,624
(laughs)

428
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:04,464
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

429
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:06,586
- (buzzer)
- Damn!

430
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,760
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

431
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:13,551
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

432
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:17,518
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

433
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:20,565
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

434
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,018
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.

435
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:27,981
However the certain party who is stealing
the guns was once a close friend of mine.

436
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:31,367
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

437
00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:34,698
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...

438
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:40,705
Why am I telling you this? You will find
these things out for yourself in good time.

439
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:45,666
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.

440
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:51,306
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

441
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:57,636
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having
a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.

442
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:05,401
(Falcon) Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.

443
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,357
I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now. (cackles)

444
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:17,207
- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.

445
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,536
That line's been reported out of order.

446
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,378
Mm-hm.

447
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,921
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

448
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,135
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

449
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:33,971
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

450
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,635
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

451
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:41,030
You didn't win here. I'm gonna
take a little bit of your money.

452
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:43,856
How much this time?

453
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:48,030
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.

454
00:57:48,156 --> 00:57:50,564
Sit still, boy!

455
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:55,447
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.

456
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,044
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly

457
00:57:58,045 --> 00:58:01,001
inferior to mine, but
you're going to like it.

458
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:05,588
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

459
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:08,503
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

460
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:12,503
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

461
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:18,310
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

462
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:22,055
You don't play cards, you play people.

463
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,682
Loose lips sink ships.

464
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:27,060
You understand?

465
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:29,983
I thought you would.

466
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:33,449
I just play the cards good and tight.

467
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,581
Oh, fuck!

468
00:58:43,712 --> 00:58:45,752
(siren)

469
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:07,525
(cracking)

470
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,204
(Snow screams) No! Don't kill me!

471
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,501
(Kayo) Dakota! You all right?

472
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,836
Dakota! Answer me!

473
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,650
Kayo.

474
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:50,874
Kayo?

475
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:27,874
It's OK, kid.

476
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:40,555
Captain.

477
01:01:40,683 --> 01:01:43,719
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

478
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:48,933
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

479
01:01:50,693 --> 01:01:53,480
- Feds.
- You better read this.

480
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,858
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

481
01:01:59,994 --> 01:02:03,862
You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

482
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:08,292
They provide every damn terrorist
organisation in the world with our guns.

483
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:11,207
I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.

484
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:16,334
You withheld evidence, harboured
a key witness in a federal investigation,

485
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:21,546
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

486
01:02:21,683 --> 01:02:24,008
I've no choice but to put you on probation.

487
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:28,853
You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

488
01:02:28,982 --> 01:02:31,105
You want my star, Captain?

489
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:34,437
That won't be necessary. Not yet.

490
01:03:08,564 --> 01:03:11,233
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?

491
01:03:24,246 --> 01:03:26,073
Jim...

492
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,634
What's wrong?

493
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:44,760
Nothing worth talking about.

494
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:13,161
Hey.

495
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:14,661
Hey.

496
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:17,039
Are you OK?

497
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:21,924
Yeah, I'm OK.

498
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:09,724
(wolf growls)

499
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:54,101
Lola!

500
01:06:00,988 --> 01:06:05,033
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.

501
01:06:10,456 --> 01:06:12,283
Damn.

502
01:06:46,618 --> 01:06:48,657
(he yells)

503
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:06,296
Jim?

504
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:20,020
Come on. Let's go home.

505
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,744
I'll see you soon, honey.

506
01:07:37,878 --> 01:07:42,006
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.

507
01:07:44,926 --> 01:07:47,299
I don't wanna leave you.

508
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,687
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

509
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,398
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

510
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:08,988
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

511
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,163
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

512
01:09:09,554 --> 01:09:13,504
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

513
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:17,591
Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

514
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:21,857
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

515
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:27,404
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

516
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,777
See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

517
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:32,859
Get to the point.

518
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:37,288
(Jackson) I know they got a drop-off point
somewhere between here and Big Bend.

519
01:09:37,415 --> 01:09:42,042
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.

520
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:56,466
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

521
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:08,106
(McQuade) There are no roads up here.

522
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:25,128
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.

523
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:28,209
We'd better turn back.

524
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,269
See somethin'?

525
01:10:44,483 --> 01:10:46,559
Take us down over there.

526
01:10:51,532 --> 01:10:56,657
There's been some activity here. Pretty
well-organised for the middle of nowhere.

527
01:10:56,787 --> 01:11:00,073
There's nothing
indicated here on the map.

528
01:11:08,299 --> 01:11:10,042
What's goin' on?

529
01:11:10,593 --> 01:11:13,879
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

530
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:50,006
(Kayo) Well, Ranger, how does it feel
to be baby-sitting Burnside?

531
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,706
(McQuade) Candy-ass feds.

532
01:12:13,281 --> 01:12:16,733
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

533
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:21,365
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine
by me. - Who the hell does he think he is?

534
01:12:21,498 --> 01:12:26,837
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

535
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:30,212
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?

536
01:12:54,448 --> 01:12:57,200
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

537
01:12:59,703 --> 01:13:02,989
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

538
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,792
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

539
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,996
What the hell...?

540
01:13:10,131 --> 01:13:11,126
Hang on.

541
01:13:11,257 --> 01:13:16,417
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

542
01:14:21,828 --> 01:14:24,497
Let's go.

543
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:29,807
A real pretty setup, huh?

544
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:33,692
It's been too easy.

545
01:15:37,988 --> 01:15:41,488
Let's check around
before we make a move.

546
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:44,952
Burnside, hold it.

547
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,822
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

548
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:49,791
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

549
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,874
Get down!

550
01:16:05,516 --> 01:16:08,268
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

551
01:16:08,394 --> 01:16:12,641
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

552
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:52,809
You son of a bitch!

553
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:07,825
Now this is my idea of fun.

554
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:10,614
Rawley, that's enough!

555
01:17:10,749 --> 01:17:15,826
Look, darling. I have a surprise for you.
One of your new friends.

556
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:19,163
Rawley, please! Rawley!

557
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:21,969
I waited a long time for this.

558
01:17:22,094 --> 01:17:25,510
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

559
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:30,799
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

560
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:34,513
Get her out of here.

561
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:42,234
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

562
01:17:45,451 --> 01:17:48,202
Pick him up.

563
01:17:59,924 --> 01:18:02,296
Put him in it.

564
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:39,744
Something to remember you by.

565
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,840
Adios.

566
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,649
Freeze, assholes!

567
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,227
Ranger!

568
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,648
You son of a bitch!

569
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:08,652
Ranger!

570
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,911
Ranger?

571
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,707
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!

572
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:28,213
Get me a beer, kid.

573
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:31,842
Yes, sir!

574
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:51,359
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?

575
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:08,042
Whose idea was this, anyway?

576
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:27,853
(groans)

577
01:23:40,769 --> 01:23:44,813
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

578
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,233
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.

579
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:53,821
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

580
01:23:56,993 --> 01:23:58,785
Oh, Jim.

581
01:24:01,748 --> 01:24:04,702
I'll take care of this.

582
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:09,583
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr" McQuade?
May I come in, please?

583
01:24:09,714 --> 01:24:13,130
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.

584
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:19,630
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.

585
01:24:19,766 --> 01:24:24,428
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.

586
01:24:24,563 --> 01:24:28,228
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!

587
01:24:28,358 --> 01:24:31,727
It's his way of saying
he would enjoy your company again.

588
01:24:31,862 --> 01:24:33,938
I want my daughter back, Falcon.

589
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:41,868
Please, please. I'm more than willing
to help you retrieve your loved one,

590
01:24:41,997 --> 01:24:44,832
providing, of course,
that you return the favour.

591
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,331
What's your deal?

592
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:51,625
I will tell you precisely where
you can find Mr Wilkes and your daughter.

593
01:24:51,757 --> 01:24:56,834
However, in return I would like
certain assets of mine protected.

594
01:24:56,971 --> 01:25:00,007
I wish to claim what is mine.

595
01:25:00,599 --> 01:25:02,556
Jim...

596
01:25:02,685 --> 01:25:05,057
Anything. Please.

597
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:53,518
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.

598
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:56,773
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.

599
01:25:56,906 --> 01:26:00,406
- Hold on. I'm comin'.
- It's not your fight.

600
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:06,744
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!

601
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:39,271
Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.

602
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,196
Gracias. Muchas gracias.

603
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,702
- Se lo lleno, senor?
- Sí.

604
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:54,414
Vaya con Dios. God protect you.

605
01:26:57,676 --> 01:26:59,716
(all murmuring)

606
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:08,391
Senor?

607
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,308
They are wishing you well.

608
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:32,035
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?

609
01:27:54,817 --> 01:27:58,269
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.

610
01:27:58,404 --> 01:28:00,029
(car approaches)

611
01:28:00,156 --> 01:28:02,445
You gotta be kidding.

612
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,494
Hey. You guys remember me?

613
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:10,658
How we gonna
smuggle him back to Texas?

614
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:12,203
That's your problem.

615
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,153
Can you make it?

616
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,527
I didn't come this far
just to drop dead on the trail, did I?

617
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:47,744
It's all downhill from here on.

618
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:07,338
OK!

619
01:29:21,363 --> 01:29:23,688
We split up from here. Stick to the plan.

620
01:29:23,824 --> 01:29:26,113
- Right.
- Good luck.

621
01:30:30,475 --> 01:30:33,974
Hello, Sally. How you doing?

622
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:39,608
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?

623
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:40,730
Rawley...

624
01:30:46,658 --> 01:30:49,030
Daddy! Daddy!

625
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:58,328
Jim...

626
01:31:00,005 --> 01:31:02,792
I'm so happy you're alive.

627
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:20,690
Where do you think you're going, dude?

628
01:31:24,071 --> 01:31:27,155
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough
round here. - McQuade.

629
01:31:46,385 --> 01:31:48,757
Get that crap off.

630
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:08,562
Let's get out of here.

631
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:18,583
- (Sally screams)
- Sally! Sally!

632
01:32:20,628 --> 01:32:23,000
Remember me, greaser?

633
01:32:28,344 --> 01:32:31,345
Yeah. I never forget an asshole.

634
01:32:37,854 --> 01:32:39,182
Stay here.

635
01:33:14,933 --> 01:33:17,222
Oh, shit.

636
01:33:17,352 --> 01:33:18,976
Dammit.

637
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,042
Agh!

638
01:33:49,926 --> 01:33:51,302
Come on. Come on.

639
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,076
Damn! I knew I forgot something.

640
01:34:45,816 --> 01:34:47,856
(clang)

641
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:24,391
Welcome to my hacienda, Mr McQuade.

642
01:35:26,191 --> 01:35:29,061
How nice of you to pay a social visit.

643
01:36:22,748 --> 01:36:24,372
Daddy!

644
01:37:19,514 --> 01:37:21,340
Daddy!

645
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,759
Come on.

646
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:28,012
- Daddy!
- No! Sally! Sally!

647
01:37:28,147 --> 01:37:30,140
No! Stop it!

648
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:42,778
(yells)

649
01:37:46,124 --> 01:37:48,829
Sally! Sally...

650
01:38:49,563 --> 01:38:52,315
Are you all right, honey?

651
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:00,819
Gimme that gun.

652
01:39:00,949 --> 01:39:04,200
- McQuade!
- Rawley! No!

653
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:17,087
Come on.

654
01:39:22,346 --> 01:39:24,386
Jim...

655
01:39:24,515 --> 01:39:27,053
I didn't betray you.

656
01:39:30,604 --> 01:39:36,026
Rawley killed my husband
and forced me to be his partner.

657
01:39:36,152 --> 01:39:39,735
I had no choice. He would have killed me.

658
01:39:49,165 --> 01:39:51,917
I love you.

659
01:40:10,144 --> 01:40:11,936
Hey, McQuade!

660
01:40:47,224 --> 01:40:49,051
Daddy...

661
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:16,043
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?

662
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:20,037
Don't move, don't talk,
and everything will be just fine.

663
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:23,671
We made a deal, McQuade.

664
01:41:23,802 --> 01:41:26,756
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.

665
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:31,304
You wanna try for three?

666
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:38,434
McQuade, wait. Wait!

667
01:41:38,567 --> 01:41:41,734
You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?

668
01:41:41,862 --> 01:41:47,023
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.

669
01:41:49,328 --> 01:41:52,199
You can't leave me! McQuade!

670
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:53,873
McQuade!

671
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,957
Wait! McQuade!

672
01:41:56,085 --> 01:41:59,620
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!

673
01:41:59,755 --> 01:42:03,374
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!

674
01:42:16,355 --> 01:42:20,733
Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

675
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,695
And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

676
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:26,609
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

677
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:30,490
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

678
01:42:33,206 --> 01:42:38,366
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

679
01:42:38,503 --> 01:42:43,081
I feel responsible for every move he's
made. After all, I taught him all he knows.

680
01:42:43,216 --> 01:42:46,799
- He has style. The best always have style.
- Bullshit.

681
01:42:46,928 --> 01:42:48,968
Daddy!

682
01:42:49,097 --> 01:42:51,588
- Dad!
- That's my girl.

683
01:42:53,018 --> 01:42:56,387
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

684
01:42:56,521 --> 01:42:58,099
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

685
01:42:58,231 --> 01:43:01,683
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

686
01:43:01,818 --> 01:43:05,401
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

687
01:43:09,409 --> 01:43:12,280
Oh, boy. Here we go.

688
01:43:12,412 --> 01:43:13,954
(siren)

689
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:24,131
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

690
01:43:24,258 --> 01:43:27,461
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

691
01:43:27,594 --> 01:43:31,046
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

692
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:34,806
Daddy?

693
01:43:38,856 --> 01:43:41,228
Hostages?

694
01:43:45,738 --> 01:43:47,398
Daddy?

695
01:43:47,531 --> 01:43:49,571
Are you comin'?

696
01:43:52,369 --> 01:43:55,904
See you later. Let's go.

697
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,827
JJ McQuade, you'll never change!

698
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:07,046
Oh, hell.

699
01:44:08:000 --> 01:44:09:000
