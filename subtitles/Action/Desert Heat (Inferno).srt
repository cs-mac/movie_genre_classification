as well be six feet under the ground.

The prison business is not
what made this company profitable.

I could have
20 Frankensteins around the globe.

How would the fans know which one was real?

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,590
Frankenstein won his fourth race today.

74
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,760
One more win, he goes free.

75

That's a fact that every fan knows.

Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,

77

you're going to lose your audience.

that Frankenstein loses,

well, son, I guess there's a first time.
