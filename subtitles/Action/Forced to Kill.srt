1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,739
Josh:<i> Hey, John.</i>

2
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,774
How you doing, man?
It's Josh.

3
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:11,176
Hey, listen, I know we were supposed
to close our deal tomorrow,

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,711
but you've been a loyal client
for a long time,

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:16,115
and I wanted to reach out
and kinda offer you a deal.

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,388
I'll take 20% off the top.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,622
I'll even take my commission off

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,424
if you wanna close today
and sell it tomorrow.

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,092
I know we have our meeting
set for tomorrow,

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,761
but I thought I'd offer
you this because,

11
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,723
you know, you've been such
a loyal client of ours.

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,504
Listen, we're set for tomorrow
if that's what you want.

13
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,372
I just wanted to
kind of give you

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,641
a heads up and see
if you were interested

15
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,276
in saving a few bucks.

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,417
It's not, it's not.

17
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,586
It's really, it's just one
of those transactions

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,555
that will, you know,
kinda help you out,

19
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,257
and help us out at
the same time, you know.

20
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,957
You know, we've been friends
a long time,

21
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:02,677
so I thought maybe you'd be interested
in something like this. But...

22
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,401
Yeah, I know.
But I mean, I just...

23
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,537
I thought maybe it would
be easier for you,

24
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,738
for tax purposes or whatever.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,139
We could just, like, bang it out

26
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,308
and take care of it right now.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,278
All right.
If that's what you want,

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,345
that's what we'll do.

29
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,580
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

30
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,681
Take care.

31
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,417
Fuck!

32
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,368
Man: All right, I call.

33
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,272
I'm in.

34
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,407
For two.

35
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,647
Man: Two hundred.

36
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,218
Come on, Jerry, let's go.

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,488
Man:
Man! Shit.

38
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,496
I don't wanna rush you, Jerry.

39
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,763
Give me a fucking break already.

40
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,165
If you're looking
for a slower game,

41
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,527
there's a rest home
down the block.

42
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,472
Mel, when you brought
this guy to my game,

43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,207
you said he was a strong player.

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,742
I didn't realize
you meant strong

45
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,711
like a rock that just
sits there.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,715
His name is Joshua,

47
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:30,883
not Jerry.

48
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:31,783
Who gives a fuck?

49
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,253
Make your fucking
decision already.

50
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,223
No.

51
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,392
I'm out.

52
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,861
Surprise, surprise. I'm
glad I waited for that one.

53
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,173
You all right?

54
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,644
I can't do this.
I'm not doing this, Mel.

55
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,950
Come on, you guys.

56
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,752
Let's just go.
One more round.

57
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,923
You're the boss.

58
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,925
Nick: You're pieces of work,
you know?

59
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,433
You take a deep breath

60
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,304
and you do what you gotta do.

61
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,508
Or you will never see
your family again.

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,314
All right, gentlemen.

63
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,749
I gotta go.

64
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,918
Punch me out, will you, kid?

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,386
Nick: Where you
going, Melly?

66
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,889
It's time. It's time.
All right.

67
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,357
What's going on, Mel?

68
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,959
Oh, I'll see you next time,
all right?

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,414
Always a pleasure, my friend.

70
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,483
Oh, you know you're my favorite.

71
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,751
You straighten this guy out?

72
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,286
All taken care of.

73
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,354
All right.

74
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,688
I want you to know something.

75
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,956
I'm making this a regular game.

76
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,460
I want you to hear that from me.

77
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,732
That's not gonna be a problem
with you and your boss, is it?

78
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,468
No.

79
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,902
There's plenty
for everybody, right?

80
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,504
That's exactly right.

81
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,874
Love you, Melly.

82
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,009
Me, too.

83
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,046
What the fuck?

84
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,112
Mmm.

85
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,747
You ready for a few more hands?

86
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,817
Yeah, sure.
Where do I gotta be?

87
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,519
Ah, see, that's the problem
with the old guys.

88
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,801
They're always
crapped out early.

89
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,856
Want some blow?

90
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,558
Yeah. I do.

91
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,429
Mmm. Get in there.

92
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,034
Good man.

93
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,539
Look at you.

94
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,074
Five card draw, no bullshit.

95
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,479
Wow. Who is this guy?

96
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,686
So, uh, how do you know Mel?

97
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,922
She's my bookie.

98
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,123
Hey, how's that
working out for you?

99
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,823
Not very well.

100
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,826
Mmm. You don't want to get
in too deep with

101
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,694
with that ball buster
and her boss.

102
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,730
Trust me.

103
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,831
Tell me about it.

104
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,945
You want a drink?

105
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,013
I'm good.

106
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,649
Yeah?

107
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,165
I'm all in.

108
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,202
What's going on, Jerry?

109
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,204
It's Joshua.

110
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,574
Who gives a fuck?

111
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,775
You have something?

112
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,076
Raise your bet.

113
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,164
You know, I'm starting
up my own book.

114
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
The terms are gonna be
a little more favorable.

115
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,568
At least as first.

116
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,769
Yeah?
How does that work?

117
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,037
You kick off money
to the old guy?

118
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,939
Fuck the old guys.

119
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,875
They can suck
my big, fat Greek cock.

120
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,245
What are they gonna do?
Come after me?

121
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,779
Let 'em try.

122
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,214
My uncle's gonna fucking
skin them alive.

123
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,582
I'm gonna take one.

124
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,558
Let's go again.

125
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,762
How much?

126
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,143
All right. Go ahead.
Get out of here.

127
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,839
Are you gonna be all right?

128
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,693
Well...

129
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,684
Let's go again.

130
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,023
Where do I have to be?

131
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,559
When did you get home?

132
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,395
What's going on? It's
7:00 in the morning.

133
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,496
I know.

134
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,865
Good morning.

135
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,407
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

136
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,653
Why don't we go somewhere
we can talk?

137
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,749
I'll be right back.

138
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,949
What do you mean
you'll be right back?

139
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,752
You're supposed to help me
with Lucy's play date.

140
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,087
I know. I'm just gonna grab
a cup of coffee with him,

141
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,789
and I'll be back
in a few minutes.

142
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,390
No. Why?
What do you...

143
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,326
Why? Who is this?
Who are you?

144
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,460
His name is Alexander.

145
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,928
He's a business associate.

146
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,263
And we'll be back
in a few minutes.

147
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,831
Everything is fine.

148
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,999
I promise.

149
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,002
What's going on?

150
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,771
What did you get into? What
are you not telling me?

151
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,239
Nothing.

152
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,341
I did everything right.

153
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,943
I will tell you everything
as soon as I get back, okay?

154
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,447
I love you.

155
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,953
So, what the fuck happened?

156
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,595
You have no idea
what happened last night.

157
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,557
I got all your money back.

158
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,093
But I got all your money back.

159
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,995
You know what I'm saying?
I couldn't lose.

160
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,063
You should have seen him, man.

161
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,132
I cleaned this guy out.

162
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,901
I was pulling flushes and
straights out of my ass.

163
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,505
You know? And then, as soon
as I got enough money,

164
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,875
for the first time in my
miserable life, I stood up.

165
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,944
I stood up and walked
the fuck out of there.

166
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,413
And you know how much
force of will that took?

167
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,985
Did you get the gun?

168
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,155
Yeah. It's right here.

169
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,528
This gun hasn't been fired.

170
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,828
You're not listening to me, man.

171
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,965
I got the money. I didn't
need to use the gun.

172
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,433
You know?

173
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,369
The time to get my money
was last week.

174
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,204
We had a different deal.

175
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,504
I thought you understood that.

176
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,408
I thought you understood that
wasn't a fucking option anymore.

177
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,644
What are you, fucking
playing games with me now?

178
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm not a... I'm not a killer.
You know what I mean?

179
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,215
I'm an accountant.
I got the money.

180
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,315
What else do you want from me?

181
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,518
I want you to do what you
said you would fucking do.

182
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,155
But I guess for a...

183
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,492
Fucking spineless
degenerate fuck like you,

184
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,428
that's kinda hard
to comprehend, right?

185
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,728
Like you did to
your fucking wife.

186
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,565
"Right. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna
help you with the kids honey.

187
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,165
"Oh, yeah." Bullshit, right?

188
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,435
You never had any fucking intention
to help her out, did you?

189
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,305
Come on. Between you and I.
Did you? You didn't fucking...

190
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,641
I got you...
Did you?

191
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,175
Were you gonna
help your wife today?

192
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,410
Were you gonna help her?

193
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,113
No. See?

194
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,249
What else do you want?

195
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,618
I want you to fucking do
what you said you would do.

196
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,587
Do you know the coordination,

197
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,190
the favors to get this
fucking gun there for you,

198
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,026
so you can do what you
said you wold do?

199
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,360
Do you know what all that took?

200
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,628
I tried. I tried to do it.
I couldn't.

201
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,931
I'm sorry. You tried?
Okay, you tried.

202
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,099
Well, you know what?
Fuck your trying.

203
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,635
I tried, all right. I tried.
I just couldn't do it.

204
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,170
You couldn't do it?
No, I couldn't.

205
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,205
That's where you and I
are different, scumbag.

206
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,408
'Cause I say I'm gonna
fucking do something,

207
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,343
and I do it.

208
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,448
Let's get the fuck out of here.

209
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,243
Mom, where's dad?

210
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,679
I don't know, honey.

211
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,683
When is he coming back?

212
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,322
Uh...
I'm not sure.

213
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,228
Can we facetime him?

214
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,432
No, sweetie, we can't
facetime him.

215
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,034
Why not?

216
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,740
Because he's not in a place where
we can do that right now, okay?

217
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,652
Can I have some more OJ?

218
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,290
Sure.

219
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,497
Lucy: Yeah, but I don't
know anyone.

220
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,632
I wanna get some more blocks.

221
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,267
I don't know, sweetheart.

222
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,069
No, I want it now.

223
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,604
I'm not sure.

224
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,105
I love you, mom.

225
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,430
Joshua?

226
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,737
Joshua?

227
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,757
Hello?

228
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,593
No. No, thank you.

229
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,688
Sorry, I couldn't help you.

230
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,490
Look. I know he hangs out
here sometimes.

231
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,658
Are you sure he's not inside?

232
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm sure, honey.

233
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,762
I don't know what to tell you.
We haven't seen him.

234
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,736
Mel: We haven't seen him.

235
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,711
What did you tell her?

236
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,553
I told her I didn't know
where her husband was.

237
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,682
Ready?

238
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,517
Yeah.

239
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,259
Thanks, bud.

240
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,101
Can you close the door
on your way out, please?

241
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,802
Let's be civilized.

242
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,448
You know, I don't need this
petty bullshit right now.

243
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,987
We're in the middle of
a fucking shitstorm.

244
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,522
And you both know it,

245
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,824
and then you come to me
with this kind of shit?

246
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,393
I just want what's right.

247
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,796
He can set up a game in any
other fucking neighborhood.

248
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,664
You want what's right?

249
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,434
I'll tell you what the fuck
is right.

250
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,935
What's right is that you go out

251
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,238
and you get the guy
who did Frankie.

252
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,906
That's what's right.
This whole town

253
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,709
is ready to go to war
because of it.

254
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,311
And excuse me, pardon me

255
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,914
if I don't give a shit
about your petty bullshit,

256
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,816
but I don't.

257
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,985
Now you listen to me.
You get your heads together.

258
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,386
You work this out.

259
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,588
You go out and get me the guy
who did Frankie.

260
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,757
And then you
bring his head to me.

261
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,659
You got that?
You understand that?

262
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,395
Do you understand?

263
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,964
Do you understand?

264
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,432
Yes.

265
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,872
Good.

266
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,852
This is fucking bullshit
and you know it.

267
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,554
No. I'm doing what's right.

268
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,691
Small steps.

269
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:34,825
Perfect timing.

270
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,496
This is the only move you had,

271
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,831
and I thought of it before
I even started.

272
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,635
That's strategy.

273
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,072
Not like that ridiculous power
grab you pulled with Frankie

274
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,874
that's blowing up
in your face right now.

275
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,777
I know what you did.

276
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,745
And I know you know it.

277
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,481
I don't wanna hurt you.

278
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,818
You wanna take all of this on?
Go for it.

279
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,953
I just want to start to spread
my wings a little bit.

280
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,656
This is my neighborhood, too.

281
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,828
So, don't worry.

282
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,064
Your secret's safe with me.

283
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,499
So what, I'm just
supposed to trust you?

284
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,967
I don't give a fuck what you do.

285
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,238
It's just time you finally
learn how to share.

286
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,741
Get the fuck out of my club.

287
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,509
Gladly.

288
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,133
He's gonna fucking
hold this over me

289
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,801
for the rest of my life.

290
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,105
Then I suggest you stop
fucking around

291
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,573
and end this.

292
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,029
Hey, val.
What's going on?

293
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,465
Hey. Joshua isn't
inside, is he?

294
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,667
No.

295
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,835
Where is he?

296
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:25,936
And please tell me he's coming,

297
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,671
because we really need this.

298
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,473
I don't know. I feel
like something's wrong.

299
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,941
He never would have missed
this meeting.

300
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,110
I feel like something happened.

301
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:36,447
Or he just panicked and went to the
fucking casino to lose his shirt again.

302
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,517
No, this feels different.
It feels bad.

303
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,520
This guy, Alexander, came
to our house this morning.

304
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,889
You don't know anything? There's
no meeting set up or anything?

305
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,058
No. We cleared the deck so we
could spend the morning prepping.

306
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,660
Fucking dick.

307
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,962
Look, you know, I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna...

308
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,433
I wanted to marry a man
and I married a fucking child.

309
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,867
If he calls, if he
comes to this meeting,

310
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,502
just tell him to fucking
not come home.

311
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,945
Look, I don't know
what the fuck you did,

312
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:08,945
or what the fuck is going on,

313
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,148
but you better call me back
pretty fucking quick, mister,

314
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,850
and tell me what is going on.

315
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,452
Stop being a child and be a man.

316
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,225
Hello, Valerie.

317
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,081
I want you to come and sit down.
We need to talk.

318
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,131
I don't wanna wake Lucy.

319
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,734
I just wanna talk.

320
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,801
Where's my husband?

321
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:38,936
Have a seat.

322
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,605
I'm not gonna
bullshit you, Valerie.

323
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,046
I want you to know that,
right off the bat.

324
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,247
I'm not gonna bullshit you.

325
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,316
I believe we

326
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,019
teach people how to treat us.

327
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,256
Joshua's dead.

328
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,761
Do you want a drink?

329
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,599
Yes, please.

330
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,135
Brian, you make her a
Tequila, I'll take one, too.

331
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,910
We both know Joshua was
a degenerate gambler.

332
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,313
And he was...

333
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,292
Joshua was heavily
indebted to me.

334
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,098
Now, usually when somebody
dies, the debt is forgiven.

335
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,068
I mean, what more do you have
to give than your life, right?

336
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,237
But what Joshua taught me,

337
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,974
is that it's your word.

338
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:52,943
Your word is worth more
than your life.

339
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,347
I don't understand.

340
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,955
The debt your husband had
with me,

341
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,957
I can't forgive.

342
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,727
So I'm forced to come
to you to collect.

343
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,727
"Collect"?

344
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,696
Collect what? You just
said you took his life.

345
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,298
What more is there to collect?

346
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,000
This isn't about money, Valerie.

347
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,335
This is about honor.

348
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,338
What the fuck are you
talking about?

349
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,041
Joshua and I made a deal.

350
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,076
Joshua was gonna kill
somebody for me,

351
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,978
and I would forgive his debt.

352
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,680
Your debt.

353
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,215
Joshua couldn't do that.

354
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,250
Even though he knew

355
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,918
that I would wind up here,

356
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,053
sitting across from you.

357
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,288
He couldn't fucking do it.

358
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,857
So now I'm forced to
come to you.

359
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,926
You have to do this.

360
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,796
And I will make you
the same deal I made him.

361
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,799
One life for yours
and your daughter's.

362
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,001
You leave my daughter
out of this.

363
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,523
She has nothing
to do with this. You...

364
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,892
You need to do this...

365
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,995
Or I will slit your throat

366
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,763
and sell Lucy to
the highest bidder.

367
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,767
Give me a glass of water
for her.

368
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,014
And if you're thinking about
going to any of the authorities,

369
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,750
just know that they may
catch me,

370
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,121
but you will never see
your daughter again.

371
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,393
Wait. Wait.

372
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,261
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

373
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,037
Alexander:
Go wait in the car.

374
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,139
Morning, beautiful.

375
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,209
Sausages in the microwave.

376
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,977
Coffee is brewed.

377
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,213
Ready to rock and roll.

378
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,586
I tried, you know.

379
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,590
I tried.

380
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,194
You gotta go.

381
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,330
You have a little...

382
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,402
You gotta go.

383
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,838
Go!

384
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,378
Lucy?

385
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,949
Lucy?

386
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,152
Lucy?

387
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,189
Lucy?

388
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,358
Lucy? Come on.

389
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,329
Lucy?

390
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,466
Lucy?

391
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,402
Lucy!

392
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,105
Lucy!

393
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,377
Lucy!

394
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,309
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

395
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,413
<i>911. Hello?</i>

396
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,317
Yes, I'm here.
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,419
<i>Are you all right, ma'am?</i>

398
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,190
No... I'm fine.
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,493
<i>Do you have a child, ma'am?</i>

400
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,429
Yes.
<i>Please explain to them</i>

401
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,464
<i>that 911 is not a joke.</i>

402
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,366
I will.

403
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,122
Get in.

404
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,290
She's here.

405
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,358
Where's my daughter?

406
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,626
Relax.

407
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,363
Hello?
Lucy:<i> Mom?</i>

408
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,699
Lucy?

409
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,301
Lucy, sweetheart. It's mommy.
Are you okay?

410
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,338
<i>Yeah, but where am I?
I don't know anyone.</i>

411
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,441
That's mommy's friend. I'm
gonna come get you soon, okay?

412
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,076
I just have to do something.

413
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,510
<i>Can you come now?</i>

414
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,578
I can't come now.

415
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,146
But I promise I'll come soon.

416
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,982
So just be a really good girl
for mommy, okay?

417
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,351
Hey, come on, come on.

418
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,119
I promise.

419
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,320
<i>Pinky promise?</i>

420
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,420
I pinky promise.

421
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,423
Alexander: All right,
wrap it up, come on.

422
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,723
I love you, okay, baby.

423
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:17,427
I'll see you soon.
Just be a good girl for mommy.

424
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,029
<i>I love you.</i>

425
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,230
Bye, baby.

426
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,469
You know...

427
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,504
I always thought women were
stronger than men.

428
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,242
I swear to god,
if you hurt my daughter,

429
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,343
I will fucking kill you.

430
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,678
So you better kill me first.

431
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,081
You see?

432
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,616
I totally believe you.

433
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,387
I told you from the beginning.

434
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:45,522
I am not gonna bullshit you.

435
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,791
You do this for me,

436
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,027
get your daughter back,
you get your life back.

437
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,332
Here's your target.

438
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,633
That's what he looks like.

439
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,504
This is what he drives.

440
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,807
This is his schedule
for the next three days.

441
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:07,044
Lucky for you,
he's very predictable.

442
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,381
And how am I supposed
to kill him?

443
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,912
I won't know what
to do with that.

444
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,163
This gun is loaded.

445
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,497
You just point it at him,

446
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,099
like you would your finger,

447
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,667
and squeeze the trigger.

448
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,202
The gun will do the rest.

449
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,740
And what happens
after I do that?

450
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,508
How am I supposed to know
that I'm not gonna end up

451
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,210
behind bars for
the rest of my life?

452
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,113
This gun is clean.

453
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,348
Do the deed,
leave it at the scene.

454
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,350
And make sure your prints
aren't on it.

455
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,219
Walk away.

456
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,554
I'll give you
your daughter back,

457
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,355
I'll give you another
envelope full of cash,

458
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,590
like the first one,

459
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,725
and you disappear into the wind.

460
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,394
I don't wanna know where you go,

461
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,396
I don't give a fuck
where you go.

462
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,266
And I'm supposed to
just believe you?

463
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,435
You don't have a choice, girl.

464
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,671
Have you checked your
financial situation lately?

465
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,607
Have you any idea
the fucking whole

466
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,809
your asshole of a husband
has put you in?

467
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,444
Wake the fuck up.

468
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,745
You're underwater, girl.

469
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,249
You're drowning and you
don't even fucking know it.

470
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,518
This is the best offer
you'll get.

471
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,157
Do this, you'll walk away

472
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,159
rebuild your life.

473
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,563
Why don't you just
do it yourself?

474
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,732
I mean, you seem pretty capable.

475
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,167
None of your fucking business.

476
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:39,435
Go.

477
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,505
Wait. When do I get to
see my daughter again?

478
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:42,906
You'll see her
when you get it done.

479
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,241
You have three days.

480
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,443
Get it done, Valerie.

481
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,550
Hi, I'm calling to check
on my mortgage.

482
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,753
Valerie Webber.

483
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,861
Excuse me.

484
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:43,767
Did you just say there hasn't
been a payment in three months?

485
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,969
What are you talking about
"refile the house"?

486
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,314
Can you please
double check this?

487
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,716
I don't... that can't be
what's going on.

488
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,752
My signature? No, you
don't have my signature.

489
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,488
No, I think you're mistaken.

490
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,723
We did not refile the house.

491
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,258
This is Webber.

492
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,395
No. I'll have to
call you back.

493
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,630
Thank you.

494
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,916
What the fuck!

495
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,785
Having fun?
Yeah.

496
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,523
What's the matter?

497
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,757
I miss my mom.

498
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,227
She coming to pick me up soon?

499
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,698
Yeah, she is. But...

500
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,600
You know, you get to hang out
here for a couple of days.

501
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,002
She just has some work to do.

502
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,738
Will you play with me?

503
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,975
Okay.

504
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,143
Where do you wanna play?

505
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,847
Here.

506
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,216
You can be him.

507
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,319
Okay.

508
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,314
You see that lady over there?

509
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,858
That's my mom.

510
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,159
She looks kinda mad,
doesn't she?

511
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,261
Why?

512
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,097
I don't know. I'm gonna go
ask her and find out, okay?

513
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,566
Okay.

514
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,900
I'll be right back.

515
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,168
Got it.

516
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,943
<i>- Who is this little girl?
- I told you.</i>

517
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:02,845
<i>- It's my friend's daughter.
- How long is she staying?</i>

518
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,154
Maybe I'll keep her.

519
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:15,992
What's going on with Nico?

520
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,996
Mom, why don't you call
and ask him?

521
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,183
Hey, wait, wait.
You all right?

522
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:01,984
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

523
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,152
Hold on.

524
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,420
Hold on a sec.

525
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,955
Hold on.

526
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,258
Come to this quiet spot with me,

527
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,228
have one drink and I'll
tell you if you're all right.

528
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,235
Okay.

529
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,003
Okay?

530
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,906
Come on, this way.

531
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,424
So, do you have a habit
of saving girls?

532
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,627
Only ones that I know
I have no shot with.

533
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,497
Smooth.

534
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,100
Does that ever work for you?

535
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:54,036
No, not really.

536
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:58,207
But I don't usually have to say much
after I've saved a girl's life.

537
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,543
My brothers used to fight
like that all the time.

538
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,879
Where are you from?

539
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,548
I'm from Florida.

540
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,184
I've been our here
a few years, though.

541
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,920
What about you?
L.A.

542
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,256
Born and raised.

543
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,590
What do you do?

544
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,562
I run a sports book.

545
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,999
What is that, like a magazine?

546
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,201
No.

547
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,904
People bet on sports through me.

548
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,141
Is that legal?

549
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,542
Are you a cop?

550
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,644
No.

551
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:37,346
Then what difference
does it make?

552
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,315
Does it ever bother you that
people betting through you

553
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,983
might have a gambling problem?

554
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,084
No.

555
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,124
How about you?

556
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,498
My father had
a gambling problem.

557
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,001
And so I was in and out of private
school and public school.

558
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,971
And I married a guy
with a gambling problem.

559
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,108
It's my story.

560
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,077
Not very original.

561
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,516
Where's your husband now?

562
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,164
Why did you do that?

563
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,432
'Cause I wanted to.

564
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,108
You always do
everything you want?

565
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,643
Yes.

566
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,347
Sounds dangerous.

567
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,615
It can be.

568
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,386
It also makes life
a lot more interesting.

569
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,495
Let me take you home.

570
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,371
I was told to never
get in cars with strangers.

571
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,539
Or pick up hitchhikers.

572
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,208
The same speech.

573
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,682
You can follow me
in your own car.

574
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,759
Lead the way.

575
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,342
Welcome, my lady...

576
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,750
To my humble abode.

577
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,287
This way.

578
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,490
You okay?
Yeah.

579
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,571
Drink?

580
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,673
Yes, please.

581
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,142
So polite.

582
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,445
My mom raised me to be
a good girl.

583
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,747
That's too bad.

584
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:03,786
Obviously it didn't take, otherwise
I wouldn't be here right now.

585
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:08,124
Ha! Is this a bad girl
thing to do?

586
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,293
I haven't done anything yet.

587
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,196
I don't know about that.

588
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,127
What would your mother say about coming
into some stranger man's apartment?

589
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,605
In the middle of the night...

590
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,808
Where no one could hear you

591
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,877
if you called out?

592
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,315
What would your mom say
if she knew

593
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,251
that you were inviting some
strange woman over?

594
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,187
Someone you know nothing about.

595
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,659
I'm sure in your line of work
you have lots of enemies.

596
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,329
Lots of 'em.

597
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,340
Is that why you're here?

598
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,745
To exact some sort of

599
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,681
revenge?

600
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,191
It's a hell of a thing
to kill somebody.

601
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,759
Especially when they
saved your life.

602
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,433
And you don't look
like a killer.

603
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,369
Not yet.

604
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,945
God, you're beautiful.

605
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,221
I'm not who you think I am.

606
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,297
Okay

607
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,771
where's this from?

608
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,408
Past life.

609
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,746
Did you always wanna run a
sports book when you grew up?

610
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,916
No.

611
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,453
I wanted to be my brother.

612
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,824
He was a bad ass.

613
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,026
It's true.

614
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,430
And he took care of me.

615
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,965
What about you?

616
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,336
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

617
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,373
Well off.

618
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,876
So nobody could tell me
what to do.

619
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,647
And I'd be safe.

620
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,117
You're safe now.

621
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,436
Mind if I indulge?

622
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,372
No, I don't mind.

623
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,676
You have a light?

624
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,112
No, I don't.
Not on you.

625
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:25,714
No, I don't smoke.

626
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,583
It may be in your purse though.

627
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,818
You never know.

628
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,854
You go to a restaurant...

629
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,722
Throw some matches in the purse.

630
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,324
For nothing else,
you didn't take a shit.

631
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,868
Get back in bed.

632
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,536
I'm not through with you yet.

633
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,848
You fucking scared me.
I should shoot you.

634
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,583
You'd never see
your daughter again.

635
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,189
Is it done?

636
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,590
No. You said
I had three days.

637
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,693
Now you got two.

638
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,796
I wanna talk to
my daughter again.

639
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,533
Then you better
get this done soon.

640
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,602
I would hate to think
what would happen to her

641
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:01,904
if she lost her mother.

642
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,707
Hi, mom.
<i>What's wrong?</i>

643
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,310
Nothing.
<i>You sound weird.</i>

644
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,245
I said hello.

645
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,947
<i>Why haven't I heard from you?</i>

646
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,983
Things have been a little crazy.

647
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,718
<i>What do you mean "crazy"?</i>

648
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,718
<i>Like what?</i>

649
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,921
Like... like whatever, mom.
I don't know.

650
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,323
It's just been a little crazy,
okay?

651
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:02,958
I'm fine.

652
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,393
<i>How's Lucy?</i>

653
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:07,696
<i>I tried facetiming
you guys yesterday.</i>

654
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:10,799
I know. She's good.
She's playing at a friend's.

655
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:11,967
<i>What's wrong though?</i>

656
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,706
Nothing. Can you please just
stop asking me that. Okay, mom?

657
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,808
I have to go.
<i>Where are you going so fast?</i>

658
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,411
I just have to go.

659
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:24,312
<i>Call me later.
I wanna see my girls.</i>

660
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,715
Okay.

661
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,083
Okay, bye.

662
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,269
So...

663
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,474
What about this accountant
that the police found?

664
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,445
He was a...
He was a customer.

665
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,080
Was he dirty?

666
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,486
Wait. You think he had something
to do with the Frankie thing?

667
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,757
Well, somebody made him die...

668
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,125
Very dramatically.

669
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,963
I'll look into it.

670
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:17,866
You okay?

671
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,335
Yeah.

672
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:21,970
Yeah, yeah...
No, no, no, no.

673
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,772
For the past few days your
head has been out of it.

674
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:24,873
What happened? What?

675
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,509
I just got all this shit
going on, man.

676
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:28,877
I'm just trying
to make a living.

677
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,477
And then I got Nicky...

678
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:33,215
No, no, no. You get your head
back in the game,

679
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,484
you dig this other shit and you
put it to bed and get rid of it.

680
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:38,954
Because you got to get back
to making a living.

681
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,155
You got it?

682
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,324
Do you got it?

683
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:43,492
Yeah.

684
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,393
Do it.

685
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,400
Fuck!

686
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,905
Hello?

687
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,474
Nick: <i>Hello?</i>

688
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:09,544
You know who this is?

689
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,950
Yes.

690
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,353
So polite.

691
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,957
So you got my note?

692
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,561
<i>Of course I got your note.</i>

693
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:28,563
I was sad that I didn't get
to say goodbye.

694
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,435
Well, I'm not really used to
these kinds of things.

695
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,337
So, I don't really know
the protocol.

696
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,875
Nick:<i> I had fun.</i>

697
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,377
I did, too.

698
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,645
Nick:<i> Let's do it again.</i>

699
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,948
Okay.

700
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,952
Let me take you away
this weekend.

701
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,890
Valerie:<i> Where?</i>

702
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,561
<i>Uh, I have a little cabin
up in the woods.</i>

703
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:03,398
<i>Nothing special, but you know,
maybe we can go for a hike.</i>

704
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,234
<i>Make a fire,
drink a little wine.</i>

705
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,504
<i>What do you say?</i>

706
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,675
<i>I say that sounds perfect.</i>

707
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,613
Okay. Do you mind
if I drive?

708
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,448
<i>I mean, I'd hate to take
two cars, you know.</i>

709
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,685
Okay, yeah.
You can drive.

710
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,687
<i>I think we're at this point
in our relationship now</i>

711
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,289
<i>where we can take one car.</i>

712
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:30,525
Good. I do, too.

713
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,294
<i>All right.
Text me your address.</i>

714
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,962
<i>I'll pick you up in the morning.</i>

715
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,064
Okay.
I'll see you then.

716
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,533
<i>Okay.</i>

717
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,158
Hello?

718
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,295
Hello. Mrs. Webber?
Yes.

719
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:41,295
I'm detective Jackson.

720
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,064
This is a warrant to
search your premises,

721
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,346
which we're conducting
right now.

722
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,068
Uh, okay.

723
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,204
Why?

724
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:51,139
Why don't we just go inside,
sit and talk.

725
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,380
I'm sorry.
What is this about?

726
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:00,715
Mrs. Webber, when was
the last time you spoke

727
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,250
or heard anything
from your husband?

728
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,788
Um, the day...
The morning before last...

729
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,024
Why? What happened?

730
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,460
I'm sorry to tell you this,

731
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:16,564
but we found your husband's
body this morning, downtown.

732
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,533
We believe that this was
an intentional killing.

733
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,239
What does that mean?

734
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,808
The coroner is conducting
an autopsy right now.

735
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,376
We'll know more in a few days.

736
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,883
Mrs. Webber?

737
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:39,605
Do you know any reason why anybody
would want to murder your husband?

738
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:44,759
No.

739
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:45,827
Was he having an affair?

740
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,263
No. No, no.

741
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,405
You said that you hadn't spoken
to him in three or four days.

742
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,773
Why didn't you report
him missing?

743
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,415
My husband is
a compulsive gambler.

744
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,418
This is not the first time he's
disappeared for a few days.

745
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,424
Lieutenant.

746
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,097
Have you ever seen
this gun before?

747
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,699
No, no. Joshua hated guns.

748
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,301
He would never have
anything like that.

749
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,435
Not around Lucy.

750
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,670
Who's Lucy?

751
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:30,138
Our daughter.

752
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,374
Where is she right now?

753
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:36,111
She's at a play date
at a friend's house.

754
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,679
Lieutenant, I also found this.

755
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,686
That's my emergency fund.

756
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,724
There's a lot of money in there.

757
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:51,359
When your husband is
a compulsive gambler,

758
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,228
you can't just
keep money in the bank.

759
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,764
I have a lot of things
to consider now.

760
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,299
I have my little girl.

761
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,358
Are you all right,
Mrs. Webber?

762
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:26,728
Are you okay?

763
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:30,832
No, I'm not okay.

764
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,702
Do you have somebody?

765
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,404
You family who could
stay with you?

766
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,873
I do.

767
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,711
This is my card.

768
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:46,181
I want you to call me
if you think of anything.

769
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,282
Day or night.

770
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,254
I'm sorry for your loss.

771
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,323
We will find who's
responsible for this.

772
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,359
You take care of your daughter.

773
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,795
Okay?

774
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:02,664
Thank you.

775
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,669
It's nice.
Yeah?

776
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,003
Nick: You ain't
seen nothing yet.

777
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:38,840
Mmm-hmm.

778
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,979
We're gonna wander all
up till that Ridge up there.

779
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,080
You see it?

780
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:47,615
Yeah.
It's gonna be us.

781
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:49,817
Just you and me.

782
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,186
Looks like you don't have any
neighbors around here.

783
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,121
Not as far as the eye can see.

784
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,260
Lot of cool hammocks though.

785
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,264
Not bad, huh?

786
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:04,732
No. Not at all.

787
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,172
I only come here, like,
once a year.

788
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:13,574
So I blame you.

789
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,076
Not that it's a bad thing.

790
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:18,179
You know, my grandpa was
kind of a hippie.

791
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:20,781
Greek hippie. You never
would have thought it, huh?

792
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,216
Yeah, I can see that.

793
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,897
Let's go for a hike.

794
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,299
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

795
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,740
Nick: Yeah.

796
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:47,975
We got a bunch of woodpeckers.

797
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,610
Valerie: Woodpeckers?
Yeah.

798
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,078
Mmm-hmm.

799
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,118
I don't really remember
the name of this path, but...

800
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,755
What would you name it
if you could?

801
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,558
Oh, anti stone.

802
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,792
"Anti stone"?
Yeah.

803
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:05,992
What does that mean?

804
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,728
Nick: The one over there is
full of stones.

805
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,130
Valerie: And this is not at all?

806
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,815
Oh!
It's okay.

807
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,884
I gotcha.

808
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:31,352
The leaves are
a little slippery.

809
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,055
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

810
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,691
Come on, let's...

811
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,253
Let's hang out for a second
right there.

812
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,166
I'll just go right here.

813
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,106
Water?

814
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,708
Yeah, thank you.

815
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:01,315
You're always rescuing me.

816
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,653
It just feels that way.

817
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,061
So nice out here, huh?

818
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,897
Yeah.

819
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,806
You wanna get back to the cabin?

820
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,744
Let's just stay here
for a second.

821
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:33,814
Take it in.

822
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,217
Okay.

823
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,030
No, really. I don't
mind experimenting.

824
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:50,831
I like, you know...

825
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,199
To try new things.

826
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,135
So I feel like, "you get
the fuck out of here."

827
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:55,302
I'm serious.

828
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,837
My husband used...

829
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,677
Don't worry about it. It's
none of my fucking business.

830
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:09,210
Mmm.

831
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,145
Matches...

832
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:28,095
Babe, I'm checking for a match.

833
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,396
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

834
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,317
Who the fuck are you?

835
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,057
How the fuck did you get
that envelope in there?

836
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,227
Where the fuck did that
envelope come from?

837
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,897
Start fucking talking!

838
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,559
Let's start with your
real fucking name.

839
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,969
Valerie Webber.

840
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:11,372
"Webber"?

841
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,011
"Webber"?

842
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:19,280
Like that fucking accountant
Webber that they found?

843
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,450
He was my husband.

844
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,887
Then what the fuck do you
want from me?

845
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:28,923
You got my money.

846
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:31,192
What are you talking about,
your money?

847
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:33,961
I didn't fucking kill him.

848
01:20:33,963 --> 01:20:35,462
He fucking cleaned me out
and then he left.

849
01:20:35,464 --> 01:20:38,399
So what the fuck do you
want with me?

850
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,304
Talk.

851
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:45,139
He was sent to kill you.

852
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,278
What did you just say to me?

853
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,214
Joshua was supposed to kill you,

854
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:55,482
and he couldn't do it,
so they came after me.

855
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:56,584
They came after my daughter,

856
01:20:56,586 --> 01:20:58,252
and that is what
the envelope is for.

857
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,222
Who sent you to kill me?

858
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,057
I don't know.
I don't know his name.

859
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,092
Alexander...
That's all I...

860
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,427
You're lying!

861
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,967
He came to the house and
that's what Joshua called him.

862
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:16,570
He told me he killed him and
then he came after my daughter.

863
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,910
Is that him?

864
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,480
Yeah...

865
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,416
Is that you?

866
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,185
Why are you together
in that picture?

867
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,355
That's my brother Alex.

868
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,628
That's your brother?

869
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,197
That's your fucking brother?

870
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,565
He has my daughter!

871
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,967
He was at the house
when you came to pick me up.

872
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:49,336
Please, you have to help
me, he has my daughter.

873
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,373
You want my help?

874
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,211
Do it.

875
01:21:58,146 --> 01:21:59,480
Do it.

876
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,284
Shoot me.

877
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:04,652
No, I can't.

878
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,421
Do it.

879
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,992
Because I'm the fucking asshole

880
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:15,162
who actually thought that
this was something special.

881
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:16,931
So if that's all that
this was to you,

882
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,066
then just go ahead
and shoot me now.

883
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,968
Go ahead and shoot me.

884
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,245
I can't.

885
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,983
Please take care of my daughter.

886
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,478
Motherfucker!

887
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,713
Why won't you die?

888
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:07,247
You fucking piece of shit.

889
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:09,016
I told you I would
never hurt you.

890
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:11,652
No. You're just gonna
fucking blackmail me

891
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:12,753
for the rest of my life.

892
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:14,989
I would never say anything!

893
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:16,490
That's not what people think.

894
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,093
This one affects
a lot of people.

895
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:20,761
You fucked this up, not me.

896
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:23,731
You fucked this up by
bringing Cudi in.

897
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:26,767
It made a lot of
fucking people nervous.

898
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:29,069
So what, people are just
gonna keep fucking dying

899
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:30,537
for this fuck up of yours?

900
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:35,175
Better them than me.

901
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,478
You fucking destroyed
this poor family.

902
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,680
This poor girl.

903
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,416
What did you do to her kid?

904
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,487
I'm not a fucking monster.

905
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:48,422
She's fine.
She's at mom's house.

906
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:49,623
You're not a fucking monster,

907
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,592
but you'll kill
your own brother?

908
01:23:51,594 --> 01:23:53,193
You fucked this up.

909
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,428
You did this.

910
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,297
You saw me drowning,

911
01:23:57,299 --> 01:24:00,134
and you chose then
to get in my face,

912
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:01,769
to fucking get greedy.

913
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:03,237
You couldn't stand
by you own brother,

914
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:04,772
even though
you knew I was wrong,

915
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:07,307
you couldn't stand by me.

916
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,243
I'm your brother, man!

917
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:12,746
You couldn't stand fucking
by your own brother.

918
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,181
Think about that.

919
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,150
Fuck!

920
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,486
You're gonna really kill
your own brother?

921
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,391
You left me no choice,
little brother.

922
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,393
It's not personal.

923
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:28,695
It's just business.

924
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,372
I just wanna see
my daughter, please.

925
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:41,842
I don't wanna
go to jail, please.

926
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:43,377
I just wanna see my daughter.

927
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,778
Can we go see my daughter?

928
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,447
Yeah, we're gonna go
see your daughter.

929
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:48,215
We're gonna see your daughter.

930
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:49,215
Okay?

931
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,485
I'm just gonna make
a phone call real quick.

932
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:52,686
Listen to me.

933
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,190
This never happened.
Okay?

934
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,093
This never happened.

935
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,528
This never happened.

936
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,398
Come here.

937
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,853
Uncle Cudi?
It's me, Nicky.

938
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,689
I need your help.

939
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,660
Okay.

940
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,324
Mommy!

941
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,226
I told you I'd come
back for you.

942
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:09,530
I'm so happy to see you, mom!

943
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:11,398
I'm so happy to see you, too.

944
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,290
I'm sorry you got
brought into this.

945
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,528
Yeah.

946
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:45,965
So, is this the part

947
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,701
where you tell me
I have to leave town?

948
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,941
Might be a good idea
for a while.

949
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,346
Till I see how this plays out.

950
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,249
Can you still protect me?

951
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,390
I'm pretty sure you can
protect yourself.

952
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:22,603
Am I ever gonna see you again?

953
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,272
Do you wanna see me again?

954
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,245
Lucy: Come on, mom.

955
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,655
You think about it.

956
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,536
You know how to find me.

957
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,940
Yes, I do.

958
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:19,993
Let's go, baby.
