1
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,105
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

2
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,189
Francis Kelly!

3
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,400
Here you go. That's everything.

4
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:25,773
Yeah, that's my brother.

5
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,358
Hey, Frankie.

6
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,275
Frankie, see ya in a couple months.

7
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,691
Yeah, I'll pay your mom
a visit in the meantime.

8
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:54,151
- I'm a free motherfucker.
- Here he is.

9
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:56,648
What up, baby?

10
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,771
- What up, Frankie?
- What up, Sugar?

11
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:02,649
I'm a free motherfucker!
Oh, shit. You got my hat.

12
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:06,481
Yeah, Frankie's back, baby.
Frankie's back.

13
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,480
- Frankie's back. My man.
- What up'!

14
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,685
Come on, Frankie.

15
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,815
Come on, boy. You good.
Watch your head, hm.

16
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:23,364
Oh, shit. Oh, Ray, man.

17
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:26,988
This is your place, bro? Oh, man.

18
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:32,321
Yo, dude, this fucking girl tonight, bro,
this fucking pussy was like--

19
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:35,945
- Bro, what--
- Where's his brother?

20
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,312
Can somebody get that'!

21
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:46,197
James, grab the phone!

22
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,276
Lewis's Auto.

23
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,777
Yeah, I'm James Kelly.

24
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:14,135
Yeah, well, I thought it was
your mandate or whatever...

25
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,322
to support small business with loans.

26
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:21,989
Yeah, no, I understand.

27
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,429
Nah, man, I don't have a degree.

28
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,692
And I don't really
see how that matters much.

29
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:33,114
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

30
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,279
All right, all right.
Thanks for your time, man.

31
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:38,896
Asshole.

32
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:48,856
Fuck.

33
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,945
Hey, Joe! I got this one.

34
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:14,982
Emily.

35
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,156
James Kelly.

36
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,804
I thought you moved away after Katrina.

37
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:33,178
I did, but soon as I could get work,
I came back.

38
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,945
Oh, yeah? What do you do'!

39
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,362
<i>Pm a dispatcher is: the NON).</i>

40
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:38,903
Really?

41
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,569
- What, so you're like a cop or something'!
- No, I'm not a cop.

42
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,570
I'm a glorified operator.

43
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:50,898
That's cool.

44
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,279
You kind of disappeared.

45
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:07,735
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.
I went traveling.

46
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,864
I was traveling abroad for a little bit,
you know.

47
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,068
Really? 'Cause I thought maybe
you got abducted by aliens...

48
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,364
or started working for the CIA or,
I don't know, went to prison.

49
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:23,406
Actually, yes.
I used to be a secret agent for the CIA.

50
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,567
But on very top secret missions.

51
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,116
But that was a long time ago and
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

52
00:08:32,398 --> 00:08:34,027
Come here for a second.

53
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,285
- You live nearby?
- Not far.

54
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:41,576
- Got a garage at your place?
- Sure.

55
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,283
Look, this...

56
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,952
this shop, it's, you know, too high priced.

57
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,235
If you want,
I could just fix your car at your place...

58
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,488
and you don't gotta pay me for my time.

59
00:08:55,566 --> 00:09:00,744
I'll pass along new parts at cost
and I'll save you a couple bucks.

60
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,279
That is very sweet of you.

61
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:08,193
Least I could do.

62
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,654
So this guy goes to prison

63
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:09,247
and they lock him down in a cell.

64
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,030
Two-man room.

65
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,103
He looks in and he
sees there's a big 350-pound black guy...

66
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:19,118
just sitting there mean-muggin' him.

67
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:25,698
Black guy says, "Say, man

68
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:30,365
you wanna be the mama
or you wanna be the daddy?"

69
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,647
The guy says, "Excuse me?"

70
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:37,455
He said, "Did I stu-- stu-stutter,
motherfucker?"

71
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,154
I say, 'You wanna to be the mama
or you wanna the daddy?“

72
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:48,370
Guy says, "Well, I'll be the daddy."

73
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:52,661
He said, "Fine. You the daddy."

74
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,532
Come over here and
suck on mama's dick.

75
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,578
Come on, Jim. Come on, man.
It's been 10 years.

76
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:08,365
You can do better than that, no?

77
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:13,375
You got some fucking balls
showing up here, man.

78
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,749
What's the matter, Jimmy'!
I came to see you.

79
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,744
You didn't come to see me.

80
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,081
Whatever happened to me
and you against the world, huh'!

81
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,658
- You want to know what happened, Frankie?
- Yeah, what happened?

82
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,789
- You want to know what happened'!
- Yeah, what happened?

83
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,619
Yeah'! I'll tell you what happened.

84
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,912
You fucking turned the world against me.

85
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,033
You still crying about that?

86
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,325
That's life, buddy. Shit ain't fair.

87
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:51,868
Fuck!

88
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,249
Hey, all right, all right, all right!

89
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:58,780
Don't act crazy, come on.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry!

90
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,616
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

91
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,785
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

92
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,124
I'm sorry.

93
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:10,449
I'm sorry.

94
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,575
Ah, shit, Jimmy.

95
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,041
Shit, Frankie.

96
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:27,959
Let's go get a drink, huh'!

97
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:31,127
Come on, let's go grab a drink.

98
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:34,247
I can't tonight.

99
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,164
Tomorrow.

100
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:56,624
- You're prompt.
- I like to keep my appointments.

101
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,035
Not what I recall.

102
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,242
What happened to your eye'!

103
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,502
- Oh, it was just a--
- You know what? I--

104
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,951
All good, it's not my business.

105
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,118
So, I'm guessing you have tools'!

106
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,158
Yeah, yeah. In my car.
You got the keys?

107
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:19,079
Yeah.

108
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:27,875
It's very sweet of you to do this.
Really.

109
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:34,917
I think I owe you.

110
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,369
It's a long time ago, James.

111
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,622
I'll be inside if you need me.

112
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:42,333
All right.

113
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,663
How's it going out there?

114
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,463
It looks like someone put
sugar in your gas tank.

115
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,155
- You're kidding.
- No.

116
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,749
Probably just some bored kids.
You park in bad neighborhoods'!

117
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,248
I won't ever again.
Can you fix it'!

118
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:54,921
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's fixable, it's just--

119
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:58,213
It was gummed up pretty bad, so
I'm gonna have to replace the fuel filter...

120
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,458
but we got a bunch of
those kicking around the shop...

121
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,731
and clean out your gas tank,
which will take me a bit of time.

122
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:05,546
But the worst part is
you're gonna need a new carburetor, so...

123
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:07,748
I'm gonna go back
and order one of those tonight.

124
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:11,796
Guess I'll see you tomorrow then.

125
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,501
Guess so.

126
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,253
All right, I'm gonna go lock up.
You have yourself a good night.

127
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,251
Okay, you, too.

128
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,608
Mr. Kelly, I'm afraid there's
been a misunderstanding.

129
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:01,379
This is not the type of loan
that's attractive to us right now.

130
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,379
Well, if you could
just take a look at what I got here.

131
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,543
You know,
you might find it a little interesting.

132
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:11,874
I've done the research and,
look, the area needs another auto shop.

133
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,171
All right?
This is my location right here.

134
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,374
There's like 10,000 cars
that go around this circle.

135
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:19,509
It's a prime spot.
It makes perfect sense.

136
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:24,423
Here, look. This is it right here,
and it's just sitting there empty.

137
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:26,168
I'm not looking for that much cash.

138
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,208
<i>Just enough to cover
the rent for 7, 8 months</i>

139
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,461
and then I'll start turning a profit.

140
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:33,585
And my business plan,
it's good, all right?

141
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,959
You just gotta take a look at it,
but I promise you--

142
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,503
Frankly, Mr. Kelly

143
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,000
we don't make small business
loans anymore.

144
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,838
All right.

145
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:55,049
Well, what the hell do you guys do'!

146
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:59,423
You know what'! Never mind,
all right'! I'm sorry.

147
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:06,715
It's just your Johnny-on-the-spot
with those overdraft fees.

148
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:17,625
Yo!

149
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:21,961
I can't believe this place
is still in business, man. Come here.

150
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,836
Yo, let me get another Jamison's. Two.

151
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,509
Two, for me and my brother.

152
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:31,255
My brother, huh'!
How you been, Jimmy'!

153
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:35,208
It's James now, all right?
People don't call me Jimmy no more.

154
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:38,506
Okay, James.

155
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,254
You all grown up now'!

156
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,756
Look, I know you're upset.

157
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,713
You got a right to be.

158
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,548
It's just, I figured all this time, you know'!

159
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,839
Yeah? What did you figure, Frankie?

160
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,049
What did you figure, man?
You'd come back and what?

161
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,677
I went to jail, Frankie.

162
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:02,792
Bro, you got off easy with
16 months. I did 10 years.

163
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,214
Every day I was in there

164
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,170
every fucking day, Jimmy,
I thought about you, man.

165
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,671
I'm sorry, man.
I want to make amends.

166
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,716
- It's not so easy, Frankie.
- I know, I know.

167
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:19,761
I know.

168
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,678
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you,
bro, really.

169
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,629
I'm proud of you.
You're a fucking good-looking kid.

170
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,421
I mean, I don't know who Mom fucked,
but you lucked out.

171
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,462
You know how much
I bragged about you, man'!

172
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:34,485
Every fucking cat in D block knew about
you blowing up these al-Oaeda niggas, man.

173
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,508
Everybody, dude.
You know what kind of street cred I got...

174
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,878
for having a brother
who knows how to blow shit up? Come on.

175
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,176
- The world forgets fast, Frankie.
- So we'll make 'em remember.

176
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,837
I got a solution.

177
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:51,114
You got a solution.
Frankie, I've changed, all right'!

178
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,282
- Jimmy, I've changed.
- Yeah, you've changed.

179
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:56,551
Yeah, I've done a lot of soul searching.
Really, I'm like--

180
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,639
I'm like" I'm like Buddha and shit.

181
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:05,961
Believe me,
I've had time to think. Okay'!

182
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,889
A lot of suckers in there, man.
That ain't us.

183
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:12,298
Okay? I'm gonna make things right.
We just got a bad hand.

184
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:14,505
Yeah, you think so?

185
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,671
Jimmy...

186
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:22,586
I know two guys, right'!
They're good guys.

187
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,279
They looked out for me in the joint.
They really did.

188
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,095
Yeah, what about 'em?

189
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,384
We all want the same things.

190
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,426
To overcome the obstacles.

191
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,472
Frankie, I'm not doing nothing shady.

192
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,797
You call real estate shady?

193
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,305
- Real estate?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:47,660
What, you get yourself a fucking real
estate license when you werein the pen'!

195
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,257
I ain't trying to be a fucking agent, bro.

196
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,623
I ain't a fucking agent. I'm a boss,
you know what I'm saying?

197
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:56,716
A boss. Legit. Calling the shots,
cashing the checks.

198
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,424
- What, hollering, what'!
- In that cheap suit?

199
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,140
Fuck you, bro. Fuck you, man.

200
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,929
Yeah, well, fuck you, bro.

201
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,387
Come on, man. I want to look out for you.
Like the old days.

202
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,802
Me and you against the world,
remember?

203
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,598
Let's go ﬂip some houses, bro.

204
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,840
I got the hook-up, man.
They're giving'em away.

205
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:19,803
- We fix and ﬂip, fix and ﬂip. It's easy.
- Where you getting the cash from'!

206
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,428
Investor. We got an investor.

207
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:27,635
He's gonna take a big piece at first,
but it'll be all right.

208
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,555
Come on. I want you to meet my boys.
They're outside.

209
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:38,221
- What, now?
- Somebody had to give me a ride.

210
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,257
You have some money on you'!

211
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:48,848
Oh, shit. Yo, this is my brother Jim--
I mean James.

212
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,582
This is Ray. This is Sugar.

213
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,345
Hey, man. How's it going?

214
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,657
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, buddy?

215
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,099
Sugar. Sugar, Ray.

216
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,677
Where's Leonard?

217
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,346
That shit's funny, though.

218
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:05,916
We heard a lot about you, man.

219
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:09,009
So, like, James has some questions
about the investor...

220
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:12,076
- how the deal's gonna go down, all that shit.
- As he should.

221
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:16,600
I don't know if Frankie's told you,
but I don't have any cash or nothing like that.

222
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:19,513
- Look, man, who does'!
- No, we don't want your money, man.

223
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,342
I'm putting together a team
of people that I can trust.

224
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:25,844
We have a meeting tonight.
Give us a lift, I'll tell you more.

225
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,221
- You want me to drive'!
- Yeah.

226
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:32,242
I thought you gave my bro a ride here.

227
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,617
Oh, yeah, we drove.
We got a car, but it's small. 228

228
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:37,093
I don't like small, man.
I don't like small at all.

229
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,388
- Unless it's pussy, though.
- Unless it's pussy.

230
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,933
Come on. Let's take a ride.

231
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:44,678
All right, come on. Hop in.

232
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,184
So you did all the work
on this yourself, huh?

233
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:01,264
Yeah. Yeah, I did all the body work
over the last couple months.

234
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:04,966
- I just got her running a few weeks ago.
- Good with cars. It's good to know.

235
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:08,349
- Yeah, I'm not bad.
- This kid's the best, man.

236
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:10,976
He can fix 'em, he can build 'em,
he can race 'em.

237
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:12,384
He's too humble.

238
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,051
I also hear you did some time.

239
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,510
Yeah, Frankie told you about that'!

240
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:21,054
- Yeah, Jimmy.
- Yeah, what can I say'! I was stupid.

241
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:24,141
Hey, happens to the best of us.

242
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:27,268
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,598
Pull in right over there, Jimmy.

244
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,342
- Who works this late?
- Who asks so many questions?

245
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,852
Our investor owns the place.

246
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:48,186
We won't be long. 20 minutes, tops.

247
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,762
Hey, when we get back,

248
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:53,470
your ass better be right here,
you hear me?

249
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:01,143
- Frankie. Frankie.
- What? What?

250
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,727
I got a bad feeling about this.

251
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:05,595
Jimmy, come on, man,
the guy's got a red-eye to London.

252
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,018
If we don't do it now,
we lose our shot. It's good. It's good.

253
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:43,313
<i>Come on, come on, came on.</i>

254
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:23,185
- Oh, shit. Get in the car.
- What the fuck?

255
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:25,648
- Back in the fucking car!
- Get in the making car, come on.

256
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:28,355
Go, go, go-

257
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,476
When I say stay in the car,
you stay in the fucking car!

258
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,127
- Drive!
- Oh, shit!

259
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,143
Go!

260
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:40,643
<i>- You blew the fucking guy away
for no reason, man. / What the fuck?</i>

261
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:41,686
Relax. Relax, man.

262
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:44,647
- You shot that motherfucker for nothing.
- Shut the fuck up!

263
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:48,106
- This is fucked, bro.
- Be more like your brother, Frankie.

264
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:53,932
- Cool.
- Cool. All right. We're fucking cool, man.

265
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,767
You're complicit in this.

266
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,144
Welcome to the family.

267
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,482
Get rid of this car.

268
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:09,438
- I don't think there's any way
he saw my plate./ Just get rid of it!

269
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,016
Fuck!

270
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,192
You understand me, Jimmy?

271
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:18,235
Look at me. You understand me'!

272
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:21,901
Yeah, we're good.

273
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,559
You kept your head.

274
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:28,896
Usually do.

275
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:36,278
Don't worry about the car, Jimmy.

276
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,943
You can always jack another one.

277
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:42,814
I'm sorry.

278
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:18,070
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

279
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,358
Fuck!

280
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,107
Fuck!

281
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,773
Yo, Jimmy,

282
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:40,812
Yo, Jimmy, come on.

283
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:46,609
- Fuck, Jimmy.
- Real estate, huh, motherfucker?

284
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,529
Yo, yo, man. Watch the suit, man.
Come on.

285
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,395
You didn't get rid of the fucking car, man.
That's a problem.

286
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:56,106
How could you do this to me, Frankie?
I'm your fucking brother, man!

287
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:58,980
What? It's not my fault, man.
It's not my fault.

288
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:02,107
You know I'm fucking this close
to putting it all behind me.

289
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,901
I'm fucking this close.
You're fucking screwing me again!

290
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,316
I didn't know they were
gonna do that shit. Come on.

291
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:09,613
The second I saw those two,
I knew they were trouble.

292
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:11,230
What the tuck's the matter with you'!

293
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,839
- Open your fucking eyes!
- I talked to them.

294
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:17,019
- There's not gonna be any more problems.
- Oh, yeah? No more problems?

295
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,987
You're so fucking casual
about everything.

296
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:22,157
No, seriously.
You got a fucking screw loose, man!

297
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,274
All right'!

298
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,687
You're fucked, all right'!

299
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:29,356
Jimmy, man. Come on, you can't go
anywhere right now.

300
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:30,063
Where you going?

301
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:32,234
- Yeah, no more problems?
- Come on, you can't leave.

302
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,735
Yeah, no more problems?
Fuck you, Frankie.

303
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:37,321
Yo, for real, man. You can't do this.

304
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:41,569
- You can't do it.
- You're my brother, all right?

305
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,696
- You're supposed to look out for me.
- I am, I am.

306
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:45,986
You are? Fuck you.

307
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:50,194
- No, Jimmy, man. Really, you can't.
- No? Watch me.

308
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,028
- 'Cause I'm leaving.
- No, Jimmy. Jimmy, really.

309
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:54,359
For real. Jimmy.

310
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,073
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
They can't know you're running.

311
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,407
They can't think you're gonna run on 'em.
Gimme that shit. Come on.

312
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,281
Hey, what up'! What up?

313
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,697
Taking a trip?

314
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:10,442
Oh, no, James loaned me some shit
'cause I ain't got no shit.

315
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:13,522
You know, to wear.

316
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:16,732
Aren't you supposed to get rid of that'!

317
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,193
I was just about to do that.

318
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:22,698
Hey, Jimmy, why don't
you hand Sugar your keys.

319
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:24,190
He'll take care of it for you.

320
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,443
Yeah, you do that.

321
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,358
Come on, man. You heard him,
give me the keys.

322
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,822
Fucking amateurs.

323
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:37,199
Sorry, Jimmy. It's a nice car.
I'm sorry.

324
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,903
You know,
I'm having the conversation.

325
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,982
Want to take this inside?

326
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,320
No, I'm good here.

327
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,527
It's your house.

328
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,950
Frankie says you need money.

329
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:02,155
- Oh, yeah'! Did he say that'!
- You need money, right?

330
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:09,278
Tell him about the bank. Come on,
tell him about the bank.

331
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:13,741
What bank'!

332
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,526
Yo, I'm not robbing no banks
with you guys, all right?

333
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:22,194
Not happening-

334
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:27,366
Take a look around,
kid. What do you see'!

335
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,284
Homes being foreclosed.

336
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:33,652
People working two, three jobs just
to put food on the table...

337
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:35,571
and still drowning in debt.

338
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,659
Don't get me wrong.

339
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:42,282
This country was founded
on great ideals and principles.

340
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,026
But they've all been mined...

341
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,901
by the banks.

342
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,243
Open your eyes, Jimmy.
It's the banks that are robbing you.

343
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,275
Word the fuck up, man!

344
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:59,614
- You know who my favorite president was?
- Who?

345
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,944
Thomas Jefferson.

346
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:06,364
Because he saw all
of this coming and tried to stop it.

347
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,318
He fought the banks.

348
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,031
JFK, too, and they killed him for it.

349
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:14,328
Fucked up, man. Fucked up.

350
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:19,236
The banking institution is more
dangerous than an army, he said.

351
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:25,316
He also said that every
generation needs a revolution, Jimmy.

352
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:31,327
The American Dream is just that...

353
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:35,070
just a fucking dream.

354
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:38,401
Deep. Shit, that's deep.

355
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,946
Frankie, go start the car
and tum on the AC.

356
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:45,319
It's too hot in this city.

357
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:48,906
It's nice out, bro.

358
00:31:55,192 --> 00:32:00,153
Jimmy, man. Come on.
I'll be in touch.

359
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,162
Get some sleep, Jimmy.

360
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:09,537
But no sleepwalking.

361
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:13,617
Any problems you cause
will he very had for your brother.

362
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:45,244
Aw, Frankie.

363
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:50,910
You fucking motherfucker.

364
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:54,196
You fucker.

365
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,244
You motherfucker.

366
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:42,952
Jimmy. Ah, Jimmy.

367
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,406
Come on, you done calling dinosaurs?

368
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,828
That's disgusting, man.

369
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:01,105
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

370
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:02,699
Sug. What's up, Sug?

371
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:10,738
Oh, shit, look. They got all
this whip cream and shit.

372
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:12,575
Yo, House. Come here, man.

373
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:16,160
This is my brother, James.
He's driving and blowing shit up.

374
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:17,496
Don't fuck this up.

375
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,074
- You need to eat something, dude.
- What?

376
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:22,290
Nothing. Nothing.

377
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:24,784
That's like House's crew.
He's cool, he's cool.

378
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:28,200
I don't talk to them too much.
Yeah, they're cool.

379
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:32,200
- Fellas, what's up'!
- Oh, shit. You remember Spoonie?

380
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,248
- From back in the day.
- We used to play ball together, man.

381
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,872
- Yo, Spoonie, from the Bywater..
- Boys, gather 'round.

382
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:39,454
What's up, man'! What's up?

383
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:46,241
War is a continuation of politics,
only by other means.

384
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,997
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

385
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,333
This is our hank.

386
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,705
This is our war.

387
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:01,617
And this is our plan of attack.

388
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:05,452
We need to create a staged distraction.

389
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:08,419
James will jack four cars
and blow 'em up all over

390
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:11,334
Central Business
District to draw out the cops.

391
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:30,747
As we enter,

392
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:33,372
Frankie will secure the guard
and disable the cameras.

393
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,998
Spoon will take out the hostages.

394
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,708
Sugar and I will grab the manager
and go for the vault.

395
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:44,205
Our window of opportunity is five minutes
after the vault unlocks automatically...

396
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,336
according to our source
back at the warehouse.

397
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,702
No risk he'll squeal.

398
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,908
Nevertheless, James will be
on police scanner in the van.

399
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:58,953
And, James, we'll need a
nondescript getaway van.

400
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,286
Weapons and ammo on you, House.

401
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,748
We all clear?

402
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:17,627
Yo, it's a good plan, man.

403
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:20,207
- It's a fucking stupid plan.
- Jimmy, come on, man.

404
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:22,672
We each break out with like
half a mil, man, come on.

405
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,336
Jimmy, I need this. We both need this.

406
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:28,950
We get our life back on track.
Erase all those lost years.

407
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:31,291
I was on track, Frankie.
All right, now get lost.

408
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:33,862
Jimmy, come on, man.
Don't do this. Don't do this!

409
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:35,953
- Frankie, get the fuck out of my way.
- We need this, man. You can't walk.

410
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:39,246
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Come on, man. Jimmy, please.

411
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,625
Look, you know what'!
If you're gonna rob a bank, Frankie...

412
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:45,210
you fucking go in, you empty the tills,
then you run out, you fucking drive like fuck.

413
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,290
Nobody actually goes for the vault.
That's just in the fucking movies, bro.

414
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:54,624
Yeah, but we got the codes, bro.
We got the schedule to the time release.

415
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:57,872
- That's fucking huge.
- They fucking killed a guy for it!

416
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,194
- What the fuck doesn't register with you'!
- I know that's bad, man. That's fucking bad.

417
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,063
- It is fucking bad!
- Yeah, but what can I do'!

418
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:06,083
What can I do about it now, man?

419
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:09,212
They'll fucking kill you, bro.
They'll fucking kill you.

420
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,288
They'll kill me, man.
They'll even kill Emily.

421
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:17,294
How the fuck do they
even know about Emily?

422
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,790
What'!

423
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:23,203
Yo, how the fuck do they
even know about Emily, huh'!

424
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,706
- I don't know.
- Do they even fucking know about her'!

425
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,835
- I may have said something about you guys.
- What the fuck did you say'!

426
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,712
When I was in the joint,
I may have talked about you and Emily.

427
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,250
- Why the fuck are you talking about us'!
- I was so happy for you.

428
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:37,499
Man, there's no love in there.
I was happy for you guys. I'm sorry.

429
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:40,705
- Fuck!
- Look, man, there's no way out, man.

430
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:45,108
This guy, Ray, he's like fucking--
he's like fucking Manson.

431
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,377
Why the fuck do you buy into his shit, huh'!

432
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,249
You don't know what it's like
being in there with the lifers. I fucking--

433
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:56,039
It's brutal, man.
These guys-he saved me. I owe him.

434
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:57,105
Yeah, you owe him'!

435
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,423
Yeah, so what?
You just gonna be his little bitch now'!

436
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,863
- What did you say?
- You gonna be his fucking little bitch now'!

437
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:06,003
- Don't you fucking talk--
- Just a fucking little clown!

438
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,333
- Don't you fucking say that to me!
- A little fucking juggling clown.

439
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,198
You don't know what
I've making been through!

440
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,880
You don't know what I've been through!

441
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:15,254
You don't know! You don't fucking know,
man. They fucked me--

442
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:21,044
Fucking took my swagger, Jimmy!
They took my swagger!

443
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:26,375
Fucking robbed me from me, man.
They making broke me, bro.

444
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:29,704
You don't know shit.
You don't know what I've been through.

445
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,961
You don't know what
I've making lived through.

446
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,540
These motherfuckers...

447
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:38,830
What happened, bro?
Tell me what happened.

448
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:45,293
What the fuck happened to you?
I want my fucking bro back, all right'!

449
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,296
They fucked me, man.

450
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,834
They're fucked, Jimmy.
You don't know shit, man.

451
00:38:57,955 --> 00:38:59,878
You don't know fucking shit, man!

452
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,382
They fucked me in the ass
with toothpaste, man!

453
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:09,295
They fucked me in the ass with toothpaste!
Bro, you don't know fucking shit!

454
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,568
- All right? They fucked me.
- They what'!

455
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:14,293
This guy fucking saved me!

456
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:18,959
These guys fucking saved me.
I'd making he done, bro.

457
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,923
I swear to God, man.
I swear to God, listen to me.

458
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:26,956
They know we're only in it for a one time deal.
They're cool with that. Okay'!

459
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,624
Tuesday night, we bounce. Okay'!

460
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,339
We good, man. I promise you, Jimmy.
I promise you.

461
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,112
We don't have to do anything like this again.
You won't have to do anything like this.

462
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:40,666
Man, we don't have we're gonna
We don't have to be like Mom!

463
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,339
We can have fucking options.

464
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:45,876
We can have fucking options!

465
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:49,591
I'm gonna get you your own shop!

466
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,335
You won't have to see me anymore.

467
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,510
You don't have to see me.

468
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:04,173
You just gotta trust me, Jimmy.
You gotta trust me, man.

469
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,214
It's not so easy, bro.

470
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:15,378
It's not so easy, Frankie.

471
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:22,593
Hey, I know it's stressful.

472
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,304
But what in life isn't'!

473
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:48,254
Thought you could use a cold drink.

474
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:51,090
Hey, thanks.

475
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:09,216
I think it's gonna rain all week.

476
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,158
Hey, would you mind?
There's a ratchet over there on the table.

477
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:15,219
- Could you pass it to me'!
- Ratchet?

478
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:17,971
Yeah, it might be in the toolbox, actually.

479
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,972
I don't know what a ratchet looks like.

480
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,011
You know what actually?

481
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:33,384
You wanna come over here
for a second and give me a hand?

482
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,420
- Yeah, what do you need?
- If you could hold that right there.

483
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:40,470
- Okay.
- And just keep that good and tight.

484
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:42,763
- Here?
- Yeah. You got it'!

485
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,799
Yeah, got it.

486
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:47,218
- Yeah, just like that.
- Okay.

487
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:09,420
Right in here.
I'm gonna tighten this up.

488
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:15,536
- And there she goes.
- Got it?

489
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:18,758
- I got it. All right, thanks.
- You're welcome.

490
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,344
Even the rain's hot tonight.

491
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:36,098
Heard some crazy stories about
you while you were away.

492
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,260
Oh, yeah? Like what'!

493
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,592
We went to school
with some bitter people.

494
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:50,431
You mean stories like
I went to prison after Iraq?

495
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,674
Yeah.

496
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:03,641
So...

497
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:06,299
Sq?

498
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:09,727
They said the same thing about Frankie.

499
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:15,094
Yeah, well, don't listen to 'em.

500
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:18,927
Who should I listen to'!

501
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:27,143
Look, Frankie and I went traveling.

502
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,677
He stayed on, I came home.

503
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,143
That's it, end of story.

504
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:41,225
Okay.

505
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,931
So, what happened to your car'!

506
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,055
I had to lend it to my brother.

507
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:58,061
Frankie's back in town.

508
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:01,346
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

509
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:05,470
Driving a car without a key.

510
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:15,426
You see, I went down to my work
this morning to grab a leaner and...

511
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:19,474
no one was around
and I couldn't find the keys and...

512
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,343
- I know, it looks a little bit shady.
- No, not at all.

513
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:29,519
I don't want to know.

514
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:15,932
Units, dispatch is available.
Do I come across clear?

515
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:31,394
Come here. Come on,
come on. Come on, come on.

516
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:40,937
- What are you doing, Frankie? I'm working.
- I know. I know, hey.

517
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:44,606
- I know what you're thinking.
- What are you doing with a fucking yellow--

518
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:49,265
Know why? 'Cause who would think
I stole a fucking yellow car'!

519
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:50,976
Who would steal a yellow car'!

520
00:46:51,262 --> 00:46:54,230
Exactly. Nobody. I'm smart.

521
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:59,226
And, if you're getting pussy and
you drive this car, you know she loves you.

522
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:02,224
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Frankie, I'm working, I can't.

523
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:05,811
Gotta make time, let's go.
Trust me, we gotta go.

524
00:47:07,388 --> 00:47:09,015
All right, one second.

525
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:14,816
Hey, Burnell, cover for me.
I'll be one second.

526
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:16,265
Yeah, all right.

527
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:20,482
I mean, really, who steals a yellow car'!

528
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:23,898
It goes with my green jacket.

529
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:26,022
And the brown.

530
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,933
Oh, so when I stole it,
I fucked the door up.

531
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,984
I'm like driving around having
to fucking hold the door.

532
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:36,470
It's a clown car, man.
This is embarrassing.

533
00:47:36,471 --> 00:47:40,147
Let's just pull around the comer,
we'll jack something that's not yellow, okay'!

534
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:42,067
It's called ﬂy yellow.

535
00:48:04,306 --> 00:48:06,685
I think the suspension on this car's fucked.

536
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,354
Fuck, man. Everybody can't
be as good as you, bro.

537
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,313
Everybody can't take the fucking
hot rods all the fucking time.

538
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:16,984
It's easy for me to pop this shit. Come on.

539
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:19,769
All right.

540
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:48,851
What's up?

541
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:54,893
Damn, whose funeral?

542
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,981
- Yours.
- Yo, what the fuck's you: problem, man'!

543
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,019
- You all right, Frankie?
- Yo, yo, Ray, man.

544
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,944
Shut the fuck up, Frankie.

545
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:06,725
- Like Montezuma's revenge of the mouth.
- What? I didn't. Say shit, man!

546
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,444
- Why you hitting me, man?
- Yeah, man. What the fuck?

547
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:11,401
- What the fuck'!
- What the fuck?

548
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,510
What the fuck was you doing
at the police station this morning?

549
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,318
Yo, chill, man. Come on, man.

550
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:17,903
You think I don't know
about your little girlfriend?

551
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,231
You think she can't
be taken away from your life

552
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:22,646
just as quickly as
she was brought back into it'!

553
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:25,436
So let's try this one more time.

554
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:29,297
Hold up, man!
I was dropping her of! For work, that's it.

555
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:32,850
All right? I haven't said jack shit.
She doesn't know nothing. I swear to God.

556
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:35,228
- At the police station?
- Yeah, she just works there, that's it.

557
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,945
- She a cop, Frank?
- Oh, man. Nah, man, come on.

558
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:40,561
- She's not a cop.
- Yo, I didn't know that.

559
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:41,985
She's not a cop.

560
00:49:42,476 --> 00:49:43,729
Is she a cop?

561
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,189
Please listen to me.

562
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:47,646
I promise you, she's not
a fucking cop, all right?

563
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,715
The fuck, man'!
She ain't a cop. We cool, right'!

564
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,654
- Jimmy, tell 'em.
- I promise you she's not a fucking cop.

565
00:49:54,768 --> 00:49:57,395
Chill, man. She ain't a cop. Fuck.

566
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:00,771
Fucking my hair all up and shit.

567
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:04,653
- You all right?
- Don't shoot my dick, man.

568
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,716
- You be fight, man, relax.
- Don't point that shit at my dick.

569
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,312
Come on, let's go.

570
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:11,646
- Come on, Jimmy.
- What the fuck, Frankie'!

571
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,322
Hey, remember...

572
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:35,316
remember when you almost blew
your hand off that Fourth of July...

573
00:50:35,686 --> 00:50:37,983
with that homemade
blockbuster you made'!

574
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:42,402
Shit, Jimmy. That was crazy.

575
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,364
Every car alarm
in the neighborhood went off.

576
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:48,357
And you were just looking at me, right'!

577
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,272
I remember you had
this look in your eye like...

578
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,445
you're like

579
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:57,280
like you discovered pussy or something.

580
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:04,531
I couldn't hear shit for a week.

581
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:10,070
You're the one that put the sugar
in her gas tank, aren't you'!

582
00:51:17,353 --> 00:51:19,230
That was you.

583
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:23,271
- Jimmy, come on.
- You tried to set us up so that I couldn't run.

584
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:26,189
Jimmy.

585
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:32,612
- That was you.
- Come on, Jimmy. I wouldn't do that.

586
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,231
I swear, Jimmy.

587
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:38,572
I didn't know they were gonna do that.
I didn't know, man.

588
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:42,362
I know, it's not nice. I know.

589
00:51:42,854 --> 00:51:44,130
But it's smart though, right?

590
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:48,656
They needed someone close to you
to get to that you cared about, right? So...

591
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:56,155
Anyway, look, hey,
it's a good thing, no'!

592
00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:01,363
I like that girl.
Nothing's gonna happen.

593
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:06,236
Some fucking brother I got.

594
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:12,355
You're a fucking piece of work, Frankie.
You know that?

595
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:17,824
I'm done eating.

596
00:52:20,397 --> 00:52:21,399
I'm done.

597
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,534
You remember when Dad went away?

598
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,158
Do you? You were young.

599
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,326
Do you remember how Mom fell apart'!

600
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:48,152
- What the fuck'!
- We had nothing!

601
00:52:49,273 --> 00:52:51,071
No one to come to!

602
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:57,820
I remember that shit.

603
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,444
I remember I came home,
I found you locked out of the house...

604
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:06,319
'cause Mom had a fucking nigger over.

605
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:13,660
And you were filthy.

606
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:19,865
And I cleaned you up.
I fed you.

607
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:26,241
I stole everything for us, Jimmy.

608
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:32,695
Everything, man.
I stole everything for us.

609
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:36,941
All your gear,
your first set of tools.

610
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:43,276
Yeah, I made mistakes,
I'm a piece of shit.

611
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:46,195
What can I say? I'm human.

612
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,403
But I always looked out
for my little brother...

613
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,994
to the best of my abilities...

614
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:55,489
even if they were somewhat
impaired.

615
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,743
It was always me
and you against the world.

616
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:09,578
Me and you...

617
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,699
against the world.

618
00:54:14,776 --> 00:54:16,403
Me and you, Frankie.

619
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:20,408
It was me and you.

620
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,246
I'm gonna go take a piss.

621
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,744
Yo, Frankie.

622
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:46,324
Yeah?

623
00:54:48,944 --> 00:54:51,696
You ever wonder what life
would be like if--

624
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:55,948
if you never pulled trig
on that cop 10 years ago'!

625
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:04,237
But I did, Jimmy.

626
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:07,325
I did.

627
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:44,415
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

628
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:49,329
I think we should check out this new place
in the Bywater.

629
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:51,914
I was just reading about it.
What do you think'!

630
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:56,747
Something's wrong.

631
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:07,551
I just wanted to say that your car works again.

632
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,301
Come on, what's wrong with it?

633
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:22,759
Last week...

634
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:28,469
we were together...

635
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,343
that was not good.

636
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,802
Of course, I was...

637
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:55,927
It's stupid to do something never existed
to start again.

638
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:59,928
I agree with you.
How much do you get me?

639
00:57:00,053 --> 00:57:04,302
This was business, you repair my car.
Let me...

640
00:57:04,427 --> 00:57:07,219
I do not want your fucking money.

641
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,552
I'm sorry, it's...

642
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:17,011
- I care about you and can not explain it...
- Apparently not.

643
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:21,594
- I understand it very well.
- I'm out of town.

644
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:25,803
When?

645
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:34,427
- Tomorrow.
- Go traveling again with your brother?

646
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:50,720
- Do not.
- I write my name.

647
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:55,471
You must understand.
If it was different...

648
00:57:55,595 --> 00:57:58,969
If I could explain it, as it could otherwise...

649
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:03,388
I do not want this. Save me.

650
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,096
Go, James.

651
00:58:09,304 --> 00:58:13,222
Listen, I care about you.

652
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:16,679
I understand that. And yet you go away.

653
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:22,513
Go.

654
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:24,930
I'll leave you alone.

655
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:31,390
Alarm Line, you name it.

656
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,726
- I blow you up, stunned.
- You missed.

657
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:02,935
This I do not miss.

658
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:20,144
- Emily, do you want coffee?
- No, I'm already on my second.

659
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:25,103
An explosion in Greenpoint.
Send reinforcements.

660
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:29,644
- Could you repeat that?
- An explosion, send reinforcements.

661
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:06,023
I need units to respond to alarms at

662
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:09,093
St. Charles and Jackson and in the Quarter
at Ursulines and Chartres.

663
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:10,301
We have an MVA with a tour bus

664
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:13,752
I'm sorry, unit 61, could you please repeat?

665
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,752
Did you say, A tour bus and three chained vehicles?

666
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:46,592
Copy that. Another explosion reported
by city parks. A car bomb.

667
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,504
Looks like it's gonna be a busy morning.

668
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:02,378
Looks like it's gonna rain.

669
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,841
Nobody fucking move!

670
01:04:01,335 --> 01:04:03,534
Fucking move,
I'll show you your fucking insides.

671
01:04:03,628 --> 01:04:06,758
- Come on, get down!
- Down, motherfucker! Down!

672
01:04:07,045 --> 01:04:08,341
No phone calls, bitch!

673
01:04:09,129 --> 01:04:10,471
You! Down! Down!

674
01:04:10,586 --> 01:04:12,884
Hands, ladies!
Show us your fucking hands'!

675
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,340
- Against the fucking wall!
- Let's go, ladies. Out the back.

676
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:16,972
Get the fuck down!

677
01:04:17,378 --> 01:04:19,827
- Let's go! Move it, move it, move it!
- Give me your cell phones!

678
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:23,252
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.

679
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:27,465
- Everybody listen up!
- Take a deep breath and relax!

680
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:30,799
We're here to rob the bank, not you.

681
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:35,089
In the five minutes we spend here,
the CEO of this bank will make more money...

682
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:38,139
off of all of you than we take from him.

683
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:41,929
Banks have become an invisible
threat to our democracy.

684
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,672
<i>So consider this...</i>

685
01:04:46,463 --> 01:04:49,546
justice. Don't be a hero!

686
01:04:49,796 --> 01:04:53,346
Don't. Look away. Look away!

687
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:01,638
- The vault, now!
- Get the fuck up! Now!

688
01:05:01,713 --> 01:05:04,341
- I can't open the vault.
- Man, get outta here. Let's go.

689
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,220
Get down, get down. Get down,
motherfucker, get down!

690
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:15,423
Move your fat fucking ass! Go!

691
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,432
Open that gate. Get it open!

692
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:22,115
Look, it's not gonna work.
Even if I give you the code...

693
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:23,716
this thing only opens
at predetermined times.

694
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,432
- Just enter the fucking code.
- It's not gonna work!

695
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:31,097
I'll only say it one more time.
Enter the code.

696
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:38,260
Fuck you.

697
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:58,428
Thanks a lot, man.
You've been a lot of help.

698
01:06:06,214 --> 01:06:07,011
Nice.

699
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,382
<i>Bags.</i>

700
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:24,849
Oh, shit! Fuck, man.
I think somebody saw me!

701
01:07:24,925 --> 01:07:26,428
Fuck! Shit!

702
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:28,670
What a fucking dumb ass!
Let's get the tuck outta here!

703
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,010
What the fuck you looking at'!

704
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,557
Stop fucking twitching or I'm gonna blow
your-fucking head off. Look down!

705
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:35,562
- Yo, she's probably calling the fucking cops.
- Get your shit together!

706
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,640
- What are we gonna do'! We gotta go!
- Calm down. What the fuck time is it'!

707
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:41,354
- Shit. Two minutes.
- Where the fuck you going?

708
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:43,561
- Two fucking minutes!
- Where the fuck you going, man'!

709
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:44,968
Fuck!

710
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,460
Okay, and how many did you see'!

711
01:07:47,551 --> 01:07:49,849
There was one inside
the bank and he had a mask,

712
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:51,599
and I think he had a gun, too.

713
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:54,759
David-four,
possible armed robbery in progress.

714
01:07:54,926 --> 01:07:57,601
Canal Street, Mid-City. Do you copy?

715
01:07:57,927 --> 01:07:59,770
Roger, that. We'll check it out.

716
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:09,205
Hey, yo, time's up, man.
We gotta go.

717
01:08:09,303 --> 01:08:12,431
We got 30 seconds, come on!
Help him. Hold his bag!

718
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,930
- Grab his bag, come on.
- Hurry up, though. Hurry up, come on.

719
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:17,880
We gotta go, come on!
Man, that's a lot of fucking dough.

720
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,060
Yeah, baby!

721
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:30,835
Yo, cops are coming, man. We gotta go!

722
01:08:30,928 --> 01:08:33,101
Ah, man, this is not good.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

723
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:34,144
Where is everybody?

724
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:36,806
In the fucking vault! They been there forever!
Where the fuck you going?

725
01:08:36,885 --> 01:08:39,230
Where you going?
Get hack in the fucking van!

726
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:42,147
- Get back in the fucking van!
- Calm the fuck down, all right?

727
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:45,136
Fuck!

728
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:50,223
I'm gonna fucking kill--
don't fucking move!

729
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:53,808
That's good. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

730
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:56,807
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!
- Yeah, we gotta go!

731
01:08:56,928 --> 01:09:00,433
We gotta go now! Come on!
Yo, leave it!

732
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,436
Yo, Spoonie.
Where the fuck is Spoonie?

733
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:07,308
Spoonie!

734
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,189
Where the fuck is Spoonie, man?

735
01:09:11,262 --> 01:09:14,166
Oh, shit! Five-O, five-O!
Get the fuck away from the windows!

736
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:17,291
- Where the fuck is he going'!
- Where's the fucking van?

737
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:20,436
- Yo, he's fucking gone, man!
- Jimmy!

738
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:05,434
Confirmed armed robbery in progress
at the Canal Street Savings Bank.

739
01:10:05,597 --> 01:10:08,442
Shots have been fired.
All available units respond.

740
01:10:09,846 --> 01:10:11,394
Get the fuck down!

741
01:10:29,847 --> 01:10:33,182
Motherfucker!

742
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,312
Fuck!

743
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:50,392
You all right'!

744
01:10:53,806 --> 01:10:56,356
Frankie! Are you hit'!

745
01:11:00,641 --> 01:11:03,269
Oh, shit. Jimmy.

746
01:11:04,015 --> 01:11:05,233
Oh, shit!

747
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:13,230
Oh, shit!

748
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:17,308
Fuck!

749
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,393
All right, listen up!

750
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,811
We have to adapt to a changing situation.

751
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:24,875
- New game plan.
- Game plan?

752
01:11:24,973 --> 01:11:27,853
Spoonie ran off with his bitch-ass
with our motherfucking getaway truck!

753
01:11:28,058 --> 01:11:29,856
We still have the advantage, Sugar.

754
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:34,231
These are first response city cops!
They have handguns and shotguns.

755
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:36,894
We have machine guns
and the high ground.

756
01:11:36,974 --> 01:11:39,104
But we gotta move
before they improve their position.

757
01:11:39,226 --> 01:11:42,605
Ray, man, I'm fucking bleeding, man!
I'm fucking bleeding!

758
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:44,812
There is no other option, Frankie!

759
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:49,001
Now listen to me.
We need another getaway car.

760
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,853
That's our only way out of here.
James!

761
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:55,142
You got to get to the side entrance
and jack us another car!

762
01:11:55,518 --> 01:11:57,987
- Hang in there, Frankie!
- Frankie, listen to me.

763
01:11:58,393 --> 01:12:00,895
- We're gonna get outta here.
- We need collateral!

764
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:04,067
Sugar, cover me. Go!

765
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:09,321
- What's your name'! What's your name?
- Katie.

766
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:11,553
All right, Katie. You be cool, you live.

767
01:12:11,643 --> 01:12:13,486
You freak out on me, you die.

768
01:12:13,684 --> 01:12:14,936
Got it? Let's go!

769
01:12:15,435 --> 01:12:16,652
Come on, James!

770
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:20,612
Come on, James, now's our break!

771
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,980
- Get up, man.
- Frankie, we're gonna get out of here.

772
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:24,274
Go with Sugar, okay'!

773
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:29,276
Get up, man, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man!

774
01:12:57,186 --> 01:12:59,886
- Come on, Frankie, get up!
- I'm bleeding out, man.

775
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:01,400
We gotta go, man!

776
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:04,980
Fuck, dude.

777
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:28,365
Get in the car!
Go, go, go, go, go!

778
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:32,068
- Drive!
- Where's Frankie?

779
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:33,237
- Go, go, go, go!
- Where the fuck's Frankie?

780
01:13:33,353 --> 01:13:36,938
Frankie's as good as dead, James.
Let's go! Let's get the fuck outta here!

781
01:13:50,688 --> 01:13:53,237
What the fuck are you doing'!
Go, go!

782
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:55,023
I'm not leaving without Frankie!

783
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,400
- Come on! Go, move!
- Shit!

784
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,357
I got you covered. Go!

785
01:14:28,313 --> 01:14:29,529
Here's what we know so far.

786
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:33,614
Gunfire's been exchanged with at least
two suspects trying to escape the Bank.

787
01:14:33,689 --> 01:14:36,771
Looks like some assailants
are still inside holding hostages.

788
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,276
What we don't know is exactly how--

789
01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:55,195
Frankie.

790
01:15:06,523 --> 01:15:08,152
I'm sorry.

791
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:18,367
What the fuck are you doing?

792
01:15:19,857 --> 01:15:21,654
I'm bleeding out.

793
01:15:22,023 --> 01:15:23,276
I'm bleeding out.

794
01:15:29,606 --> 01:15:33,067
All right,
I'm gonna take a look, all right'!

795
01:15:35,816 --> 01:15:36,863
Okay?

796
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:46,070
Shit.

797
01:15:56,191 --> 01:15:58,321
All right, it's not that bad.

798
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:03,362
We gotta stop this bleeding though.

799
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:14,692
All right...

800
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:18,908
let's get you fixed up
and get the fuck out o! Here.

801
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,072
All right'!

802
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:26,993
I'm gonna go get some supplies.

803
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:29,578
I'll be right back.
We'll get you all fixed up, all right?

804
01:16:32,402 --> 01:16:34,404
All right, I'll book it. Keep going!

805
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:36,365
Go! Go!

806
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:39,303
Sugar!

807
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,698
Motherfucker!

808
01:17:08,568 --> 01:17:12,278
Yo! Hey, lady. Lady.
Come here, get up.

809
01:17:12,652 --> 01:17:14,654
All right, I'm trying to get up.

810
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:16,321
- Get up. Don't worry.
- Shit!

811
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:18,867
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right'!
Come on.

812
01:17:19,444 --> 01:17:20,912
Come on. Come in here.

813
01:17:22,652 --> 01:17:24,327
Get the fuck back!

814
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,572
Tell your guys to get the fuck back!

815
01:17:26,653 --> 01:17:29,328
All right'! I got hostages in here!

816
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:31,951
I'm gonna start throwing
bodies out the window!

817
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:35,406
We're standing down.
Stand down!

818
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:39,863
This is Captain Sullivan speaking.
Is everybody all right in there?

819
01:17:39,944 --> 01:17:41,366
What you think!

820
01:17:41,486 --> 01:17:44,490
Do you need anything?
Do you need medical assistance?

821
01:17:44,653 --> 01:17:48,453
No! Just get your fucking guys
the fuck away from this bank!

822
01:17:49,486 --> 01:17:51,865
I'm gonna start fucking
murdering people, all right'!

823
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:55,267
Okay, I'm here to help you.

824
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:57,705
Son, you tell me what you want.

825
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:00,032
I just want-- you know what?
I want to talk to a real making negotiator,

826
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:04,284
all right,
Captain Whatever-the-fuck-your-name-is!

827
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:07,366
Okay, son. He's been contacted.
He's en route.

828
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:09,206
Negotiator's on the way.

829
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,411
All right.

830
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:13,741
Just stay the fuck away
from this fucking bank!

831
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,282
Come on, ma'am.

832
01:18:16,404 --> 01:18:18,407
All right, you did good.

833
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,909
You did good.
Thank you very much. You did good.

834
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:25,187
Yo, I need a first aid kit.
Where the fuck's the first aid kit here?

835
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,328
Somebody, where the fuck
is the first aid kit in here'!

836
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,704
Okay, Central,
I've got eyes on the suspect.

837
01:18:37,822 --> 01:18:40,415
He's on foot heading
north on Royal Street.

838
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:03,948
What the"!

839
01:19:16,947 --> 01:19:18,790
Ah, fuck!

840
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,457
Mother" motherfucker!

841
01:19:21,698 --> 01:19:25,279
- Okay, last one. All right.
- Holy--

842
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,578
Take a deep breath.

843
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,413
All 119111. 1111 tight.

844
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:47,330
- All right, good as new.
- Oh, God.

845
01:19:52,365 --> 01:19:53,332
Come here.

846
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:57,331
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Come here.

847
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,369
Oh shit. Oh, shit, Jimmy.

848
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:04,122
Oh, shit. Jimmy,
what are we gonna do'!

849
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:06,202
What are we gonna do'!

850
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:09,660
We're gonna wait for
the negotiator to show up.

851
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:17,119
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.

852
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:21,794
We can't shoot our way outta here, bro.

853
01:20:23,575 --> 01:20:27,159
I'm not going back. You hear me'!

854
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:30,086
- I'm not going back. Think of something.
- Yeah, all right. I know.

855
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,660
- No, you gotta think of something.
- I know.

856
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,871
- Come up with something.
- I know, all right?

857
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:40,751
They're wolves in there, Jimmy.
They're wolves in there.

858
01:20:40,825 --> 01:20:42,452
I can't go back.

859
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:50,119
All right.
You just got to do what I say, okay'!

860
01:20:51,825 --> 01:20:53,418
Gotta do what I say.

861
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:00,041
Fuck!

862
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:16,081
...invested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

863
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:22,956
Get back! I got a hostage!
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

864
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:26,416
Step back! You! You!

865
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,208
Back!

866
01:21:48,495 --> 01:21:49,747
Freeze!

867
01:21:54,286 --> 01:21:55,630
Target down!

868
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:06,622
All right!

869
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:09,006
All right!

870
01:22:10,953 --> 01:22:13,959
You put down your guns,
I'll let y'all live!

871
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,499
All right,
I ain't going warn you no more!

872
01:22:22,579 --> 01:22:24,000
This is it!

873
01:23:09,038 --> 01:23:10,460
Jimmy.

874
01:23:11,455 --> 01:23:13,207
Yeah, Frankie?

875
01:23:14,414 --> 01:23:16,336
I'm just a thief.

876
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:21,002
All my life...

877
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,962
nothing but a thief.

878
01:23:28,289 --> 01:23:30,963
And I stole from you.

879
01:23:37,206 --> 01:23:39,881
I stole from you, bro.

880
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:46,716
Look at me.

881
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:53,208
Do you forgive me, Jimmy?

882
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:02,459
You're my brother, Frankie.

883
01:24:08,874 --> 01:24:10,376
I love you.

884
01:24:20,374 --> 01:24:23,092
I love you, too, man.

885
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:27,467
I love you, too.

886
01:24:37,332 --> 01:24:38,424
What 319..

887
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:54,880
You!

888
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:57,836
You!

889
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:01,925
Come here.

890
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:15,959
Come here.

891
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,878
Jimmy, wake up.

892
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:32,634
You gotta get up.
Get up. Get up.

893
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:39,461
Jimmy.

894
01:25:43,335 --> 01:25:46,259
- I gotta do it.
- What the fuck are you doing'!

895
01:25:47,461 --> 01:25:49,178
I gotta do it, Jimmy.

896
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,382
Oh, shit, Frankie.

897
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,388
Shit, Jimmy.

898
01:28:43,173 --> 01:28:46,053
All right, easy, easy, easy.
We got you We got you"

899
01:28:47,258 --> 01:28:49,259
Okay, just hang tight. Hang tight.

900
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:51,618
Hang tight. Let's get you undone here.

901
01:28:51,715 --> 01:28:54,890
I'm gonna take care of you, sir. All right.

902
01:29:37,259 --> 01:29:40,083
Come in!
The hostage I was working on...

903
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:43,555
is not a hostage!
I repeat, he is not a hostage!

904
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:49,636
He's headed north on Carondelet.
He's on foot. Do you copy'!

905
01:29:53,259 --> 01:29:55,012
Yeah, roger that.

906
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,889
- Hey... Emily!
- I can't.
