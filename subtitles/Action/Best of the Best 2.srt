00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,490
Stock Exchange, this is Helicopter
123 Tango-Yankee on Vegas approach.

3
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:38,226
We're three miles out from landing.
Request permission to land.

4
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,978
Thank you.

5
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,337
123 Tango-Yankee.
Report landing assured.

6
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,909
Winds at south side
off helipad at 75.

7
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:02,219
Roger. Copy winds at 15.
We've got Mr. Brakus on board.

8
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:06,591
123 Tango-Yankee.
Signify tower when approaching pad.

9
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:18,750
Ah, Mr. jaquire.
So good to see you, sir.

10
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:24,054
123 Tango-Yankee to Stock
Exchange base. We're on final approach.

11
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:25,505
Roger, Tango-Yankee.

12
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,848
We've got you in sight.
Security is standing by.

13
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:30,160
Roger. Tango-Yankee out.

14
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:53,921
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Brakus.

15
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:26,416
- Good evening, Mr. Brakus.
- Hi, Mr. Brakus.

16
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,796
- Lose it.
- Sorry, Mr. Brakus. I-

17
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,199
What did I say about guns?

18
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:43,534
They're unmanly.
It won't happen again.

19
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:47,405
Warriors fight here.
Get rid of it.

20
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,904
You're at 200 feet below
the surface of the earth...

21
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:02,373
where you, our special
guests, will witness

22
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,883
the deadliest of combat,
the highest stakes.

23
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,486
- It's a forum for gladiators!
- Mr. Brakus coming through.

24
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,031
Lust like in ancient Rome.

25
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:14,159
Not in Rome.
You are in Las Vegas!

26
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:17,364
It's My kind of town!

27
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:20,670
- Are you ready to rock and roll?
- Yea h!

28
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,040
Are you ready to rumble?

29
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:35,350
Okay. All right.

30
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:41,459
Welcome, welcome to the Coliseum,
ladies and gentlemen.

31
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,897
The greatest show under
the face of the earth.

32
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,901
The Coliseum.

33
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:51,838
That means the ultimate
in fighting competition with no referee...

34
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,841
no rules...

35
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,434
and open to anyone-

36
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,038
anyone with big brass balls.

37
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,048
For those of you that are here for
the first time, this is how it works.

38
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:07,910
Our finalists from
our preliminary

39
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:09,479
tournaments are privileged...

40
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:13,051
to challenge our stable
of modern gladiators.

41
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,097
Take a look!

42
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:33,178
They'd kill their mothers!

43
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,842
I'll bet on him!

44
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,914
Mean as cat shit!

45
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,321
What a bonanza!

46
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:48,954
Oh!

47
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,965
Now, if our challenger is successful
in defeating the first gladiator...

48
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,699
he will win $20,000.

49
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,640
Should he be successful
at the second gladiator...

50
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,148
he will win $50,000.

51
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:10,446
That's 50,000 big ones.

52
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:13,454
Now, if by some
divine intervention...

53
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,822
the challenger defeats
all three gladiators...

54
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:22,796
then he has earned the right to challenge
the supreme fighter...

55
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:26,231
for the ownership
of the Coliseum.

56
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:32,499
The ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

57
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:38,034
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

58
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:43,341
the champion of the underworld...

59
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:46,410
Brakus!

60
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,494
Brakus! Brakus!

61
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,076
Yes! The betting cages are now closed...

62
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:16,110
so let the fights begin!

63
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,259
We have a spectacular
contest for you tonight.

64
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:24,305
The Coliseum's newest gladiator,
all the way from Paris, France...

65
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,784
Andre Mares!

66
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:39,789
The challenger, fresh from three
consecutive wins in the preliminaries...

67
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,527
all the way from
North Las Vegas...

68
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,126
Mr. Travis Brickley!

69
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,469
A 5 -to-7 underdog.

70
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,668
Paris, my ass.

71
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,201
Remember,
when the buzzer sounds...

72
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:57,806
there is only one rule-

73
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,283
There are no rules!

74
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,411
And you love it! Yes!

75
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,749
Fighters, take your corners.

76
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:12,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

77
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,828
Andre!

78
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,954
- Go!
- Come on!

79
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,958
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yeah! Allright.

80
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,242
Sorry about that, Sinbad.

81
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,643
There's a new boy in town!

82
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:38,683
- Alex, you know what?
- Huh?

83
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:42,025
If he doesn't get it this time,
he'll get it on the next try.

84
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,964
Oh, I know it, Tommy,
but he's growing up so fast.

85
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,661
He made me promise that
if he gets his black belt...

86
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,965
I let him drive the car.

87
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,973
So? Let him drive the car.

88
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,136
Tommy, I've only got one car.

89
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,516
Look at him.

90
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:06,781
God, I hope
he makes it tomorrow.

91
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:08,845
Relax. He'll make it.

92
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:11,482
Yeah. At least he had
one of the best teachers in the world.

93
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,891
- Thanks, man.
- I was talking about me.

94
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,363
Walter, go to bed. Come on.

95
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:23,159
Oh, Honey, if you take your shoe off,
I can kiss your foot.

96
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:26,105
Hey, Travis.
What a hell of a fight.

97
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,335
- You killed my guy.
- Yeah, I did.

98
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:31,038
You took him like
Grant took Richmond.

99
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,776
- Thank you, sir.
- So tell me, how good are you, really?

100
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,875
I'm good enough to beat
any of your steroid freaks.

101
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:46,818
- Including that one.
- Open your mouth.

102
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,159
How long's it been since
you fought? About six months?

103
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:52,199
Mmm. Call him.

104
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:55,896
- Or are the fights fixed?
- Go ahead, then.

105
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,529
What, are you injured?

106
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,871
One or two punches right on the chin,
I believe you'd go right out.

107
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,810
You have a big mouth, boy.

108
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,711
And a big everything else.

109
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,718
So why don't you stop wasting time.
Put me in the ring with him.

110
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,253
Weldon, give him what he wants.

111
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:19,418
- You want Brakus?
- Yes, I do.

112
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,230
You got it.

113
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,741
- Black belt candidates.
- Sir!

114
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,913
Attention.

115
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,043
Present your papers.

116
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,058
Ready? Begin.

117
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:34,496
Break!

118
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,311
Point.

119
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,280
Yeah! All right!

120
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,874
I'm proud of you, Walter.

121
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,885
You taught that boy a lesson.

122
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:49,855
Now, it's showtime.

123
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,359
- I can do it.
- They're waiting on you.

124
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:57,056
Black belt candidates,
are you ready to break your bricks?

125
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,032
Yes, sir!

126
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,400
Ready? Begin.

127
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,996
Hyah!

128
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,007
Hyah!

129
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,912
- Oh.
- Oh.

130
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,886
Hyah!

131
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,563
- Walter?
- Yes,sir?

132
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,233
If you don't break,
you don't pass.

133
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,540
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,710
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

135
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:25,774
Walter, come on.

136
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,317
Walter, are you gonna be okay?

137
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:36,390
Yeah, I'll be okay.
I'll get it on the next try.

138
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,894
- Cheer up, okay?
- Come on, Walter.

139
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,902
We gonna get lucky tonight.

140
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,098
My little ass-kicker.
Let's go make him feel good.

141
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,058
- Very happy to be here.
- Did you always know?

142
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,156
Now you stay here.
Make like a hat rack.

143
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,736
Mr. Brickley.

144
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,672
I blew it.

145
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,338
You look the same to me.

146
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,751
Hey, Walter, look-it there.

147
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:13,688
Hey, it's Dae Han.

148
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:16,405
He gave Tommy one hell of a fight.
Remember that?

149
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:19,084
It's only a violent sport.

150
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,558
- Thank you for that.
- Mmm.

151
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,756
Well, he'll be cool.
Now be his daddy.

152
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,390
- Walter Grady's daddy always be cool.
- Oh, yeah?

153
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:30,026
Mmm.

154
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,470
- Say hi to Tommy.
- Hi, Tommy.

155
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,667
In this tour
we hope to share...

156
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:40,338
the beauty and the art
of tae kwon do...

157
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,972
along with its power.

158
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:48,611
For KXRT Sports,
I'm Sue MacCauley.

159
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:54,626
Everyone, I would like
to propose a toast...

160
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,356
to those who have received
their belts today...

161
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,194
and to those who will
receive them tomorrow.

162
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,293
To the team.

163
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,395
To the team.

164
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:12,437
Alex, why don't you say
a couple words?

165
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,909
Uh, years ago
when Walter's mother passed away...

166
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,044
I didn't know how
I was going to make it.

167
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:26,182
She was everything.
And it's tough to lose everything.

168
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:30,923
Son, today, all I wanted
was for you to make it...

169
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:34,660
to get your belt.

170
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,669
And you surprised me
by giving me much more.

171
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,898
The way you handled
your disappointment...

172
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,339
makes me prouder than
lever imagined, Walter.

173
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,809
You have become a man...

174
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,506
and I'm just so happy
to be your dad.

175
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,582
- To Walter Grady.
- To Walter Grady.

176
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:01,098
Out to Walter Grady.
Ten seconds left.

177
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:04,729
Nine, eight, seven-
He's driving up. He's in the paint.

178
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,900
Five, four, three, two-
He's going up!

179
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,137
- Buzzer shot! And he makes it.
- Oh!

180
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,511
All right, you guys. If I make it,
you have to wash my car.

181
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,880
If I don't make it,
you still have to wash my car.

182
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,885
- No! No.
- No way.

183
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,855
- Oh!
- Doesn't matter anyway.

184
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,856
- Where's your dad?
- Inside getting ready.

185
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,858
- Let's go.
- Bye, Mr. Lee. See you later.

186
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,757
- See you later john.
- See you, john.

187
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,491
Aah! Aah.

188
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:35,365
Hey, Alex!
Your sauce is burning.

189
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,032
Look at this.

190
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:43,338
You know, Walter, you have a great dad,
but he can't cook spaghetti.

191
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,004
Humor him.
He thinks it's my favorite.

192
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:48,014
- Hey, Alex.
- Coming.

193
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,311
- Hey, man, do I look good or what?
- You look marvelous.

194
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:53,012
New haircut, new shirt on-
My sauce.

195
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,613
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

196
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,315
- Hungry?
- Always.

197
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,484
How does pasta Alexander sound?

198
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:03,496
Like you're trying to make up
for not taking me to dinner.

199
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:06,488
Could be some truth to that.

200
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:09,195
All right, Walter, I made a little extra
for Martha in case she's-

201
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:12,171
Dad, I gotta talk to you
about Martha.

202
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:15,037
What's the matter? You don't like her?
I thought you liked her.

203
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:18,601
Oh, yeah, she's great.
But she's not coming tonight.

204
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:22,376
Did she cancel?
I can't get another sitter this late.

205
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,781
You see, I called her
and canceled.

206
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,888
You what?

207
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:31,618
Dad, I don't need
a babysitter anymore.

208
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,718
Walter, you are 11 years old.

209
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,253
Dad, picture this scene.
A guy breaks into the house.

210
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,529
Martha freaks, runs screaming
into the closet, and I kick his butt.

211
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,900
Dad, you said it yourself

212
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,838
I'm a man now, and real men
don't need babysitters.

213
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,776
Oh, man.

214
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:54,302
I gotta pass, man. I got
no one to stay with Walter.

215
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:57,680
Great. I'll take 'em both out.

216
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah. All right, look.

217
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,819
This is not an option.

218
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:06,390
Travis is on his way over
here to drop off some

219
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,717
stuff before he goes
to his bowling league.

220
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,025
So you tell him to take you with him.
Understood?

221
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:11,619
Got it.

222
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:14,862
Okay. Hang this up.

223
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,534
Tommy, we're outta here.

224
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,067
- See you later.
- Stay away from the Playboy channel.

225
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,753
Travis, Dad said
I have to go with you.

226
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:44,058
Sorry, little buddy. Bad news.

227
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,656
Can't go bowling tonight.
Somethin' came up.

228
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:50,295
But you can't leave me here alone.
I don't even have a babysitter.

229
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,340
What if a serial killer
broke into the house?

230
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:58,002
- Get in.
- You sure?

231
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,068
Get in.

232
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,706
Thanks, Travis.

233
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:07,379
Put your seat belt on.

234
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,630
- Walter, there's somethin'
I gotta tell you.

235
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,091
But you gotta keep it
to yourself now, you hear?

236
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:17,290
You hear me?
I'm fighting tonight.

237
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:21,664
It's not the kind of fighting
that we-what we're used to.

238
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:28,898
At the Coliseum,
there are no rules.

239
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,966
Are you kidding?

240
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:34,845
Tommy and Dad would freak out if they
knew we were even going near that place.

241
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:38,146
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Walter. What do you
mean, “we“? You're staying in the car.

242
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,152
Come on. You can sneak me in.

243
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,917
No can do, little buddy.
This'll take me a couple hours, tops.

244
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,451
Dad's not gonna
wanna hear about this.

245
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,963
And you're not gonna
tell him, Walter.

246
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,329
Might slip.

247
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,162
You're blackmailing me, Walter.

248
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,535
That's correct.

249
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:03,666
You are bad.

250
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,510
Thank you.

251
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,517
Take a good look
at this place, Walter...

252
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:15,316
'cause after tonight's fight,
it's gonna be mine.

253
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:28,768
Hey, Travis. Why don't you go in
the front door?

254
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,771
Got a buddy with me. I think it's better
he comes in this entrance.

255
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:34,535
Okay. Oh.

256
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,542
- Sparring partner.
- Yeah.

257
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:53,586
- Who's the midget?
- He's my manager.

258
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,693
- Look out for him.
- You got it.

259
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,596
Travis.

260
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:02,760
Showtime.

261
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,247
Wow.

262
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:30,362
Ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:37,578
Tonight is a very special night.

264
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:40,206
We have a challenger.

265
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:47,413
Straight from a stunning victory
over Andre Marais.

266
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:52,223
Ladies and gentlemen, the challenger,
a member of the U.S. National Karate Team.

267
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:57,323
Give a big Coliseum welcome
to Mr. Travis Brickiey!

268
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:06,069
Right here. The fat guy.

269
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,009
Hey, smut!
The disco's upstairs!

270
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:12,470
BOO!

271
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:16,944
Ladies and gentlemen...

272
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:22,150
the ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

273
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:25,353
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

274
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:30,889
the champion of the underworld...

275
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:33,367
Brakus!

276
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:49,241
Brakus! Brakus!

277
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,991
Now, remember,
when you hear the buzzer...

278
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:00,460
there is only one rule.

279
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:02,998
There are no rules.

280
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,158
And you love it! Yes!

281
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:14,436
♪  Fighters, to your comers.

282
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:20,039
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

283
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,195
Come on!
Is that all you've got?

284
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:50,438
No.

285
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,578
You gotta stop it.
You gotta stop the fight.

286
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,139
Take it easy, kid.
Just part of the show.

287
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:33,941
In the tradition of the Coliseum,
you privileged few must decide:

288
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,450
Life or death.

289
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:39,044
Brakus! Brakus!

290
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:41,282
Does he live?

291
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:53,958
Or does he die?

292
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:57,335
Die! Die!

293
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,801
No!

294
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,883
Damn it!

295
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:25,290
- Payoff of the slots is better.
- Oh, yes. Whoo.

296
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:42,176
What's the matter, kid?

297
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:44,445
Need a ride somewhere?

298
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,668
What's the matter?

299
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:17,081
- I should've been back a long time ago.
- Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

300
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,948
Dad!

301
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,318
I don't know, Alex. Maybe
we should go to the police.

302
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:23,914
And tell 'em what?
We can't find our friend?

303
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,394
Tomorrow, when you park a car-

304
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,124
Yo, yo, yo.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

305
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,996
I got a couple of men just cruised
through the front door here.

306
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,933
Hey. Guys. Can I help you?

307
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:44,978
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, Weldon Dardano.

308
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,393
We're looking for a friend
who fought here tonight.

309
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,370
Travis Brickiey.

310
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:51,146
There's gotta be some mistake.
This is a dance club.

311
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,483
Travis Brickley doesn't dance.

312
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,786
I said this is a dance club,
period.

313
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:02,351
Travis Brickley fought here tonight,
and we would like to see him.

314
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:06,798
A lot people come and go. Now, maybe
your friend was here, maybe he wasn't.

315
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,199
- This is bullshit.
- I'm sorry?

316
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,135
This is bullshit.

317
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:16,066
Look, guys, your
friend did fight here

318
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:18,367
tonight, but he is
no longer here.

319
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,880
- What are you saying?
- Well, he got his bell rung pretty good...

320
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:24,042
got his face messed up a little bit,
but he did walk out of here...

321
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:28,452
on his own two legs with some bimbo
with her tongue in his ear.

322
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,820
- Yeah.
- I put him in a cab and sent him home.

323
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,825
- I'm sure he'll be fine. Don't worry.
- Thanks.

324
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,883
- Pleasure.
- Yeah.

325
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,153
See you.

326
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,371
Finch.

327
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,453
Finch.

328
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:45,410
What'd he say?

329
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:48,375
Everything is groovy. They
put Travis in a cab home.

330
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:52,121
He's lying, Dad. I saw it.
The big guy broke his neck.

331
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:54,685
Walter, maybe he
just got knocked out.

332
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,323
- Come on. Get in the car.
- He's dead. I know it.

333
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,392
Walter, he's not dead.
Now get in the car.

334
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,339
How you doing, Mr. Finch?

335
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,002
Never better johnny boy.
Never better.

336
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,099
Travis and a bimbo.

337
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,364
Let's take Walter home,
then go find Travis.

338
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:50,555
Where are you, Travis?

339
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:17,497
Tommy.

340
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:19,192
Back it up.
Tell that ambulance to back it up.

341
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:20,341
Tell that ambulance
to back it up.

342
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:21,681
So it was an accident?

343
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:24,315
We're investigating,
but it looks like that.

344
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:26,793
Thank you, Sergeant.

345
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:31,298
- Alex.
- Tommy. Tommy, what the hell happened?

346
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:34,096
We're lifting this thing now.

347
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:42,165
The police are saying
it's an accident.

348
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:50,274
Oh, Travis.

349
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:03,288
Tommy, we gotta do something.

350
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:08,697
He]!

351
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,865
Jesus! What is this?

352
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:15,599
They just pulled our
friend out of the river.

353
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,901
What do you want?

354
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,539
I want the man who killed
Travis Brickley.

355
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:24,210
I told you guys before, Travis walked
out of here on his own two legs.

356
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:28,221
Now the fact he went somewhere else
and got all screwed up is not my problem.

357
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,650
Yes, it is your problem.

358
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:34,160
My son witnessed
the whole thing.

359
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:36,753
Your son?

360
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,060
Your son the witness?

361
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:42,193
I got 20 witnesses.
I got 5O witnesses.

362
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:45,762
I don't like you guys very much.
Now get the hell out of here.

363
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,077
Did you kill Travis Brickley?

364
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,374
Easily.

365
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:55,109
Yeah.

366
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:01,282
Care to join him?

367
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:08,521
Ah, you son of a bitch.

368
00:34:10,986 --> 00:34:13,193
Brakus!

369
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:16,259
Hold up, Brakus.

370
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:20,068
We don't make any money
like this.

371
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:23,133
- Clear the path. Let's go. Move it.
- Gus, get in here!

372
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,941
Alex, behind you!

373
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,242
Step aside, please.
Step aside. Let us through!

374
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,954
- Let"s go, boys.
- Where did you get the hat?

375
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,547
It was left to me in a will.

376
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:05,409
Lie down. How you doing?

377
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:12,088
Guess you're doing all right.

378
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:15,152
Behind ya. I'll get the car.

379
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,799
Eh, you're gonna have
a nasty scar there.

380
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:37,409
There you go.
It's the best I can do.

381
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:42,589
Shit.

382
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:47,151
That one who cut my face-
I want him alive.

383
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:51,187
The other one-
kill him and his boy.

384
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:57,887
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen,.

385
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,432
- Amien.
- Thank you all very much for coming.

386
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:21,178
Bye, Travis.

387
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:30,628
- Jammy.
- Hmm?

388
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,100
Bless you, sir. Bless you.

389
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:38,831
- They heard?
- Hmm.

390
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,637
The Lord be with you, jim.

391
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:53,513
Dae Han. Thank you for coming.

392
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:57,784
As your friend,
I share your loss.

393
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:00,052
Dae Han, it's so good
to see you.

394
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:02,788
Alex.

395
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,831
- How are you?
- Dane Han, this is my son, Walter.

396
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:10,302
I remember. You have grown.

397
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:14,368
Here. You go with Richard,
okay? I'll be with Dae Han.

398
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:21,770
- And the boy saw it happen?
- Yes, he did.

399
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:25,807
- Then it is also his tragedy.
- Yes.

400
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:30,822
- And the police?
- They're treating it as an accident.

401
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:34,816
Then let me help you.

402
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:37,021
Blood for blood.

403
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,463
I owe it to you.

404
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,522
I can't ask that
of you, Dae Han.

405
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:44,502
If not, what will you do?

406
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,617
- Excuse me. When are you on?
- H-Hi.

407
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:01,313
- When are you on?
- Oh, I can't do it, Alex.

408
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:04,219
Don't tell me that, Sue.
You know Travis was murdered. Come here.

409
00:38:04,278 --> 00:38:07,316
L- Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

410
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,554
Honey, they shot me down.

411
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:14,794
I'm a sportscaster, you know.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

412
00:38:14,856 --> 00:38:16,927
Well, if I'm gonna make
allegations like these...

413
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:19,437
I'm gonna have to go through
their proper procedure.

414
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:22,566
And without proof, well-
I don't have any.

415
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,610
Appropriate procedure?

416
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:27,311
Thirty seconds, Sue.

417
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:29,405
Honey, I gotta-l gotta
go on the air, okay?

418
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:33,508
Uh, we'll talk about this
later, all right?

419
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:36,555
A friend of mine was murdered,
and you're worried about your job.

420
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:41,082
Well, yes, I'm worried abut my job.
It's the only one I have.

421
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:44,096
But that doesn't mean I don't care
about what happened to Travis.

422
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:47,690
What, you think it's all about Travis?
What about Walter, Sue?

423
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:50,702
What do you mean, Walter?

424
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:53,466
You want me to tell my son
it doesn't matter what he saw...

425
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:55,633
because his word isn't
good enough for you.

426
00:38:55,696 --> 00:38:59,041
- Ten seconds, Sue.
- Alex, please. Uh-Please.

427
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,137
Walter was there,
and that's good enough for me, honey.

428
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,222
And you know what else?
I couldn't care

429
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:05,266
less about your
appropriate procedures.

430
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:07,946
- Five, four, three, two-
- Don't do this. Please, Alex.

431
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:11,286
- [Buzzer Sounds
- Or your goddamn job.

432
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,461
It's been a busy day
in the world of sports.

433
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:30,430
Over there!
All right, there he goes. There he goes.

434
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,026
Come on, man. Step on it.

435
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,895
There were three of 'em,
Dad, in a big black car.

436
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,929
He's just a kid, man.
I'm going after them.

437
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:13,236
Alex, wait a minute.

438
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:15,743
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

439
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:18,411
Alex!

440
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,917
Walter, get down!

441
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,831
- Walter!
- Dad!

442
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:38,889
Come here.

443
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,176
Dad!

444
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,377
Freeze, asshole!

445
00:41:52,436 --> 00:41:54,814
Stand up. I said, get up!

446
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:57,045
All the way up.

447
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:59,110
'Got him! 'Got him!

448
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:04,373
You wanna shoot me? Huh?
Shoot me now. Shoot.

449
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,876
No. No, I don't want to. No.

450
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,862
Punk.

451
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:42,226
You came into my house.
You came into my fucking house.

452
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:47,396
Dad!

453
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:49,529
Don't kill me, man.
Don't kill me.

454
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:54,064
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. We'll-Tommy,
I gotta get Walter out of here. Come on.

455
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:56,737
Come on. Come on.

456
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:21,928
What do you mean
they vanished into thin air?

457
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:26,338
Brakus, there's no one
more surprised than me.

458
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:30,777
Find them. Bring me
the one who did this.

459
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:32,837
Do you understand?

460
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,281
Yeah, I understand.

461
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,376
I understand.

462
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,909
Fill 'er up.

463
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:14,408
- Tommy.
- Grandma.

464
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:15,209
Grandma?

465
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,174
I'll tell you later. Come on.
Grab your gear.

466
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,125
Come, meet my friends. Come on.

467
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,661
Grandma, I'd like you
to meet my closest friend.

468
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,666
- Alexander Grady.
- Hello.

469
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:30,668
- This is my son, Walter Grady.
- Hello.

470
00:44:30,724 --> 00:44:33,864
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Here. Let me help you.

471
00:44:36,563 --> 00:44:40,101
- So she's the one who raised you, huh?
- Yeah, she's the one.

472
00:44:41,868 --> 00:44:46,408
So, Grandma, I thought this would be
the safest place to come.

473
00:44:46,473 --> 00:44:50,285
- You were lucky.
- Thank you for taking us in.

474
00:44:50,343 --> 00:44:53,654
I think you should
talk to james.

475
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:59,121
- He's back?
- Two months.

476
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:01,689
- Who's james?
- I don't want to see him...

477
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:03,792
and I don't wanna talk to him.

478
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:05,803
He can help you.

479
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:10,865
- Who's james?
- Grandma, he can't even help himself.

480
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:15,209
- Who's james?
- He needs you, Tommy.

481
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:19,273
I'm sorry, Grandma,
but it's too late for that.

482
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,861
Excuse me.

483
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:21,896
Excuse me.

484
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:24,703
Who's james?

485
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,479
James.

486
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:37,647
Wake up.

487
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:45,156
Well.

488
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:47,323
Look who's here.

489
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:53,997
- What are you doing here, boy?
- James, Tommy's got trouble.

490
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,301
I said you could help him.

491
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:16,758
Just like old times, huh, boy?

492
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:20,026
Still runnin' to Ma
to fix your problems, huh?

493
00:46:22,088 --> 00:46:24,830
- What did you say?
- Tommy, be cool.

494
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:26,962
- What did you say? Huh?
- Be cool. - Oh, come on.

495
00:46:27,027 --> 00:46:29,735
Show me your stuff.

496
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:35,344
Let's see if you've learned
anything in the last 16 years.

497
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:38,315
I don't fight drunks.

498
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,909
Drunk? This is nothin'.

499
00:46:44,778 --> 00:46:47,884
Right here.
Give me your best shot.

500
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,724
James.

501
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:56,063
I'll rip your fuckin' ears
right off your goddamn head!

502
00:46:56,122 --> 00:46:59,569
Then I'll stick 'em right
where the sun don't shine...

503
00:46:59,626 --> 00:47:01,867
so you can hear me
kick your butt.

504
00:47:01,928 --> 00:47:03,930
Let's get out of here, man.

505
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:05,999
Can you believe this shit?

506
00:47:06,066 --> 00:47:08,307
You damn-

507
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:09,745
- You son of a bitch.
- No! Don't!

508
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:13,307
Hey, hey! Hey! What's going on?

509
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,148
I'm gonna kick your-

510
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,381
- Let's get some cookies.
- Cookies? What-

511
00:47:17,444 --> 00:47:19,219
- Cookies.
- Inside, Walter.

512
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:23,227
- Oh, come on. I wanna see this.
- Come on. Come on, you candy-ass!

513
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:26,389
Cut the crap James.
We're not kids anymore.

514
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,433
Come on.
Show me your stuff, boy.

515
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:30,434
If you've got any.

516
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,164
What is the matter with you?

517
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:42,079
James, I'm gonna
have to hurt you, man.

518
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:52,512
Pretty good. But you're gonna
have to do better than that, boy.

519
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,636
You got a little snap
in those kicks, ain't ya?

520
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:27,782
- Are you all right?
- Damn, that hurt. Ow.

521
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:29,793
What the hell was that about?

522
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:32,420
Come on. I'll take both
you bastards out.

523
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,556
Let's get him.

524
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:37,261
Mmm. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

525
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:40,396
Oh.

526
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:56,921
Now.

527
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,923
Come on.

528
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,721
- You're out of your mind.
- Come on. I'll take both of you on.

529
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:03,852
You're out of
your goddamn mind.

530
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:08,965
Oh, to hell with you.

531
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:17,931
- Here, Walter. Grab some plates.
- Okay.

532
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,176
James ran with
a real bad crowd.

533
00:49:24,604 --> 00:49:27,050
Always fighting for
the wrong reasons.

534
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:32,315
Then one day,
he just took off?

535
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:35,383
Went overseas to fight.

536
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:37,485
He left without
ever saying good-bye.

537
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:40,553
Took Grandma's life savings.

538
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,032
And I won't forgive him
for that.

539
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:47,671
I'm sorry.

540
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:53,003
Was he a good fighter?

541
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:55,706
We heard
he won some tournaments.

542
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,840
But then he had
a terrible car accident...

543
00:49:57,904 --> 00:49:59,850
almost died.

544
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:04,815
And his life
pretty much fell apart.

545
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:39,776
Four, five, six, seven-

546
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,984
Ooh.

547
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:56,720
What's up, handsome?

548
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:58,728
How much longer are we
gonna stay here?

549
00:50:58,784 --> 00:51:02,732
Oh, I don't know.
Till we're done training.

550
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,592
What's up?

551
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:09,630
I watch you training, Dad...

552
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:13,541
and I know either you're gonna kill Brakus,
or he's gonna kill you.

553
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,103
No one's gonna kill me.
I promise.

554
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:19,615
I saw him kill Travis, Dad.

555
00:51:19,672 --> 00:51:22,551
I watched him die.

556
00:51:22,608 --> 00:51:24,781
I know it, Walter.

557
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:28,086
And I have to protect
other people from Brakus.

558
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:30,855
It's like a war.

559
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,918
Like a war.

560
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:36,855
Are you afraid?

561
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:40,326
Yes.

562
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:54,478
Are you gonna help Tommy?

563
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,111
Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:51:57,176 --> 00:51:59,213
I'm gonna help the boy.

565
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,383
It'd be my pleasure.

566
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:04,860
Here. Here.

567
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:11,162
There's a dollar.
Give him that for a bowl of soup.

568
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:17,968
I know what happened to you
and what you think it cost you.

569
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,034
But the son who left me many years ago
in search of his manhood...

570
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,071
returned home a drunk
and self-pitying overgrown child.

571
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:28,675
You are a terrible example
for our people...

572
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:32,188
and a disgrace to your mother.

573
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:36,784
You have an opportunity now
to do something good.

574
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:43,598
Help Tommy or pack your bags.

575
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:55,134
Walter?

576
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:58,770
- Walter?
- Yeah?

577
00:53:01,707 --> 00:53:04,813
Help me with the chicken feed,
will you?

578
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,879
Sure.

579
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:10,849
This is pretty cool.

580
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:28,468
Oh!

581
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:33,910
- Good morning, Mom.
- Good morning James.

582
00:53:33,972 --> 00:53:36,578
- Where are they?
- Out back.

583
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,730
- Tommy, Alex.
- This is a private conversation.

584
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:55,635
Not on my mother's property
it's not.

585
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,836
You know,
I'm tired of your shit.

586
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:02,901
Tommy.

587
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:09,645
Ma told me about your problem,
sol came out here to help.

588
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:13,621
I know Brakus.
I've seen him fight.

589
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:18,989
How you're gonna fight him,
you must be prepared to die.

590
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,199
- You think I'm just a drunk.
- You are a drunk.

591
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,203
Yes, I am.

592
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:34,535
But I am one of three people
in the whole world...

593
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,206
that can teach you
to beat Brakus.

594
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:39,681
- You're full of it.
- Tommy!

595
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:42,309
- What?
- Remember the accident?

596
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:44,684
Yeah. So what?

597
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:48,320
Brakus was the car.

598
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,382
I was the accident.

599
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:54,864
Now, I can train you to beat him
if you're not too proud.

600
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,176
If you ever get past
the preliminaries...

601
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:13,238
you're gonna have to fight
with these things.

602
00:55:21,146 --> 00:55:24,753
Pick it up.

603
00:55:24,816 --> 00:55:28,229
Not with your hands. Like this.

604
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,796
All right.
Now let's see what you got.

605
00:55:37,863 --> 00:55:40,537
- What do you want me to do?
- Attack!

606
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:46,347
Okay.

607
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:52,778
We got a long way to go, kid.

608
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:32,057
One of them.
Don't disappoint me.

609
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:35,462
Bring me Tommy Lee, alive.

610
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,646
- Go on in.
- Excuse me?

611
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:53,482
- Go on in.
- Why?

612
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:55,920
- It's part of your trainin'.
- Oh.

613
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:58,584
- Come on, gentlemen. Let's go.
- Okay.

614
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:01,685
U h, Tom my, after you.

615
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:23,977
It's too hot. I can't breathe.

616
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,887
Tommy, I'll see you outside.

617
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:32,790
Alex, Brakus would stay...

618
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,556
even if it meant dying.

619
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,133
The sweat lodge is a church.

620
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:49,336
The heat drives the body temperature
way up like a fever.

621
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:54,973
Sometimes you may have
what the white men cal! Hallucinations.

622
00:57:55,037 --> 00:57:58,211
We call them visions...

623
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,948
messages from the spirits.

624
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:04,408
Go ahead, Walter, Take it.

625
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:11,983
- What is it?
- It's a snake charm.

626
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,757
A snake can take a life
or save a life.

627
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,765
It's to protect you.

628
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,358
I don't get it.
Is this a riddle?

629
00:59:21,423 --> 00:59:24,927
It's a symbol of courage.
Do you know what courage is?

630
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,940
Sure. When you're not afraid.

631
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:30,603
No, courage is not
the absence of fear.

632
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:34,739
It's doing what's right
even in the presence of fear.

633
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:40,182
Sometimes you just
gotta kick butt.

634
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:55,847
You men have done a good job.

635
01:00:57,273 --> 01:01:01,380
But now I think you're ready
for a higher level of training.

636
01:01:01,444 --> 01:01:04,857
So pack your stuff,
and you get a good night's sleep.

637
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:07,326
Then tomorrow
we begin our journey.

638
01:01:24,706 --> 01:01:28,244
Easy Easy.

639
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:31,820
Come on. Let me see your hands.

640
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,622
Slow. Slow.

641
01:01:50,698 --> 01:01:53,440
Okay, we've got 'em.
Come on in.

642
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,735
Come on.
Get the lead out, chief.

643
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:24,233
Let's finish this up, finally.

644
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:34,446
Get down, goddamn it!

645
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:47,058
ﬂames!
Move, and <i>I'll</i> pop her a third eyeball.

646
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:20,933
Now, all of you, get up.

647
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:34,069
Inside. Except you.
Mr. Brakus wants you for himself

648
01:03:42,243 --> 01:03:44,484
- Gun.
- Inside.

649
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,922
Inside, please.

650
01:04:03,898 --> 01:04:08,438
Mr. Brakus and Mr. Weldon Dardano
send their regards.

651
01:04:11,205 --> 01:04:15,051
- Don't kill my son.
- It'll be clean.

652
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:17,453
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

653
01:04:17,512 --> 01:04:20,254
All right. Turn around,
and down on your knees.

654
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,031
Run it all the way out
to the chopper.

655
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:39,168
You, too, kid. Come on. Let's go.
I don't have all day.

656
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:41,941
- What, are you deaf, tough guy?
- Courage.

657
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,244
Or you wanna take it in the face?

658
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:49,612
' Dad!

659
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:53,352
Where's Gus?

660
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:03,168
- It's about time.
- They're expecting four shots.

661
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:27,119
Don't you ever touch me!

662
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:30,253
- Hey, where's Gus?
- Takin' his sweet time now!

663
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:33,629
- I'm gonna go get him.
- No! We're outta here in 3O seconds!

664
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:37,101
- Acceptable loss!
- Like hell!

665
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,644
Can I, Mr. Finch?

666
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:50,774
Let me do it.

667
01:05:57,178 --> 01:05:59,180
Blaze 'em!

668
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:08,260
Aw, shit!

669
01:06:37,018 --> 01:06:40,295
I always told Gus
smoking would kill him.

670
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,069
Let's ﬂy!

671
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:25,233
All right. Take my hand.

672
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:27,301
Then Grandma. Come on.

673
01:07:31,405 --> 01:07:33,407
Jesus!

674
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,153
Son of a bitch!

675
01:07:44,218 --> 01:07:46,596
Son of a bitch!

676
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:58,704
Grandma, I'm so sorry.

677
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,644
I'm so sorry.

678
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:05,910
Enough!

679
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:10,346
I said, enough!

680
01:08:12,073 --> 01:08:16,954
My, my. He is interesting.

681
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:21,184
I believe you two
have met before.

682
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:27,963
Tommy Lee, thank you
for joining us.

683
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:31,970
- Do you know why you're still alive?
- I really don't give a shit.

684
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:37,100
You challenged my invincibility,
scarred my perfection.

685
01:08:37,165 --> 01:08:41,272
For that I will kill you
in the ring.

686
01:08:41,335 --> 01:08:45,044
- Let's do it here, now.
- Excuse me. What-

687
01:08:45,106 --> 01:08:47,848
What Mr. Brakus
was trying to say...

688
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:50,355
is that you're gonna have to
work your way up the ladder...

689
01:08:50,411 --> 01:08:52,721
just like everybody else.

690
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,885
And when you're finished
with the gladiators...

691
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,828
and then Mr. Brakus
finishes with you...

692
01:08:57,885 --> 01:09:00,832
the last thing through your mind
will be your ass.

693
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:04,463
Curtain's going up
in a few hours.

694
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:06,835
Show business is my life.

695
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:10,432
- Later.
- Get him to the Coliseum.

696
01:09:10,498 --> 01:09:12,808
Poor baby.

697
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:45,340
Now, I realize that I didn't give you
time to study for this test.

698
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:47,777
But here it is.
How many of you believe...

699
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:51,840
that a martial artist could defeat
a world champion boxer?

700
01:09:51,906 --> 01:09:55,115
How many believe yes?

701
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:58,714
How many believe no?

702
01:10:02,383 --> 01:10:06,160
Okay. Well,
I say let's find out.

703
01:10:08,356 --> 01:10:12,498
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing...

704
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,562
our champion martial artist...

705
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:16,905
Tommy Lee!

706
01:10:28,242 --> 01:10:32,884
And European boxing champion...

707
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:34,984
The Hammer!

708
01:10:49,964 --> 01:10:51,966
Now, I thought The Hammer
was a rapper.

709
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:54,274
What do I know?

710
01:10:56,904 --> 01:11:02,377
Now, remember, when the buzzer sounds,
there is only one rule.

711
01:11:02,443 --> 01:11:05,720
- There are no rules!
- And you love it!

712
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,386
Yeah!

713
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:16,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

714
01:11:44,518 --> 01:11:46,259
Damn!

715
01:11:48,656 --> 01:11:52,365
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an upset!

716
01:11:52,426 --> 01:11:55,873
The winner, Tommy Lee!

717
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:58,638
A big Coliseum
round of applause!

718
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:06,341
- Tommy Lee.
- You lower the gate, now!

719
01:12:08,843 --> 01:12:10,845
Work with me, man.
Work with me.

720
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,299
Tommy Lee!

721
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:32,870
Aren't we special!

722
01:12:34,568 --> 01:12:37,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest will begin shortly.

723
01:12:37,405 --> 01:12:41,876
Just time enough to go potty
and come back and place your bets.

724
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:45,048
Now, this is gonna be
a long night.

725
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:48,616
Darling, I thinkyou may have finally
found a worthy opponent.

726
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:57,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
our second battle of the evening.

727
01:12:57,068 --> 01:13:01,574
Tommy Lee versus the man who won
the gold in Olympic wrestling...

728
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,449
Stavros!

729
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:17,058
Come on! Come on!
Kill him! Let's go!

730
01:13:29,434 --> 01:13:32,608
Tummy, some on'.
Tommy, come on'.!

731
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:56,466
It's not over yet!

732
01:15:03,895 --> 01:15:06,068
Yeah! Come on!

733
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:01,759
BOO!

734
01:17:49,102 --> 01:17:51,275
- Bring on the champ!
- Ladies and gentlemen...

735
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:56,151
in the tradition of the Coliseum,
we present only the best.

736
01:17:56,209 --> 01:18:00,624
If you will, a big round of applause
for our winner, Mr. Tommy Lee.

737
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,627
Come on now. Let's hear it.
Tommy Lee!

738
01:18:07,153 --> 01:18:09,793
Ladies and gentlemen...

739
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,769
according to the rules
of the Coliseum...

740
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:18,657
Tommy Lee has earned the
right to challenge me.

741
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:22,570
I have accepted.

742
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,373
Tomorrow night...

743
01:18:27,507 --> 01:18:30,010
only one man...

744
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:32,078
will leave the ring.

745
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:38,525
I look forward to killing you!

746
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:41,998
Don't bet on it.

747
01:18:48,122 --> 01:18:50,796
Yeah? Yeah? Who is it?

748
01:18:50,858 --> 01:18:53,361
Open up, Sue. It's me.

749
01:18:54,394 --> 01:18:58,240
Alex? Alex?

750
01:18:58,298 --> 01:19:03,611
Oh! Oh! Oh, God, you're alive!

751
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:08,585
We'll talk about it later.
We'll talk about it later.

752
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:11,748
Yeah. Oh, God,
I was so worried about you.

753
01:19:11,812 --> 01:19:14,349
- I've been worried sick.
- They got Tommy.

754
01:19:14,414 --> 01:19:16,724
I heard.

755
01:19:16,783 --> 01:19:19,024
He's supposed to fight Brakus.

756
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:22,226
They'll kill him.
I'm going in after him.

757
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,963
In the meantime, I need you
to take care Of Walter, all right?

758
01:19:26,326 --> 01:19:29,307
- Of course I will.
- Dad!

759
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:32,503
What? Oh, boy!

760
01:19:32,566 --> 01:19:35,672
What's the matter? It's okay.

761
01:19:35,736 --> 01:19:39,183
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't-

762
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:48,116
- I don't wanna lose you.
- Hey. Hey.

763
01:19:48,182 --> 01:19:50,662
There's no way in hell
you're gonna lose me.

764
01:19:50,717 --> 01:19:55,291
I'm gonna go get Tommy, and then Tommy
and I are gonna come get you.

765
01:19:55,355 --> 01:19:58,700
In the meantime, you stay here.
I'll know you're safe.

766
01:19:58,759 --> 01:20:01,467
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?

767
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:04,441
- Take care of Sue.
- Okay.

768
01:20:04,498 --> 01:20:06,500
Okay.

769
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:11,138
- Here.
- Huh?

770
01:20:11,205 --> 01:20:13,845
Grandma said this will
help you kick butt.

771
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:21,025
Alex.

772
01:20:21,081 --> 01:20:23,186
I'm sorry that I let you down.

773
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,763
Come here.

774
01:20:35,095 --> 01:20:38,099
You've got my boy-

775
01:20:38,165 --> 01:20:40,338
You think I don't trust you?

776
01:20:45,839 --> 01:20:47,841
I'll be back in a minute.

777
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,054
Hey, he saved my life today.

778
01:20:52,112 --> 01:20:54,353
Let him tell you about it.
Tell her all about it.

779
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,394
It's easy money. The smart money's
gonna go on Brakus.

780
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:07,369
Okay? Believe me.
Put it all on Brakus.

781
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:10,770
- How much is there?
- $500,000, my dear.

782
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:12,775
Uh, counter, please.

783
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:09,990
Hey, tough guy,
Brakus says put this on.

784
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:15,061
Yeah. Did you order the, uh,
double security downstairs like I asked?

785
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,766
Okay, great. Thanks.

786
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:21,709
Through the roof! Yes!

787
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,747
Give me a little kiss. Thanks.

788
01:22:38,516 --> 01:22:41,463
I ﬂew all the way in
for this fight.

789
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:45,990
Got myself a suite of rooms
if you wanna stop on by later.

790
01:22:46,057 --> 01:22:51,666
Hell, bring your friend, huh?
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

791
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,271
Hey. Stranger!

792
01:22:57,335 --> 01:23:00,077
You look like you're
a real stranger in these parts.

793
01:23:00,138 --> 01:23:03,517
Where the hell are you from
anyway, huh?

794
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:07,922
- Houston.
- Houston. Houston!

795
01:23:11,483 --> 01:23:14,123
Hey, blondie,
come on over here a minute.

796
01:23:48,598 --> 01:23:51,340
Thank you.

797
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:55,545
Ladies and gentlemen...

798
01:23:55,605 --> 01:24:00,918
I bring you the event
of a lifetime!

799
01:24:06,283 --> 01:24:10,231
Firstly, our challenger,
vanquisher-

800
01:24:10,287 --> 01:24:14,083
Vanquisher? He kicked the
shit out of three gladiators!

801
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:21,299
Mr. Tommy Lee!

802
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:32,782
And the ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

803
01:24:32,843 --> 01:24:37,952
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

804
01:24:38,015 --> 01:24:42,122
the champion of the underworld...

805
01:24:42,185 --> 01:24:45,189
Brakus!

806
01:25:09,713 --> 01:25:13,490
I have waited a long time
for this, Tommy Lee.

807
01:25:15,018 --> 01:25:17,430
The feeling is mutual.

808
01:25:22,793 --> 01:25:27,037
Ladies and gentlemen...

809
01:25:27,097 --> 01:25:30,271
the Coliseum!

810
01:26:12,409 --> 01:26:14,411
- What do you want?
- Excuse me.

811
01:26:14,478 --> 01:26:17,721
- I said, what do you want?
- What do I want?

812
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:20,352
Aaah! God!

813
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:23,193
Ah, son of a bitch! Ah!

814
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:03,517
- Hey, Han.
- Alex.

815
01:27:03,573 --> 01:27:07,749
- So good to see you.
- G00D' to see you.

816
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:10,814
- You guys tryin' to mess up your clothes?
- How about you?

817
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,917
Hey, it's a rental.
Look out. Here they come.

818
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:15,053
- There he is, right there.
- Let's do it.

819
01:27:23,059 --> 01:27:25,699
Ow!

820
01:27:31,634 --> 01:27:35,343
That's it, Brakus.
Tear his head off!

821
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:28,391
Come on.

822
01:28:43,706 --> 01:28:45,784
Get up, Brakus!

823
01:29:03,794 --> 01:29:05,740
Hey, watch it!

824
01:29:05,796 --> 01:29:08,072
- Oh!
- Watch out!

825
01:29:08,132 --> 01:29:10,612
- You better watch it!
- Hey come on!

826
01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:48,643
- Sorry, gentlemen.
- Private club.

827
01:30:05,356 --> 01:30:08,394
Yeah! Yeah!

828
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:26,916
Now he's mad.
Now he's gonna get him. Get him!

829
01:30:42,726 --> 01:30:44,763
How many?

830
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:48,298
All of them? All of them?
Where's Finch?

831
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,868
Get me Finch now, now, now!

832
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:02,516
How'd' you get in here?

833
01:31:13,223 --> 01:31:15,726
Code red downstairs! Let's go!

834
01:31:28,205 --> 01:31:31,049
- Move it! You!
- Come and get me.

835
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:39,660
- You've got a lot of balls.
- Come on.

836
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:02,077
Tommy! Tommy!

837
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:04,949
Tommy!

838
01:32:07,044 --> 01:32:10,423
- Hey!
- Four more, Alex.

839
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:13,428
Okay. You get them.
I got Tommy.

840
01:32:49,186 --> 01:32:52,429
The buck stops here, bucko.

841
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:55,402
You. I owe you.

842
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,832
Join your dead friends!

843
01:33:12,609 --> 01:33:16,853
Tommy!

844
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:24,388
Yeah!

845
01:33:37,501 --> 01:33:40,107
Yeah, yeah!

846
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:44,716
Yeah!

847
01:33:48,178 --> 01:33:50,419
Yeah!

848
01:33:54,184 --> 01:33:56,460
Tommy! Tommy!

849
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,993
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

850
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:06,173
Kill him! Kill him!

851
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:09,507
- No! No! No!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!

852
01:34:21,812 --> 01:34:24,759
- No! No! No!
- Dead! Dead!

853
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:31,494
- Kill him! Kill!
- Dead! Dead!

854
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:42,001
Stay down... and live.

855
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:50,885
Tommy, look out!

856
01:35:16,266 --> 01:35:18,530
Ladies and gentlemen-Ladies and

857
01:35:18,556 --> 01:35:21,172
gentlemen, in
victory, the title...

858
01:35:21,205 --> 01:35:25,153
and the ownership of the Coliseum
pass to the strongest.

859
01:35:25,209 --> 01:35:28,486
The new owner and master
of the Coliseum...

860
01:35:28,545 --> 01:35:32,618
Tommy Lee

861
01:35:32,683 --> 01:35:36,597
W-Well, you see, the-the champ
is a little new to public speaking.

862
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:39,497
Believe me when I tell you,
you're gonna be seeing more of him...

863
01:35:39,556 --> 01:35:43,936
right here at the Coliseum in the months
and-and the years to come.

864
01:35:43,994 --> 01:35:48,136
Everybody, come on.
Give him a big Coliseum round of applause.

865
01:35:48,198 --> 01:35:51,441
Mr. Tommy Lee!

866
01:35:56,974 --> 01:35:59,386
Say a few things, champ.

867
01:35:59,443 --> 01:36:02,549
Champ, say a few things.
Champ, this is it.

868
01:36:02,613 --> 01:36:05,321
You gotta talk to these people.
Say a few things.

869
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:08,056
- Do it for me.
- Say something.

870
01:36:12,789 --> 01:36:17,101
The Coliseum is closed.

871
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:20,039
What? Wait a minute.

872
01:36:20,097 --> 01:36:22,099
Hey,wait a minute!

873
01:36:22,165 --> 01:36:24,839
Wait! Hey, wait a minute, guys.
You need me.

874
01:36:24,901 --> 01:36:27,279
You can't do this.
You gotta think this over.

875
01:36:27,337 --> 01:36:29,377
You gotta think this over.
This is not chicken feed.

876
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:31,544
This is 20 million dollars
a year, champ.

877
01:36:31,608 --> 01:36:35,078
Think about this. You-

878
01:36:40,117 --> 01:36:44,020
You'll be back. You'll be back.
You'll see, man.

879
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:45,717
Don't bet on it.
