1
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,361
- Where have you been? You look awful!
- I had a late-night poker game.

2
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,906
You should have at least shaved.

3
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:34,865
This new Police Commissioner Blakelock
is very spit-and-polish.

4
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,206
Fuck him.

5
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,753
But, Jesus God, Ben!
You got to watch the way you look.

6
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,794
You can't walk in on these
bigwigs without shaving.

7
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,594
You just can't do that.

8
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,468
You should've put on a tie.

9
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,431
You should've shined your shoes.

10
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:53,516
You should've made an effort
to spruce up a little bit.

11
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:55,603
Mr. Feyderspiel.

12
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:57,186
Shockley. How are you?

13
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,853
Fine, sir.

14
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,694
How's our Assistant D.A. These days?

15
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,653
Shit! He couldn't convict Hitler.

16
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,446
Don't use any profanity.

17
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:10,448
And remember to say "sir" to him.

18
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,577
When he speaks to you, say "sir."
Then stand up straight.

19
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:16,041
And for God's sakes,
don't breathe on him.

20
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:17,084
Here.

21
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,916
Wait a minute, guy! Come on!

22
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:20,668
Open your mouth.

23
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,592
I wish I had time to shave you.

24
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,340
Nag, nag, nag!

25
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,306
E.A. Blakelock.

26
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,611
Ben Shockley, sir.

27
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,154
I've heard about you, Shockley.

28
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,274
As Commissioner of the
police department...

29
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,862
...considerable responsibility.

30
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,824
Watchdog of the department,
so to speak.

31
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,662
Policing the police.

32
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:57,247
So that the need for
absolute secrecy is...

33
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,712
I understand.

34
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,592
Plane tickets.

35
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,173
Extradite and subpoena.

36
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,143
You're flying to Las Vegas,
coming back with...

37
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:12,395
...a prisoner for us...

38
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,398
...whom you will remand
to custody at County.

39
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:20,280
And then you report, you know,
back here.

40
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:27,694
Respectfully, sir,
I work for Metro squad. Why me?

41
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:32,285
Your division commander says
you're a man who gets the job done.

42
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:38,251
Is there anything special
I should know about this case?

43
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,470
What it is, is this:

44
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,345
It's a nothing witness
for a nothing trial.

45
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:50,350
That'll be all.

46
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:58,152
You represent the Phoenix P.D.
Get a shave.

47
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,356
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,580
15 years on the bricks together,
look what happens to us.

49
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:12,168
I land a lousy desk job.
You get a freebie to Vegas.

50
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,995
Big deal. A two-bit witness
for a two-bit trial.

51
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:18,212
- Anybody I know?
- Name's Gus Mally. Heard of him?

52
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,006
No. What's the charge?

53
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,468
He wouldn't say.

54
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:23,431
I'm just going there...
Hi, Shirley.

55
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,305
And coming back. You won't
even have time to get laid.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,762
You won't have time.
Helen'd kill me.

57
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,977
Listen, are you still
getting serviced by Shirley?

58
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:35,568
Why not? You've got a
very shapely lady there.

59
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,696
She was after me for my money.

60
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,576
The trip to Vegas is 2 hours.
Have dinner with us.

61
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,667
Not tonight. Say hello to Helen
and the kids, though.

62
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,786
And thanks for the escort.
I know how busy you execs are.

63
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:53,922
In your ear, Jim!

64
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,381
Congratulations on the promotion.

65
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:02,638
I don't know why they promoted me.
We're partners, for chrissake.

66
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:04,684
You deserved the promotion.

67
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:06,894
I hate paperwork, you know that.

68
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:10,848
If it wasn't for the family,
I'd tell them to shove it.

69
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,937
Why don't you quit bellyaching?

70
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:16,322
- You're off the bricks, aren't you?
- I like the bricks.

71
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:19,316
Relax and enjoy life.

72
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,331
You and me been through
some doors together.

73
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:29,785
We've had our times.

74
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,006
We've had our times.

75
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:28,815
Ever been to Las Vegas before?

76
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,660
A lot of tourists in town.

77
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:40,446
It's always this way, the Strip,
choked with traffic all the time.

78
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:44,954
You can't drive. You can't go fast.
30 miles an hour all the way.

79
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,417
The old days...

80
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,712
Buddy, drop the tourist crap,
will you?

81
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,564
What do you mean my man isn't here?

82
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,697
You heard what I said, bud.

83
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,245
I've got papers for one Gus Mally.
The address is this building.

84
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:19,454
You better check again.

85
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,377
I've got all kinds of fellas in here.

86
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,664
I got a Smith.
I got a Gonzales.

87
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,880
I got a McNaughton.
Take your pick.

88
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,384
But I don't have a fella
named Gus Mally.

89
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:35,679
He was to have been picked up
yesterday, held for extradition.

90
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,551
Somebody screwed up.

91
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,348
Wait a minute now!

92
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:44,014
When you get back to
Phoenix empty-handed...

93
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,518
...all I said was...

94
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:50,029
...I ain't got no guy named Gus Mally.

95
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,990
Augustina Mally I got
over in women's detention.

96
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,405
Asshole.

97
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,909
She's been spitting up since morning.

98
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,041
I don't know.
She might have a fever or something.

99
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,006
We called the prison doctor,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

100
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,847
Hit the deck, Mally.

101
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,017
Has she eaten?

102
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,682
Just a cup of coffee this morning.

103
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,400
Looks like she put
cigarette ashes in the coffee.

104
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,238
Old army trick.

105
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:34,070
She wanted to look sick.

106
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,827
Let me go!
They're going to kill me!

107
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:40,077
I want a fucking lawyer!

108
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:44,878
Terrific!

109
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:48,218
My life on the line and they
send me an on-the-ropes bum!

110
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,295
What kind of record?

111
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,135
Hooker.

112
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,554
We've got a problem, you and me.

113
00:10:57,813 --> 00:11:00,731
We don't like each other,
but we're taking a trip together.

114
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,938
You can come along peacefully
or be a pain in the ass.

115
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:07,274
But I warn you, mess around
and I'll put cuffs on.

116
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,243
Talk dirty, I gag you.
If you run, I'll shoot you.

117
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,067
My name is Shockley.
We've got a plane to catch.

118
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,370
They're still cutting her papers.

119
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,747
Swell.

120
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,036
Can you ask them to hurry it up, please?

121
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,577
You...

122
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,919
...think about what I said.

123
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,504
You're a dead man, Shockley.

124
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:27,924
They'll kill me.

125
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,214
And if you're with me,
they'll kill you.

126
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:31,755
Who's "they"?

127
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:34,559
I don't know.

128
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:37,226
Why are they going to kill you?

129
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:38,769
I don't know.

130
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,396
Pack your lipstick.

131
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,111
Damn it, it's the truth!

132
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:46,156
They've even got a line on it.
On us!

133
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:49,575
They got a betting line on
everything in this town.

134
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:51,370
Ponies, football, the fights.

135
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:55,370
Nobody cares about a dumb-ass cop
and a two-bit hooker on Airwest.

136
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,251
Shockley, listen to me.

137
00:11:57,503 --> 00:12:01,168
It's 50-to-1 we don't make it.
Ask any bookie.

138
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,333
Don't drown in the sink.

139
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,878
You big prick!

140
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:19,931
That's a hooker?

141
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:24,144
The kick now is the schoolgirl look.
She's on the high side.

142
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:27,527
Finds it hard to maintain
those hundred-dollar tricks.

143
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,909
On a scale of 10, I'd give her a 2.

144
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,915
And that's only because
I've never seen a 1 before.

145
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:39,172
Okay, sir. Here you are,
just what you ordered.

146
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,668
How about another one?

147
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:41,838
This is fine.

148
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,050
- You sure?
- I've got a plane to catch.

149
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:47,340
Holy gee!
No way you'd get me on a plane.

150
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,386
Not after the airline pilots
I've dated.

151
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,933
I wouldn't let those
assholes drive my car.

152
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,179
Really?

153
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,932
Just last week
I was reading this article.

154
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,522
It talked about flying.

155
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,937
Said we'd all become just like cattle.

156
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,199
Trusting our lives
to people we don't even know.

157
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,907
Like pilots.
Said we do it all the time.

158
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,535
Then we get our heads bashed in...

159
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,198
...like cattle,
for being so trusting.

160
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,334
Did you ever think about that?

161
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,545
Like those pilots I dated.

162
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,295
They're so snockered
they don't know what button to push.

163
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,223
One minute you're flying
30,000 feet in the air...

164
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,762
...next you are splattered
all over the ground...

165
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:31,766
...somebody's dachshund
nipping at your pancreas.

166
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,435
Flying really sucks,
you know what I mean?

167
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,990
How much on what, sport?

168
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,490
Mally No Show.

169
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,405
What's the score on her?

170
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:48,827
50-to-1.

171
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,074
I can read.
I mean, how does she run?

172
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:55,623
I don't know shit from horses.
I just put up the names.

173
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,298
She started out at 20-to-1.

174
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:04,430
The smart money must figure
she ain't got a chance.

175
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,756
You want to bet or not?

176
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,306
Maybe later.

177
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,731
Ed's Pony Book.

178
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,156
You got a horse in the 10th race
called Mally No Show.

179
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,735
- Got a line on her?
- Hang on.

180
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:28,246
We've got her, 70-to- 1.

181
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,335
70? It was 60-to-1
10 minutes ago.

182
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,745
So aren 't you glad you waited?

183
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,457
But the odds are bound to go down.
No filly can be that bad.

184
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,641
You found out I was right, didn't you?

185
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,439
I didn't find out dick.

186
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,184
But a horse named Mally No Show's
in the 10th race at Santa Anita.

187
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:57,861
Somebody's betting she'll
drop dead at the starting gate.

188
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,942
And this is the gate right here!

189
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,870
You see? They're saying
we haven't got a chance!

190
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,952
For all I know,
it's just a coincidence.

191
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:11,375
It's not a coincidence.
There isn't any 10th race at Anita!

192
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:14,044
Wagon's outside.

193
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:16,588
What about that horse?

194
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,258
75-to-1.
Sounds like a real nag.

195
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:23,350
Go back home. Leave me be.
Call it off. Please!

196
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,510
We're splitting right now.

197
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,771
One of you call Hertz or Avis.
I don't care which one.

198
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,025
Have them leave me a car
between here and the airport.

199
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,768
Leave the keys. I'll pay
once she's on the plane.

200
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,735
If, and I say if,
what you're saying is true...

201
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:42,409
...somebody's betting I can't do my job.
They're full of shit!

202
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:46,953
These people laying these odds
will chew you up and spit you out!

203
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,828
You're fucking crazy.
I'm not going anyplace with you.

204
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:07,267
What about that car?

205
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:11,224
'74 Plymouth, blue.
It's parked at the Christian Center.

206
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:13,028
- Who's the driver?
- That's me.

207
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,525
Let's go.

208
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,490
- Just him.
- We're a team.

209
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,029
Next time.

210
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,401
You cheap-shot, gutless bastard!

211
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:53,647
You get off roughing up girls,
don't you?

212
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,363
Big man!
Big 45-caliber fruit!

213
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,484
That's me.

214
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,153
Macho mentality.

215
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:05,034
You'll get us both killed
before we get out of here!

216
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,711
Jesus!

217
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:10,375
Breathe deeply.

218
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:17,677
There it is.

219
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:25,811
All right.

220
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:29,152
Pull around in front.
I'll get her ready for transfer.

221
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,684
Check for the keys.

222
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:55,004
I'm hyperventilating, you bastard!

223
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:58,717
Go die by yourself.
I won't get out of this ambulance.

224
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,468
Come here.

225
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:34,129
- Take this.
- What's that?

226
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:35,553
It's a gun. Take it.

227
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,265
- I don't want it.
- Take it!

228
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,179
Anybody comes up behind us,
shoot him.

229
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,516
You got to be kidding!

230
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:50,776
Where the hell are you going?

231
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,323
I'll take a less popular way
to the airport.

232
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:56,912
After what happened back there?
They'll be waiting for us!

233
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:00,250
By the time they sift through
that wreckage, we'll be gone.

234
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:13,928
Pull over.

235
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:22,770
Until you pull that trigger,
I'm headed to the airport.

236
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,565
I mean it.

237
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,691
I swear to Christ,
if you don't stop, I'll shoot.

238
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,448
What's that?

239
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:32,776
They're shooting!

240
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,449
- Shoot at them!
- Stop! It's the police!

241
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,502
It's not the police!
Shoot at them!

242
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:41,833
I can't!

243
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,587
You were ready to
shoot at me, damn it!

244
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,241
Oh, my God!

245
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,106
So we don't go to the airport.

246
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,404
But I'll be damned
if I know where to go.

247
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,991
Six blocks down, hang a left.

248
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,621
Second house on the right.

249
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,663
You got a telephone in this place?

250
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,374
It's over there.

251
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:16,337
This your house?

252
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:17,913
Yeah.

253
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:23,125
What kind of guys do you bring here?

254
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:25,097
Locals, mostly.

255
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:27,887
Married men cheating on their wives.

256
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,848
- Police Department.
- Commissioner Blakelock's office.

257
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,558
Ben Shockley.

258
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:42,445
You were supposed to be
on the plane 15 minutes ago.

259
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,074
Somebody doesn't want
your nothing witness...

260
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:47,701
...to testify at your nothing trial.

261
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:51,533
If I'm going to get her to Phoenix,
I'll need your help.

262
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,838
Call the Vegas police
and send two squad cars...

263
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:59,004
...one for a decoy, the other
to take her to the airport.

264
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,381
Where are you?

265
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,506
Where the hell is this place?

266
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,508
316 Rothdale.

267
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,047
316 Rothdale.

268
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:09,394
You can't miss it.
There's an ambulance in front.

269
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,804
Yeah, it's a cathouse.

270
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:13,479
Stay there.

271
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:17,026
- Where the hell would I go?
- Don 't get smart, Shockley.

272
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,651
Yes, sir.

273
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:27,121
You win, Shockley.
I'm through fighting it.

274
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:30,497
I appreciate what you did
in the ambulance.

275
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,243
If you hadn't pulled me back...

276
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:35,956
My job's just to get you
back to Phoenix in one piece.

277
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,592
I know.

278
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:39,468
Still, I owe you.

279
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,176
You married?

280
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,134
What do you care?

281
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,766
I'm interested in you.

282
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,848
Want a glass?

283
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,435
It's fine.

284
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,226
Every woman has her thing about men.

285
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:57,030
Something that turns her on.

286
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:00,320
With me, it's hands.

287
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,615
I love strong hands.

288
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,366
Like yours.

289
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:11,753
We have time.

290
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:18,002
We'll have such a good time, baby.

291
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:20,884
Such a good time.

292
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,762
You're so beautiful.

293
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,846
You just lie there now.

294
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:27,563
Just lie there...

295
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:30,732
...and momma will do all the work.

296
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:34,771
Somehow I get the feeling
your heart isn't in your work.

297
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,110
You bastard!

298
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:38,239
Even if we do get to Phoenix...

299
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,782
...I'm not testifying
at any lousy trial.

300
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:43,872
That's your problem.
My job's to get you there.

301
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,573
You'd risk your life
for something this stupid?

302
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,329
All you've got's your job!

303
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:50,588
I just do what I'm told.

304
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,832
Yeah? So does an imbecile.

305
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,600
- Information.
- Number for Airwest.

306
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,938
We won't be here long.

307
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,903
Do you mind?
Once we're in the air...

308
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:17,862
...I'd hate you to worry
I'll leap out the washroom window.

309
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,198
Go ahead.

310
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:22,538
Air-worst has planes leaving
almost every hour.

311
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:25,788
Airwest?

312
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,339
When's your next flight to Phoenix?

313
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,045
You have planes leaving every hour?

314
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:36,671
I'd like to book a reservation
on your next flight for two.

315
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,011
Two people, name's Smith.

316
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:46,265
We'll be there. Thanks.

317
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,213
Let's go.

318
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:12,376
You, in the house!

319
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,635
Come out with your hands up!

320
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:17,554
We got the house surrounded.

321
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,679
Throw out your guns.
Bring the girl.

322
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:23,182
Fuck me!

323
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,403
Come on, let's go.

324
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,742
Come on, goddamn it!
They've got an army out there.

325
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:37,531
You've got thirty seconds.

326
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,335
They're shooting at us!

327
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,580
Mally?

328
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:53,882
Open fire!

329
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:57,223
Hold your fire!

330
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:20,084
Captain, they should've surrendered.

331
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:34,886
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about that passageway?

332
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,525
I'm your prisoner.
I was trying to escape.

333
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,354
What happened?
I heard shooting.

334
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,109
I damn near got cut to ribbons.

335
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,273
Somebody set me up!

336
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,237
Don't blame me.
It was your idea, calling the cops.

337
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,619
Did you shoot at those guys?

338
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,665
I didn't do jack shit!

339
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,328
Then why? What happened?

340
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,543
I don't know what happened.

341
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,831
Let's get out of here.

342
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:04,458
I don't suppose there's anybody
in this town you could trust?

343
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,298
I don't know. I'm not sure.

344
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,174
I guess in your line of work
you don't make many lifelong friends.

345
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,764
What about you?

346
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,594
Those were cops.
How many friends have you got?

347
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,517
Get your ass in gear.

348
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:17,564
Here.

349
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,187
Look normal.

350
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:21,402
I am normal.

351
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:39,374
- There's a cop car.
- Shut up.

352
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:57,025
- Do what I say and this won't go off.
- You got it!

353
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:58,606
Get in the back.

354
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,000
Now go.

355
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:25,215
Don't get nervous with that cannon.
I ain't no trouble.

356
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,639
Just head right on out there
to the left.

357
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,141
We just left 50 of your buddies,
tried to blow me to hell.

358
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,108
They were nothing but trouble.

359
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,278
You two are them holed up
in that cathouse, ain't you?

360
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,610
Do you know about that?

361
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,858
Every cop in town knows about it.

362
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:44,075
Just what do you know?

363
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,654
Our dispatcher said
there was this hooker...

364
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:50,912
...and three men, armed and dangerous,
holed up in a cathouse.

365
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,953
Hell, half the units in this city
must have picked it up.

366
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,540
I don't care what bullshit
came over that radio.

367
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:00,968
There was just us two in that house,
and I'm a cop.

368
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:06,347
You think that piece of tin
proves anything?

369
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,767
You can get that out of
a box of Cracker Jacks.

370
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,889
It's real. You look at it!

371
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:16,440
The two fellas in the car said
you shot at them...

372
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:17,942
...put them in a hospital.

373
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:19,777
Why would a cop do that?

374
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:22,073
They shot at us, that's why.

375
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:23,608
That ain't their story.

376
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:25,995
They said you fled
the scene of an accident.

377
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,822
They tailed you
and you opened up at them.

378
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,917
Well, they're full of shit.

379
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:32,873
Sure as hell, somebody is.

380
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,705
Constable 3- 1-5.
This is dispatch.

381
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:39,419
You being a cop, you don't mind
if I tell them you're in the car?

382
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,171
You just forget about that.

383
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:45,600
What's your detail?

384
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:49,640
You're compounding your problem,
kidnapping an officer.

385
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,687
I said, what's your detail, cowboy?

386
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,020
I got the west side shift.

387
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,655
I just cruise.

388
00:32:56,907 --> 00:33:00,241
Come sundown, I turn in this car
and hang up the hat.

389
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:04,907
You just cruise out this highway
towards the border, understand?

390
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,155
I'll tell you what.

391
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,378
I'll make you a deal.

392
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:11,207
If you're really a cop...

393
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:14,584
...let's turn this clit into the
people who are looking for her...

394
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:18,259
...and I'll forget the liberties
you've been taking.

395
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:19,671
You know who they are?

396
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:23,261
The people looking for her.
You know who they are?

397
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:26,313
Let's just say
that your story's true...

398
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:29,767
...about them dudes in the car
shooting at you first.

399
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,355
If them two are examples,
I'd say the folks hunting for her...

400
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,487
...have the initials M-O-B.

401
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,991
You didn't tell me
it was the Mob after us...

402
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:42,575
...raising the odds.

403
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,701
Who the hell are you protecting?

404
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:47,325
I'm not protecting anybody.
I didn't know.

405
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,620
Shit!

406
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:55,970
Now you got the cops
on your ass too.

407
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:58,546
The good guys and the bad guys.

408
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:01,215
You're between a rock
and a hard place, boy.

409
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:04,680
You ain't got a chance in hell.
No, sir!

410
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,310
What do you say, colonel?

411
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:11,434
Let's us get a taste of her
and turn her ass in. Okay?

412
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,230
Pull over up here.

413
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:17,738
Pull into this station right up here.

414
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,501
Right here. Stop.

415
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,622
Here, take these cuffs.

416
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:32,215
Put one bracelet on her hand
and one over the roll bar.

417
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:34,085
Tough guys!

418
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:36,671
Big tin-star egomaniacs.

419
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,359
Slide out this side.
Right over this side, here.

420
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,523
Over by that booth.

421
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:03,074
I ask you under penalty of perjury,
Mr. DeLuca...

422
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:07,499
... are there witnesses to corroborate
what you've told the jury?

423
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:10,420
One, sir.
One that I can think of.

424
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,130
Just one?

425
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:20,591
Detective Shockley from Vegas, sir.

426
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:22,803
Jesus!

427
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,066
I don't care what you heard.

428
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm telling you what happened
and who set me up.

429
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,032
Proof?

430
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,825
Proof against the Mob?
Come off of it, sir!

431
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,572
I've got a scorched ass.
That's all the proof I need.

432
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,458
In the middle of nowhere with
a witness you said means nothing.

433
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:48,384
And everybody in this town's
shooting at me.

434
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,757
And I'm slightly worried about it.

435
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:52,471
You've got to bring me in.

436
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,472
I'd like an escort.

437
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:56,469
A convoy of Arizona police...

438
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:59,015
... to take me and the prisoner
back to Phoenix.

439
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:00,813
Where and when?

440
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:03,437
The Arizona border's
an hour away from here.

441
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,851
I'll be riding in a constable's car.

442
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,143
You copy?

443
00:36:07,404 --> 00:36:08,235
Affirmative.

444
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:11,063
You'll have your escort.

445
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:13,899
You'll transfer from
the constable's vehicle...

446
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:17,863
...to an escort car in 60 minutes.
Can you handle it...

447
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:21,375
...or should I write it in braille
and shove it up your ass?

448
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:25,371
Yes, sir.

449
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:28,541
Take us to the border.

450
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:32,338
I heard some of that phone stuff
so I guess you are a cop.

451
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:35,635
So you know I got to call in
at quitting time, which is now.

452
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,764
Call in, tell them you need
the car for another hour.

453
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,229
Say your mother-in-law
was hit by a truck.

454
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:44,520
Tell them anything,
just make believers out of them.

455
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,586
You mind if I ask you a question?

456
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:07,502
How many times a month
you spread your legs?

457
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:10,927
Just drive the car, will you?

458
00:37:11,182 --> 00:37:13,673
I got a chance to learn
something, colonel.

459
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:16,598
As long as I got to chauffer
the little strumpet.

460
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:20,390
You mind if a country boy
picks up a little education?

461
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:24,856
I got this buddy...

462
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:28,031
...he had the idea we'd open
a string of whorehouses...

463
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:30,857
...and advertise
like fried chicken places.

464
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,077
"Finger-lickin' good!"

465
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:38,794
How's it work with your kind?

466
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:41,038
You go to some kind of special school?

467
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,289
I have a B.A. From Finch College.

468
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:46,378
Is that where you learned
how to give head?

469
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:49,342
Will you shut up, for chrissake!

470
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:52,344
Colonel, you coming to
the strumpet's rescue?

471
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:55,971
I bet you had some ideas
of getting some gash yourself.

472
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,638
Maybe you already had
a taste of it, huh?

473
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:02,069
Ain't nothing like
a slice of the damp, is there?

474
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:05,397
You can't fool Deke.
I seen you zip your fly...

475
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,449
Will you shut up!

476
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:12,028
Let him talk.

477
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,088
Were you going to shoot
a fellow officer, colonel?

478
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,332
What'll you tell them back home?
I was insulting your whore?

479
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,219
Looks like you done lost
your hero-boy.

480
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,598
I can take care of myself.

481
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,641
Yeah, I bet you can at that.

482
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,476
Let's me and you have a little talk.

483
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,606
Did you ever go down on
another little girl?

484
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,106
Ever have it done to you?

485
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,526
Whores just don't make it with guys.

486
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:48,778
They make it with anybody
with cash, right?

487
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,079
Bet you do.

488
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,333
Bet I'd like to watch you too.

489
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:56,497
Yes, ma'am. I'd really dig
watching you.

490
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:59,750
Them little melons
all pink and tight.

491
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:03,424
That little ass a-humping
and a-jerking around.

492
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:06,882
Them long legs
all jacked up juicy-like.

493
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:10,764
I bet it don't take much
to get you all wet...

494
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:13,469
...and hot to trot, does it?

495
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,775
Talk to me. I want to know
what it's like being a whore.

496
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:27,452
Actually, I always thought
it was rather like being a cop.

497
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:29,033
You did?

498
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,956
Not unlike being on the take at
two dozen bars in downtown Vegas.

499
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,092
Taking money from
some politician each time...

500
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:44,430
...you peel his drunken kid's Cadillac
off a telephone pole.

501
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:48,465
Strong-arming the Chicanos
in the barrio on Saturday night.

502
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,305
Busting kids for smoking grass...

503
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,226
...then taking a kickback
from heroin dealers.

504
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,848
Or those occasions
when you do bust a pusher...

505
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,020
...and skim the haul
when you've made the collar.

506
00:39:58,237 --> 00:40:01,689
Sell it to your
dope addict buddies on the force.

507
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:04,615
She's sure onto all our tricks.

508
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,236
As I see it...

509
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:11,040
...the only difference between us,
is that when I quit work...

510
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:13,328
...I take a long hot bath...

511
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,167
...and I'm clean
as the day I was born.

512
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:17,876
But a cop...

513
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:20,210
...especially a flunkie like you...

514
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:23,265
...when sheriff whistles,
you squat.

515
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,424
And what he does to you
rots your brain.

516
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:28,180
No amount of water
can get you clean again.

517
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:30,888
You going to take that crap?

518
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:33,725
You were the one
that wanted her to talk.

519
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,274
I know you don't like women like me.

520
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,112
We're a bit aggressive.

521
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:39,775
We frighten you.

522
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,072
Because you've got
filth in your brain.

523
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:44,699
The only way
you'll ever clean it out...

524
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:46,663
...is to put a bullet through it.

525
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,076
Does your wife know you masturbate?

526
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,592
You've had your chat.
Now drive!

527
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,511
What's going to happen at the border?

528
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:51,942
We'll pick up an escort
to take us to Phoenix.

529
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:53,607
Who?

530
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,192
Police.

531
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:58,781
Arizona police.

532
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:00,905
How do you know?

533
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:02,828
Because I asked for them.

534
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:07,956
Did you call the same person
you telephoned from the house?

535
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:15,212
When I saw you back in the culvert
you said you'd been set up.

536
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:19,922
It seemed that way at the time.

537
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,973
What's changed since then?

538
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:28,566
What are you trying to say?

539
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:30,936
Somebody's trying to kill me.

540
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,520
Since you're along,
you're a target too.

541
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:37,784
The car that blew up,
and the guys who shot at us...

542
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,280
...could've been the Mob.

543
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,492
But back at the house,
those were cops outside.

544
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,419
Somehow they got the wrong message.

545
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:50,129
Maybe it was a legitimate mistake.
Maybe not.

546
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:51,757
But if it wasn't...

547
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,423
...who would've given them
the wrong message?

548
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:56,554
How would I know?

549
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,052
Not my guys.

550
00:42:58,307 --> 00:43:01,143
Not the guys on my own force,
for chrissake!

551
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:03,643
You're probably right.

552
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:08,306
But let's just say that
there's a chance you're wrong.

553
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,775
Just one chance in a thousand.

554
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:16,618
The state line's a pretty
lonely place to find out.

555
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:20,911
Hear what she said
about your own people?

556
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,491
You going to sit there
and take that shit?

557
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:29,838
How far is the state line?

558
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,835
About 10 miles.

559
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:38,553
I really do have a college degree.

560
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:57,742
State line's just beyond
that next rise up there.

561
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,449
Good thing you're out of here.

562
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,701
I ever see you again,
you've had it.

563
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:23,307
I may be wrong.

564
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:25,264
But what if I'm right?

565
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,993
Pull over here.

566
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,496
Pull over and stop!

567
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:40,622
The hell, you say!

568
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:56,975
I'll leave your gun by the road.
You can pick it up later.

569
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,342
Damn bet I will!

570
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:00,597
You'll have some fast talking to do.

571
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:03,692
They'll wonder why you bailed out,
and I'll tell them.

572
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:05,356
You chose sides.

573
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:08,150
Got yourself a little nookie
and chose sides!

574
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:17,870
Shit!

575
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,240
Better get a move on.

576
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:22,705
If you're wrong,
I want to be there to explain...

577
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,881
...before that asshole
starts spouting off.

578
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:06,216
Red Fox One, this is Kingman relay.

579
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,794
Has Rabbit arrived yet?

580
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:11,511
Rabbit approaching.

581
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:14,139
Ten-four.
Will relay to Phoenix.

582
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,066
How y'all doing?

583
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,480
If it's any consolation...

584
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:18,023
Nothing.

585
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:21,364
Shut up.

586
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:29,154
Never saw a cop feeling sorry
for himself before.

587
00:48:29,415 --> 00:48:31,123
Mind if I watch?

588
00:48:34,546 --> 00:48:37,713
For 2 cents and a stick of gum
I'd kick the shit out of you.

589
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:40,464
Whatever gets you off, butch.

590
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:44,964
After I was through...

591
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,133
...where would I leave the $20?

592
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:52,262
I don't want your money.
I love you for your mind.

593
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:14,542
Sorry.

594
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:17,289
Just had to jog your thinking.

595
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:22,430
You're a loser.

596
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:23,713
I'm splitting.

597
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:31,265
You'd shoot a woman in the back?

598
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:33,517
How would that look on your record?

599
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:37,400
You'd never make it
alone out there.

600
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:40,022
With you I don't have a chance.

601
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:41,861
On my own, I do okay.

602
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,028
I saved you from that constable.

603
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,408
I wouldn't take any bows.

604
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:50,580
If not for me, you'd have let that
schmuck drive us into the guns.

605
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:53,713
There wouldn't be guns
if they weren't try to kill you.

606
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:56,421
It's both of us, you witless idiot!

607
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:58,550
Haven't you figured that out?

608
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,336
Why do you think
you drew this assignment?

609
00:50:01,557 --> 00:50:04,048
Because I get the job done!

610
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,765
They don't want the job done!

611
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:09,144
They picked you because
you're a drunken bum.

612
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,228
And if they bump you off,
not a fucking soul...

613
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,436
...is going to give a rat's ass!

614
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:15,811
You're a nothing.

615
00:50:16,156 --> 00:50:17,069
A nobody.

616
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:19,281
A faded number on a rusty badge.

617
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:23,402
You've been set up by your own
people to take the fall with me.

618
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:26,073
Wake up, for chrissake!

619
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:30,711
At least that way you'll know
where the bullets are coming from!

620
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,010
Watch out for the sidewinders.

621
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:41,346
What?

622
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:44,892
It's a type of rattlesnake
that comes out after dark.

623
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:47,647
Horseshit!

624
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:51,724
They're drawn by body heat.
You never know it till they hit you.

625
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,250
I'll leave in the morning.

626
00:51:13,676 --> 00:51:15,005
I will!

627
00:51:15,428 --> 00:51:17,966
I'll make it too. You'll see.

628
00:51:26,774 --> 00:51:29,561
If we were in Vegas,
you'd be just going to work.

629
00:51:31,237 --> 00:51:33,907
Go polish your badge, Shockley.

630
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:36,033
It's all you've got.

631
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:37,952
Miserable bitch!

632
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:42,829
Welcome to the ranks
of the disenchanted.

633
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,959
Shut up and go to sleep.

634
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,916
I'm a counter-puncher, Shockley.

635
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:56,053
If you can't last the 12 rounds
then stay out of the ring.

636
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:34,168
Who's DeLuca?

637
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,802
Angelo DeLuca, as in the
State of Arizona vs. DeLuca.

638
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:42,058
Who is he?

639
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,641
Have you been sitting there all night?

640
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:48,353
Cut the mother-hen crap, will you?

641
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:51,400
You're supposed to be
a witness at this trial.

642
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,444
Now who the hell is he?

643
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:56,275
- Small time.
- Is he Mob?

644
00:52:56,913 --> 00:52:58,407
Who knows?

645
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:00,665
Talk, for chrissake!

646
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:03,367
Hell, I guess he is.
So what?

647
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:07,462
A: The Mob's making book
you don't testify at the trial.

648
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:11,335
And B: Somebody on the Phoenix P.D.
Also doesn't want you testifying.

649
00:53:11,596 --> 00:53:13,884
A plus B equals a tie-in...

650
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:16,305
...between the Mob
and the police force.

651
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,681
You sit on your ass all night
figuring that out?

652
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:21,397
Congratulations.

653
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:22,977
Now, who's DeLuca?

654
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,605
I only met the guy once! Jesus!

655
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:28,103
I'm no good without coffee.
Lay off!

656
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,321
The time you met him, what happened?

657
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,366
I don't want to talk about it.

658
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:34,907
Half my force is involved
and you won't talk.

659
00:53:35,163 --> 00:53:35,993
You heard me.

660
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,157
- Who you protecting?
- Nobody.

661
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:41,329
Me! I'm protecting me!
So lay off!

662
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:42,831
From what? From me?

663
00:53:43,088 --> 00:53:46,042
Have I tried to kill you?
Or jump your bones?

664
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,091
I'm not the enemy!

665
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:50,261
Hurray for Mr. Clean.

666
00:53:50,471 --> 00:53:51,930
What did he do?

667
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,097
I don't want to talk about it!

668
00:53:54,934 --> 00:53:55,930
You're the key.

669
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:58,599
You're the proof
and both sides know it.

670
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:05,314
Please.

671
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:18,697
DeLuca set me up with this guy.

672
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,285
Told me to be special nice to him.

673
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:22,703
What guy?

674
00:54:23,715 --> 00:54:25,091
Someone on the force.

675
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,130
Phoenix P. D?

676
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:28,925
His name?

677
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:32,930
I didn't ask.

678
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:34,389
What happened?

679
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,018
I went to this hotel room...

680
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,690
...in Vegas.

681
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,276
There was this guy there.

682
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:55,119
He seemed like an okay guy.

683
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,911
I asked him how he wanted it.

684
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,422
He told me to take off my clothes...

685
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,252
...lie down on the bed...

686
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,336
...lie on my stomach.

687
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,390
Told me to open up my legs.

688
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,011
I couldn't see him.

689
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:15,854
He had this gun.

690
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:20,026
He took this gun with one hand...

691
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,358
...and he held it there.

692
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:28,575
I knew what he was doing
with his other hand.

693
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:33,033
And he told me...

694
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,579
...if I screamed,
he'd pull the trigger.

695
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:36,623
Describe him.

696
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:42,004
He was 55, 60.

697
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,926
Blue eyes, gray hair.
Very distinguished.

698
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:51,681
And he had this face...

699
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,975
...that looked like it was
made out of stone.

700
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,275
And his voice...

701
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:04,313
...sounded like it came
from the bottom of a tomb.

702
00:56:08,954 --> 00:56:09,784
Blakelock.

703
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:18,418
Hogs.

704
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:24,757
You stay there.

705
00:56:54,962 --> 00:56:56,207
Oh, my God!

706
00:56:57,215 --> 00:56:58,543
You wait here.

707
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,552
- Where you going?
- You just stay here.

708
00:57:10,062 --> 00:57:12,387
All right, mother-jumpers!
This is a bust!

709
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:21,114
Everybody up against their bike.
Balls in your pockets.

710
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:22,899
Come on!

711
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,957
Don't do that, man! Don't!

712
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:41,303
Son of a bitch!

713
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:45,305
The next turkey who tries that,
I'll shoot him...

714
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:48,720
...stuff him and stick
an apple in his ass.

715
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:50,219
Any takers?

716
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:52,391
You? You?

717
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:54,437
You? You?

718
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:55,649
Hey, man.

719
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:58,356
You can't do this without a warrant.

720
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:01,529
The man says I need a warrant.

721
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:04,401
The man don't know jack shit!

722
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:07,742
Anybody here know more
about the law here than me?

723
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:09,618
Any lawyers here?

724
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:13,085
Any lawyers want to tell me
why I don't need a warrant?

725
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:15,254
Why don't you get off our case?

726
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:18,084
You with the fucking hair.

727
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:19,375
You look smart.

728
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:23,097
Tell me why I'm entitled
to come in here anytime I please.

729
00:58:26,728 --> 00:58:27,926
Reasonable what?

730
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:30,564
Reasonable suspicion.

731
00:58:30,816 --> 00:58:33,521
Exactly!
Reasonable suspicion.

732
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:36,566
I can do as I please
if I have reasonable suspicion.

733
00:58:36,822 --> 00:58:39,610
If I have suspicion
a felony's been committed...

734
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:42,868
...I can walk in here
anytime I feel like it.

735
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:45,493
Because I got this badge, this gun...

736
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:48,703
...and I got the love of Jesus
in my pretty green eyes.

737
00:58:48,919 --> 00:58:50,627
He must be high on something.

738
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,504
He's just fucking crazy.

739
00:58:52,756 --> 00:58:54,630
Shockley, you idiot!

740
00:58:55,259 --> 00:58:59,043
Mindless, brainless,
stupid, fucking idiot!

741
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:01,215
Maybe even one of you girls.

742
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:02,933
Like what?

743
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:06,436
I don't know what.
And personally I don't give a shit.

744
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,897
The main thing is,
I'll have to bust you all.

745
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:13,857
Of course, we do have a choice.
Wait a second. We have a choice.

746
00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:18,112
If you get on those bikes and
get out in the next 30 seconds...

747
00:59:18,326 --> 00:59:20,817
...I'll let you off with just a warning.

748
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:23,202
However, if you give me any shit...

749
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:24,737
...any shit at all...

750
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,039
...then there's going to be more cops.

751
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:30,919
More guns. More handcuffs.
More marijuana-sniffing dogs...

752
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:34,049
...than you've ever seen
in your wildest hallucinations.

753
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:36,460
Thirty seconds!

754
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:39,217
Haul ass!

755
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,047
This bike stays with me.
You 3 can take a hike.

756
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:17,510
Hey, man!
This is our choppers, Charlie!

757
01:00:17,723 --> 01:00:19,799
This is my gun, Clyde!

758
01:00:20,059 --> 01:00:21,339
Come on, this game's dead.

759
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:24,272
Let's get out of here.
This guy's nuts.

760
01:00:24,522 --> 01:00:26,349
- Fuck you!
- Take a hike, man.

761
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:28,517
What else can you do?

762
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:31,609
Pig!

763
01:00:31,863 --> 01:00:32,729
Asshole!

764
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,113
You're crazy!

765
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:38,073
Ridiculous!

766
01:00:38,954 --> 01:00:42,489
You're outrageous.
You're just completely outrageous.

767
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,830
Thanks.

768
01:00:44,502 --> 01:00:47,503
- Hop aboard.
- Do you know how to drive this thing?

769
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:50,715
It's been a few years.

770
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,672
We'll fake it.

771
01:01:30,218 --> 01:01:32,674
Maynard Josephson, Metro squad.

772
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:35,136
I'll get us something to eat.

773
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,141
Josephson.

774
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,519
Josephson? It's me, Shockley.

775
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:43,888
Ben?

776
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,107
For chrissakes, Ben!

777
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:50,068
There's an APB out on you.

778
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:51,313
Why'd you do it?

779
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,529
Do what?

780
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:55,281
The constable last night.
Why'd you kill him?

781
01:01:55,495 --> 01:01:58,165
I didn't kill anybody.
That's Blakelock, you hear me?

782
01:01:58,457 --> 01:01:59,371
It's who?

783
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,208
It's Commissioner Blakelock.

784
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,955
He's tied in with the Mob.

785
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:05,288
He's trying to nail me and the girl.

786
01:02:05,548 --> 01:02:07,755
What girl are you talking about?

787
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:12,345
The witness at that trial.
Gus Mally's not a guy, it's a girl.

788
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:16,642
And if she testifies,
Blakelock knows she'll torpedo him.

789
01:02:21,232 --> 01:02:22,228
Hear me, Josey?

790
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:35,282
Come on!

791
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:40,871
What's going on?

792
01:02:41,128 --> 01:02:43,086
Blakelock's buddies.

793
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:49,761
Hold tight.

794
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:43,361
Look out!

795
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:45,456
Jesus, we're going to hit!

796
01:08:49,944 --> 01:08:51,058
Let's go.

797
01:08:57,952 --> 01:08:59,233
We'll never make it.

798
01:09:00,664 --> 01:09:02,621
Nag, nag, nag!

799
01:09:14,095 --> 01:09:15,554
Thanks, buddy.

800
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,405
Hold him! Hold him!

801
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:33,903
Stop!

802
01:09:36,536 --> 01:09:37,816
Let me kick him!

803
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:40,749
- Move away from him!
- Let him alone!

804
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,122
- Get off my hand!
- Get him up!

805
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:57,299
Where's your gun, Clyde?

806
01:10:05,776 --> 01:10:07,603
I'll get his hand.
Hit him!

807
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,066
Where's your gun?

808
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:11,113
Get this bitch away!

809
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:15,493
Get away from here!

810
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,160
Give it to him!
Come on, hit him!

811
01:10:37,894 --> 01:10:41,061
What are you?
A bunch of goddamn fairies?

812
01:10:43,316 --> 01:10:44,859
You want to play with boys...

813
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,897
...or show me if you got
anything between your legs?

814
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:34,286
Get her pants off.

815
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,162
Hold still!

816
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:07,938
Get her pants.

817
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,818
You get her pants, man!

818
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:15,999
Get off her.

819
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:44,780
You wouldn't hit a lady.

820
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,089
Mally?

821
01:14:20,927 --> 01:14:23,085
When's the next bus to Phoenix?

822
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:27,724
Next express pulls in at 3 o'clock.

823
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,473
Thanks.

824
01:14:29,686 --> 01:14:30,765
You want a ticket?

825
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:34,557
I don't think that'll be necessary.

826
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:37,060
I heard it's 3 o'clock.

827
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:42,605
This whole idea's insane.

828
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:14,817
You first.

829
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,323
Care for something to eat?

830
01:15:24,329 --> 01:15:25,823
What'll you have?

831
01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:28,613
Surprise me.

832
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:36,881
- Josephson here.
- Josephson?

833
01:15:37,134 --> 01:15:38,249
Ben!

834
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:40,005
Hold on, guy.

835
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:46,884
You okay?

836
01:15:47,395 --> 01:15:48,938
I'm coming in.

837
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:50,517
Coming in where?

838
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:53,524
Phoenix. Right to City Hall.

839
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:56,692
For chrissakes, that's nuts!

840
01:15:56,906 --> 01:15:58,186
Will you write this down?

841
01:15:58,574 --> 01:15:59,819
You can't!

842
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:01,991
Please.
Will you write this down?

843
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:06,162
All right, all right.
Go ahead.

844
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:09,330
I'm taking the 7th Street off-ramp...

845
01:16:09,586 --> 01:16:11,744
...going down Central over Mesa...

846
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:13,832
...straight down Adams to City Hall.

847
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:15,330
You got that?

848
01:16:15,801 --> 01:16:19,051
Seventh, Central, Adams, Mesa.
I got it. But, Ben...

849
01:16:19,263 --> 01:16:21,090
Five minutes after I leave here...

850
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:23,425
...Blakelock's going to hear I'm coming.

851
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:25,345
He's going to try and stop me.

852
01:16:25,603 --> 01:16:29,648
I want you to give him my route.
Tell him to clear the streets.

853
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,809
That way no innocent people get killed.

854
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:34,060
This is crazy.

855
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:36,148
And give him this message:

856
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:39,106
Tell him I know why
he picked me for the job.

857
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:40,702
Tell him he was wrong.

858
01:16:40,953 --> 01:16:44,405
Tell him I'm coming
and I'll nail his ass to the wall.

859
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,697
You hear me?

860
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:48,496
For chrissakes!

861
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:52,538
He'll have every cop on the force there.
You can't get in there!

862
01:16:52,758 --> 01:16:55,331
Thanks, partner.
My best to the family.

863
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:04,644
Jesus Christ!

864
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:11,814
- Front desk.
- This is 14-A.

865
01:17:12,988 --> 01:17:15,859
You have anything like room service
around this joint?

866
01:17:16,116 --> 01:17:17,776
I can probably get you something.

867
01:17:18,035 --> 01:17:21,618
Maybe you could send your kid out
and pick up some steaks...

868
01:17:21,872 --> 01:17:25,206
...fried chicken. Something like that.
Maybe a bottle of wine.

869
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,251
Yes, sir. Anything else?

870
01:17:27,504 --> 01:17:30,374
Is there anything like a florist
around this neighborhood?

871
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:42,427
When I was a kid growing up,
I used to hate cops.

872
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:45,809
Me and the other kids
in the neighborhood...

873
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:48,641
...we'd always get in trouble, fights.

874
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:50,266
Gang fights.

875
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:53,687
Always getting rousted by the cops.

876
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:57,696
I suppose if we had guns
like gangs do nowadays...

877
01:17:57,953 --> 01:18:00,409
...I'd have shot every cop on sight.

878
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:05,457
Parents never seemed to care.

879
01:18:05,712 --> 01:18:08,203
Teachers, they forgot how to care.

880
01:18:09,632 --> 01:18:14,259
As you grow older, you begin
to realize what cops are all about.

881
01:18:15,097 --> 01:18:19,391
They're just doing a job,
enforcing the law. Raising families.

882
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:25,106
If you break the law you get busted.
That's about all there is to it.

883
01:18:25,358 --> 01:18:27,351
I learned to respect that.

884
01:18:29,362 --> 01:18:31,485
I even began to realize...

885
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,405
...that the only people I knew
that stood for something were cops.

886
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:39,665
So when I got old enough,
I joined up.

887
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,039
I had this dream, boy.

888
01:18:45,213 --> 01:18:47,964
I had this dream
of meeting the right woman...

889
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:49,503
...having kids.

890
01:18:51,511 --> 01:18:52,922
Most of all...

891
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:55,380
...breaking that big case.

892
01:18:55,891 --> 01:18:59,260
I could just see them pinning
captain bars on me and...

893
01:19:01,146 --> 01:19:05,227
Well, the years went by, and
never did meet that right woman.

894
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:10,736
Seemed like other guys
were always breaking the big case.

895
01:19:12,993 --> 01:19:15,614
After a while you get to the point
where you just...

896
01:19:15,871 --> 01:19:18,706
...put in your 20
and wait for retirement.

897
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:27,499
Now I got the big case
and I'm picked to go down with it.

898
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:31,839
You don't have to.
Neither of us does.

899
01:19:32,097 --> 01:19:34,469
Nobody's forcing us
to go back to Phoenix.

900
01:19:34,724 --> 01:19:38,224
We could go to Canada or Mexico.
Anyplace!

901
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,063
Sure. And live like kings.

902
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:41,648
I've got some money.

903
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:43,179
I've got my checkbook.

904
01:19:43,442 --> 01:19:45,731
$5000 back in Vegas.

905
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:47,896
And when that runs out?

906
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:52,318
Then let's take the money
and buy a pickup truck.

907
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:54,908
An old sedan,
or something unobtrusive.

908
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:58,414
We'll take back roads, turn ourselves
in to some precinct station.

909
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:00,161
Anything but City Hall!

910
01:20:00,419 --> 01:20:02,412
We'll ask for protective custody.

911
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:03,667
Talk to the D.A.

912
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:06,330
That's exactly what I want you to do.

913
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:07,957
What about you?

914
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:09,879
Me? I'm going in.

915
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,087
Why?

916
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:15,097
We know why Blakelock picked me
for this job. I'll prove he's wrong.

917
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,597
Then I'm going with you.

918
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,975
You're not my prisoner.
You can go.

919
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,939
You get your money.
It's between me and Blakelock.

920
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:28,731
You said yourself you didn't
think the whole thing would work.

921
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,735
At least someone'll know I tried.

922
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,903
- Who, Blakelock?
- No, me.

923
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,885
- Operator.
- Area 2-1-2, please.

924
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:49,259
684-6114.

925
01:20:49,514 --> 01:20:50,973
Just a moment.

926
01:20:55,353 --> 01:20:57,180
- Hello.
- Hi. Mom?

927
01:20:57,981 --> 01:20:59,725
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

928
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,775
I'm okay. How are you?

929
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,101
I'm in...

930
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:05,442
...Wickenberg.

931
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,189
Wickenberg.

932
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:10,486
It's a small town halfway
between Vegas and Phoenix.

933
01:21:10,745 --> 01:21:13,699
I thought you had
a nice job you liked.

934
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,582
I quit that job.

935
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:18,123
Who wants to be
a secretary all her life?

936
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,537
That's what I've always said.

937
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:23,086
Things always happen for the best.

938
01:21:23,676 --> 01:21:25,799
Anyway, the big news is...

939
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,927
...I met this man.

940
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,723
He's really special.

941
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:32,798
You'd really like him.

942
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:34,970
If you like him,
that's what counts.

943
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:37,685
Shockley.

944
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,025
Ben Shockley.

945
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,027
Jesus! What difference does
it make what church he goes to?

946
01:21:47,284 --> 01:21:50,903
We love each other
and we're going to be married.

947
01:21:51,289 --> 01:21:52,452
We're going to...

948
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:56,159
...settle down in Arizona
and have kids.

949
01:21:56,419 --> 01:21:58,542
Where are you going to live?

950
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:00,042
I don't know.

951
01:22:01,258 --> 01:22:04,010
We hadn't really decided.
Probably...

952
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:06,717
...Northern Arizona somewhere.

953
01:22:06,972 --> 01:22:09,214
Maybe up near the canyon.

954
01:22:09,517 --> 01:22:12,269
It's supposed to be
really beautiful there...

955
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,388
...and you can still get land.

956
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,268
When are you getting married?

957
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:22,193
We've got business we have to
take care of in Phoenix first.

958
01:22:22,448 --> 01:22:24,357
Then we're going to do it.

959
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:25,903
What business is he in?

960
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,820
I just wanted you to know.

961
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,570
Look, would you tell Dad?

962
01:22:30,832 --> 01:22:32,741
What was the young man 's name again?

963
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:35,539
Shockley. Just like it sounds.

964
01:22:36,546 --> 01:22:39,333
- I love you.
- I love you too, dear.

965
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,341
What number, please?

966
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:49,263
Give me Las Vegas. 283-8779.

967
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:52,012
Up near the canyon, huh?

968
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:55,348
Bernie's Book.

969
01:22:55,608 --> 01:22:57,435
Bernie? Gus Mally.

970
01:22:58,695 --> 01:23:02,147
Listen, what's the line on
that horse, Mally No Show?

971
01:23:02,616 --> 01:23:04,823
100-to-1? Perfect.

972
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:08,369
I want $5000 worth, on the nose.

973
01:23:08,622 --> 01:23:10,081
You know I'm good for it.

974
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:13,999
She's going to be a winner.

975
01:23:22,596 --> 01:23:24,007
Let's go.

976
01:23:38,697 --> 01:23:39,693
Move on out.

977
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,490
What the hell
you think you're doing?

978
01:23:41,825 --> 01:23:43,367
What the hell's it look like?

979
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:46,154
What's wrong with you?
This is the bus.

980
01:23:46,372 --> 01:23:47,914
I don't give a damn.

981
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,784
Get away from that lever.

982
01:23:52,378 --> 01:23:53,707
Get out of here.

983
01:23:56,883 --> 01:23:59,125
Let's get the luggage
out of this thing.

984
01:24:00,637 --> 01:24:02,926
Sorry for this inconvenience...

985
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:05,886
...but I'll have to ask you
to leave the bus.

986
01:24:06,143 --> 01:24:10,223
Please be sure to take your belongings.
Arrangements will be made...

987
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:14,016
...for your continued journey
as quickly as possible.

988
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,438
Haul ass!

989
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:28,288
You, shorty!

990
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:31,033
And you, give me a hand
with this luggage.

991
01:24:33,047 --> 01:24:34,755
My, this is so exciting!

992
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:37,084
Just like on the news!

993
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,796
Court stands to recess.

994
01:24:43,809 --> 01:24:44,805
Ralph, ten minutes.

995
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,219
I don't know if you
remember me or not.

996
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:49,519
My name is Josephson, I'm Metro squad...

997
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:51,766
I'm busy now.
Can you see me later?

998
01:24:52,026 --> 01:24:54,980
Yes, sir. But you see,
this is about Shockley.

999
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:58,488
He and I talked together
just a little while ago.

1000
01:24:58,742 --> 01:24:59,773
You spoke with him?

1001
01:24:59,993 --> 01:25:03,777
Yes, sir. He's coming in.
He gave me his entire route.

1002
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:07,455
He said some very strange things
about Commissioner Blakelock...

1003
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:09,661
...and I didn't know who to approach.

1004
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,621
You've done absolutely the right thing
coming to me about this.

1005
01:25:15,051 --> 01:25:17,720
Why don't we go into my office
and talk there?

1006
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:30,014
There's some quarter-inch steel here.
Get this over by the bus.

1007
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:34,318
Here's what I'm looking for.

1008
01:25:49,463 --> 01:25:51,670
What's this Josephson know?

1009
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,840
Nothing that can hurt us yet.

1010
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:57,676
Why would Shockley give us his route?

1011
01:25:57,931 --> 01:26:00,932
I don't know.
I haven't had time to melt it down.

1012
01:26:01,184 --> 01:26:03,473
It's a ruse. It's a ploy.

1013
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:06,480
He's trying to manipulate us
into thinking some...

1014
01:26:06,732 --> 01:26:08,523
I think he's on the level.

1015
01:26:12,363 --> 01:26:13,608
I'll call you.

1016
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:15,027
Do that, Feyderspiel.

1017
01:26:15,283 --> 01:26:17,821
Before the whole bucket
blows up under our face.

1018
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:20,368
You get that trial postponed.

1019
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:22,698
Have a heart attack.
Perjure yourself.

1020
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,500
Shockley's got to be stopped.

1021
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:25,996
Stopped hard.

1022
01:26:45,816 --> 01:26:47,191
So long, folks.

1023
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:49,475
Good luck.

1024
01:26:56,577 --> 01:26:57,407
All set?

1025
01:26:59,080 --> 01:26:59,910
Ready.

1026
01:27:22,063 --> 01:27:23,771
Hijacked a what?

1027
01:27:32,366 --> 01:27:36,411
Wickenberg-Phoenix.
That's 150 miles of goddamn desert.

1028
01:27:36,662 --> 01:27:38,869
It's 3 hours on that road.

1029
01:27:39,123 --> 01:27:40,286
We could...

1030
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:43,623
...blast that bus to hell.

1031
01:27:44,296 --> 01:27:46,170
Sitting duck, you know?

1032
01:27:46,423 --> 01:27:47,288
Call Vegas.

1033
01:27:47,549 --> 01:27:50,586
Have the boys do it.
Blow the shit out of it, I mean.

1034
01:27:50,803 --> 01:27:52,214
I could make that call.

1035
01:27:52,471 --> 01:27:54,760
But the boys don't
do that sort of job.

1036
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:56,474
It's a little high-profile.

1037
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:58,344
But they're with us, right?

1038
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,552
Yes, sir.

1039
01:28:00,813 --> 01:28:04,397
But we're talking about
a large bus on a public highway.

1040
01:28:04,651 --> 01:28:06,311
And that's big news.

1041
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:09,357
Our friends in Las Vegas
don't like...

1042
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:11,858
They're embarrassed by
that kind of coverage.

1043
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:15,611
Our boys, then. The cops,
deputy sheriffs, Highway Patrol.

1044
01:28:15,871 --> 01:28:19,038
We've got heavy-duty weapons,
don't we? Bazookas?

1045
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:20,952
We have the assholes.

1046
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:23,618
Show some balls!
Blow them away, for chrissake!

1047
01:28:23,838 --> 01:28:27,042
Sir, with all due respect,
this is a very well-traveled highway.

1048
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,385
We don't want blood and tennis rackets
all over the asphalt.

1049
01:28:30,637 --> 01:28:31,467
Screw it!

1050
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:33,465
A few casualties.

1051
01:28:33,974 --> 01:28:37,344
If there are casualties,
other than Shockley and the girl...

1052
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:39,976
...someone will be answerable.
You.

1053
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,432
I make the decisions.

1054
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,856
Now what is it?
Are there any other options?

1055
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:51,488
I suggest we let Shockley
drive right in.

1056
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:53,321
Now, we have his route.

1057
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:55,453
We then employ a two-phase plan.

1058
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:58,494
In phase one, we use his friend,
Josephson, to lay a trap.

1059
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:01,540
In phase two, we clear
the streets along his route...

1060
01:29:01,796 --> 01:29:04,750
...deploy our men and create
an impassable barrier.

1061
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,793
A gauntlet, if you will.

1062
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:08,676
He won't have a chance.

1063
01:29:10,556 --> 01:29:11,931
That would work, wouldn't it?

1064
01:29:14,643 --> 01:29:15,557
I mean...

1065
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:19,227
...we could control
the media then too.

1066
01:29:19,857 --> 01:29:23,606
We'd appear justified, getting him.
It'd be a feather in our caps.

1067
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,356
- Excellent thinking.
- Then that's our plan.

1068
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:32,445
Can you manage? Can you
arrange the thing with his friend?

1069
01:29:32,746 --> 01:29:33,778
Josephson, sir?

1070
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:35,284
Yes, sir.

1071
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,873
I'll put it in the works right away.

1072
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:42,754
I repeat to all units:

1073
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,998
Station yourselves as requested.

1074
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:51,089
Battalion Captains will be taking
their orders from this office only.

1075
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:53,099
Contingency nine-one.

1076
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,387
We're doing this to one of our own?

1077
01:29:55,646 --> 01:29:57,354
You heard Blakelock, didn't you?

1078
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:58,887
But it don't make sense.

1079
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:02,601
I mean, if this guy's
the mad-dog killer Blakelock says...

1080
01:30:02,862 --> 01:30:05,436
...why would he supply us
with his route?

1081
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:33,039
What do you think they'll do to us?

1082
01:31:33,544 --> 01:31:36,035
Whatever Blakelock tells them to.

1083
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:40,081
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
The Chief or the Mayor or...

1084
01:31:40,343 --> 01:31:42,300
He's the Police Commissioner.

1085
01:31:42,553 --> 01:31:44,593
He'll do whatever he wants to do.

1086
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:48,343
He can put an army on the streets
and nobody'd question it.

1087
01:32:08,415 --> 01:32:10,491
You do want kids, don't you?

1088
01:32:14,087 --> 01:32:18,002
Kids, a house, a car, swimming pool.
You name it.

1089
01:32:21,345 --> 01:32:23,172
Someplace with trees.

1090
01:32:24,223 --> 01:32:28,268
Someplace with neighbors
not too close by.

1091
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:30,929
With hills to walk in.

1092
01:32:31,356 --> 01:32:33,978
Horses and a greenhouse, maybe.

1093
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:38,696
Maybe even a little
guesthouse out back.

1094
01:32:38,948 --> 01:32:40,525
Maybe even a...

1095
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,572
What?

1096
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,571
Nothing.

1097
01:33:06,853 --> 01:33:09,771
You don't even know
if I'm good in bed or not.

1098
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,936
I'll just take that on faith.

1099
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:40,503
What if he gets through?

1100
01:33:40,806 --> 01:33:42,004
He can't get through.

1101
01:33:42,433 --> 01:33:44,260
He's gotten this far, hasn't he?

1102
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:47,140
Sir, how many units have you deployed?

1103
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,933
Four dozen? Five dozen?

1104
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:51,895
And those marksmen
are the finest on the force.

1105
01:33:52,652 --> 01:33:55,144
I know. But what happens if...

1106
01:33:56,156 --> 01:33:58,944
I mean, there's going to be
hell to pay if something...

1107
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:00,660
...goes wrong.

1108
01:34:01,495 --> 01:34:04,413
The only thing that can
go wrong is if your disciples...

1109
01:34:04,665 --> 01:34:08,331
...decide they can't shoot down
one of their own officers.

1110
01:34:08,586 --> 01:34:10,246
Jesus, they're cops.

1111
01:34:10,505 --> 01:34:12,794
The bastards are paid to shoot,
not think.

1112
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,924
Then we have no problem.

1113
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:33,190
This is where our
welcoming committee will be.

1114
01:34:36,033 --> 01:34:38,654
Why can't we just keep going?

1115
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:40,903
Maybe they won't stop us.

1116
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:42,955
We could just keep going and going...

1117
01:34:43,207 --> 01:34:44,832
Nag, nag, nag!

1118
01:35:08,318 --> 01:35:09,432
What's that?

1119
01:35:10,403 --> 01:35:11,684
Roadblock.

1120
01:35:11,905 --> 01:35:14,147
You get ready to hit the deck now.

1121
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,916
They're letting us through.

1122
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:26,535
Don't want innocent people
to get killed.

1123
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,722
Who's that?

1124
01:35:41,478 --> 01:35:43,436
Jesus! That's Josephson.

1125
01:35:54,326 --> 01:35:55,903
What the hell you doing here?

1126
01:35:57,037 --> 01:35:59,030
Jesus Christ!

1127
01:35:59,623 --> 01:36:01,912
You don't have to do this.

1128
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:03,911
We've got a friend at City Hall.

1129
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,578
- Who?
- Feyderspiel.

1130
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:09,206
He's the Assistant D.A.
On the DeLuca case.

1131
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:12,755
I told him about Blakelock.
He promised to help us.

1132
01:36:13,012 --> 01:36:16,179
He promised to defend you
if you could prove your point.

1133
01:36:16,433 --> 01:36:19,968
I don't trust anybody
connected with the DeLuca case.

1134
01:36:20,312 --> 01:36:21,806
Damn it! Don't you hear me?

1135
01:36:22,064 --> 01:36:24,270
The man is the Assistant D.A.

1136
01:36:24,525 --> 01:36:26,767
The man prepared the whole case.

1137
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,653
Maybe he's the one with enough guts
to go up against Blakelock.

1138
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:32,532
And maybe they're in bed together.

1139
01:36:32,784 --> 01:36:35,489
Maybe the whole thing's a smokescreen.

1140
01:36:35,745 --> 01:36:37,323
Listen to me.

1141
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:40,748
I've talked to Feyderspiel.
He's okay, not like we thought.

1142
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:43,290
Besides, guy, you've got no choice.

1143
01:36:43,545 --> 01:36:46,666
Blakelock's got half the
goddamn police force out there.

1144
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:49,208
Just waiting for
this elephant to roll in.

1145
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:50,299
Where?

1146
01:36:50,553 --> 01:36:52,095
Seventh, Central...

1147
01:36:52,347 --> 01:36:53,212
...Mesa...

1148
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:55,631
...Adams.
The whole route you gave me.

1149
01:36:55,892 --> 01:36:58,597
The place is swarming with squad cars.

1150
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:02,852
Hell, even with this pig iron,
it's suicide.

1151
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,559
Please. Transfer to my car.

1152
01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:07,819
Stay in the back.
Just stay down low.

1153
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:11,073
I'll smuggle you into City Hall.
The back door.

1154
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,067
Feyderspiel and I got it doped out.

1155
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:17,413
We'll take the service elevator.
He said keep your gun.

1156
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,665
If you think you're being crossed...

1157
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:23,418
...you can use him for a hostage
to get away again.

1158
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:28,883
For chrissakes! This man's laying
his life on the line for you!

1159
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,090
What do you think?

1160
01:37:38,772 --> 01:37:40,930
I think it's worth a try.

1161
01:37:45,362 --> 01:37:47,604
Maynard Josephson, meet Gus Mally.

1162
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,862
Hi, Gus.

1163
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:50,527
Let's go, partner.

1164
01:38:11,682 --> 01:38:13,640
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the bus!

1165
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,931
Get in the bus!

1166
01:38:21,193 --> 01:38:22,936
Son of a bitch!

1167
01:38:30,036 --> 01:38:31,364
He's dead!

1168
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:49,464
The son of a bitches killed him!

1169
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:51,301
Blakelock and Feyderspiel.

1170
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:54,015
Goddamn, motherfucking...

1171
01:39:03,113 --> 01:39:04,442
Stay down.

1172
01:39:05,157 --> 01:39:06,153
We're going in.

1173
01:40:03,262 --> 01:40:04,804
Keep glued to that floor.

1174
01:40:11,187 --> 01:40:12,017
Commence firing!

1175
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:18,834
Unit 4, this is Unit 5.

1176
01:41:19,094 --> 01:41:20,256
Stand by.

1177
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:23,050
We failed to stop him.
He's headed straight for you.

1178
01:41:28,437 --> 01:41:30,762
Come here.
Drive this sucker.

1179
01:41:31,065 --> 01:41:32,144
Get up.

1180
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:34,268
Drive this sucker.

1181
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:44,156
I don't know how!

1182
01:41:44,371 --> 01:41:46,944
- Do what I tell you!
- Don't yell at me!

1183
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:49,083
Do what I tell you.

1184
01:41:49,293 --> 01:41:50,668
Drive, please!

1185
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:16,895
Jesus Christ!

1186
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:18,858
Oh, my God! Look at this.

1187
01:42:32,173 --> 01:42:33,631
Open fire!

1188
01:43:44,334 --> 01:43:45,828
Just get down!

1189
01:43:46,211 --> 01:43:47,586
Stay down!

1190
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:57,840
Watch out! Here he comes!

1191
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,059
Cease fire!

1192
01:44:05,315 --> 01:44:06,975
Cease fire!

1193
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:50,339
I've got a witness here
for Courtroom "G."

1194
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:52,173
I gave orders!

1195
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:54,673
They were supposed to kill them!

1196
01:45:54,934 --> 01:45:56,392
I gave orders!

1197
01:45:57,019 --> 01:45:57,968
Shoot them!

1198
01:45:58,187 --> 01:45:59,101
Shoot!

1199
01:45:59,355 --> 01:46:00,304
Kill them!

1200
01:46:00,565 --> 01:46:01,395
Shoot them!

1201
01:46:01,691 --> 01:46:03,019
Kill them!

1202
01:46:04,736 --> 01:46:05,981
Tell them.

1203
01:46:06,947 --> 01:46:08,109
It was Blakelock!

1204
01:46:08,323 --> 01:46:09,652
Tell them about Blakelock.

1205
01:46:09,908 --> 01:46:11,735
Blakelock did the cover-up!

1206
01:46:11,952 --> 01:46:14,443
- What cover-up?
- The DeLuca cover-up.

1207
01:46:14,663 --> 01:46:16,537
He set you and the girl up!

1208
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,937
Please speak to me!

1209
01:46:40,566 --> 01:46:42,440
You know I love you.

1210
01:46:44,946 --> 01:46:46,109
Goddamn it!

1211
01:46:46,906 --> 01:46:49,694
Ben Shockley, don't you die on me!

1212
01:46:51,453 --> 01:46:53,197
Open those fucking eyes!

1213
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:58,369
Nag, nag, nag!

1214
01:47:00,713 --> 01:47:02,042
Get me up.
