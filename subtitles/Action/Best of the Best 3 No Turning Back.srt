1
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:26,867
Ready? Okay.

2
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,103
Wishing and hoping

3
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:31,705
And thinking and praying

4
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:33,774
Planning and dreaming

5
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:37,277
Each night of his charms

6
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:42,282
That won't get you
into his arms

7
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:45,319
So if you're looking
to find love

8
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:50,457
That you can share

9
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,059
All you've got to do

10
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,294
Is hold him and kiss him
MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING

11
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:58,731
And love him
and show him that you care

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,872
Show him that you care
just for him

13
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:08,976
Do the things
that he likes to do

14
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:13,913
Wear your hair
just for him

15
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,951
'Cause you won't get him

16
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:21,421
Thinking and praying
Wishing and hoping

17
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:24,158
Just wishing and hoping

18
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:26,660
And thinking and praying

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,166
Planning and dreaming
his kisses will start

20
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:36,102
That won't get you
into his heart

21
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,507
So if you're thinking
of how great

22
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:44,637
True love is

23
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,518
And squeeze him
and love him

24
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:55,189
Just do it
and after you do

25
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,124
You will be his

26
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:25,779
Two and two, menu !
Brian, 22, immediately!

27
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,447
Guillermo!

28
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:29,783
Two pigeons! Right away!

29
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,149
''V. I.P.''
Very important tabIe right here!

30
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,482
Give me two grain!

31
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,898
- I'll take that poIenta!
- AIl right, Chef.

32
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,900
- This is the one I'm waiting for!
- Yes, sir.

33
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,737
I need that speciaI meat now.
Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.

34
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:53,473
I will kill your family it you don't
get this right. I need this perfect.

35
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:54,497
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,495
I'm writing it up as...

37
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,831
inventive and...

38
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,264
confident.

39
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:28,932
- Did the chap from Newsday ever call?
- I'll check my machine.

40
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:33,013
Is this a reaI interview
or some cute guy...

41
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,015
- you're setting me up with?
- Please, Julianne.

42
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,851
I don't send you men anymore.
You have no idea what to do with them.

43
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:42,189
lt's Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

44
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:48,028
l can't wait to talk to you.
l'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

45
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:52,032
Call me. 4:00 in the morning,
whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.

46
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:56,203
- Who called? Man of the moment?
- No, the opposite.

47
00:04:56,203 --> 00:05:00,140
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
Sounds desperate to talk to me.

48
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,677
The wandering sportswriter.
Remind me about that one.

49
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,178
Sophomore year at Brown...

50
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:08,882
we had this one hot month.

51
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:12,886
But you know me.
I got restless.

52
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:16,556
So I get up the nerve
to break his heart...

53
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:18,547
and he gives me this look.

54
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,229
Then he said, ''The thing
that makes me want to cry is...

55
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,565
l'm losing the best friend
I ever had.''

56
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:29,403
At that moment,
I knew I tell the same way.

57
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:33,407
So I cried for maybe
the third time in my entire life...

58
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,075
kissed him...

59
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,839
and we've been best friends
ever since.

60
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,343
We've seen each other
through everything:

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,252
losing jobs...

62
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,754
losing parents, losing lovers.

63
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,690
We've traveled all over.

64
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,427
The best times of my life, maybe.

65
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:57,597
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.

66
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:01,034
Go on. This is so moving.
Kindred spirits?

67
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:04,697
He's nothing Iike me.
He's Iike you actually, only straight.

68
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:09,576
I remember this one night
in Tucson six years ago.

69
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,612
He takes a razor out
ot this littIe shaving kit...

70
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:15,615
cuts his tinger, takes my hand,
does the same to me.

71
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,952
- I'm gonna be sick.
- He says, ''Swear when we're 28...

72
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:21,922
if we've never married,
we marry each other.''

73
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,658
We never talked about it again.

74
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:28,462
I don't know
what made me think of that.

75
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:31,659
You're about to be 28
in three weeks, right?

76
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:37,003
- How old is he?
- You think?

77
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,801
Desperate to talk.

78
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,748
Cheers.

''Red''

81
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:14,508
- Good evening. The Drake Hotel.
- l'm calling for Michael O'Neal...

82
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,602
- but since it's so late--
- One moment, please.

83
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,446
Hello?

84
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:26,853
You've been enrolled
in the Obscene caller of the Month Club.

85
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:29,856
Hey, beautiful.
lt's so great to hear your voice.

86
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:33,193
l miss you. l've been
calling you for over a month.

87
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:35,028
l've been on a book tour.

88
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,198
- I figured you were out of town.
- My machine eats alI my messages.

89
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,534
Or you're just averaging 30 days
to return a call.

90
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:45,372
- lt's less when it's you.
- l have to ask you something important.

91
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,374
lf you turn me down,
l don't know what l'll do.

92
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:51,470
It I could just tell you
one thing first.

93
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,550
This is probably going
to hand you...

94
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,553
the biggest laugh
ot your adult life...

95
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,389
but I was thinking about you,
and l was remembering...

96
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,394
this unbelievably insane night
we spent in Tucson...

97
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,230
like a thousand years ago.

98
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,566
- You probably won't remember this--
- Are you kidding?

99
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,569
l think about that night
all the time.

100
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,571
You do?

101
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,907
But it's not why l called.

102
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,409
It's not.

103
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:25,503
l called because l met someone.

104
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,583
That's great.

105
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:34,754
You haven't really seen anybody
since that dingbat Jenny Lee, have you?

106
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,423
You don't understand.

107
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:39,426
I've never felt this way
about anybody.

108
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:43,263
- She's all wrong for me.
- That's a good start.

109
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,432
She's a junior
at the University of Chicago.

110
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:48,602
She's 20. Her name's Kim.
You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.

111
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:52,439
Her dad is this billionaire. He owns
the White Sox and some cable empire.

112
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:55,108
l've always been uncomfortable
around rich people.

113
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:58,778
- Sure.
- But they're not like that.

114
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:03,283
They're such wonderful people.
Salt of the earth.

115
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,547
So you've met her parents?

116
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,787
Jules, we're getting married
this Sunday.

117
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,226
- Hello?
- Michael--

118
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,466
It's Wednesday night.

119
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,635
How can you possibly
be getting married on Sunday?

120
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,303
Actually, it starts tomorrow.

121
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:26,306
lt's a four-day wedding
with all the traditional events...

122
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:30,810
and 10 milllon people
flying in from all over the world.

123
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,981
Aren't you working this weekend?
Is that responsible?

124
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:40,487
The Sox are at home and Sports is
letting me do a profile on Frank Thomas.

125
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,656
Wait.
What do you mean, irresponsible?

126
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,250
Taking off a weekend
to get married?

127
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,253
Jules, I'm scared.

128
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:55,001
- Maybe we shouId talk about this.
- l need you.

129
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,338
lf you can't come and hold my hand,
l'll never get through this.

130
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,272
Please come.

131
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:05,879
l can 't wait for you
to meet her.

132

Listen, Jules.

133
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,851
Let's stop for a drink.
You can take a later tIight.

134
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:15,689
I'm a busy girl. I've got four days
to break up a wedding...

135
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,793
steal the bride's teIlow,
and I haven't one clue how to do it.

136
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,529
He adored me
for nine goddamn years.

137
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,232
- I can see why.
- She has known him for five seconds.

138
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:29,703
Plus, she's got billions of dollars,
and she's apparently perfect.

139
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:34,140
So don't go feeling all sorry
for Miss Preteen Illinois.

140
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:39,979
l can't lose him, George.
I'm going to bring him back.

141
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,216
You give your hand to me

142
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,052
You give your hand to me

143
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:48,520
And then you say hello

144
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,892
l can hardly speak

145
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:56,396
My heart is beating so

146
00:10:56,396 --> 00:11:00,066
And anyone can tell

147
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:03,236
You think you know me well

148
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,603
But you don't know me

149
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,580
No, you don't know the one

150
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,250
Who dreams of you at night

151
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,587
Wants to kiss your lips

152
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:23,590
Wants to hold you tight

153
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,926
l am just a friend

154
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:30,597
That's all l've ever been

155
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:34,363
- Can you believe l'm gonna do this?
- Not hardly.

156
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,719
This just makes everything
so perfect.

157
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:57,247
Since I've met Michael, all I've heard
is ''Julianne this'' and ''Julianne that.''

158
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,092
I've never had a sister.

159
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,570
I have this monstrous tavor
to ask you.

160
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,305
- Excuse me?
- My best friend...

161
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:17,811
shattered her pelvis line dancing
in Abilene over spring break.

162
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:20,279
- Be my maid of honor?
- What?

163
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:26,619
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone you've known longer?

164
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:30,156
My bridesmaids are my only two
temale relatives under the age of 40...

165
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:34,160
debutante sisters from NashvilIe
who are basically vengetul sluts.

166
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,457
My exit!

167
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:40,934
I have tour days
to make you my new best friend.

168
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,994
It's time for you
to force yourseIf to get personal.

169
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,687
- Do you like the color?
- I think it's beautiful.

170
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,689
- Isn't that perfect for her?
- absolutely.

171
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,692
This is going to be tighter.
You don't want those things to fall out.

172
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:08,895
- It's beautiful.
- I'm not hurting you.

173
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:13,800
I don't want her to trip,
so I'll take this up a tiny bit.

174
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,166
Would you rather the datfodil?

175
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:22,041
I thought the bridesmaids
all wore the same dress.

176
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:26,068
Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable
unless you were distinctive.

177
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:31,017
What else did he tell you?

178
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:34,053
You hate weddings.
You never go.

179
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,556
You're not up
for anything conventional...

180
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:40,492
or anything that's assumed
to be a female prlority...

181
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:46,065
including marriage
or romance or even--

182
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,657
Love?

183
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,405
Michael and I were a wrong tip
right from the start.

184
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:55,074
He said that too.

185
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:59,412
I thought I was like you,
and proud to be...

186
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,615
until I met rumpled,
smelly, old Michael.

187
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,084
Then I tound I was just
a sentimental schmuck...

188
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:08,755
like all those flighty nitwits
I'd always pitied.

189
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,746
It's funny, huh?

190
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:14,685
l need a cigarette.

191
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,438
George, how do you think I feel?

192
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:28,107
all she does is talk
about her and Michael's future.

193
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:33,079
- She's just so dreamy.
- Jules, pull yourself together.

194
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,309
I don't know if l can do it.

195
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,786
You want me to turn around
or something?

196
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:43,552
Not the person I was expecting.

197
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:49,220
I've seen you
a lot more naked than that.

198
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:55,901
Things are different now.

199
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,573
I guess so.

200
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:09,649
You look really good...

201
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,947
without your clothes on.

202
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,262
She's toast.

203
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:28,425
''Caution 2-Way Tratfic''
''Exit''

204
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:35,842
- Where is the honeymoon exactly?
- It depends.

205
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,345
It San Antonlo sweeps Sacramento,
we could start there.
''Chicago HiIton And Towers''

206
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,848
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the Indiana-CIeveIand game--

207
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,516
Garden spots, alI.

208
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:46,686
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit
represents a packing challenge...

209
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:50,523
but there's tine tood and cocktalls
at a choice of Embassy Suites.

210
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:54,660
lt's his career. I'm supportive.
I've been everywhere.

211
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,798
I want to be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

212
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:04,771
He's lucky. One woman in a billion
could put up with his shit.

213
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:08,007
The guy's a one-man festival
of idlosyncratic--

214
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,676
You've been introduced
to the symphonic range--

215
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:13,880
Of his snoring?
He says it's worse than ever.

216
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,178
You know that snartle one?

217
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,981
Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing
happening behind it.

218
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,065
Earplugs work.

219
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:35,268
- What about--
- Cigars in bed? l broke him of that.

220
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:38,204
The bathroom's a swamp.
He wears Reeboks to dinner.

221
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:42,008
He likes action movies.
He reads over my Shoulder.

222
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:43,943
He loves karaoke bars...

223
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,245
- and I can't carry a tune.
- Really?

224
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,748
He sucks soup
through his front teeth.

225
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:52,081
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.

226
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,354
But he sure can kiss.

227
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:02,186
It's been a whiIe.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.

228
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:12,105
After two weeks
of cataloging all his taults...

229
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,040
I made a command decislon
that changed my life.

230
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,647
I threw the list away.

231
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,983
He's not a baIance sheet.
He's Michael.

232
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,085
Loving him means
loving all of him.

233
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,887
Do you get nervous
in contined spaces?

234
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,956
It's sweet of you
to want to be protective...

235
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:33,759
but nothing ever could give me
one moment's pause about this marriage.

236
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,991
- Do you become hystericaI in confined--
- Except one.

237
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,434
You. You're always
in his mind....

238
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,769
this perfect creature
he loved for years.

239
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,806
perfection can get wearing
atter awhiIe.

240
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,642
I'm not kidding. I had to tace up
to my competitive drives.

241
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,978
believe me, I've got them.

242
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:55,314
Am I gonna be jealous of you
for the rest of my life?

243
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,450
- Our paths will keep crossing.
- Space. of course.

244
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,985
- He'll always talk about you.
- It's only natural.

245
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:02,155
The answer was so simple.

246
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:05,158
I was gonna predict that.

247
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,591
You win.

248
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,861
I've missed a step.

249
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:15,001
He's got you on a pedestal...

250
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,969
and me in his arms.

251
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:28,881
My God, it's the bride
and the woman she'll never live up to.

252
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:31,684
- Are you okay, honey?
- That would be us.

253
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:34,353
Did she say the wrong thing again?
That is so in character.

254
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,522
- I'm Julianne Potter.
- We'd be the vengetul sluts.

255
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:40,693
- You can just call us eager.
- Have you sized up the groomsmen?

256
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:44,697
- As maid of honor, you get first pick.
- Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.

257
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:47,200
- He's mine.
- Kimmy's a virgin.

258
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,635
Is this Michael's Julianne?

259
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,205
I'm IsabeIIe Wallace.

260
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:55,003
My handsome new son
scarcely did you justice.

261
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:59,712
My husband says
to scoot you to the baIlpark...

262
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,814
so you can hang with Michael.

263
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:04,884
But tirst you have to meet
a lot of really old women.

264
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:08,149
That is, it you've absorbed
enough profanity.

265
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,703
Who ordered a beer?

266
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:28,541
- Let me heIp you with that.
- You unwittingly imply I'm cIumsy.

267
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,244
Sorry. l was confusing you
with somebody l used to know.

268
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,380
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric
from Sport magazine.

269
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,382
- Nice to meet you.
- They kindly gave me a job.

270
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:39,018
- Hi, there.
- How do you do?

271
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:42,288
And this is Walter,
my father-in-Iaw.

272
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:44,757
Future father-in-Iaw.
''Comiskey''

273
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,259
Thank you.

274
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,887
lf he gives you any grlet,
come see me.

275
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:54,267
- And this guy you know.
- Papa Joe.

276
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:59,772
I told him to make you best man,
but he had to go with his baby brother.

277
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:02,441
Best-looking guy
in any room.

278
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,378
- Great to see you.
- That will do.

279
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,614
- Scotty, that will do.
- Sorry.

280
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:11,284
Remember, it is the duty
of the best man...

281
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,587
to dance
with the maid of honor.

282
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:17,123
Dance? You can't dance.

283
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:22,060
- When did you Iearn to dance?
- l've got moves you've never seen.

284
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,327
You're an imposfor.

285
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,302
What did you do
with my best friend?

286
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:32,805
''Chicago Tribune"
I'm stiIl your best friend.

287
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:35,467
You just haven't seen me
for awhiIe.

288
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:44,417
Some people might find
that kind of perfection boring...

289
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,653
- day after day, year atter year.
- That's what I thought at tirst.

290
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,822
How can you like someone
that perfect?

291
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:53,492
No potentiaI
for long-range IikabiIity.

292
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:57,330
But then, she does have
a few good traits.

293
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,831
- AlI right.
- Such as?

294
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,133
They got him.

295
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,669
When I hug her,
even in pubIic...

296
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,505
I don't have to let go
right away.

297
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:09,008
She lets me hold her
as long as l want.

298
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:13,012
- Batting second, the shortstop--
- What?

299
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:16,182
- Nothing.
- I forgot.

300
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,884
You and that yucky love stuft.

301
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,020
You always get like that
when it gets sentimentaI.

302
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,215
I do not.

303
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,827
When we were--
When you and l were--

304
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,954
- When we were--
- Together?

305
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,135
Did I, when--

306
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:40,172
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

307
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:43,232
You puIIed away when I tried
to hug you in pubIic.

308
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,283
I've changed.

309
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,808
I mean, I'm not the girl
that l once was.

310
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:56,756
Really?

311
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,691
Any reIationship over two weeks
I should know about?

312
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:03,026
This is not about longevity.

313
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,932
This is about...

314
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,335
being comfortabIe...

315
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:11,326
with the yucky love stuft.

316
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,275
all right.

317
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:18,766
And l am.

318
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:25,251
And it's wisdom born of pain

319
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,753
Yes, I've paid the price

320
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,689
But look how much I've gained

321
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:32,925
- If l have to
- Karaoke!

322
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:34,760
- I can do anything
- Where did you find this place?

323
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,263
The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.

324
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:41,767
l am strong
l am invincible

325
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:45,362
l am woman

326
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:53,378
I didn't realize
this was a karaoke bar.

327
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,749
This is so great.
My two best girls.

328
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,952
- You toIks thirsty?
- Margarita.

329
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:01,787
- Blended, no salt.
- She wants it straight up.

330
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:03,456
- You?
- Amstel Light.

331
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:05,458
Two words for you.

332
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,560
Margarita.

333
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,221
Vespa.

334
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,229
Florence.

335
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,968
Me hanging on in the rain.

336
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,937
- I love Florence.
- And the guy with the thing.

337
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:22,675
Where was my pass?

338
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:25,644
- ''No, the pier is for tishing!''
- ''French kissing?''

339
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:29,080
- ''Fishing!''
- I've always loved Florence.

340
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,086
You Should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

341
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,260
''lt San Antonlo
sweeps Sacramento''?

342
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,162
You're off the road in September, and
when does taIl quarter start for you?

343
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:53,298
I'm not coming back senlor year.

344
00:23:55,841 --> 00:24:01,380
Don't architects find a degree
sort of an asset?

345
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,684
I travel every week. Got coIlege baIl,
mofor sports, training camps.

346
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,687
l think the most important thing
is for us to be together.

347
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:13,559
Say, Pinky, l wanna hear you sing.
Come on.

348
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,823
Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

349
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:21,901
all right, tolks.
Everybody...

350
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:26,472
my bride-to-be here
is about to kick some ass on--

351
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:28,741
What?
It will be tun.

352
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,410
No, she doesn't want to, Michael.
Leave her alone.

353
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,380
Come on.
Ladies and gentIemen...

354
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,417
Please give it up for the dazzIing
vocal styIings...

355
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,749

356
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,817
Come on.

357
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:06,245
l just don 't know what to do
with myself

358
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:10,716
Don't know just what to do
with myself

359
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:14,887
l'm so used to doing

360
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,256
Everything for you

361
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:22,928
- You suck!
- Planning everything for two

362
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:26,932
And now that we're through

363
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:28,734
l just don't know

364
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:33,539
What to do with my time

365
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,108
l'm so lonesome for you

366
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:38,243
It's a crime

367
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:41,906
Going to a movie

368
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:14,647
lf your new love

369
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:17,316
Ever turns you down

370
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:19,451
Come back

371
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:24,650
I will be around
just waiting for you

372
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:30,588
l just don 't know what to do

373
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,924
Like a summer rose

374
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:40,271
It needs the sun and the rain

375
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:47,846
l need your sweet love

376
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:53,148
l need your sweet love to ease

377
00:26:55,854 --> 00:27:01,622
All the pain

378
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:10,357
That was just terribIe!

379
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:22,881
''Steakhouse'' ''Park'' ''Taxi''
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

380
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:25,884
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- Your grandmother's dinner?

381
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:29,555
As bride-to-be,
she's got you on a technicallty.

382
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:34,893
I'd baby-sit you, but my loyaIty
is to the bride in her time of need.

383
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:39,398
- It's not really a time of need.
- If you're sure.

384
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:43,562
- ''Sure''?
- I'll stay with Michael it you're sure.

385
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,836
- Call me later?
- of course.

386
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,506
- Bye.
- Have tun.

387
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:11,597
Were you pretty shocked
when I told you?

388
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,531
Shocked? No.

389
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:18,270
A little.

390
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,706
A lot.
I tell oft the bed.

391
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:25,811
That expIains the thump.

392
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:28,041
You like her, don't you?

393
00:28:29,948 --> 00:28:33,452
- I do.
- That's enthusiastic.

394
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:36,888
I mean, she's--
She's great.

395
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:44,129
She serlously
can't sing a note.

396
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:49,101
But to make that kind
of sacritice--

397
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:54,173
- What? Leaving schooI?
- all of it.

398
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:57,810
Putting her career on hold
to toIlow you around in this dumb job...

399
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,646
where you travel 52 weeks a year...

400
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:04,149
to places
like CoIIege Station, Texas.

401
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:08,287
- ''Dumb job''?
- It's not a grown-up job.

402
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:10,856
My job never bothered you before.

403
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:14,927
It doesn't bother me now,
but I'm not Kimmy.

404
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:20,490
Her tather owns the Sox
and cabIe sports.

405
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:26,171
I'm just surprised
it hasn't come up, that's all.

406
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,763
What?

407
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:31,643
The corner oftice with a view.

408
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:34,513
You in a nice blue suit.

409
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:38,851
Permanent Chicago address,
somewhat close to Mom and Dad.

410
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:40,519
Never.

411
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,181
She would never even think of that.

412
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:46,390
You don't know her.

413
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:57,202
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

414
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:00,372
Bad games, bad pay,
bad towns, bad flights...

415
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:02,875
bad hoteIs, reaI bad food...

416
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,043
homeIess, rootIess, lonely...

417
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,379
your copy makes it
in one issue out of tour.

418
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,381
What's not to love?

419
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:13,218
Why would he trade that for running,
say, a piece of the public reIations...

420
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:17,055
at a powerful compIex conglomerate
like your father's?

421
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:21,355
- That's what my father and I discussed.
- l'm not surprised.

422
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,231
So do you think
he'd really accept?

423
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,900
Michael?
A job like that?

424
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,570
It would be the greatest thing
that ever happened to him.

425
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,072
Present company excepted.

426
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:38,944
This is what we do:
We make your dad a coconspirafor.

427
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:40,946
Michael does a favor for Walter.

428
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:43,582
Walter's reorganizing
his public relations...

429
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:46,084
and needs a brilliant guy
that he's close to...

430
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:48,587
that he can completely trust.

431
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,590
Then you beg.
'Michael, please do this for Daddy.

432
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,082
It's only six months.
lt would mean so much to me. "

433
00:30:57,162 --> 00:31:01,861
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

434
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:04,269
At the end of six months...

435
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,072
he will be happy...

436
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:08,874
settIed...

437
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,603
successtul.

438
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,723
Wow.

439
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:30,462
You look beautiful.
Do you have a date later?

440
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:31,895
Never can tell.

441
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:36,826
Just the way you look tonight
Remember?

442
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,769
Okay, kid, you're up.

443
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,744
It's really my father
who needs the favor.

444
00:31:57,322 --> 00:32:01,827
He's reorganizing some
ot the divislons of the company.

445
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:05,194
PubIic relations
is a reaI probIem area for him.

446
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:11,295
lt would only be
six months maybe.

447
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:17,342
- Or three or four.
- You knew about this?

448
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:21,335
I think you ought to Iisten to her.
lt's her life too.

449
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:27,052
You gonna tell me
that Walter thought this one up?

450
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:31,189
Why don't you start
by being honest one second.

451
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,525
I am being honest.

452
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:37,029
all of a sudden I'm supposed
to drop out of schooI...

453
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,131
forget my tamily,
forget my career...

454
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:43,702
- forget the things I had planned?
- Forgive me for screwing up your plans.

455
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:46,538
GIad I heard this
before it's too Iate.

456
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:49,808
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What am I supposed to do with my life?

457
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:53,045
I work in a low-paying,
zero-respect job...

458
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:56,173
which, unfortunately,
I happen to love.

459
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:04,222
- It sounds like a great opportunity.
- Does it really?

460
00:33:04,222 --> 00:33:07,726
How come you never took
some seIlout estabIishment job?

461
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:10,228
I'll teIl you why,
because that isn't you.

462
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:12,898
- And it's not me either.
- lf that's the way you feel--

463
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:16,701
Damn straight that's how I feel !
Just come out and say it.

464
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:20,205
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.

465
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:24,505
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

466
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,047
Great, Kim.

467
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:33,074
Two days before our wedding, you Iay
this on me. I'm supposed to roII over?

468
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:39,591
Fine. I'm an insensitive.
sexist asshoIe.

469
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,422
You're better oft without me.

470
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:48,066
You are so right.
l was so wrong.

471
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:51,470
We settIed this, and I reneged.
That just wasn't tair.

472
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,108
You have to forgive me and forget
this happened or I'll just die.

473
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:57,541
Please.

474
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:04,479
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:32,310
George and Werner are not in.

476
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,646
Brevity is the order of the day.

477
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:36,948
George, answer this, damn itl

478
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,485
l'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!

479
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:44,823
The little twerp groveledl
She's so wrong for him.

480
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:49,661
Michael and I are the same person:
self-absorbed and vaguely loveable.

481
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:52,164
We deserve each other.
l'm running out of time.

482
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:55,967
l'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
l have come to the end...

483
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,836
of my rapidly fraying rope!

484
00:34:57,836 --> 00:35:00,430
Yo u have got to think of something!

485
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:08,438
- Cottee, anyone?
- That would be wonderful.

486
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:14,178
''The Drake''

487
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:48,887
This is very Marcel Marceau.

488
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:53,558
Now, relax. We don't want your face
coming off with it, do we?

489
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:55,458
What a hideous room.

490
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:59,827
Death by a mini-bar.
How glamorous.

491
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:06,571
You flew all the way here.
You hate to tly.

492
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:10,709
I have to go back this evening.
We have a tamily thing in the Hamptons.

493
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,643
You're butting in.

494
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:17,382
What I mean when I say
she's annoyingly perfect...

495
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:20,252
is that there is nothing annoying
about her perfection.

496
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:25,223
It is vuinerable and endearing.
And that is annoying as shit.

497
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:27,225
You like her.

498
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,352
lt l didn't have to hate her,
I'd adore her.

499
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,331
This is my whoIe life's happiness.

500
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:35,265
I have to be ruthIess.

501
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:39,104
He was in love with me
every day for nine years.

502
00:36:39,104 --> 00:36:41,106
I can make him happier
than she can.

503
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:43,275
I am breaking her heart
in the short run...

504
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,944
but really doing her
a gigantic favor.

505
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:50,711
She would be so miserabIe tagging along
after this insensitive doofus.

506
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,294
Do you really love him...

507
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:04,462
or is this just about winning?

508
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:05,895
Serlously.

509
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:13,805
In the beginning,
it was mostly this prlor claim.

510
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,898
He belonged to me.

511
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,314
But now, when I'm with him...

512
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:26,151
he's just so wonderful.

513
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:30,655
How come I never knew that
when I could have had him?

514
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:34,250
It's amazing the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

515
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:39,331
George, believe me...

516
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:42,167
if he was feeling
what I'm feeIing...

517
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,836
then he would know how I feel.

518
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:47,339
It's horrible.

519
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,931
What?

520
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:52,942
Just tell him you love him.

521
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:59,851
tell him you've loved him
for nine years...

522
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:02,445
but you were afraid of love.

523
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:07,192
TeIl him you were afraid of love,
afraid of needing.

524
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:10,028
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

525
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:12,197
We alI are, sweetheart.

526
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:14,866
l'm sorry about that.

527
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:20,438
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this to him...

528
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:22,374
but there it is.

529
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:24,467
He's got to choose.

530
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,880
tell him the actuaI truth?

531
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,817
Maybe not the actual truth.

532
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:36,446
Highlights.

533
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,029
Arms at your sides, Please.

534
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:59,744
- Good morning.
- I have to talk to you.

535
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:03,415
- You don't like the suit?
- That's not what I have to talk about.

536
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,679
One thing tirst.
Excuse me.

537
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:15,760
- Guard this with your life.
- What is it?

538
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,263
- The ring.
- Why are you giving it to me?

539
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:21,266
- l don't trust Scotty with it.
- I don't think--

540
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,101
Please.

541
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,603
You're practically
the best man anyway.

542
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:28,697
- Thank you.
- Open it.

543
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,742
will she like it?

544
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:41,553
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

545
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,111
You wanted to talk
about something?

546
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,596
We've known each other
a long time, right? Twenty years?

547
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,799
Not that long, but a long time.

548
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:56,801
And in that time...

549
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:01,329
we've grown close.

550
00:40:02,474 --> 00:40:05,143
Very close.
Do you know what I mean?

551
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:07,771
- I think so.
- Good. So do I.

552
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,074
So sometimes--

553
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:15,118
could you excuse us?

554
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:22,026
Sometimes...

555
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,662
peopIe think...

556
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:27,332
they know how they feeI
about each other...

557
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:28,765
but they don't...

558
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:31,802
until...

559
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,828
until they do.

560
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:38,107
I have a point.

561
00:40:39,344 --> 00:40:41,946
- Am l getting to it?
- Why don't you?

562
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:45,177
Whatever it is you have to say
can't be that big a deaI.

563
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,684
''A big deaI'' is a relative term.

564
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,406
Who's that guy?

565
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:15,246
It's George. I've told you
about George. He's my editor.

566
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:17,510
What's he doing here?
You working this weekend?

567
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,814
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

568
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:31,396
Because he's my friend.
He's my good friend.

569
00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:32,988
My best friend these days.

570
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:38,729
You've been busy.

571
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:44,872
So all of this
has been about George?

572
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,932
I'm speechIess.

573
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:09,934
That's JuIes.

574
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:11,436
- Congratulationss.
- Congratulationss.

575
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:13,471
What?

576
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:17,271
I told him, puppy. If we're engaged,
we Shouldn't be ashamed of it.

577
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,281
He's racing back to New York.
He just came in for a few hours...

578
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:25,545
to fuck me.

579
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:32,923
Takes a few hours.

580
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,226
God.

581
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:42,300
Give me your ring.
Give it to me!

582
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,970
When you ask a girl to marry you,
you have to give an engagement ring.

583
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,140
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to heIp you.

584
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,735
- You're insane!
- For one day find me irresistible.

585
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,652
Stop it.

586
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:08,788
ls something wrong?

587
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:14,766
I guess it's just the way
you've always talked about George.

588
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:18,302
It always seemed...

589
00:43:18,302 --> 00:43:21,005
seemed like--

590
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:24,942
- It sounded like George was--
- Gay?

591
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:26,432
Actually, yes.

592
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,807
Common misconception.

593
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,886
It is.

594
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:40,381
George likes to pretend
that he's gay.

595
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:47,888
And why would you do that?

596
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,536
I find it attracts women.

597
00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:54,138
Indeed.
Worked for me.

598
00:43:54,138 --> 00:43:55,628
Big time.

599
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:01,872
Right.

600
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:09,819
Oh, my God.
Race you to the altar.

601
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:13,124
- UnderpIay.
- Got it.

602
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:15,226
I'm JuIes' fiance, George.

603
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:19,564
Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal
visit, it you catch my drift.

604
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:20,997
I do.

605
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:24,736
- You're going to humiliate me.
- Only if I can.

606
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:27,371
Just one thing.
Stay away from--

607
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:29,999
George! Oh, my God!

608
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:36,748
- I don't know why I'm so carried away.
- Me neither.

609
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,181
It's so--

610
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,919
Against God's plan?

611
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,889
No! It's just wonderful !

612
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,187
It's so wondertul!

613
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:52,695
Mom!

614
00:44:56,601 --> 00:45:00,104
- What?
- You have to meet George.

615
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,607
You must be
Kimmy's little sister.

616
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:06,210
Julianne's fiance.
They're going to be married.

617
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,446
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

618
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:10,982
- Why didn't you telI us?
- There hasn't been time.

619
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:14,452
I wanted to. I wanted
to shout it from the rooftops...

620
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:18,122
but Jules said,
''No, Pumpkin, no.

621
00:45:18,122 --> 00:45:19,624
This is Kimmy's day.

622
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:22,058
Let's not take the attention
away from Kimmy.

623
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:25,129
Dear, sweet...

624
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:27,757
adorable,
chocolate-covered Kimmy.''

625
00:45:28,633 --> 00:45:31,402
Those were her very words.

626
00:45:31,402 --> 00:45:33,404
I think I'm gonna cry.

627
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:35,306
Me too.

628
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:38,142
This is so sweet of you
to come to our rehearsal.

629
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:40,278
I insist you stay for lunch.

630
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:42,246
- No, absolutely--
- Love to.

631
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:45,917
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything. Love to.

632
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:49,910
- Darling, what about your flight?
- Canceled.

633
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,997
I can tell you this now,
but I was very worried about you.

634
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:01,666
About me?

635
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:04,602
All those sfories that Michael told me
were hilarlous...

636
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:08,639
but all those broken reIationships,
all those men.

637
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,976
lt must have hurt going through so many
guys and never finding the right one.

638
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:15,707
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy littIe me.

639
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:20,214
And the man of your dreams
was always there.

640
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,349
She's talking about me.

641
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,859
Yes, Darling?

642
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:32,196
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

643
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:34,532
But, Poopy,
we met a long time before that.

644
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:38,302
Actually,
it's a very romantic story.

645
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:41,372
would you like to telI it,
Sweet Pea?

646
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:43,966
- It's private.
- Not anymore.

647
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:48,713
I first met Julianne...

648
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:50,977
in a mental institution.

649
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:54,719
Julianne was there visiting
some French chef...

650
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,888
she'd sent insane
with a bad review...

651
00:46:56,888 --> 00:46:59,356
and I was there
visiting Dionne Warwick.

652
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:03,261
He thought he was Dionne Warwick.

653
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:07,431
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Sacrilege, darling.

654
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:09,100
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

655
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,402
She's very good
on the Psychic Friends Network.

656
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:16,271
- Isn't she?
- Do you know the way to San Jose

657
00:47:22,413 --> 00:47:25,583
There I was with Dionne.
His real name, by the way, is Jerry.

658
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:29,086
We were having a sing-along,
then suddenly...

659
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:32,924
breezing through the doors
from the shock therapy room...

660
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,592
I saw her.

661
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:37,220
A vislon in pink.

662
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,099
- You don't wear pink.
- She does.

663
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,602
Sometimes she does wear pink.

664
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:47,371
- You do.
- l do.

665
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:49,640
l said to Dionne...

666
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,077
''Dionne, who is this vislon?

667
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:56,948
Surely, she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

668
00:47:56,948 --> 00:47:59,450
Look at her skin.
Who does her hair?''

669
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,353
- In that moment, I knew.
- We don't all need to know--

670
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:03,786
We do!

671
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:11,128
- I'm very curious.
- They do.

672
00:48:11,128 --> 00:48:13,631
I knew...

673
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:16,300
that someday
we'd end up like this:

674
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,136
like some glittering...

675
00:48:19,136 --> 00:48:22,936
Doris Day-Rock Hudson
extravaganza.

676
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,077
l said to Dionne...

677
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:29,480
''Dionne, I'm in love.

678
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,316
Could this siren love me?

679
00:48:32,316 --> 00:48:35,152
Are the gods that kind?''

680
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:40,590
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...

681
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:48,756
What did she say?

682
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:53,329
The moment l wake up

683
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,377
Before l put on my makeup

684
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:02,642
I say a little prayer for you

685
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:07,183
While combing my hair now

686
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:11,789
While wondering
what dress to wear now

687
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:15,359
I say a little prayer for you

688
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,963
Forever and ever
you'll stay in my heart

689
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:20,631
And l will love you

690
00:49:20,631 --> 00:49:23,534
Forever and ever
We never will part

691
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:25,036
Oh, how l love you

692
00:49:25,036 --> 00:49:28,039
Together forever
That's how it must be

693
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:31,075
To live without you
would only mean

694
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:33,811
Heartbreak for me

695
00:49:33,811 --> 00:49:35,972
Go, Granddaddy!

696
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,373
l run for the bus, dear

697
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:44,852
While riding
l think of us, dear

698
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,221
At work l just take time

699
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:55,492
And all through
my coffee break time

700
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,521
My darling, believe me

701
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:27,459
For me there is no one but you

702
00:50:28,566 --> 00:50:32,069
- Please love me too
- Answer his prayer

703
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:35,106
- And I'm in love with you
- Answer his prayer now

704
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,199
Answer my prayer, baby

705
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:41,036
Say you love me too

706
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:07,436
all right, now!

707
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:12,143
- Heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

708
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:17,513
Get on your plane. I'll call at the turn
of the century when I've forgiven you.

709
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:23,320
- It never would have worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

710
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,810
Difterent temperaments.

711
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:30,692
Look, tell him you love him.

712
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:33,930
Bite the bullet.

713
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:47,011
What will he do?

714
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,945
''Be Careful
Watch Your Step''

715
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:58,856
He'll choose Kim.

716
00:51:58,856 --> 00:52:01,792
You'll stand beside her
at the wedding...

717
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:04,955
kiss him good-bye
and go home.

718
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,290
That's what you came here to do.

719
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,468
So do it.

720
00:52:28,786 --> 00:52:32,056
George isn't my fiance, Michael.

721
00:52:32,056 --> 00:52:33,857
It's been over for ages...

722
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:36,060
but he can't accept it.

723
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,896
I'd buiIt you up so much...

724
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:42,166
l couldn't let him lose face
in tront of you.

725
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:47,661
He could never stack up to the one man
I measure everyone against.

726
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:55,845
This is strange.

727
00:52:57,414 --> 00:52:59,917
I gotta tell you, when you--

728
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:03,011
When you told me that you were
marrying George...

729
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:08,616
I got this really strange--

730
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:13,529
You were jealous?

731
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:21,197
Crazy jealous.

732
00:53:23,307 --> 00:53:24,740
I'm sorry.

733
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:34,579
Can we maybe spend some time alone
this afternoon?

734
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:40,579
would that be aIl right?

735
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:12,790
I've been thinking a lot
the Iast coupIe of days, about us.

736
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,587
Have you?

737
00:54:18,529 --> 00:54:21,760
- There are a lot of memories.
- It's more than that.

738
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:28,260
It's kind of embarrassing
to say it this way, but...

739
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:32,910
you've sort of been,
you know...

740
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,572
the woman in my life.

741
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:40,551
You've been the man in mine.

742
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:43,620
And I was thinking
this could be our last time...

743
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,612
alone together, you know?

744
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:51,762
Except for that hot aftair
we'll have twice a year.

745
00:54:51,762 --> 00:54:53,696
Except for that.

746
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:06,176
I mean, you commit
to this wedding...

747
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:10,881
and then it seems
like there's this momentum...

748
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:13,441
and then you forget
you chose it.

749
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:21,425
You and I didn't--

750
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:25,896
In our reIationships
with other peopIe...

751
00:55:25,896 --> 00:55:30,333
we didn't use
the word love a lot, did we?

752
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,540
Kimmy says
it you love someone...

753
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,109
you say it.

754
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:41,270
You say it right then,
out loud.

755
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:46,683
Otherwise,
the moment just--

756
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:48,617
Passes you by.

757
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:13,109
We don't even have a song.

758
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:18,438
Kimmy and I don't have a song.

759
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:21,885
Do you think that's a bad sign?

760
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,724
Someday

761
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:30,727
When l'm awfully low

762
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:33,096
And the world is cold

763
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:37,658
l will feel a glow
just thinking of you

764
00:56:39,536 --> 00:56:44,667
And the way you look tonight

765
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,811
Is your dance card tilled?

766
00:56:47,811 --> 00:56:51,181
I'd have to check.
I keep it on Powerbook these days.

767
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,115
Is that right?

768
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:58,255
With each word

769
00:56:58,255 --> 00:57:01,247
Your tenderness grows

770
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:06,652
Tearing my fears apart

771
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:13,704
With each laugh
that wrinkles your nose

772
00:57:13,704 --> 00:57:17,538
To uches my foolish heart

773
00:57:56,346 --> 00:57:57,779
Excuse me.

774
00:58:01,218 --> 00:58:04,555
- I thought Michael was picking me up.
- I said l'd drop you at the stag.

775
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:07,724
He's got a lot to do.
l'm the unotficiaI best man.

776
00:58:07,724 --> 00:58:10,294
Ot course.

777
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:15,299
Kim said when Michael turned the job
down that there was no friction.

778
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:17,434
Friction? No.

779
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:19,269
Good.

780
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:22,072
I haven't caused a probIem,
have I?

781
00:58:22,072 --> 00:58:24,404
You haven't. Nobody has.

782
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:28,879
Listen,
you're just a little bit early.

783
00:58:28,879 --> 00:58:30,881
Actually, I needed
to make some phone calls.

784
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:33,650
- Is it possible to use your oftice?
- of course.

785
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,175
- At the end of the hall on the lett.
- Thank you.

786
00:58:37,654 --> 00:58:39,952
Take your time.

787
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:49,698
E-mall.

788
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:54,234
''File'' ''New Letter'' ''Open'' ''Close''
New letter.

789
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:05,382
To: Eric Isaacson...

790
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:11,321
''Mall Out''
Senlor editor, Sport Magazine.

791
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:15,087
From: Walter Wallace.

792
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,964
You can do this. It's easy.
Just do it fast, get it over with.

793
00:59:20,964 --> 00:59:22,898
It's like it never happened.

794
00:59:24,301 --> 00:59:28,105
Eric, I need a tavor.

795
00:59:28,105 --> 00:59:32,409
My daughter's
every happiness...

796
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:34,244
is in your hands.

797
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:38,215
I have offered Mike O'Neal...

798
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:40,917
my new son-in-Iaw...

799
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,720
a great opportunity...

800
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,922
in my company.

801
00:59:45,922 --> 00:59:49,426
To his own detriment...

802
00:59:49,426 --> 00:59:51,428
Michael will not...

803
00:59:51,428 --> 00:59:55,432
accept our ofter...

804
00:59:55,432 --> 00:59:59,266
while he works for you.

805
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:27,431
My daughter joins me
in this plea...

806
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:31,101
for your cooperation.

807
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:35,338
With gratitude, Walter.

808
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:37,306
''Do You Wish To Send?''
''Yes'' ''No''

809
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:41,569
Why would I send this?
He'd get tired.

810
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,010
''Save For Later'' ''Delete''

811
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:51,286
Save for later.

812
01:00:56,393 --> 01:00:58,261
It's not like I'm sending it.

813
01:00:58,261 --> 01:01:01,231
I'm just saving it
for a few hours...

814
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:04,101
till we come back here and...

815
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:05,936
Michael can see it.

816
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:08,268
Perfectly harmIess.

817
01:01:47,744 --> 01:01:49,177
''Wallace Company''

818
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,094
Send out this, this,
not this, this.

819
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:06,062
That's it.

820
01:02:06,062 --> 01:02:10,600
l'm holding tour or five e-malls
I wrote over lunch. Send those too.

821
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,004
- Yes, sir.
- Bye.

822
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:15,904
all set?

823
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,910
I can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

824
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:22,312
It's no big deaI.
She just gave us the wrong keys.

825
01:02:22,312 --> 01:02:26,283
There's got to be a janifor
or a guard...

826
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:29,853
or a cleaning woman
or, you know, some kind of--

827
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:34,658
Somebody has to be in this building!
I need a brick.

828
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:36,956
What's the big deal
about getting this tile tonight?

829
01:02:38,428 --> 01:02:40,797
- I'm up against a deadline.
- Me too.

830
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:43,733
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- That's my point!

831
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:46,169
Everybody will be busy
with more important things...

832
01:02:46,169 --> 01:02:48,738
and this is really my last chance.

833
01:02:48,738 --> 01:02:51,775
If I could just get up to Walter's
oftice, they're by the computer.

834
01:02:51,775 --> 01:02:55,111
Then I could just e-mail
those figures right out now!

835
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:56,880
Tomorrow's Sunday.

836
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,949
Nobody's doing business.

837
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:03,477
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you right up there.

838
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:06,722
Give it up, kid.

839
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:09,724
Can't win them all.

840
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,173
Good night.

841
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:37,449
This thing mean
that much to you?

842
01:03:40,023 --> 01:03:42,192
We'll use the phone
in your room.

843
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:44,527
Walter's probably not even asIeep.

844
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:47,530
- I'll drive you up there.
- Thank you !

845
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,834
We'll get the right key,
and we'll go back to the office.

846
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:53,603
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow,
you'd better be there.

847
01:03:53,603 --> 01:03:55,505
I'll be there.

848
01:03:55,505 --> 01:04:00,677
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric too.

849
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:03,246
My wedding. You'd think my boss
would leave me alone.

850
01:04:03,246 --> 01:04:05,180
Maybe it's Congratulationss.

851
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:17,688
What is it?

852
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:27,604
''Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to
you on the night before your wedding...

853
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:31,908
but I think you need
and deserve...

854
01:04:31,908 --> 01:04:33,842
to know what
you're marrying into.

855
01:04:38,148 --> 01:04:41,709
I received the foIlowing e-mall
this afternoon:

856
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,878
'Eric, I need a favor.
My daughter's every--'''

857
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,461
IsabelIe, I need to talk to Kim.

858
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:53,997
- ls anything wrong?
- No, I'm just tired.

859
01:04:53,997 --> 01:04:56,693
Please put her on.
Thanks.

860
01:05:00,236 --> 01:05:02,170
could you give me a minute?

861
01:05:03,974 --> 01:05:05,407
Please?

862
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:56,121
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

863
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:02,797
Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.

864
01:06:05,168 --> 01:06:07,404
It's a nonsmoking tloor too.

865
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:11,207
Maybe you could go down
to the lobby.

866
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:13,232
Why don't you have me arrested?

867
01:06:15,478 --> 01:06:17,113
I mean it.

868
01:06:17,113 --> 01:06:20,810
I am a dangerous, criminaI person.

869
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:25,814
I do bad things
to honest peopIe.

870
01:06:28,258 --> 01:06:30,960
You can make a citizen's arrest.
I wouldn't struggIe.

871
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,451
It'd be like getting AI Capone
on tax evaslon.

872
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:44,168
Can I heIp you, miss?

873
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:51,640
Do you smoke, Richard?

874
01:06:52,382 --> 01:06:54,951
Yes, I do, but--

875
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:56,748
It's a nonsmoking tloor.

876
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:01,923
But you know what?

877
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:29,249
You know,
my grandmother always said...

878
01:07:31,354 --> 01:07:34,323
''This too shall pass.''

879
01:07:37,727 --> 01:07:39,160
Thanks, Richard.

880
01:08:04,654 --> 01:08:07,991
l want you to quit this shit.

881
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:09,424
It'll kiII you.

882
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:15,396
What happened?

883
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:20,803
It's over.
She denied it.

884
01:08:20,803 --> 01:08:23,740
She said
I was crazy and paranold.

885
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,776
A bad combination.

886
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:28,311
There's a big...

887
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:32,015
brunch tomorrow morning
at her parents' house.

888
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:34,779
She said,
''How could I call it oft?

889
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:39,077
What am I supposed
to tell everyone?''

890
01:08:40,857 --> 01:08:43,189
It's for the best.
It really is.

891
01:08:44,027 --> 01:08:45,961
She was right.

892
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:50,132
I am crazy...

893
01:08:52,635 --> 01:08:55,126
to tall for someone
I hardly knew.

894
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:02,343
I'm so gIad you're here.

895
01:09:09,485 --> 01:09:12,750
Have you still got that ring?

896
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:27,000
I tried it on,
and it won't come otf.

897
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:09,536
Why don't we take a walk
or have some food sent up?

898
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:14,651
I just want to be alone.

899
01:10:14,651 --> 01:10:16,986
Is that okay?

900
01:10:16,986 --> 01:10:18,419
Sure.

901
01:10:21,524 --> 01:10:26,663
Maybe I'll go back to New York
for awhile and hang with you.

902
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:31,467
Eric will understand.
Or we could go somewhere...

903
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:32,900
if you want.

904
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,066
''lt San Antonlo
sweeps Sacramento--''

905
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:40,442
I've never been to Texas.

906
01:11:29,525 --> 01:11:31,459
''Brown''

907
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,813
You what?

908
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,495
- Can I try that?
- Sure.

909
01:12:27,283 --> 01:12:29,342
- Excuse me.
- Good Iuck.

910
01:12:32,488 --> 01:12:34,791
So this is your basic
call-off-the-wedding party?

911
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,494
I came here to confront everybody.
I won't sIink away like some coward.

912
01:12:38,494 --> 01:12:41,264
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
l don't know what I'm supposed to do.

913
01:12:41,264 --> 01:12:45,360
There is a wedding at 6:00.

914
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:57,340
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

915
01:13:00,616 --> 01:13:04,143
I made a decislon.
It's over.

916
01:13:06,055 --> 01:13:07,989
I'll go tell them.

917
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,255
First,
do you think she's all right?

918
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:17,393
could you
check on her for me?

919
01:13:21,304 --> 01:13:24,296
These are the most beautiful tlowers
I've ever seen.

920
01:13:28,044 --> 01:13:29,477
How is he?

921
01:13:32,248 --> 01:13:34,917
He's sort of wondering...

922
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:38,216
why you haven't told your parents
that the wedding's oft.

923
01:13:39,856 --> 01:13:43,626
I don't know. I'm still hoping
for a miracIe, I suppose.

924
01:13:43,626 --> 01:13:47,196
How could he think that
my father and I would do such a thing?

925
01:13:47,196 --> 01:13:50,290
I only minored in psych,
you understand, but...

926
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:55,238
maybe Michael couldn't commit
to this marriage...

927
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:57,974
so he created...

928
01:13:57,974 --> 01:13:59,475
a deIuslon...

929
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:02,445
produced an unconsclous,
psychosomatic...

930
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:04,379
manitestation of--

931
01:14:07,116 --> 01:14:08,708
I'm better with food.

932
01:14:11,254 --> 01:14:15,892
You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

933
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:19,295
You order...

934
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:21,388
creme bruIee for dessert.

935
01:14:22,465 --> 01:14:25,301
It's beautiful. It's sweet.

936
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:29,038
It's irritatingly perfect.

937
01:14:29,038 --> 01:14:31,707
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

938
01:14:31,707 --> 01:14:34,443
he doesn't want creme bruIee.

939
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:39,278
- He wants something else.
- What does he want?

940
01:14:41,584 --> 01:14:44,314
- Jell-O.
- ''J eII-O''?

941
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:49,892
- Why Jell-O?
- He's comfortable with Jell-O.

942
01:14:49,892 --> 01:14:53,195
Jell-O makes him comfortabIe.

943
01:14:53,195 --> 01:14:55,398
I realize
compared to creme brulee...

944
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:58,367
it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.

945
01:15:00,403 --> 01:15:01,961
I could be Jell-O.

946
01:15:03,606 --> 01:15:06,275
Creme bruIee
can never be Jell-O.

947
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:09,045
You could never be Jell-O.

948
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:12,315
- I have to be Jell-O.
- You'll never be Jell-O.

949
01:15:12,315 --> 01:15:17,520
TeIl your parents. lf you're waiting
for that ''do you take this man'' part...

950
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,715
- it's considered poor form.
- I love him.

951
01:15:20,923 --> 01:15:23,326
Whatever deluslons
I drove Michael to...

952
01:15:23,326 --> 01:15:25,328
there's truth
at the heart of it.

953
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:28,664
I want him to work
for my father.

954
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:31,827
I want to stay in schooI,
and I want a life of my own.

955
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:36,801
Please, tell him it's my fault
and I love him.

956
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,538
You're the only person
that I trust.

957
01:15:46,616 --> 01:15:49,346
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

958
01:16:02,465 --> 01:16:04,667
How is she?

959
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:08,034
- Knock it off!
- Yes, sir!

960
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:12,441
- I asked you--
- She admits that it's her fault.

961
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:15,069
Totally, completely,
inexcusably her tault.

962
01:16:18,481 --> 01:16:20,449
Do you think
she still loves me?

963
01:16:23,886 --> 01:16:27,490
Love is a strong word...

964
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:30,059
and I don't know that
I'm necessarily quallfied--

965
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:34,163
I guess I wouldn't be totally oft base
it I said that, in her way...

966
01:16:34,163 --> 01:16:36,961
she does possess
strong feelings--

967
01:16:42,705 --> 01:16:44,639
Sure, she does.

968
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,543
She's crazy about you.

969
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:51,570
You fill up my senses

970
01:16:52,548 --> 01:16:56,211
Like a night in the forest

971
01:16:57,653 --> 01:17:03,059
Like the mountains
in springtime

972
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:05,728
Like a walk in the rain

973
01:17:05,728 --> 01:17:08,060
TeIl her I'll marry her
at 6:00...

974
01:17:09,131 --> 01:17:11,065
it she'll still have me.

975
01:17:13,302 --> 01:17:15,133
Please.

976
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:21,210
Like a sleepy blue ocean

977
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:24,202
I'll be right back.

978
01:17:28,651 --> 01:17:33,679
Come love me again

979
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,834
What did he say?

980
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:53,941
He said...

981
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,913
''Marry me.''

982
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:07,156
Thank God you were here.

983
01:18:07,156 --> 01:18:09,358
I got so contused.

984
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:10,791
It happens.

985
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:13,394
Got a minute?

986
01:18:15,431 --> 01:18:16,864
What's up?

987
01:18:28,577 --> 01:18:31,847
I have to say this quick or I'll
just have this massive coronary...

988
01:18:31,847 --> 01:18:34,984
and then you'll never hear it,
and you have to.

989
01:18:34,984 --> 01:18:39,955
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
l've ever done in my entire life.

990
01:18:39,955 --> 01:18:45,361
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
But I'm gonna.

991
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:46,885
What's wrong?

992
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:58,140
I love you.
l've loved you for nine years.

993
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,545
I've just been too arrogant
and scared to realize it.

994
01:19:02,545 --> 01:19:04,780
Now I'm just scared.

995
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:08,651
I realize this comes
at a very inopportune time...

996
01:19:08,651 --> 01:19:12,747
but I really have this gigantic
favor to ask of you.

997
01:19:15,124 --> 01:19:18,027
Choose me. Marry me.

998
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:21,019
Let me make you happy.

999
01:19:22,231 --> 01:19:24,600
That sounds like three favors,
doesn't it?

1000
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,033
But--

1001
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:09,140
- Lovely together.
- Aren't they?

1002
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:16,817
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.

Michael, wait!

1004
01:20:35,571 --> 01:20:37,664
Please! You'll never catch her!

1005
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:43,012
Doesn't anybody
leave their car unlocked?

1006
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:46,081
Nobody trusts anybody anymore?

1007
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:48,117
A good Samaritan.

It is not going well !

1017
01:21:13,142 --> 01:21:17,413
This is what comes of telling the truth
or even part of it!

1018
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:20,649
- Getting what you deserve isn 't fair.
- Where are you?

1019
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:25,321
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!

1020
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:27,756
This is all your fault!
I told him the truth !

1021
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:29,758
I said that I loved him,
and I kissed him.

1022
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:32,428
- This is what's happened!
- Jules, a question.

1023
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:35,664
When you kissed Michael,
did he kiss you back?

1024
01:21:35,664 --> 01:21:37,666
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

1025
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:41,762
Was there anything there leading you
to believe this chase will end happily?

1026
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:45,040
That's beside the point.
We were interrupted.

1027
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,776
- Who interrupted you?
- Kimmy! She ruined everything!

1028
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,279
And Michael started chasing her
before he could answer me.

1029
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:51,914
Michael's chasing Kimmy?

1030
01:21:51,914 --> 01:21:53,782
You're chasing Michael?

1031
01:21:53,782 --> 01:21:56,852
Who's chasing you?
Nobody. Get it?

1032
01:21:56,852 --> 01:21:58,420
There's your answer: Kimmy.

1033
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,723
Jules, you are not the one!

1034
01:22:00,723 --> 01:22:04,860
Now, for God's sake,
the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.

1035

of opportunity to do the right thing.

Excuse me.

1039
01:23:50,065 --> 01:23:52,501
I have a confession to make.

1040
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:54,867
Another contession.

1041
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:04,877
Besides that I love you,
this is even worse.

1042
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:15,589
The e-mall that Walter sent
to your boss--

1043
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:22,320
I wrote that.

1044
01:24:25,434 --> 01:24:28,198
I'm the bad guy.

1045
01:24:29,204 --> 01:24:30,706
Are you crazy?

1046
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:33,903
Are you completely insane?

1047
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:38,705
l mean, Jules,
how could you do that?

1048
01:24:40,182 --> 01:24:44,219
It wasn't supposed
to get sent.

1049
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:46,517
I just wanted you
to get mad at Kimmy.

1050
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,325
God.

1051
01:24:54,196 --> 01:24:57,633
I have done nothing
but underhanded, despicable...

1052
01:24:57,633 --> 01:25:01,899
not even terribly imaginative things
since l got here.

1053
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:14,947
I was just trying to win you...

1054
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:18,810
to win you back.

1055
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:22,288
But that doesn't excuse
any of it.

1056
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,149
I'm pond scum.

1057
01:25:27,863 --> 01:25:29,498
Lower, actually.

1058
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:33,902
I'm like the tungus that feeds
on pond scum.

1059
01:25:33,902 --> 01:25:35,426
Lower.

1060
01:25:38,173 --> 01:25:41,176
The pus that intects the mucus...

1061
01:25:41,176 --> 01:25:45,112
that cruds up the tungus
that teeds on the pond scum.

1062
01:25:53,288 --> 01:25:55,483
On the other hand...

1063
01:25:58,293 --> 01:25:59,726
thank you...

1064
01:26:01,563 --> 01:26:03,758
for loving me that much.

1065
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,535
That way...

1066
01:26:06,535 --> 01:26:08,469
it's pretty fIattering.

1067
01:26:10,005 --> 01:26:12,940
Except it makes me tungus.

1068
01:26:13,742 --> 01:26:17,508
That part I knew.

1069
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:29,256
God.

1070
01:26:33,095 --> 01:26:35,529
I'm glad you didn't get
on that train.

1071
01:26:38,467 --> 01:26:40,628
I came here looking for her.

1072
01:26:43,105 --> 01:26:47,405
- Why would she be here?
- This is where I proposed.

1073
01:26:50,512 --> 01:26:54,549
l had to cover a game in MiIwaukee,
and she saw me ott.

1074
01:26:54,549 --> 01:26:58,212
The train was starting
to leave and...

1075
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:03,218
I jumped up on the step
and I heId the handIe...

1076
01:27:04,293 --> 01:27:07,062
and without...

1077
01:27:07,062 --> 01:27:10,429
a thought in my head,
I just shouted, ''Marry me.''

1078
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:18,401
The train was puIIing out,
and she just suddenly screamed, ''Yes!''

1079
01:27:20,575 --> 01:27:22,099
Just once.

1080
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:25,779
And bIew me a kiss.

1081
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:40,261
It would've been
a nice wedding.

1082
01:27:42,698 --> 01:27:45,734
You can't believe
that you've lost her.

1083
01:27:45,734 --> 01:27:50,505
You will find her, and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

1084
01:27:50,505 --> 01:27:55,377
I just hope that it's soon.
Or eIse l'd hate to be you at 6:00.

1085
01:27:55,377 --> 01:27:57,346
Just wait.

1086
01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:59,181
We'll spIit up.

1087
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:02,851
You will go to every romantic place
the two of you have...

1088
01:28:02,851 --> 01:28:08,256
and I will go someplace brilliant,
and we'll find her.

1089
01:28:08,256 --> 01:28:10,747
We will find her.

Have you gotten a call from Kimmy?

1092
01:28:19,234 --> 01:28:22,404
She slipped out, the little monkey,
during the commotion.

My sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue troze right to it.

1095
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:31,012
And that's a commotion?

1096
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:33,014
It's a sculpture of the David.

1097
01:28:33,014 --> 01:28:34,950
So Kimmy would be--

1098
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:38,320
She's probably with Michael
doing the nasty.

1099
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,256
Either that or crying in her nachos
down at Comiskey Park.

1100
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:43,291
- Excuse me?
- l had this crank call...

1101
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:45,627
from some guy who says he saw her
in the luxury box.

1102
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:48,697
- Right.
- What would a bride be doing--

1103
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:50,699
Can you bring my dress
to the church?

1104
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:53,435
I have to pick something up
for the ceremony.

1105
01:28:53,435 --> 01:28:55,835
Don't forget to shave now.

1106
01:28:57,773 --> 01:29:00,008
Here we go.
Here's the hair dryer.

1107
01:29:00,008 --> 01:29:02,077
There we go.

1108
01:29:02,077 --> 01:29:06,013
It's going to be okay.
Please, no pictures.

1109
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:11,284
''Federal Express''

1110
01:29:24,132 --> 01:29:26,601
I know you're in here.
The guard saw you come in.

1111
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,365
Just leave me alone,
you bitch!

1112
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:38,914
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1113
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:41,349
- Cat fight!
- You came here...

1114
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:45,287
pretending to be my friend,
and I made you my maid of honor!

1115
01:29:45,287 --> 01:29:48,957
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me what, eight minutes?

1116
01:29:48,957 --> 01:29:51,626
Michael trusted you,
so I trusted you.

1117
01:29:51,626 --> 01:29:55,363
You wanted to keep me close.
You didn't trust me for a second.

1118
01:29:55,363 --> 01:29:57,833
- I was right!
- of course you were right.

1119
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,936
- But that's not my fault.
- You kissed him!

1120
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:02,938
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold.

1121
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:04,539
On my wedding day!

1122
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:06,341
- Bitch.
- Tramp.

1123
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,343
Shut up!

1124
01:30:08,343 --> 01:30:10,779
Now I love this man,
and there is no way...

1125
01:30:10,779 --> 01:30:16,274
I'm going to give him up to some
two-faced, big-haired food critic!

1126
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:22,624
all right.
Okay, all right!

1127
01:30:22,624 --> 01:30:24,057
I kissed him.

1128
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:28,928
I tried to steal him.

1129
01:30:33,268 --> 01:30:34,701
I lost.

1130
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:44,904
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

1131
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:55,445
I haven't done much that l'm proud of
the last three days.

1132
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:02,163
I'd like to take you
to the church...

1133
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:05,133
so you can walk down
that aisIe...

1134
01:31:05,133 --> 01:31:07,624
and marry the man
ot our dreams.

1135
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:11,796
Because he sure wants
to marry you.

1136
01:33:05,086 --> 01:33:09,958
So raise our glasses and wish Mike
and Kim every happiness...

1137
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:12,290
for a long and happy life
together...

1138
01:33:13,595 --> 01:33:16,723
filled with happiness.

1139
01:33:19,768 --> 01:33:23,101
- I guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom.

1140
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:32,972
Now let's hear from the maid of honor,
the lovely Julianne.

1141
01:33:43,425 --> 01:33:45,791
I had the strangest dream.

1142
01:33:47,529 --> 01:33:52,228
I dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two of you up.

1143
01:33:58,039 --> 01:34:02,635
Luckily, I woke up and I see...

1144
01:34:04,345 --> 01:34:08,281
that the world
is just as it Should be...

1145
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:13,985
for my best friend...

1146
01:34:15,523 --> 01:34:17,650
has won the best woman.

1147
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:30,734
I didn't get you a gift.

1148
01:34:32,941 --> 01:34:34,209
However,
this is on loan...

1149
01:34:34,209 --> 01:34:37,645
However,
this is on loan...

1150
01:34:40,281 --> 01:34:43,478
until you two
find your song.

1151
01:34:47,689 --> 01:34:50,920
Someday

1152
01:34:52,894 --> 01:34:56,057
When I'm awfully low

1153
01:34:57,265 --> 01:35:00,291
When the world is cold

1154
01:35:01,903 --> 01:35:05,240
l will feel a glow

1155
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:11,012
Just thinking of you

1156
01:35:11,012 --> 01:35:14,971
And the way you look

1157
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,540
Tonight

1158
01:35:19,287 --> 01:35:24,247
Oh, but you're lovely

1159
01:35:26,294 --> 01:35:29,161
With your smile so warm

1160
01:35:31,533 --> 01:35:34,730
And your cheeks so soft

1161
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:39,874
There is nothing for me

1162
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:44,208
But to love you

1163
01:35:45,613 --> 01:35:48,844
Just the way you look

1164
01:35:49,818 --> 01:35:51,718
Tonight

1165
01:36:04,499 --> 01:36:07,400
- It's mine!
- I don't think so!

1166
01:36:11,472 --> 01:36:13,064
I got it!

1167
01:36:42,303 --> 01:36:43,827
Bye.

1168
01:37:31,786 --> 01:37:34,188
Hey, gorgeous,
having a good time?

1169
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:37,492
Not particularly,
but I did what I came to do.

1170
01:37:37,492 --> 01:37:39,694
What? You split them up?

1171
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:41,562
No, I said good-bye.

1172
01:37:41,562 --> 01:37:44,232
Good girl.
l'm proud of you.

1173
01:37:44,232 --> 01:37:46,601
Be prouder still
if you were dancing.

1174
01:37:46,601 --> 01:37:48,836
I have big plans for dancing.

1175
01:37:48,836 --> 01:37:52,807
Just give me 30, 35 years.

1176
01:37:52,807 --> 01:37:54,609
The misery...

1177
01:37:54,609 --> 01:37:56,144
the exquisite tragedy.

1178
01:37:56,144 --> 01:37:59,113
The Susan Hayward of it all.

1179
01:37:59,113 --> 01:38:02,717
l can picture you there sitting alone
at your table in your lavender gown.

1180
01:38:02,717 --> 01:38:04,285
Did l tell you
my gown was Iavender?

1181
01:38:04,285 --> 01:38:07,422
Hair swept up.
Haven't touched your cake.

1182
01:38:07,422 --> 01:38:11,793
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen tablecloth...

1183
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:13,962
the way you do when you're
really feeling down.

1184
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:17,465
Perhaps looking at those nails thinking:
''l should've stopped...

1185
01:38:17,465 --> 01:38:21,102
my evil plotting to have that manicure,
but it's too late now. "

1186
01:38:21,102 --> 01:38:24,806
I didn't tell you
my dress was lavender.

1187
01:38:24,806 --> 01:38:26,874
Suddenly, a familiar song.

1188
01:38:26,874 --> 01:38:30,241
The moment l wake up

1189
01:38:31,946 --> 01:38:34,972
And you're off your chair
in one, exquisite movement...

1190
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:40,922
wondering, searching,
sniffing the wind...

1191
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:43,424
like a dapple deer.

1192
01:38:43,424 --> 01:38:45,560
Has God heard your little prayer?

1193
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:48,196
Will Cinderella dance again?

1194
01:38:48,196 --> 01:38:52,394
And then, suddenly,
the crowds part...

1195
01:38:54,102 --> 01:38:55,535
and there he is:

1196
01:38:56,871 --> 01:38:59,974
sleek, stylish...

1197
01:38:59,974 --> 01:39:02,744
radiant with charisma.

1198
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:05,880
Bizarrely,
he's on the telephone.

1199
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,440
But then, so are you.

1200
01:39:10,918 --> 01:39:12,943
And he comes towards you...

1201
01:39:14,222 --> 01:39:16,156
the moves of a jungle cat.

1202
01:39:17,392 --> 01:39:19,792
Although you quite correctly sense
that he is...

1203
01:39:21,162 --> 01:39:22,797
...

1204
01:39:22,797 --> 01:39:26,324
like most devastatingly handsome
single men of his age are...

1205
01:39:28,069 --> 01:39:31,095
you think, what the hell...

1206
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,410
life goes on.

1207
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:38,112
Maybe there won't be marriage.

1208
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,307
Maybe there won't be sex.

1209
01:39:41,649 --> 01:39:45,483
But, by God,
there'll be dancing.

1210
01:40:04,038 --> 01:40:06,370
Bond. Jane Bond.
