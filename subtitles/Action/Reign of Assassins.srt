1
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:06,587
<i>Since Mary, Queen of Scotland, was a child,</i>

2
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:10,957
<i>the English wanted her
country and her crown.</i>

3
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:15,428
<i>She is sent to France to wed its next King</i>

4
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,230
<i>to save herself and her people,</i>

5
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:20,433
<i>a bond that should protect her.</i>

6
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,102
<i>But there are forces that conspire,</i>

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,938
<i>forces of darkness, forces of the heart.</i>

8
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,442
<i>Long may She Reign.</i>

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,778
<i>Previously on Reign...</i>

10
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:34,246
I don't know if I'm ready.

11
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,882
To leave here? Or marry the
future King of France?

12
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,584
You will wed young Francis

13
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:41,754
for your faith, for your
people, for Scotland.

14
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,988
She's here doing her job,

15
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,290
and her job is waiting for me to decide

16
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:46,658
when you should marry her.

17
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:47,992
What matters is what's
right for my country.

18
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,762
You don't want to marry me.

19
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:59,463

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,577
We've no quarrel with the English.

21
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:09,980
We're just farmers. But...

22
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,282
You're welcome to share our breakfast.

23
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:16,485
You're going to need a lot of eggs.

24
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,237
A few grains should help you sleep.

25
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,539
But only a few and not every night.

26
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:45,848
What?

27
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,782
Nostradamus.

28
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,883
What are you seeing?

29
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,679
War.

30
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,923
And the cost of war.

31
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,059
- Where?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:01,596
But wherever it is, it
will reach inside this castle.

33
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,466
All right, Kenna.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,134
It's your turn. Not your first

35
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,402
but your best kisser.

36
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:11,305
It was a man, not a boy.

37
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,773
Who? You must tell us.

38
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,375
All I'll say is that there's no point

39
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:15,743
in waiting for boys our own age

40
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,110
who have no idea what they're doing.

41
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,911
Either find yourself a man or...

42
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:21,481
Take care of your needs yourself.

43
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,450
Anyway,

44
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:25,951
I think that it's Greer's turn, isn't it?

45
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,087
My first kiss...

46
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,292
...is in the very near future.

47
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,226
I'm not like you.

48
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,960
My family's not titled.

49
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,397
I can't afford even little mistakes.

50
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,400
But... I think I've found the man.

51
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,203
He's tall, dark and noble.

52
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,972
Tomas, the son of the King of Portugal.

53
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,608
He's here negotiating some
kind of trade deal,

54
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,041
but he's taking his time

55
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,144
about it, and I think it's to stay with me.

56
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,414
Greer, it's dangerous to
get involved with a prince.

57
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:58,248
You know they marry for alliances.

58
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:01,652
Your family are commoners.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,555
Tomas is a King's bastard, like Bash.

60
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:07,457
Favored, too, but with money and land.

61
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,892
I'm not a fool. I know a true royal

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,929
would never look at me except to ruin me.

63
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,632
I can take care of myself.

64
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,636
Your Majesty,

65
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,070
Your Uncle,

66
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,104
Claude de guise, is here and wishes

67
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,138
to see you at once.

68
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:32,046
You look well, Mary.

69
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,883
Your mother sends her
affection. Read it later.

70
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:38,853
You may be assured the
love is in there, as is the news

71
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,854
of a crisis in Scotland.

72
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,189
- The English.
- They're massing on the border.

73
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,058
And these are not the normal skirmishes.

74
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,960
They're out in number. They're
looking for weakness,

75
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,995
- and if they find any...
- We must respond with strength.

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,196
Yes.

77
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,032
Surely my mother has sent soldiers.

78
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,467
Of course. But not enough.

79
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:54,590
We need more men.

80
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,923
Our strongest ally is France.

81
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:57,258
- King Henry will help us.
- He's been asked,

82
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,159
and he's been slow to answer.

83
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,813
You were sent here to secure
the alliance by marrying

84
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,815
Henry's son. Now they're dragging

85
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,149
their feet. What happened?

86
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,817
Nothing happened.

87
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,554
They're being politicians.

88
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,191
Francis and his father
aren't eager to commit to Scotland.

89
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,059
They'd rather keep me in a drawer,

90
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,895
like a pair of gloves for cold weather.

91
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,164
And then when the
weather grows cold for France,

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,165
they'll take me out and I'll be wed.

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,368
They're afraid of what a
permanent bond might mean.

94
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,237
But right now, we have immediate problems.

95
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:36,107
Scotland needs more troops.

96
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:39,810
As Queen, you must do something.

97
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,588
Mary.

98
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:57,927
Your Grace.

99
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:00,696
We've been...

100
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:03,565
discussing this business in Scotland.

101
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,736
You have my sympathy.

102
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,904
Father, I believe Her Majesty is
here for more than just sympathy.

103
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,707
Of course. We're sending wagons, gunpowder,

104
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:14,143
- supplies for your army...
- Supplies are useless without men.

105
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,111
Surely you can spare a few.

106
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:18,212
- You have so many more soldiers than we do.
- And...

107
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:19,714
Many more borders as well.

108
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,282
You only have to worry about England.

109
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,217
I have England, Spain,

110
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,419
a hundred Italian and
German principalities...

111
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,421
You are supposed to be our ally.

112
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:30,759
If our positions were
reversed, Scotland would help.

113
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:34,862
Mary, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,830
Eight companies.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,168
- Six!
- I hope I will have

116
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:44,604
the happiness of seeing you tonight
at the entertainments.

117
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,839
Yes?

118
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:48,141
I hope you understand

119
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,909
the position you're putting us in.

120
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,946
Lives will be lost.

121
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,184
She only asked for six companies.

122
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,618
And what if we lose those companies?

123
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,187
We look weak in England's eyes.

124
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:03,489
So we send more and we
lose those. When do we stop?

125
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:07,092
Before or after England
decides we're soft prey?

126
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,661
At the moment, the
Scottish border is quicksand.

127
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,163
You know this.

128
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,698
A pretty girl doesn't change that fact,

129
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,132
even if she happens to be your fiancée.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,902
And their Queen.

131
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,871
Mary.

132
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,506
Mary, my father just...

133
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:25,275
- The political situation is complicated.
- Complicated?

134
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,312
People will be dying soon. Isn't
that complicated enough?

135
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,448
Mary, I agree with you.

136
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,318
- You do?
- I think France should help Scotland in this.

137
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,219
We're at a tilting point:

138
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,154
If England invades Scotland and succeeds,

139
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,156
it'll be that much of a
stronger enemy to France.

140
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,958
Then we're on the same side.

141
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,960
For all the good it does.

142
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,829
One day, if things goes well,

143
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,232
we'll rule France and
Scotland and we'll be together.

144
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,434
Now we have no real power.

145
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,368
We have to wait.

146
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:54,970
No.

147
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,372
I'm tired of waiting.

148
00:06:57,406 --> 00:07:00,375
And if we have no power,

149
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,012
then we must find a way of getting some.

150
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,493
Come play with me?

151
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,162
Happily.

152
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:17,631
Sometimes you just need to kick something.

153
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:20,467
You're not like a girl.

154
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,870
What did you think girls were like?

155
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:25,572
They sit around, afraid
they're gonna mess up their dresses.

156
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:28,341
You like to have fun.

157
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:46,992
It's stuck.

158
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,228
Maybe you should
fetch someone with a ladder.

159
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,896
Wait, I've got it!

160
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,667
Your Majesty,

161
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,403
may I present Tomas of Portugal,

162
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,739
lord of palmela? Tomas,

163
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,008
Mary, Queen of Scots.

164
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,510
Hello.

165
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:09,847
Do you often stroll in trees, Your Majesty?

166
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:12,850
Um, I climbed up here to
fetch prince Charles' ball,

167
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,852
but I guess he got tired of waiting.

168
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,221
Are you sure? Because from down here,

169
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:21,224
it looks like Scotland
attacked Portugal without provocation.

170
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,626
Um, turn around

171
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,063
- so I can come down.
- We may have a diplomatic incident here, Your Majesty.

172
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:28,932
Greer, please get
your friend to turn around.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,333
I can't climb down with
him staring up my skirts.

174
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:39,741
Your arm!

175
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,809
I'll be fine.

176
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,077
Are you all right?

177
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:44,380
Yes. I'm so sorry.

178
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,847
Just promise, no more attacks from the sky.

179
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:49,017
Portugal surrenders.

180
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,252
Greer of Kinross,

181
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:55,589
I look forward to seeing you tonight.

182
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,292
Your Majesty.

183
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,664
I might not have made a
very good first impression,

184
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:07,100
but I see why you like him.

185
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,002
Isn't he perfect?

186
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,270
I have it all planned.

187
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:11,471
The boating party's coming up.

188
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,307
I'll pack a picnic basket,

189
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:15,943
we'll be out there on the
lake under the moonlight.

190
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,644
And nature will take its course.

191
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,646
Your first kiss. And a beginning, I hope.

192
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:21,981
Well, good luck.

193
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,616
He definitely looks worth the wait.

194
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,473
Your mind's elsewhere.

195
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,908
Is it slender lady
Charlotte or plump lady Isabelle

196
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:53,110
- with the breasts like two pigeons?
- If I told you,

197
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:55,847
you might poach. You've a
liking for pigeon, as I recall.

198
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,349
We should help Scotland.

199
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,317
Not for Mary but for France.

200
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:02,753
By all means, explain.

201
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,489
When you say that the border is quicksand,

202
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,022
you assume that we'll lose.

203
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,691
England hasn't sent its entire army north.

204
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:11,294
They're poking to see
what reaction they get.

205
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,597
We could strike fast,
hit back hard and win.

206
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,098
But if we do nothing,

207
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,166
we risk losing the
entire Scottish alliance.

208
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,802
Years of planning, wasted.

209
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,304
So it's a balance of risks either way.

210
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,771
Very good.

211
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,172
Except I've decided the...

212
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,108
Reasons against outweigh the reasons for.

213
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,342
And guess what:

214
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,811
I'm King.

215
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,045
Another round?

216
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,817
You never spar with me.

217
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,052
Is it a good idea for a
King to spar with his usurper?

218
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,654
You mean his inheritor.

219
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,690
If you win,

220
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,559
I shut up about this whole subject.

221
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,196
If I win, you send those
six companies of men.

222
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,186
Very good.

223
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,589
Very good.

224
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,725
When can they leave?

225
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,261
No one's going to Scotland.

226
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,831
But your word, your wager.

227
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,867
Well, that's what Kings do.

228
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,368
We make promises to everybody,

229
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,503
and whatever works for the realm, we keep.

230
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,673
Otherwise, they never happened.

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,008
Lesson for today.

232
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,649
- That's not the way...
- Don't need any more lessons right now.

233
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,357
Bread...the seeded kind.

234
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,293
I'm not talking about everyday black bread.

235
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,395
Chestnut spread. Strawberry tartlets.

236
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,030
Strawberries this late?

237
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,032
I can make you apple tarts.

238
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Everyone has apple. I
wanted something different.

239
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:05,635
Talk to God.

240
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:07,804
- He put the strawberries away.
- Fine.

241
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,607
But I want the apple tarts
that have the honey on top.

242
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:11,975
Baked, so they're golden brown,

243
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,576
not soggy, to taste fresh

244
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:16,812
and crisp after two
hours in a boat on the lake.

245
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:19,114
You want an awful lot...
this must be for someone special.

246
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,281
Not that it's

247
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:21,984
any of your business, but yes,

248
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:23,451
it's for someone very special.

249
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:25,621
I expect your best.

250
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:28,624
- Why don't you just leave the list.
- But who would read it to you?

251
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:32,426
Greer? I've been
looking for you everywhere.

252
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,935
You said Tomas was in from Portugal

253
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,670
to negotiate a trade deal.

254
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:45,106
- What kind of deal?
- I don't know.

255
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,107
Something about buying
French timber for ships.

256
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,642
That makes sense.

257
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,644
They're expanding their fleet...war ships,

258
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,512
exploring vessels for the new world.

259
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,080
Of course they need timber.

260
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,082
Why are we talking about wood?

261
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,684
Because it occurred to me

262
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,153
that if a Queen can't
command what she needs,

263
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:02,187
maybe she can buy it.

264
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:06,458
May I know where you're
taking me, Your Majesty?

265
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,293
I didn't want to be overheard.

266
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,495
Intriguing.

267
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,430
Is it romantic?

268
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:14,399
Conspiratorial?

269
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,136
May I have a hint?

270
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,537
It's about timber.

271
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,338
- Timber?
- Timber.

272
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:23,675
Scotland has trees, too, you know.

273
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,210
Whatever deal you have with King Henry,

274
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,780
<i>I'll do better...if you close the deal now</i>

275
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,649
and if you send us men instead of money.

276
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:34,117
Your country is in need.

277
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,720
But surely, King Henry will help you.

278
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,321
I mean, the alliance.

279
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,728
I see.

280
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:46,663
Well, my father

281
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,231
The King empowered me

282
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,733
to make whatever deal I think best.

283
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:53,569
And I'd be a fool to turn this down.

284
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:57,139
But... Henry
considers our deal almost made.

285
00:13:57,174 --> 00:14:00,209
And it's not a small thing to anger a King

286
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,644
in his own house.

287
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,646
Meet me this afternoon.

288
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,281
I'll confirm our transaction then.

289
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,765
Now.

290
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,400
The guards are discreet.

291
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,237
I want to be with you completely,

292
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,572
as a woman, but...

293
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,644
...as a girl, I need more time.

294
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,045
How long?

295
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,919
When you're ready.

296
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:59,086
It's an old church, made by Louis vii.

297
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:01,989
Meant to last forever,

298
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,158
but... nothing does.

299
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:13,266
Why have you brought me here?

300
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:15,601
I wanted your advice.

301
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,704
I sent for this from my ship in the bay.

302
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:22,241
The new world has brought us wealth...

303
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:23,976
Beyond imagining.

304
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:28,047
Do you think these might make a woman

305
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:30,549
think kindly of me?

306
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,986
I think you might have a chance, yeah.

307
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,524
I'm glad you think so.

308
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,728
I don't understand.

309
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:47,398
I thought you and-and Greer were...

310
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,467
What does Greer have to do with this?

311
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,770
She's a lovely girl, but...

312
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,138
I've seen you...

313
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,175
And I can't look away.

314
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,280
There is... there's a wildness in you,

315
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,315
as you play...

316
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,684
Ride, as you climb trees.

317
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,752
I see your spirit...

318
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:13,489
And I believe it's like mine.

319
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,594
Just thoughts I would have kept to myself,

320
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:21,330
but I see your struggle here in France.

321
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,200
Left to solve your problems alone.

322
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:26,667
I'd never do that.

323
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:28,470
Never.

324
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,139
Wed me.

325
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:36,511
Wed me, and I won't make you wait.

326
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:39,747
Say yes, and you'll have your men.

327
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,949
Say yes.

328
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:49,589
Tomas... y-you're kind,

329
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:51,458
you're handsome,

330
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:53,293
You're very charming...

331
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,462
I sense a refusal.

332
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,831
But I am a Queen.

333
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:01,167
And flattered as I am by your attentions,

334
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,868
I must marry a nation,

335
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,703
not a man.

336
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,407
What is this?

337
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,409
My father's been writing

338
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:12,711
to the pope, arranging to
have me declared legitimate.

339
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,382
My father is dying, and
I'm his only living son.

340
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,320
His grandson is next in line,
and he's only three years old.

341
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,689
My father doesn't trust the regent

342
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:26,691
to safe guard Portugal.

343
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,493
He wants me on the throne.

344
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:31,662
The announcement will be made any day now.

345
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,064
So, you see...

346
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:35,433
I can lay my heart at your feet,

347
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,435
and my country as well.

348
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,437
We can save Scotland.

349
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,606
If you marry me.

350
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,968
Will you?

351
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,344
A real proposal from The Future King?

352
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,049
What does your uncle think?

353
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,936
I haven't told him yet.

354
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,938
Because you're worried

355
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,206
he'd press you to accept Tomas,

356
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,808
and you're not ready to let Francis go?

357
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,377
It's all right to admit it, Mary.

358
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,213
I'd be exchanging a man I...

359
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,950
Admire... For a man I barely know.

360
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,652
And true support for Scotland.

361
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,654
Tomas seems nice. Feelings may come

362
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,490
in time. And what of Greer's feelings?

363
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,059
She had her eye on
Tomas. A crown prince would

364
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,661
never marry her... she's
not even a possibility.

365
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,631
Well, it's entirely possible
that nothing will come of it,

366
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,033
and that Tomas will

367
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,667
return home to Portugal.

368
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,668
I asked him to be discreet

369
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:37,372
while I considered the proposal.

370
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,209
Your vision.

371
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,123
Do you know yet

372
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:01,760
how the warfare you saw
will reach inside the castle?

373
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:03,461
No.

374
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,430
Maybe you saw the fighting in Scotland.

375
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:06,897
If Mary weds my son

376
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:10,701
and it causes his death, as you predicted,

377
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:13,537
this castle will see violence
within its walls

378
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,272
like none before.

379
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,742
Tell me exactly what you saw.

380
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:23,412
You look lovely.

381
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,917
Is the King still
refusing to send the men we need?

382
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,319
I've pushed as hard as I can.

383
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,925
Well, I know you've done your best.

384
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,026
- Thank you.
- Mary...

385
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:39,561
Nostradamus.

386
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:43,598
Why don't you share your
wisdom with all of us.

387
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,302
I don't understand.

388
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,204
Always at my wife's ear.

389
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,305
What do you whisper?

390
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,541
I hear emperor maximilian

391
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:53,742
has a seer in Prague who can...

392
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,478
Tell fortunes using playing cards.

393
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,013
Tell the fortunes of Queen Mary

394
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,414
and her ladies.

395
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,349
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

396
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,252
but I'm not skilled at cards and
I don't control my visions.

397
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,554
They come and go as they will.

398
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,722
You're not as good

399
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,523
as maximilian's seer?

400
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:09,857
- Leave him alone, Henry.
- Come,

401
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,426
the man must have
something to recommend him

402
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,729
since you rely so deeply on his counsel.

403
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,765
Each of you pick a card.

404
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,268
Have your question ready.

405
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,371
Will I ever love again?

406
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,941
You'll meet a dark, handsome stranger.

407
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,542
Be wary of flattery.

408
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,179
Life will offer

409
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,947
many challenges.

410
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,515
You'll meet them with grace.

411
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:37,450
Well, that's not very specific.

412
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:38,685
Give us a fortune,

413
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,853
not a platitude.

414
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,755
Or is that the best you can do?

415
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:53,599
The lion will fight the
dragon on the field of poppies.

416
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,467
What?

417
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:58,903
The lion will fight the
dragon on the field of poppies.

418
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:03,975
- Who will I...?
- You'll fall in love

419
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,677
with a man with a white mark on his face.

420
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,581
When will I see my family?

421
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,483
You'll never go home.

422
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,720
What do you mean "Never go home"?

423
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,321
That's all I was given.

424
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:19,890
You know no more than I.

425
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,559
Well,

426
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,161
there's a showman for you.

427
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,830
Musicians, dancing music.

428
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,399
Enough of this foolishness.

429
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,467
Why would you say that to my friend?

430
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,769
Why scare her?

431
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:34,603
I can only say what I've seen.

432
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:37,774
Like a dragon and a field of poppies?

433
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,910
Are people fooled by you?

434
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,845
The only dragons are in children's stories.

435
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,313
Then I must be a liar.

436
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:47,316
But why these lies?

437
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,318
Who gains?

438
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:51,086
The fortune-telling was Henry's idea,

439
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,521
so it can't have come from Catherine.

440
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:56,391
Who are you and who do you serve?

441
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,762
The realm... Myself, the truth.

442
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,497
The truth?

443
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,066
Serving the truth at court
is a crooked path.

444
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,373
You know, I don't think I ever noticed

445
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,876
that tiny white scar on your cheek.

446
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,478
It becomes you.

447
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:19,513
Thank you.

448
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:20,547
Would you excuse me?

449
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,719
Mary,

450
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,322
believe me, I've argued with my father.

451
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:32,358
I've explained why politically
it's a good idea.

452
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,294
I've, I've done more than argue.

453
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,296
I've done all I can reasonably do.

454
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,097
Then maybe you should be unreasonable.

455
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,201
I commanded the musicians

456
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,500
to play music from my country.

457
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,036
Allow me.

458
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,124
Why don't you dance like that?

459
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,592
Shut up.

460
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:46,094
Apparently they do
things differently in Portugal.

461
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,196
I love this Portuguese music.

462
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:49,697
Keep playing.

463
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:51,799
Not what I meant by "Discreet."

464
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,805
Greer, don't be upset.

465
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,207
It was just a dance.

466
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,641
I'm not upset because of a dance.

467
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:01,876
I'm not upset at all.

468
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,976
I'm just going back to my room.

469
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,244
I'm not feeling well.

470
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:05,245
Please, let's talk.

471
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:06,479
There's no need.

472
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,217
You're my Queen.

473
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,219
You're rich and you're beautiful

474
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:15,389
and you're engaged to the crown prince

475
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:17,624
of France.

476
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:20,059
I thought perhaps you
could leave Tomas for me.

477
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:24,063
It's not as if you could marry him anyway.

478
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:26,532
You knew how important this was to me.

479
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,303
It just wasn't important to you.

480
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:35,340
No, Greer...

481
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:38,109
You do have a way of
leaving chaos in your wake.

482
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:42,013
What was that about?

483
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:44,615
Tomas asked me to marry him.

484
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:48,253
He's being declared legitimate.

485
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:51,155
He says his father wants
him on the throne imminently.

486
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:53,157
It's not what I want,

487
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:56,360
but my options are extremely limited.

488
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:59,296
You went behind our back?

489
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,498
You're making a new alliance with Portugal?

490
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,800
It was his idea, not mine,

491
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,502
and he's willing to
actually get married, too,

492
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:05,703
which is more than your family is offering.

493
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:06,970
You can't just

494
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,573
- break an alliance.
- I don't want to.

495
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,309
You said that we had no power,

496
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,345
that there was nothing we could do.

497
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:19,516
I don't like it but I found a way.

498
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:22,885
If France won't help us,

499
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,155
then I will have no choice
but to accept Portugal's offer.

500
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,359
His name is Tomas.

501
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,595
You'd be marrying the man,

502
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,697
not the country.

503
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,032
It's what my mother will want...

504
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,735
...and what my country needs.

505
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:28,732
I never thought, you know.

506
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,229
Thought what?

507
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,798
My first marriage.

508
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,035
I married for love

509
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:38,538
and I loved her deeply.

510
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:40,105
She died of influenza.

511
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:41,741
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:49,481
When I learned my father planned

513
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,951
to make me his heir, I thought,

514
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:54,420
my next union is sure to be arranged,

515
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,856
my life nothing but politics,

516
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,791
but then I saw you in a tree.

517
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,430
- Please.
- Thank you.

518
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,592
Your father is a confusing man.

519
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:40,562
Yes, he is.

520
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,234
It's not a reflection on you personally,

521
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,871
but my family will need to confirm
all that you've said.

522
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:53,040
I understand you're not ready to trust me.

523
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:57,045
You needn't wait for confirmation
from Portugal.

524
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,815
My ship in the bay has several
companies of men.

525
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:03,017
They can leave for
Scotland on tomorrow's tide.

526
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,851
So quickly?

527
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:07,787
I know you're the woman I want

528
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:12,126
and I'll do whatever it
takes to keep from losing you.

529
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,934
What are you doing here?

530
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:27,206
Returning the basket.

531
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,079
So, how did it go, lady
only the special cheese for me?

532
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:35,680
Your important friend like it?

533
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:43,921
Is he a punishing man if he doesn't get

534
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:46,723
the exact thing he
wants the moment he wants it?

535
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:49,507
Hard to imagine a more uncomfortable
conversation

536
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:51,776
- about one's father.
- You don't even know what I'm talking about specifically.

537
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:54,278
I know exactly what you're talking about.

538
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:57,267
His attention drifted to you

539
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,935
and now it's drifting elsewhere.

540
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,970
Am I right?

541
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:06,209
He's not punishing you, he's playing you.

542
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:08,078
He likes to play and he likes to win,

543
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:10,646
but know this about him:

544
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:14,416
A victory without
effort is worse than a defeat.

545
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:26,462
If the Scottish alliance is worth saving,

546
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:27,796
we need to send troops.

547
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:30,631
We've had this talk before.

548
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:31,932
Not quite.

549
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,804
I see the way that you
look at the Lady Kenna

550
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:39,740
and the way that she looks at you.

551
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:41,775
I know your pattern.

552
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,812
Now, I'm not sure that you've
slept with her yet.

553
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:46,913
What's this?

554
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:50,484
But I wonder how your Medici wife

555
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,486
and, more important to
you, your French mistress

556
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,488
will react when they find out

557
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,924
that you moved in on a new girl.

558
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,760
I think we both know that
Diane and my mother

559
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:03,596
have a way of making life very
difficult when they wish,

560
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,964
even for a King.

561
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,735
Finally.

562
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,474
Very well, King in waiting.

563
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,875
- I'm not...
- We'll try it your way.

564
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,378
Win or lose, you will answer for it.

565
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,413
That's what Kings do.

566
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,485
There are six companies of men

567
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,054
quartered between us and the channel.

568
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,490
You'll send our
fastest rider to mobilize them.

569
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,926
Do you know who our fastest rider is?

570
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,298
Send a message to all six captains.

571
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,367
Tell them that
they'll board ship at outreau.

572
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,569
Are you sure you're all right to ride?

573
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,004
I am a riding fiend, little brother.

574
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,838
You'll be happy, Scotland will be happy,

575
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:53,242
Mary will be happy, and Mary will stay.

576
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:54,710
Just be careful.

577
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,679
Aren't I always?

578
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,181
Well, if always means never.

579
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,287
Hyah!

580
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,015
So this goat just goes running off.

581
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,419
As for my father, he's
shouting, "Catch him! Catch him!"

582
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,657
I chased that damned goat
over half the mountaintop.

583
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,460
And I decided, no more sheep and goats.

584
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,127
Indoor work for me.

585
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:29,430
Mind you, when I go home,

586
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:31,632
that goat still shares
our house in the winter.

587
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,000
There's no escape.

588
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,203
I can't say I've ever lived with a goat.

589
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:39,238
Didn't think so, where you come from.

590
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,007
But my father keeps hounds.

591
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:43,777
They're all over the house, all the time.

592
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,012
I think he cares more about the hounds

593
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,581
than my mother and my sisters.

594
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:50,517
Is that why he sent you so
far away, with Queen Mary?

595
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,751
He sent me here to be married.

596
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,454
I have to marry well, for my family's sake.

597
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:58,390
My parents made that very clear to me.

598
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:02,194
The only way to rise in the world
is through land and title,

599
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,829
and for people like us,

600
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:06,298
the only way to achieve these
things is to marry them.

601
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:09,300
So, love has no place in your life?

602
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:11,903
I hope it will,

603
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:16,474
but I have four younger
sisters counting on me, as well.

604
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:19,711
If I rise, they rise.

605
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:24,515
You should have been there when
they saw me off to France.

606
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,049
They looked at me

607
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,151
the way my father looks at an investment,

608
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:29,920
wondering if I'll fail, or pay off.

609
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,891
Well, I'm sorry you have to live this way.

610
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:46,869
I never...

611
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:48,971
I shouldn't...

612
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,373
Nor should you.

613
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,008
You're a servant.

614
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:54,677
Nothing can ever happen between us.

615
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:57,513
But it did.

616
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:04,786
Mary, it's done.

617
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,721
Six companies are on their
way to Scotland tonight.

618
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:08,890
What? Francis!

619
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,560
But how? You said the
King wouldn't change his mind,

620
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:14,295
that you'd done all you could.

621
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:15,829
I suppose I was inspired.

622
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:18,533
I can't believe it.

623
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:22,136
I still can't offer to
marry you right away, like Tomas.

624
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:24,372
You'd have a secure alliance there.

625
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,974
Here, we can only hope.

626
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:29,709
Some day it will be
right for our countries.

627
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:32,412
I would rather have hope with you

628
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,348
than certainty anywhere else.

629
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:44,657
Morning.

630
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:47,299
What's this?

631
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,453
You've been avoiding me,

632
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,530
so I thought I would try and bribe you

633
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,038
with this new venetian drink.

634
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:55,034
It's coffee.

635
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:56,469
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,404
The truth is,

637
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,671
there never really was
much between Tomas and me.

638
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,140
Some flirting...

639
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,809
all very proper... but that's it.

640
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:06,644
I wanted to believe there was more.

641
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:08,380
Well, you know why.

642
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,582
I imagined the whole fairytale.

643
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:14,152
The perfect first kiss with

644
00:35:14,186 --> 00:35:16,520
the man with the white mark on his face.

645
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:19,923
Me as the heroine, helping my family.

646
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:21,758
I know you'll find the right man, Greer.

647
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,328
I know you will.

648
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:27,398
Should I tell you a secret?

649
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:31,568
Maybe it's because I've
been engaged since I was six, but

650
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:34,004
I've never been kissed, either.

651
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,340
Well, actually,

652
00:35:37,374 --> 00:35:39,475
things have changed for me in that respect.

653
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:42,211
What?! No! Who is it? Tell me everything!

654
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,848
Morning.

655
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:47,050
I suppose I should send
down for breakfast then.

656
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:50,485
No. By all means, I'll go.

657
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:53,121
Coffee?

658
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:55,123
And we want the sweet butter,
not the other kind.

659
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:56,625
And try putting some heavy cream

660
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,594
in that coffee, but for heaven's sake,

661
00:35:58,628 --> 00:35:59,929
not goat's milk cream.

662
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:02,097
I'll take care of it.

663
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:05,299
Lovely morning, my Lady.

664
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:17,879
Our men will have
gone north to the channel.

665
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:20,114
Calais is in English hands,

666
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:21,882
so our men will take ship at outreau.

667
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,318
Guards?

668
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:34,828
Quickly!

669
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,765
It's Bash.

670
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:11,230
The cost of war will
reach inside this castle.

671
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,268
- How is he?
- He's gravely injured.

672
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,170
I can tend to his wounds,

673
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:19,737
ease the pain, but I make no guarantees.

674
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,273
Father,

675
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,776
the English...

676
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,179
Rode out from Calais

677
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,747
to face us.

678
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:31,849
We never made it to the ships.

679
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,952
It was a slaughter.

680
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,021
He shouldn't be talking.

681
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,923
I'm give him a potion, put him to sleep.

682
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,858
Clear the room. It's the best

683
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,794
- thing for him.
- Bash?

684
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,129
Bash, I'm so sorry.

685
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,930
Come.

686
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,732
Come.

687
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:58,107
Go wait.

688
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:05,748
Kings don't apologize.

689
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,149
I didn't know this would happen,

690
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:09,218
but I knew it was a risk. So did you.

691
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:13,389
Lives are always at
risk, at our hand, at our will.

692
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:15,491
For a prince, this was a...

693
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:17,926
A cheap lesson.

694
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,730
Cheap? Six companies.

695
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:24,666
Your son... I know you love him.

696
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,302
You were influenced by your heart.

697
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:30,538
If that happens when you are King,

698
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:32,841
you could lose 10,000 men.

699
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,941
You could lose France.

700
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:44,017
The English were ready for us.

701
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,619
- Someone told them.
- Yes.

702
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,821
While Bash was riding to
six different companies,

703
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:50,690
it appears someone loyal to
the English rode straight to calais

704
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:52,458
and warned them.

705
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:55,294
Well, aren't you going to tell Francis?

706
00:38:57,865 --> 00:39:00,332
No. Not today.

707
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,802
It would ruin the lesson.

708
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:06,638
Let something come of this treachery.

709
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,508
Francis will never trust his heart again.

710
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,976
That's the only way to rule.

711
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:17,382
Francis?

712
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,651
Francis?

713
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:23,020
You did the right thing.

714
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:27,357
Talk to me.

715
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,174
You should marry Tomas.

716
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,677
My father's right.

717
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:50,079
- I haven't been thinking clearly.
- That's not true.

718
00:39:50,147 --> 00:39:51,648
You were trying to help.

719
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:53,049
<i>I can't help you.</i>

720
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,150
France can't help.

721
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,185
There are no more troops to send.

722
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:58,987
Do what's right for your country.

723
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,760
- Francis!
- Can you say that I'm wrong?

724
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:33,153
Well...

725
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:36,055
I suppose you're going to
have to teach me Portuguese.

726
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:46,830
I'll make you happy.

727
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,114
You already have.

728
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,873
There are eight companies of
fighting men on that ship.

729
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,510
They'll be in Scotland in two days.

730
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:10,588
The English lion will fight
the dragon on the field of poppies.

731
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:24,335
