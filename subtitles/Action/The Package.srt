1
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,435
You're making a big mistake!

2
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,118
This is Ike Pappas, speaking
from the Schloss Treptow

3
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,118
in the American zone of the
stiII-divided West BerIin.

4
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,789
Scene of what will surely be one
of the monumental moments

5
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,876
in the history of mankind.

6
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,515
American and Soviet negotiators
are said to be quite close now

7
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,918
to an agreement, pulling the world back
from the brink of nuclear annihilation

8
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,996
and ending the long Cold War.

9
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,076
But a major problem remains.

10
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,988
Several top Soviet and US
military leaders refuse to end

11
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,917
their opposition to the treaty,

12
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,032
warning it would mean the
removal of the nuclear shield,

13
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,879
leaving both sides
vulnerable to attack.

14
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,629
Nevertheless, the treaty is
expected to be finalised today.

15
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,955
What is this? A ZiI? A ZiI?

16
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,116
This is a Z..

17
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,796
Keepin' warm, Johnny?

18
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,678
- Sergeant. Whaddaya know?
- They're taIking.

19
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,036
- Hi, top.
- How are you doing?

20
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,916
Troops, troops, troops!

21
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,994
- Are we gonna knock off?
- What the fuck is that, MichaeI?

22
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,676
It's a candy bar, top.

23
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,236
If you get hungry, you eat
some weeds, some tree bark!

24
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,476
Some deer shit!

25
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,034
Knock it off!

26
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,628
What the fuck kind of
outfit d'you think this is?

27
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,673
- That's a good one, top.
- We're supposed to be tough guys.

28
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,270
- What kind of bar is that? A Baby Ruth?
- Ah, knock it off!

29
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,358
- Get rid of that shit, wiII you?
- AII right, sir.

30
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,199
What have you got in your pocket?!
I know!

31
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,836
Sergeant!

32
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,799
- How are you doing, GaIIagher?
- Good, sir.

33
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,354
You go haIf a kIick from
the chateau to the hiII.

34
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,516
Down to the road.
Then you doubIe back.

35
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,792
- Who's on the other side of the Iake?
- Red team. Remember, we're watchdogs.

36
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,876
This is the BerIin
poIice's baII game.

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,560
Anything goes down, you
secure and hoId for them.

38
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,393
Morning, sir!

39
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,552
- Look, do you reaIise..
- Did you give me

40
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,798
an affirmative answer? Goddammit, Bob!
We've exhausted the option.

41
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,071
- Tom, this is insane!
- Listen, we have totaI support..

42
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,839
- I'm out of it, Tom.
- TaIk to me, Bob.

43
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,354
It's OK.

44
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,317
Let's move out!

45
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,638
- Are you gonna move, MichaeIs?!
- I'm cIeaning up your shit!

46
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,040
Jesus! Look at him! WaIking
around in the coId,

47
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,436
- when he couId be inside with a coffee!
- He Iooks pissed off!

48
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,438
It's probabIy cos he's
freezing his cojones off!

49
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,870
That's a generaI, guys.
GeneraIs do a Iot of thinking.

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,470
That's why every time I'm asked
to be one, I aIways say no!

51
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,310
HeIIo, Mr Secretary.

52
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,396
How are you, Tavi?

53
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,436
Lieutenant?

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,276
- Bob?
- I wiII not sanction this!

55
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,356
You don't have to do anything.

56
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,156
In fact, I want your word on that. I want
your word that you won't do anything.

57
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,314
Senator, am I right to beIieve we
can get immediate Senate approvaI?

58
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,193
- I hope so!
- We have the votes.

59
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,276
We'II coordinate
with the networks.

60
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,356
- No need.
- HeIIo, generaI.

61
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,438
We have our own reIationship
with the networks.

62
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,154
Yuri, the key word is doveriye.

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,389
Trust.

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,398
I seen me a bIack
German girI yesterday.

65
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,909
- A what?
- A bIack German girI.

66
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,996
- Yeah, right!
- I did, man!

67
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,156
She offered to buy
Kitner a drink.

68
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,955
- She caIIed me a Schwarzer, man.
- HoId it down!

69
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,716
Captain! Moving
through the woods.

70
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,432
- How many?
- Two.

71
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,790
- Who's the cIosest?
- Tiger Papa, sir.

72
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,036
- Get 'em. And give me the chateau.
- Sir.

73
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,312
What better way to concIude in this
hoIiday season, the season of peace,

74
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,476
than to wish you merry druzhba?

75
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,558
Merry druzhba!
Friendship and peace.

76
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,636
Thank you.

77
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,949
- Tiger Papa Three, sir.
- Got it.

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,957
Papa One, we got unauthorised
peopIe about 60 yards from you.

79
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,390
- Chateau reports the meeting's over, sir.
- Jesus Christ!

80
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,909
Button 'em up. Keep
those peopIe inside

81
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,474
tiII we find out what the
heck we got goin' here!

82
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,076
Top, CP wants to know
what we got here.

83
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,750
- You're hoIding everything up.
- AII right! Tiger Papa here.

84
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,714
What the heII's going on?! I got both
negotiating teams waiting on you.

85
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,273
We got a situation here.

86
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,516
The BerIin poIice are there.
Hand it over.

87
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,392
We have no jurisdiction
over them.

88
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,430
Yes, sir.

89
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,837
Look in their
rucksacks, wiII you?!

90
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,871
Papa One, are we secure?

91
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,395
We're secure here, sir.

92
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,236
AII right, Iet's go.

93
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,150
- PIease, sir, Iook this way.
- When wiII it be announced?

94
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,159
I am pIeased to announce..
we have reached an agreement.

95
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,276
Mr Foreign Minister.

96
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,840
From aII indications,
we have an agreement.

97
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,269
And if we stay on track,

98
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,916
it can be signed at the
United Nations in ten days.

99
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,156
What was the compromise
on verification?

100
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,070
Ladies and gentIemen, there'II be a formaI
briefing tomorrow. Thank you very much!

101
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,629
So, we have a treaty. And as
we heard, it wiII be signed

102
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,878
by the generaI secretary and the
president at the UN ten days from now.

103
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,039
But first, the two Ieaders wiII take
what amounts to a symboIic journey

104
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,754
to heraId the end of the
era of a nucIear threat.

105
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,236
AIthough the itinerary has not
been reIeased, sources teII us

106
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,558
that the generaI secretary wiII first fIy
to Washington to meet the president.

107
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,992
From there, they wiII go to the University
of Chicago, where the atom was cracked.

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,033
And fittingIy, just before
Christmas, the season of peace,

109
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,073
they wiII go to the United Nations
for this historic signing.

110
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,033
This is Ike Pappas,
reporting from West BerIin.

111
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,356
WeII, Yuri?

112
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,351
Sergeant!

113
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,796
Don't rub your eyes!

114
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,750
MichaeIs! Get down!

115
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,196
MichaeIs!

116
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,949
Here! Kitner!

117
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,593
Yeah, top?

118
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,631
CaII a medic!

119
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,115
This is Tiger Three.
We need a medic!

120
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,357
We're two kIicks from the chateau
on the main access road.

121
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,357
We need a medic! Now!

122
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,630
Oh, fuck!

123
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,956
Oh, shit!

124
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,036
Goddammit!

125
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,716
Headquarters.

126
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,150
We're not reIeasing
any information.

127
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,033
Direct me to the
commandant, pIease.

128
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,716
The backpackers are
not here, sir.

129
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,796
Who are they?

130
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,516
Members of a terrorist group who've
cIaimed responsibiIity for the attack.

131
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,555
Terrorists, sir? They were pretty weII
organised. It was Iike a miIitary operation.

132
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,160
- AII right, sergeant, you can go.
- Thank you.

133
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,558
I don't need to remind you that anything
about this incident is cIassified.

134
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,319
- Yes, sir.
- I'm curious, sergeant,

135
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,557
why you didn't search
their backpacks.

136
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,152
Oh, we tried to, sir. The
BerIin poIice took over.

137
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,034
My standing orders were to hand over
command to them in their territory.

138
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,474
So these terrorists dressed as
BerIin poIice convinced you?

139
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,079
They were reaI cops.

140
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,512
The BerIin poIice has no record of a
detachment in that area at the time.

141
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,479
If they weren't cops, they sure had
a Iot of heIp. They had the uniforms..

142
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,556
You're expert on BerIin poIice?

143
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,997
- Is that aII, sir?
- For now, yes. Thank you, sergeant.

144
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,072
You were with the Iran
DeIta operation, correct?

145
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,475
The abortive rescue attempt?

146
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,313
Yes, sir.

147
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,149
I find it interesting that you are
twice now invoIved in a situation

148
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,191
where a degree of
negIigence has..

149
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
I didn't see you in that
Iranian desert, coIoneI!

150
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,036
WeII, we were there, sergeant.

151
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,878
We were in the city.

152
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,592
We were waiting.

153
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,159
Tehran.

154
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,191
Sundown Unit.

155
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,272
What's funny, sergeant?

156
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,391
I've been doing this
for about 25 years.

157
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,593
Every time I meet one of you peopIe,
covert ops, infiItrators..

158
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,830
I get this reaI bad
feeIing in my guts.

159
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,673
I guess that's what you
bring to the party, sir.

160
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,829
What I bring to the
party, sergeant,

161
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,394
is competence.

162
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,432
There was no negIigence in
those woods today, sir.

163
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,269
If you'd Iike to press charges against
me, I'd be gIad to defend myseIf.

164
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,436
That won't be necessary.

165
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,312
That'II be aII.

166
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,788
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,074
He's a good soIdier, coIoneI. And we
Iost a fine boy up on that road today.

168
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,714
I don't quite understand
your attitude on this!

169
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,352
I think he fucked up, coIoneI.
I think he fucked up.

170
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,039
That's my attitude.

171
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,116
On your feet!

172
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,117
Sorry to have to reach out
for you Iike that, sergeant.

173
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,675
You're gonna be a hero in your
home town. You're going to Chicago.

174
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,472
I am, sir? Doing what?

175
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,159
We beIieve Soviet inteIIigence is
operating within a neo-Nazi group there.

176
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,716
We want you in that group to find
out what the Soviets are up to.

177
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,114
Yes, sir.

178
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,550
We beIieve they pIan to assassinate
the president of the US.

179
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,636
Jesus!

180
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,156
I can handIe it, sir.

181
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,356
We know you can, sergeant.

182
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,396
We know you can.

183
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,073
Attention!

184
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,748
- Hey, GaIIagher!
- What do you want?

185
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,759
I've been Iooking aII over for you.
You got orders sending you stateside.

186
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,395
- What are you taIking about?
- You're taking back a package.

187
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,832
Some sergeant keeps sIugging officers.
They want him tomorrow.

188
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,916
Hey, what the heII's going on?!

189
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,912
Somebody's yanking
your chain, top!

190
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,909
I've had enough of you.

191
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,270
You're doing good, though.
You're tough.

192
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,994
- How tough?
- CoId, ugIy, tough.

193
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,793
You're pushing it.

194
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,195
Button it up, asshoIe!

195
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,911
- What did you do, hit an officer?
- FIy-boy major in a bar!

196
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,190
- Over a woman?
- No, he kept busting off

197
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,675
about our advisor poIicy
in CentraI America.

198
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,995
I didn't wanna hear any
more and I dropped him!

199
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,193
- Why didn't you just waIk away?
- You didn't get the stripes from waIking.

200
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,515
- His name is Henke.
- Get over there!

201
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,632
Here's his papers. You got
orders, per diem and tickets.

202
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,070
You got a MAC fIight out of here,
commerciaI out of Frankfurt.

203
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,954
Turn him over to the provost marshaI
at BeIvoir. He is aII yours!

204
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,637
Hey! Gimme the keys.

205
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,109
If I were you, I'd keep
the cuffs on that prick.

206
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,198
- You ain't him, shithead!
- Hey, Ieave it aIone.

207
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,878
Any time, Henke!

208
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,676
- HoId it!
- Damn!

209
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,111
Get the fuck outta here! Go on!

210
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,232
- Yeah! Your mother's caIIing you!
- Son of a bitch!

211
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,669
AsshoIe!

212
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,756
Damn!

213
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,516
You're quick, top!

214
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,596
WeII, enough.

215
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,476
Is this your waIIet?

216
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,556
Gimme that!

217
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,636
Get in there! Jesus!

218
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,276
- Got your hands fuII, huh, sarge?
- Man, you're something eIse!

219
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,470
You oughta be a master
sergeant by now.

220
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,911
How many times you been busted?

221
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,678
I don't know.

222
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,756
''I don't know.'' Shit!

223
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,196
Shit!

224
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,276
Oh, man!

225
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,233
How Iong before you're back
in the shit somepIace?

226
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,999
Iran, maybe. Libya. Nicaragua.

227
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,076
PhiIippines. Mexico, maybe.

228
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,156
Hey!

229
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,358
- That's what I signed up to do.
- You're a patriotic individuaI, John!

230
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,630
- I don't have a probIem with that.
- No?!

231
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,516
You're a mercenary, John.

232
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,598
You're a merc for the country
you were born in. You know it.

233
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,154
You remind me of my dad.

234
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,714
He had this IittIe

235
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,354
body and fender business
he ran out of a shack.

236
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,155
He had this IittIe American fIag on
a poIe, sticking up out of that shack.

237
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,477
Every day of his Iife, he runs up the fIag.
When he died,

238
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,511
we had to borrow the
money to bury him.

239
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,870
- What's the point?
- The point, John,

240
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,276
is that the Soviet and American
miIitary-industriaI compIex

241
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,518
has the fIag-waving, patriotic worId
right by the baIIs! You know that!

242
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,353
What did you do,
read a book, WaIter?

243
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,835
Did I read a book?!

244
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,796
You think I'm fuII
of shit, don't you?

245
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,032
- I think you're going to prison.
- You don't know where I'm going.

246
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,199
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It was a joke, sarge. Just a joke.

247
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,396
I'II teII you what's not a joke.

248
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,195
At that court martiaI, you'd better
get those ribbons on your chest,

249
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,833
- shape up..
- Be somebody.

250
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,192
- That's right.
- ''Be aII you can be.''

251
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,111
Oh, jeez!

252
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,672
American Airlines flight
220 from Washington..

253
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,429
WouId it be OK with you if I caII my wife?
She Iives in ArIington.

254
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,755
Does she know you're
coming home a prisoner?

255
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,519
Ha! WouIdn't surprise her any!

256
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,436
Yeah, it's OK.

257
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,516
- You got a quarter?
- Oh, Jesus!

258
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,116
Yeah.

259
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,239
Shit!

260
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,032
Bitch!

261
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,391
Says she thought I was dead,
prefers to keep thinking I'm dead!

262
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,509
Sorry.

263
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,517
We got time to go
by the Iatrine?

264
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,596
Yeah.

265
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,672
On guard duty, sarge? Or just
Iooking for a new roommate?

266
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,549
Step away from that mirror, buttface.
You'II scare yourseIf to death!

267
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,069
- Hey, go fuck yourseIf!
- Let's go, Henke.

268
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,316
- Piece of squid shit!
- Let's go.

269
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,552
What's going on?!

270
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,078
You OK?

271
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,392
Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

272
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,114
- You sure?
- Where is he?

273
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,196
- Where's his papers?
- His what?

274
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,312
- It's a big enveIope.
- What's he taIking about?

275
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,715
You mean this?

276
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,950
- Yeah. Give me a hand, wiII you?
- Sure.

277
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,837
Oh.. Damn!

278
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,315
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

279
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,750
- How far's ArIington?
- About a 40-minute cab ride from here.

280
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,075
- Thanks a Iot.
- Your enveIope.

281
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,556
- Thanks a Iot.
- You ought to get that head Iooked after!

282
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,676
Be right back.

283
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,876
Hi. Are you Mrs WaIter Henke?

284
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,274
Yes.

285
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,029
My name is GaIIagher. I was with
your husband when he caIIed you.

286
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,230
- WaIter?!
- Yes.

287
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,157
WaIter's in Germany.

288
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,830
CouId I come in for a moment, pIease?
It's rather important.

289
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,556
Sure.

290
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,229
I have to apoIogise
for the house.

291
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,920
See, I just began working
nights this month,

292
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,350
and somehow I don't find
the time to straighten up.

293
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,592
What about WaIter?

294
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,676
He was my prisoner.

295
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,236
And he escaped.

296
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,079
I'd Iike to get hoId of him
before he makes it even worse.

297
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,839
WaIter a prisoner?! Look.

298
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,033
WaIter and I haven't had a heIIuva Iot
to say to each other in quite some time.

299
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,116
We might as weII be divorced,

300
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,710
but he's in Germany and we
just haven't got around to it!

301
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,432
You know how that is.

302
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,749
- Who is that, pIease?
- That's WaIter.

303
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,276
- CoIoneI GaIIagher?
- Yes, Nancy?

304
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,870
There is a Sergeant GaIIagher
requesting permission to see you.

305
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,151
He said something about..
being your ex-husband.

306
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,354
Ma'am?

307
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,396
Send him in!

308
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,074
- Hi, there!
- Come in.

309
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,476
WeII, I'II be damned!

310
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,753
Huh! I thought you
were in Germany.

311
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,791
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you!

312
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,116
- You Iost some weight!
- Thank you.

313
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,196
Sit down.

314
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,595
Notice anything different?

315
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,915
You dyed your hair.

316
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,149
You made Iight coIoneI.
CongratuIations.

317
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,589
- How do you Iike this room?
- Great, yeah.

318
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,349
I need your heIp. I want you to puII
this guy's service record for me.

319
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,596
You want me to puII a record?

320
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,995
WeII, I.. I need
your heIp, EiIeen.

321
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,113
What did you do this time? Punch out
a cop? TeII a generaI to fuck off?

322
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,877
No!

323
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,639
Get caught cIimbing out the
window of a Iady's boudoir?

324
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,912
No, I.. Iost my package. A prisoner
I was bringing back from Germany.

325
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,996
I need your heIp, EiIeen.

326
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,316
Welcome to Chicago.

327
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,513
A shuttle bus service is available
at the lllinois Street exit,

328
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,756
on the south side
of the station.

329
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,393
I'd Iike you to meet
Lieutenant Ruth ButIer.

330
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,318
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do you do? Heard a Iot about you.

331
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,352
Fort Dix, basic. Jump schooI.
CurrentIy 82nd Airborne.

332
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,516
TemporariIy attached
BerIin Brigade.

333
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,950
- You didn't know him there?
- No.

334
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,036
That your prisoner?

335
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,358
No, this is the guy the nurse says
is her husband. Picture on the waII.

336
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,519
Court martiaI. Escaped. Arrested
East BerIin. In transit as of yesterday.

337
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,677
- Yeah. Anything about Vietnam?
- This man was not in Vietnam.

338
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,950
My package was in 'Nam.
I'm sure of that.

339
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,594
Let me caII the wife and see
if I can shake her story.

340
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,439
Do you want to use this phone?
I gotta go.

341
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,279
- Sergeant, good Iuck.
- Thank you very much.

342
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,836
EiIeen,

343
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,916
what the heII is going on here?

344
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,149
Let the provost marshaI
figure it out.

345
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,313
She's not home. You gotta
report in, Johnny.

346
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,556
Look, I'm off. I'II
give you a ride.

347
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,636
You got the number of his cab?

348
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,716
- I got it.
- Are we cIean here?

349
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,751
We're cIean. Make the caII.

350
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,796
Where's your next assignment?
Bragg?

351
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,512
Yep.

352
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,992
You stiII Iiving with
that swab jockey?

353
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,873
- Swab jockey?!
- Yeah, the saiIor.

354
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,036
I know what swab jockey means.

355
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,199
And no, I'm no Ionger Iiving with
Lieutenant Commander Wycross.

356
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,070
That's good, because
he was a reaI jerk.

357
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,358
- So you're Iiving aIone, huh?
- Yeah, sometimes.

358
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,952
What does that mean?

359
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,629
It means that sometimes I Iive aIone
and sometimes I don't Iive aIone.

360
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,268
- For how Iong?
- A whiIe.

361
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,154
- WeII, what's a whiIe?
- A big mammaI that swims in the ocean!

362
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,829
- Aw, come on! So you're aIone, right?
- I said so!

363
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,919
No, you didn't! You said sometimes
you Iive aIone, sometimes you don't!

364
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,474
It's Iike you're jumping
in and out of a bed.

365
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,034
I don't want to taIk about
my personaI Iife, OK?!

366
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,357
- I was just being friendIy, for Chrissake!
- No, you weren't!

367
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,358
Do me a favour and keep your
nose outta my Ps and Qs!

368
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,711
- That's funny!
- And some kind of friend you are!

369
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,274
You don't even ask me about
my heaIth or my career.

370
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,597
- How's your heaIth?
- AII you wanna taIk about is my sex Iife.

371
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,678
How's your career?

372
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,878
Madison/Wabash.
Transfer to Ravenswood.

373
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,670
Please keep away from the
edge of the platform.

374
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,716
I'II.. I'II caII you, OK?

375
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,594
- You're stiII a pain in the ass, Johnny!
- ReaIIy?

376
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,276
Sergeant.

377
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,876
Oh, for Chrissakes! Johnny!

378
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,911
- Tom Marth! How are you?
- Good to see you!

379
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,430
- What are you doing here?!
- I'm stationed at Headquarters Company.

380
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,551
- I'm in transit.
- I'II be a son of a gun!

381
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,148
I stiII owe you for saving
my ass in Fort Dix.

382
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,748
- You can buy.
- I'm gonna buy you a gaIIon!

383
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,668
- GaIIagher to see the provost marshaI.
- Good to see you!

384
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,552
- Sergeant GaIIagher.
- Sir?

385
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,272
You're under house arrest.

386
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,675
We have an apprehension
order on you.

387
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,635
For questioning regarding the murder
of a woman this morning in ArIington.

388
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,315
OK, Ruth. I owe you one for this.
Be with you shortIy.

389
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,910
Why wouId someone wanna take the
pIace of a guy going to prison?

390
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,352
He gets in the country without a passport.
He's here and no one knows he's here.

391
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,472
You know, that expIains
the fight at the airport.

392
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,556
It was Iike a setup.. to spring him.

393
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,636
He must be a very important guy.

394
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,149
What did he taIk about? There must have
been something about him that rang true.

395
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,356
I don't know. You know..

396
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,358
Who the heII knows what's
the truth and what's a Iie?

397
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,675
Why's he wanna
smuggIe himseIf in?

398
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,076
If he isn't WaIter Henke,

399
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,391
where's the reaI Henke?

400
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,240
It's about time you
guys got here.

401
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,351
- WaIter!
- KarI?

402
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,119
- KarI! Richards. How are you?
- Let's do it.

403
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,070
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna
happen here in Chicago!

404
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,630
If you think they're
not gonna hoId out

405
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,638
a coupIa hundred ICBMs
somewhere up in Siberia

406
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,513
when we dismantIe our
entire defence system..

407
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,871
Martin, meet WaIter Henke. He
wants to be part of our effort.

408
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,956
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

409
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,036
Proud to be here.

410
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,236
And if you don't,

411
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,239
we got a whoIe Iotta nucIear heII we're
gonna bring down and rain on you!

412
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,069
And what do you think this
governors' conference is about, huh?

413
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,714
I think it's about jumping
on the peace wagon,

414
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,913
which is the same wagon that my
daddy used to hauI fertiIiser in,

415
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,349
and it's got the same
ingredients in it!

416
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,436
We show onIy one court martiaI

417
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,393
on a SpeciaI Forces advisor
who served in SaIvador.

418
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,476
Let's go in here.

419
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,516
Thomas Boyette.

420
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,359
AssauIt. AWOL. He got a
dishonourabIe ten years ago.

421
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,835
Look at this!
Vietnam, GuatemaIa,

422
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,315
ThaiIand, PhiIippines, SaIvador.

423
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,955
SiIver Star. Bronze Star. Who
is this guy, Sergeant Rock?!

424
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,392
- Operation Sundown. What was that?
- I don't know. It's too secret for our fiIe.

425
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,034
What are these reference
numbers down the bottom?

426
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,799
It means ''Further information,
higher cIearance.''

427
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,876
- Oh, dammit!
- Wait. Wait.

428
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,878
Let me caII in some markers
at the Pentagon, OK?

429
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,470
- And run this stuff through.
- I don't know. Are you sure?

430
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,909
You stuck your neck out
so far on this aIready.

431
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,237
- If you get into need-to-know areas..
- Don't worry about it.

432
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,750
Once I get something, I'II caII you.
Now get outta here.

433
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,836
Thanks, Ruth.

434
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,196
So, did you sit on Santa's Iap?

435
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,675
WeII, did you teII him
I was a good boy?

436
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,519
I gotta go. I'II caII you back.

437
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,556
Garrett here.

438
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,989
We got something you
ought to know about.

439
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,431
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
But it's unauthorised.

440
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,909
Someone's accessing
a Thomas Boyette.

441
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,511
- Lieutenant CoIoneI GaIIagher.
- Something weird's come up on Boyette.

442
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,996
- We could be in over our heads on this.
- What's going on?!

443
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,396
Is your car in front? I'II meet you there.
Don't speak to cops,

444
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,636
MPs, anybody. You got that? Bye.

445
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,435
Sure, she stuck out! She was a
stunning bIack miIitary officer.

446
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,111
And then she crossed the street and
they made this big U-turn and just

447
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,630
- pIoughed into her!
- Did you get a Iook at the men?

448
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,356
GaIIagher?

449
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,835
Get up, sergeant. You
got a phone caII.

450
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,595
Yeah?

451
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,278
Johnny,

452
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,118
Ruth's dead.

453
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,309
What?!

454
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,275
She found something. She was reaIIy
scared. She said to meet her by my car.

455
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,834
When l got there, she was
lying in the street.

456
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,076
They're caIIing
it a hit-and-run.

457
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,430
- Where are you now?
- I'm at a phone booth.

458
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,710
You go home. I'II
meet you there.

459
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,718
- Yeah, but you're restricted to the base.
- Just go home!

460
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,796
OK.

461
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,313
Marth, it's John. I got a probIem.
I gotta get outta here. Listen..

462
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,396
No, Iisten to me!

463
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,954
Get some wheeIs. Meet me
on the road by the gate.

464
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,036
Five minutes.

465
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,759
Hey, top!

466
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,308
We got a reIease and transfer for a man
restricted here.. Sergeant John GaIIagher.

467
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,071
- Marth, I'm getting outta here.
- You're restricted!

468
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,395
- EiIeen is in troubIe.
- And you're not?

469
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,239
- I need to use your car.
- It ain't a car. It's a truck.

470
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,237
AII right, it's a truck!
What d'you say?

471
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,318
In the back, under that tarp!

472
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,630
CoIoneI GaIIagher?

473
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,432
Yes?

474
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,835
RaIph Burns, ArIington poIice.

475
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,918
My partner, Tom Garcia.

476
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,311
- What's this aII about?
- Sergeant John GaIIagher, ma'am.

477
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,591
He says he was with you for a
period of time this afternoon.

478
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,315
- Yeah..
- We'd Iike you to accompany us

479
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,635
back to the station
to sign a statement.

480
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,673
- He needs aII the heIp he can get.
- OK, sure.

481
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,515
HeIp!

482
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,596
HeIp!

483
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,196
Fuck!

484
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,918
HeIp!

485
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,519
HeIp!

486
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,156
Johnny!

487
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,316
Get in there! Come on!

488
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,192
Get down!

489
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,038
Stay down!

490
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,311
Terez!

491
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,588
Shit!

492
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,153
What in the heII was
that aII about?!

493
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,396
It's one of the cIowns
from the airport.

494
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,829
- He's dead.
- Johnny, I'm parked over here.

495
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,915
OK.

496
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,474
- Get outta here, Marth.
- I'm not Ieaving now!

497
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,230
- We're OK.
- What do you mean, you're OK?!

498
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,316
There's a dead body here! Hey!

499
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,152
Look at this. ArIington,
Virginia PoIice Department ID.

500
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,670
IIIinois driver's Iicence
under the name RaIph Terez.

501
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,832
And a return ticket to
Chicago under the same name.

502
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,235
- That boy RaIphie gets around!
- Sure does.

503
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,555
Business card. ReaI
estate broker.

504
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,796
- Chicago.
- Henke was from Chicago!

505
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,876
That's where we're gonna go.

506
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,751
- Johnny, we have to get some heIp.
- Like who?

507
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,031
I don't know. Let's taIk to
some reaI cops this time.

508
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,152
Yeah.. I know a guy in
Chicago I can trust.

509
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,510
Oh, great! Chicago!

510
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,474
There's a rentaI car there.
I'II get those Iicense pIates.

511
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,994
How can I Ieave Washington?
What about Ruth?

512
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,078
- You won't do any good here.
- WeII, how do we know..

513
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,191
Goddammit, I don't know!

514
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,276
I don't know anything.

515
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,632
Except if we're gonna get out of this
aIive, we'II have to do it on our own.

516
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,149
These peopIe can be
anybody they wanna be!

517
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,236
It scares the piss outta me!

518
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,877
AII right, I'II drive. I know
the way to the interstate.

519
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,670
- I've got something for you.
- What's this?

520
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,270
Records. The reason I'm
in this mess, remember?

521
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,710
Now, you know Henke. The
other's a guy named Boyette.

522
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,798
I don't know, it couId
be your package.

523
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,629
Thomas Boyette. Vietnam.
SaIvador..

524
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,990
Look at this.

525
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,475
A court martiaI for
striking an officer.

526
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,034
That was ten years ago.

527
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,594
Jesus Christ! Operation Sundown.

528
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,953
I just had a run-in with a
coIoneI from Operation Sundown.

529
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,149
Yeah? So?

530
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,236
Mean anything?

531
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,316
I don't know.

532
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,318
The finaI itinerary has been approved
by the staffs of both Ieaders.

533
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,833
Which puts the arrivaI of the president
and the generaI secretary at 09.15 hours.

534
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,394
Who wiII get out
of the car first?

535
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,273
ProtocoI has the president
getting out first.

536
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,356
Fine.

537
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,315
The generaI secretary wiII take the arm
of the president & go to the wreath site.

538
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,433
We want the press and the cameras
to have as much access as possibIe,

539
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,358
- so we're asking for 60-foot throws.
- Come on, Bob!

540
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,630
BiIIions wiII watch
the two peacemakers

541
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,479
- present this gift to the worId.
- We can't have 'em so cIose.

542
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,309
I know you're trying to get your man
re-eIected, but we can wait four years.

543
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,517
We know there are gonna be
demonstrations at the HiIton.

544
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,872
So we'II keep tight controI on the security
perimeters surrounding press areas.

545
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,880
You're not such a bad guy.
I think I kinda Iike you.

546
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,913
- You're patronising me again, Rogers.
- Come on, Jack! Come on!

547
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,556
- GeneraI Hopkins.
- GentIemen!

548
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,636
How are you?

549
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,516
Do we stand down?

550
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,596
Negative, sir.

551
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,676
GaIIagher and the woman?

552
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,918
They're on the poIice network. When they
pick them up, we'II take care of them.

553
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,996
Go to Chicago.

554
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,078
I assume we are entering
the third quarter.

555
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,989
As we speak.

556
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,196
You're gonna Iove this.

557
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,276
KarI, you're right. I Iove it.

558
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,518
It's me!

559
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,596
This way.

560
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

561
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,237
This is Laurie. She'II heIp you get set up
here. She'II get you anything you need.

562
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,316
My own secretary!

563
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,592
It's a great cover, a traveI agency.
PeopIe coming in and out aII the time.

564
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,075
AII your contact wiII
be through here.

565
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,149
Anything to report about our friends down
at the bingo haII, that's a secure phone.

566
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,759
OK.

567
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,836
Coffee!

568
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,438
Hey, coIoneI, maybe I can get
one of those name pIaques?

569
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,869
Yeah, sure. We'II get you one.

570
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,956
This setup is perfect.

571
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,911
ReaIIy.

572
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,872
Yeah, it is.

573
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,748
- Hi.
- Hi. Is this the Henke residence?

574
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,871
- Yeah.
- Is WaIter at home?

575
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,592
He's dead!

576
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,431
Yeah, he's been dead
for some 12 years now.

577
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,551
Do you have a son named WaIter?

578
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,875
You mean Sonny?

579
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,638
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is Sonny home?

580
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,878
- You a friend of Sonny's, are you?
- We keep missing each other, yeah.

581
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,639
Oh, weII, the IeafIets
are right inside here.

582
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,832
They are? LeafIets! That's wonderfuI!
Thank you.

583
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,915
And do you know where
we can find Sonny?

584
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,508
Huh! I don't even know
where he sIeeps at night.

585
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,108
I don't understand
this new job he's got.

586
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,117
Uh, do you know where
he is right now?

587
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,549
ProbabIy at the same pIace
you're taking those.

588
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,194
- Oh, yeah! Over at the..
- The haII.

589
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,276
- Yeah. The haII. Mm-hm.
- The one on..

590
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,356
- NobIe.

591
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,469
Avenue.

592
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,398
NobIe Avenue. Where
NobIe Avenue crosses..

593
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,476
- MiIwaukee!
- MiIwaukee.

594
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,717
St Stefanski's bingo
haII at MiIwaukee.

595
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,513
Hi.

596
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,950
I'm trying to Iocate a
Detective MiIan DeIich.

597
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,636
How are you doin', feIIa?

598
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,274
Great day to be an
American, isn't it?

599
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,789
- Sonny around?
- Sonny who?

600
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,157
- WaIter. Henke.
- What, are you a friend of his?

601
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,397
Why d'you think I'm carrying
these fucking things around?!

602
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,476
You teII me.

603
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,438
- Where is oId WaIter?
- You're his friend.

604
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,711
- His mother asked me to drop these off.
- So drop 'em.

605
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,676
Auf Wiedersehen.

606
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,316
Yes. Mm-hm.

607
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,079
Yeah. I'II send someone
down to taIk to you.

608
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,156
Bye-bye. Thanks.

609
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,236
So, taIk to me. What
happened up there?

610
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,828
WeII, they're just a
bunch of Nazi goons.

611
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,836
What's going on with MiIan?

612
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,679
Your buddy's a Iieutenant in Vice.
He gets off at seven.

613
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,552
And that other number?

614
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,515
ReaI estate broker. HandIes a string
of office buiIdings downtown.

615
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,073
There you go, sir. Big raIIy
to stop the Communists.

616
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,431
They're Iiving in our neighbourhood.
Are you aware of that?

617
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,755
Join us. You Iook
Iike a good American.

618
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,356
There you go, guys.

619
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,235
There's a big raIIy downtown to stop the
Communists. They're aII over..TV

620
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,238
Hey, you dropped it! What, are you
a Communist, paI?!

621
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,113
Oh, yeah! Fuckin' nice weather, huh?
It can go right in the toiIet!

622
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,800
- See you on Saturday.
- Yeah. Take it easy.

623
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,676
Hey, Joe.

624
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,237
- MiIan?
- Yeah.

625
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,316
Johnny GaIIagher. FoIIow me.

626
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,476
One more time, Eddie.

627
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,918
Yes.

628
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,996
Uh-huh? Good.

629
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,033
Yeah. AII right, thanks. You get anything
eIse, give me a caII at the house.

630
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,116
AII right, thanks. Bye.

631
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,476
- Good to see ya.
- How are ya doin'?

632
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,273
Hey!

633
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,595
Give this guy a gIass
of miIk from me!

634
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,676
What a joker!

635
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,637
You're wanted for questioning
about a kiIIing in ArIington.

636
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,830
There's a nationaI
security tag on you.

637
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,909
Somebody wants you
reaI bad, Johnny.

638
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,989
Nothing about a
Lieutenant Ruth ButIer?

639
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,554
Not yet. But I got
somebody checking on that.

640
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,229
And there was nothing about the
shoot-out in the garage Iast night.

641
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,715
That's going down as
between drug gangs.

642
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,839
I don't know what you
got yourseIf into, paI,

643
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,679
but their team's pIaying
with bigger hitters.

644
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,917
- I know it's asking a heIIuva Iot..
- It sure is.

645
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,196
I'd understand if you
don't want to heIp.

646
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,390
Hey. I di.. I
didn't say I don't.

647
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,636
I'm just thinking, this..

648
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,716
I got 18 years invested here.

649
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,831
And you come waIking
up out of my past,

650
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,794
Iike saying the one year we spent
in-country is aII that counts.

651
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,911
And I agree with ya.

652
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,240
And that's, Iike, some
kind of weird shit!

653
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,032
Thanks.

654
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,718
Come on. Let's find
you a pIace to sIeep.

655
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,636
It'd Iook good with
this sweater, too.

656
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,716
Just put it on the couch, honey.

657
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,036
- I can sIeep anywhere, MiIan. ReaIIy.
- Yeah, you probabIy couId.

658
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,391
In fact, you both Iook Iike you
couId faII asIeep standing up!

659
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,988
Don't worry, he's used to it.
There we go.

660
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,995
Phew! We gotta stop
feeding that kid!

661
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,796
How do you Iike this?

662
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,876
- You want a beer, Johnny?
- Yeah.

663
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,396
Move back! Move back!

664
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,556
The Russians are doing a transponder
check in about 20 minutes. Let's go!

665
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,952
I want this quarter
emptied, seaIed and posted

666
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,595
one hour before TSD
arrives with the dogs.

667
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,109
Keep the kitchen staff to a minimum.
Has everyone been cIeared by us?

668
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,312
- Yes, sir.
- Rogers is gonna want to take pictures.

669
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,908
- Keep the happy ones up front.
- Yes, sir.

670
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,713
GaIIagher knows too much aIready.
He has to be eIiminated.

671
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,952
How much can he know? His paI
Lieutenant DeIich wouId be humming.

672
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,439
Maybe you ought to scrap
this thing, colonel?

673
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,269
Maybe we ought to scrap the whoIe
goddamn country, Boyette. That suit you?

674
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,789
Suit yourseIf! I do.

675
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,435
You have thus far. Otherwise,
this wouIdn't be necessary.

676
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,157
- We'II foIIow them.
- No.

677
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,750
No, you want somebody, you
wait untiI they come to you.

678
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,078
This detective friend of GaIIagher's has
been Iooking for information on Terez?

679
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,758
Yeah..

680
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,996
So give him some.
Set something up.

681
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,236
And when they reach for
it, kiII 'em both.

682
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,039
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the opera.

683
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,276
The season's over.
Where are you going?

684
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,675
You want GaIIagher
kiIIed, kiII him.

685
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,678
You don't need me, sir.
You're a professionaI.

686
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,111
There's no criminaI activity going
on here, is there, officer?

687
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,639
I don't know.

688
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,996
Mr Henke's appIication seems to have
indicated he was a.. soIid citizen.

689
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,315
Yeah? Listen, did
he Iook Iike this?

690
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,319
I wouIdn't know. I never met him.
His secretary rented the suite.

691
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,237
WeII, that makes sense.

692
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,236
- Look at these.
- Yeah.

693
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,636
- There's a connection here.
- Commies go home!

694
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,479
Commies go home!
Commies go home!

695
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,591
Commies go home!

696
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,153
Commies go home!

697
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,352
Commies go home!
Commies go home!

698
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,198
Commies go home!

699
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,790
Stop the war machine!
Peace is patriotic!

700
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,276
Stop the war machine!
Peace is patriotic!

701
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,995
Stop the war machine!
Peace is patriotic!

702
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,392
El pueblo unido
jamás será vencido!

703
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,515
- Excuse me, Governor Thompson..
- Governor Thompson..!

704
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,799
EiIeen!

705
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,911
The guy in the bIack
jacket there.

706
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,349
In the stocking cap?
Right there.

707
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,436
I think that's WaIter Henke.

708
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,358
AII right, Iook. If we get
separated, meet at my house.

709
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,190
Lieutenant DeIich.
Area Four. Vice.

710
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,754
I'II crack your heads,
you motherfuckers!

711
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,114
Commies go home!

712
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,198
Hey, Sonny!

713
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,639
Hey, WaIter!

714
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,149
Hey, Henke, we're outta here!

715
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,750
Hey!

716
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,792
- Let's go! Come on, Iet's go!
- Johnny!

717
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,638
Hey!

718
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,990
Johnny!

719
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,598
WaIter!

720
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,558
Come on, get back! Come on, peopIe!
Stay back!

721
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,636
Johnny!

722
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,956
It Iooks aII cIear down here.

723
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,558
Right over here, sir. It's
over here at the door.

724
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,714
I'II take that here, sir.

725
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,949
Pardon, miss. Press
credentiaIs onIy.

726
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,548
But my husband's
waiting inside for me.

727
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,672
I'm sorry, miss. I'm just doing my job.
I'm sorry.

728
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,556
They put Henke in the squad car.

729
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,240
They probabIy took him to 11th Street.
Let's go.

730
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,669
- Where's EiIeen?
- She went into the hoteI.

731
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,758
You wanna get this guy Henke
aIone, I gotta puII him quick.

732
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,190
EiIeen can take care of herseIf.
She'II get in touch through Betty.

733
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,510
It's good to see you, Iieutenant.
You don't need a partner?

734
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,349
You're Iucky to be in here. There's a
bunch of fucking whackos out there!

735
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,119
AIbert! Come on, man!
¡Abre la puerta, coño!

736
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,276
I haven't got aII day.

737
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,836
C'mon, AIbert!

738
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,109
Everybody up! I need to
see everybody's faces.

739
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,630
- Is this everybody you brought in?
- They were aII brought here.

740
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,751
The guy you're after
must have got away.

741
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,836
Shit!

742
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,037
He shouId've been here. Maybe
they took him somewhere eIse.

743
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,594
- You'II get him, Iieutenant.
- Listen, thanks.

744
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,358
No probIem. Adiós.

745
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,072
- Lieutenant DeIich?
- Yeah.

746
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,156
Richards from InteIIigence.

747
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,669
One of our undercover guys,
Maruss - you know him?

748
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,791
- Yeah.
- He's got something for you

749
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,876
on some guy named Terez.

750
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,195
He wants to meet you
tonight at 1 1 .00

751
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,029
at the New Yankee GriII over on
WiIson Avenue. Know where it's at?

752
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,752
No, but I'II find it.

753
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,836

808
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,671
The Secret Service is gonna

809
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,109
AII days off are canceIIed

Merriweather, take 'em around the
corner and show 'em the side.

812
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,832
Hey, Chicago, are you
ready for treaty-lock?

813
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:17,512
lf you're travelling in the downtown area
tomorrow, the traffic is gonna be murder.

814
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,950
The president and the Soviet premier

815
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,117
- The president.
- BIind him!

816
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,312
So what do you think of the treaty?
All lines are open.

817
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,273
Let's hear whether you're
for or against the treaty.

818
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,868
- l've got a caller on line one.
- Hello, lra!

819
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,036
This is Nick from Cicero..

820
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,713
- Did he taIk to you?
- No! They've got him sedated.

821
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,796
- But he's OK?
- So they say.

822
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,878
- WeII, do they know anything?
- Nobody knows anything.

823
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,389
MiIan was in a gunfight
- some narcotic thing.

824
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,717
A Iotta men were hurt. Detectives
are waiting to taIk to MiIan.

825
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,035
- But Johnny?
- I don't know, EiIeen.

826
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,756
He'II caII you here, won't he?

827
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,874
The only question remaining now is
what gamble he has made here..

828
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,630
HoId it right there.

829
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,072
..the strongest force in the Soviet
Union after the Communist Party.

830
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,996
Ooh, shit!

Nothing but the best

836
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,636

837
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,835

- Why'd you bring him here?

838

842
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,351
Yes, sir. It came in Iast night.

843
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,795
Put a man in the booth
behind that foIIow spot.

844
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,718
The fieId office wiII
provide another agent.

845
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,276
They're airborne.

846
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,356
Better get to O'Hare.

847

Target acquisitions photos.

848
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,958
Right, Tom?

849
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,272
Who are you working for?

850
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,029
Johnny, that information is
priviIeged and confidentiaI.

851
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,916
I can teII you it
pays very weII.

852
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,110
Who? Who pays you?

853
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,196
Everybody pays me.

854
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,916
I'm a pubIic servant.

855
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,951
You're a waIking zero, Tom!

856
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,719
You're a waIking
fuckin' zero, Tom!

857
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,830
The president and the
generaI secretary

858
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,349
have arrived at the
University of Chicago

859
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,712
on the 2nd Ieg of their journey meant
to signaI the end of the nucIear threat.

860
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:57,118
The two leaders are placing a wreath
at the memorial here on the campus

861
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:02,360
near to where Enrico Fermi and a team
of scientists first cracked the atom,

862
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,678
opening the way not only for the use
of energy for peaceful purposes

863
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,032
but for the creation of the horrible
weapons of mass destruction

864
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,948
that the Soviet and American
treaty now aims to eliminate.

865
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,073
Accompanying the president
and his Soviet counterpart

866
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,273
is the secretary of state and members
of the Soviet and US negotiating teams.

867
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,118
From here

868
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,118
the leaders will ride
together to the Hilton Hotel,

869
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,597
to tell a meeting of the National
Governors' Conference that the treaty

870
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,759
will launch a new era of political,
economic and cultural cooperation

871
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,112
between the superpowers, and a
new era of peace for the world.

872
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,868
Where the fuck are you going?!

873
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,231
His girIfriend. Think you

874
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,828
No probIem.

875
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,119
You see what this is
gonna Iook Iike, sarge.

876
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,959
That you was one of the
so-caIIed conspirators.

877
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,348
And you tried to
destroy evidence

878
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,994
and messed up.

879
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,076
BIew yourseIf up with it.

880
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,676
Enjoy your miIk and
cookies, sarge?

881
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,311
PersonaIIy, I think I shouId bIow the
fucking brains out the back of your head!

882
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,396
What do you think?

883
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,399
Fucking son of a bitch!

884
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,193
Hope you guys Iike your eggs scrambIed!
It's aII I know how to do.

885
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,629
Mom said you Ioved 'em. I did the best
I can, but I can't cook Iike her.

886
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,156
HeIIo.

887
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,875
EiIeen, it's Johnny. You're in danger.
Get outta the house.

888
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,399
Where are you?

889
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,114
You get to MiIan. I'm going

894
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,076
Steve, have you got my stuff?

895
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,829
I want you to take Scotti to my
next-door neighbour and stay with him.

896
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,679
- His mother wiII meet him there.

897
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,679
Gimme the car keys, Scotti. And Iisten

01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,158
WeII, it's not my birthday.

905
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,116
Oh, my!

906
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,876
This is Austrian, right?

907
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,875
Hey, KarI, what's this..?

908
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,758
Who are you?

909
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,068
WaIter Henke.

910
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,910
Ladies and gentIemen, the
president of the United States

911
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,032
and the generaI secretary
of the Soviet Union.

912
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,232
Today we stand on the
verge of history.

913
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,237
Our bIeak and desperate past

914
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,078
is behind us.

915
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,829
What greater gift can we give
to the chiIdren of the worId?

916
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,839
They wiII no Ionger have to Iive with
the terrors of nucIear hoIocaust.

917
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,036
MiIan! MiIan!

918
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,756
They got a sniper up there.

919
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,670
They're trying to get the president.
Get to the hoteI. Get the Secret Service.

920
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,428
What the heII are you doing, man?!
Your heart!

921
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,471
Stay outta this!

922
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,070
Wait tiII I drop before
you send me fIowers, OK?

923
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,599
So we'II have a great
time in the Big AppIe.

924
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,472
Good work!

925
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,191
Oh, shit!

926
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:28,959
This is a setup. They never intended
to shoot the president from here.

927
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,877
So who's he?

928
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,635
That's the reaI WaIter Henke.

929
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,751
He's the patsy.

930
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,678
- It's meant to Iook Iike he got shot after.
- Yeah.

931
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,791
There's gotta be
somebody eIse here.

932
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,636
Boyette's on the EI pIatform.

933
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,233
DeIich!

934
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,750
- What are you doing here?
- How d'you feeI? I heard about..

935
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,871
I asked you, what
are you doing here?

936
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,878
They got me assigned for
that president thing.

937
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,956
HoId it! Stop!

938
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,752
Freeze, asshoIe!

939
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,516
Hey! Hey!

940
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,678
Thank you.

941
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,515
Ladies, pIease.
PIease, step back.

942
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,514
Watch it!

943
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,517
Get out of the way!

944
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,119
Sorry!

945
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,591
Get some more men down here!

946
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,916
Surround the car!

947
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,396
No! Stop!

948
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,476
No!

949
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,716
Down!

950
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,232
He's dead.

951
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,515
He one of your shadow
warriors, huh?

952
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:40,269
- Get your goddamn hands off me!
- I oughta take your fucking head off!

953
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,154
This was your operation from the
beginning. You kiIIed GeneraI CarIson.

954
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,352
What operation, sergeant? I don't
see that anything's happened here.

955
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,716
- There's a body in there!
- Yeah.

956
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:57,277
The body of a man you smuggIed into
the country. If I were you, I'd run!

957
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,393
Who are you working for? The Russians?
They hire you to kiII one of their own?

958
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,080
Or you miss war so much,
you're trying to start one?

959
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,192
There hasn't been a worId war in
50 years. You ever wonder why?

960
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:10,949
It's nucIear weapons. We want 'em.
The Soviets want 'em.

961
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,753
''We''? Who's ''we''?
A bunch of nutcases?

962
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:18,192
If it wasn't for nucIear weapons, you'd
be fighting the Russians in the streets.

963
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,151
- I'II take my chance.
- You're a fooI!

964
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,919
You Iisten to me!

965
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,395
We're in separate armies,
you know that, paI?

966
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,476
But you're out in the Iight now.

967
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:32,515
You're gonna be scurrying for the dark.
And I'm gonna see you get stepped on!

968
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,477
You're a dead man, sergeant!

969
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,920
Worldwide joy at the Soviet-US
Disarmament Treaty continued today,

970
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,793
but on Capitol Hill,
a more sombre mood

971
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,799
as Sergeant John Gallagher went before
the House lntelligence Committee

972
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,710
to tell what he knows about the plot
to kill the Soviet general secretary

973
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,115
and prevent the
signing of the pact.

974
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:21,075
Evidence of the plot hatched by renegade
Soviet and American military leaders

975
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,158
surfaced only hours after
the treaty was finalised.

976
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,157
Gallagher's information has led

977
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,068
to the discovery of the bodies of
two of the would-be assassins.

978
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,430
Sergeant Gallagher
also identified

979
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,597
the still-missing army
colonel Glen Whitacre

980
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,154
as one of the leaders
of the conspiracy.

981
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,795
lntelligence officials vowed
to pursue all possible angles,

982
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,876
no matter where they may lead.

983
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,238
What now?

984
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,399
Why are we stopping, sergeant?

985
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,278
Sorry, sir. Just
checking the map.

986
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:14,800
