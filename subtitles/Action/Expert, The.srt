22
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,861
Excuse me,

23
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,864
boatman,

24
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,201
how much is the fare to Miura?

25
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,078
The fare?

26
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,747
Exactly what the sign says.

27
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:48,878
I just wondered if you might give
half off or something

28
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,882
to children and the physically impaired.

29
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,135
Why should I give a sturdy-looking
man like you a special discount?

30
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:00,556
What kind of stone-hearted rule

31
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,810
makes no allowance
for the physically impaired?

32
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,561
Those are the regulations.

33
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,480
If you don't like it,
you don't have to ride.

34
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,816
Move along, will you?
You're holding up the others.

35
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,945
If you can't treat crippled folk
better than that,

36
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,697
don't be surprised

37
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,950
if the gods throw a storm at you
and capsize your boat.

38
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,413
Watch out!

39
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,016
Thanks. That was close.

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,643
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,770
I'm much obliged to you, sir.

42
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,106
I guess the world isn't filled
entirely with demons.

43
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,025
Ouch.

44
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,404
Many pardons.

45
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,823
Hey, help him aboard.

46
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,742
Much obliged.

47
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,370
All aboard!

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,208
All aboard!

49
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,961
Wait for me. Wait for me.

50
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,275
Damn!

51
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,737
We just missed it.

52
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:44,827
The boat from here to Miura
runs only once every five days.

53
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,542
So we either wait four days,
or we go by land.

54
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,169
Ino,

55
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,256
you're sure you saw Otane?

56
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,718
I already told you,
I didn't actually see her.

57
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,182
I saw her straw hat hanging outside
the window at an inn in Chikura.

58
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,393
When I later asked at the desk,
they told me she'd left.

59
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,522
She said she was going to take
the boat from Tateyama to Miura.

60
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,441
So assuming it really was Otane,

61
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,195
the question is
how far do we try to pursue her?

62
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,613
What do you think?

63
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,748
Uh-oh. Looks like we're too late.

64
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,417
Too bad. Too bad.

65
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,796
What a shame!

66
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,257
When will the next boat be?

67
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,887
Not for four days?

68
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:47,974
You could cross to Uraga instead.
Where are you headed?

69
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,727
- Hakone.
- Going to the hot springs?

70
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,354
In that case,

71
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,108
I'd suggest going by land to Edo
and taking the Tokaido highway.

72
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,528
It may be the long way around,
but you won't have to wait.

73
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,030
What do you think?
- That's probably a good idea.

74
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,242
If you wait here
and a storm rolls in,

75
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,870
a five-day wait
could easily become ten.

76
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,514
Everybody ready?

77
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,058
I'd like to join you, if I may.

78
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:37,565
And I wonder if you'd be so kind
as to let me take the dice cup.

79
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,026
As a guest dealer.

80
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,822
Are you sure you can
handle the cup like that?

81
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,159
Well, you see,

82
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:52,955
I don't have much of an eye
for most amusements.

83
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,919
Don't have much of an eye?
That's funny.

84
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,007
But for some reason,
I can see the dice in a cup.

85
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,926
What do you say?

86
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,971
Don't you think it's worth seeing
what I might be able to do?

87
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,806
Go ahead.
You take the cup.

88
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,559
Thank you very much.

89
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,024
Here you go.

90
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,444
Now everyone,
don't forget I'm blind.

91
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,822
I ask you to overlook my clumsiness.

92
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,741
Is everyone ready?

93
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,206
Place your bets.

94
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,709
Ah, yes, excellent
handling of the cup.

95
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,296
All right, I say even.

96
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,175
- Even.
- Odd.

97
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,970
Is that everyone?

98
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,140
You've got 175 <i>mon</i> on even.
And 50 <i>mon</i> on odd.

99
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,936
Is that all people are betting?

100
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,855
Very well.

101
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:00,898
What do we have?

102
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,608
Three and six, odd.

103
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,701
Here you go.
You've won 125 <i>mon</i> for starters.

104
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,286
I guess you really can see
what's in the cup.

105
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,624
- Then, may I continue?
- Go ahead, go ahead.

106
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,168
All right, everybody ready?

107
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,468
Place your bets everyone.

108
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,930
You're sure you want us to bet on this?

109
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,726
Oh, yes, absolutely.
Place your bets.

110
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,228
Go ahead. Place your bets.

111
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,856
This is amusing.
I think I'll bet too.

112
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,691
I'm betting on even.

113
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,527
Even.

114
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,447
Huh?
Everybody's betting on even?

115
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,032
No one wants to bet on odd?

116
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,242
No one wants odd.

117
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,788
300, 215, 210, 200, 250, 150 -
all on even.

118
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:02,460
So altogether that's
one <i>kan</i> and 325 <i>mon.</i>

119
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,881
My, my, you've all really
raised the stakes this time.

120
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,841
I like that.

121
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,468
What do we have?

122
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,097
Five and one, even.

123
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,016
Did you say even?

124
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,310
No question about it.

125
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,690
So it's even.
That's a surprise.

126
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,818
I guess I can't really
see the dice after all.

127
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,987
It was even.

128
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,075
If I may, I was in for 300,

129
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,786
so I get 600 back.

130
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:40,122
- Hey, I was in for 200.
- Relax. You'll all get yours.

131
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,459
What do you say, mister?
Ready to call it quits?

132
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,504
No, no. I have more.

133
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,756
Hold on just a second.

134
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,383
Here it is.

135
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,346
My goodness!
Twenty-five <i>ryo!</i>

136
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,474
Please now, everyone loosen up
your purse strings.

137
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,685
Here are the dice.

138
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,396
And here's the cup.

139
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,740
Everybody ready?
Here goes.

140
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:20,704
All right, place your bets.
No need to hold back.

141
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,832
All right,
I'm going for broke this time.

142
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,835
Even.
- I'm betting on even, too.

143
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,672
- Even.
- All right, even.

144
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,590
Three hundred on even.

145
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:39,431
Everybody's betting on even again.

146
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,561
Why doesn't anybody bet on odd?

147
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,355
I guess sometimes
the wind blows a certain way,

148
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,233
and that makes everyone
prefer the same bet.

149
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,278
Because of the wind, you say?

150
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,156
Well, if you're all sure
there are no mistakes,

151
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,700
let's see what we have.

152
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,500
Naughty dice! When did you
jump out of my sleeve?

153
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,003
- Hey! What're you -
- What do we have?

154
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,801
Even or odd?

155
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,724
So it's odd?

156
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,603
I guess the dice
didn't feel that wind.

157
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,398
That means all this comes to me.
Thank you very much.

158
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,526
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it a second.

159
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,237
- Is there a problem?
- Something's not right here.

160
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,324
The dice came up odd, didn't they?

161
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,742
That means I win.

162
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,495
What happened to those dice
you put in your sleeve?

163
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,957
They're still right here.

164
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,503
You tricked us,
you son of a bitch.

165
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,588
Me?

166
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,341
Hey, everyone,
this guy's a pro at sleight of hand.

167
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,762
Don't think you can get away with
that "jumped out of my sleeve" crap.

168
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,140
You deliberately made
those two dice fall out of the cup.

169
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:06,101
This bastard used four dice
to play a trick on us.

170
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,646
Now hold on just one second.

171
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,106
Are you telling me

172
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:16,278
you all bet on the dice
that were outside the cup?

173
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,532
What kind of dice game would that be?

174
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,160
When you're gambling with dice,

175
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,830
you're supposed to bet
on the dice in the cup.

176
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,291
Isn't that right?

177
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,919
You son of a bitch.

178
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,504
Damn you!

179
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,968
Do you people think

180
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,054
you can take advantage of me
because I'm blind?

181
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,227
Now then, miss,

182
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:53,399
I believe you tucked some treasure
away in a sweet little spot.

183
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,572
Bastard!

184
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,452
If you're that attached
to the money you lost

185
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:51,749
you can have my show money
as your banker's fee.

186
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,471
Blind man.

187
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,432
You handle yourself very well.

188
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,648
Sighted people are always
trying to take advantage of me,

189
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,694
and giving me a lot of grief.

190
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,617
If I'm not mistaken,

191
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:31,372
aren't you the kindly samurai
who rescued me

192
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,332
when I nearly fell in the water?

193
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,003
Hardly worthy of the name, I'm afraid.

194
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,510
So you play <i>shogi</i> chess, do you?

195
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,513
As a matter of fact,

196
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,350
I'm really very fond of chess myself.

197
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,604
Perhaps you would let me
challenge you to a match?

198
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,274
Sure.

199
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,528
Great. Thanks.

200
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,698
So tell me,
what name do you go by?

201
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,159
My name is Ichi.

202
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,621
Isn't Ichi what they call

203
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,541
any blind masseur of a certain rank?

204
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,211
In my case,
it's also my real name.

205
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,046
Well, then,

206
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,174
if your real name is Ichimatsu,
they call you Matsu no Ichi,

207
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,052
and if it's Ichitaro,
they call you Taro no Ichi.

208
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,805
That's true,

209
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,393
but I was always just called Ichi
from the time I was little

210
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:39,440
so Ichi is really
the only name I know.

211
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,402
In other words,

212
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,239
you're just plain old Ichi.

213
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,909
All right, then.

214
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,454
Plain Old Ichi.

215
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,206
Let's see who goes first.
Throw these pieces.

216
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:17,019
We're not going to forget this,
you son of a bitch!

217
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,403
Bishop to five-seven.

218
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,575
My surname is

219
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,454
Jumon.

220
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:40,876
- Jumon?
- Actually, Jumonji.

221
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,711
Given name, Tadasu.

222
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,924
Master Tadasu Jumonji.

223
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,176
That's an unusual name.

224
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,637
It's an assumed name.

225
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,849
Perhaps for a man
on a mission of vengeance?

226
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,518
Wait a second.

227
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,314
This move will just get me captured.

228
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,608
Well, never mind.

229
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,320
Gold to five-seven.

230
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,323
You're not going
to get me that easily.

231
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,995
So you fend off disaster
by the skin of your teeth.

232
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:22,793
I suppose I'll strike right back then.

233
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,004
Rook to same.

234
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:35,973
Plain Old Ichi,
you seem to have slipped up.

235
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,319
Wait, I take it back.

236
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,363
That's not allowed.

237
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,409
We agreed on that
at the beginning.

238
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,167
Checkmate.

239
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,395
ENOSHIMA

240
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,529
STRIKE STRAW HAT, 10 <i>MON</i>
BREAK PLATE, 20 <i>MON</i>

241
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,573
WITH GENUINE BLADE,
100 <i>MON</i>

242
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:04,561
<i>The colors blossom</i>

243
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,899
<i>Scatter and fall</i>

244
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:17,908
<i>But after spring passes</i>

245
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:25,540
<i>They flourish again</i>

246
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:32,005
<i>That's right</i>

247
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:42,933
<i>Birds soar high</i>

248
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,978
<i>In the blue sky</i>

249
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:00,033
Boss, a traveling masseur
was passing by, so I stopped him.

250
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,588
<i>Here you go.</i>

251
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,508
Masseur.

252
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,804
The boss of the Banyu family
is a sworn brother of mine.

253
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:25,475
And I hear you had a little run-in
with some of his men

254
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,728
aboard the boat from Tateyama.

255
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,815
The Banyu family?

256
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,362
I see. So those fellows
belonged to the Banyu family.

257
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,156
Is that right?

258
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,908
Perhaps we did have
a tiny little encounter.

259
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:45,078
So it really was you.
Well, well.

260
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,414
You son of a bitch.

261
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:55,756
If I don't repay your kindness,
I'll be failing my duty to my brother.

262
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,799
Just a tiny little payback.

263
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,552
Take that!

264
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,304
Don't try to resist.

265
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,848
We're not asking you
to pay with your life.

266
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,934
We just want to make sure
you don't play that trick again.

267
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,707
Are you all right, Miki?

268
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,292
EJIMAYA

269
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,425
I beg your pardon.

270
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,971
Is she hurt?

271
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,809
ENOSHIMA MISAKIYA INN

272
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,160
Bishop to two-four.

273
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,290
Bishop to two-four.

274
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,126
I see.

275
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,671
So you strike only when
you have no other choice.

276
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,049
Otherwise,
you never draw your sword.

277
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:07,012
That's right.
I try to avoid needless killing.

278
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,017
And you?
Do you take a different approach?

279
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,604
I kill to kill.

280
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,189
Silver to four-five.

281
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,609
Silver to four-five.

282
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,070
All right. Rook to seven-four.

283
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,951
You kill just for the sake of killing?

284
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,496
No. I kill to win.

285
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,916
To defeat anyone stronger than me.

286
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:41,087
To defeat anyone stronger than you
in swordsmanship?

287
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,882
Not just swordsmanship.

288
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,927
Even in something like chess?

289
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,475
Even in chess, depending on
time and circumstance.

290
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,270
You sound like a dangerous man.

291
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,694
Wait a second.

292
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,073
This isn't really an even contest.

293
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:14,120
Since you can't see the board
and I can,

294
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,540
it can't be a fair fight.

295
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,168
All right.

296
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,594
I'll play without looking
at the board either.

297
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,932
That'll make us even.

298
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,772
Let's see.

299
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,527
Pawn to five-four.

300
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,570
Pawn to five-four?

301
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,282
Pawn to five-four, you say.

302
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,661
Pawn to same.

303
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,038
Pawn to same, is it?

304
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,627
Gold to seven-seven.

305
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,214
Gold to seven-seven.

306
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,637
In that case, let's see.

307
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,808
Pawn to three-six.

308
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,311
Pawn to three-six?

309
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,399
Rook to five-nine.

310
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,585
Ichi,

311
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,005
you're amazingly quick.

312
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:53,762
I figured they were after me,
but it appears I was wrong.

313
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,891
Were they both Banyu men?

314
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,018
So it would seem.

315
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,188
Well, sooner or later

316
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,857
that game probably
would have ended up a draw

317
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,151
since I was playing blindfolded.

318
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,862
If I had won,

319
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,866
would that mean
you'd have to cut me down?

320
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,369
I don't kill opponents I like.

321
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,622
If I killed them,

322
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:24,334
there soon wouldn't be
anyone I liked left.

323
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,211
Somebody, please!

324
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,089
Please tell me where
I can find a doctor.

325
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,759
This child is running a high fever
and having convulsions.

326
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,970
I'm afraid she's going to die.
I need to get her to a doctor.

327
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,973
Someone please tell me
where I can find a doctor!

328
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,767
Excuse me.

329
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,979
Good grief!
She's burning up.

330
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,815
The doctor's a long way away
and it's late,

331
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,650
so he's not much use
in an emergency.

332
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,028
But we happen to have
a shaman here tonight

333
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:56,533
to exorcise one of the maids
who's been possessed by a fox.

334
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,743
The woman used to be a doctor
of the Chujo School,

335
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,204
so perhaps we can ask her
to take a look at the girl.

336
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,581
Yes, please.

337
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,968
How does she look?

338
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,263
It's clearly a case of tetanus.

339
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,516
The poison got in
through her wounded foot.

340
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,434
Tetanus can be fatal.

341
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,438
If it's not treated in time,
the child could die.

342
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,440
Then please tell me,

343
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:32,777
what's involved in treating it?

344
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:37,574
First is medicine, second is medicine,
and third is prayer.

345
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,786
We beg you, O great god Okuninushi,
O great god Sukunahiko,

346
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,789
please bring your powers to bear
and heal this child.

347
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,629
And the medicine?

348
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,633
If we can get it quickly,
the child will survive.

349
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,720
But I'm afraid this medicine -

350
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,139
Yes?

351
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,850
I know where
it can be obtained, but -

352
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,937
How much does the medicine cost?

353
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,608
For a full round, it'll be this much.

354
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:17,447
I'm sorry, but I'm blind.

355
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,824
Please go ahead
and say the amount aloud.

356
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,621
A full round costs five <i>ryo.</i>

357
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,374
There's a druggist in Odawara
called Tochinko who has it.

358
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,544
It's a powerful medicine
imported from overseas.

359
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,589
Five <i>ryo.</i>

360
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,551
Master!
She's turned violent again!

361
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,137
The fox must have
possessed her again.

362
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,474
Please hurry back to her,
Widow Tarozaemon!

363
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,280
Ma'am, please set your mind at ease.

364
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,617
I will obtain the medicine for her.

365
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,287
Thank you, sir,

366
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:10,208
but I could never ask you to do that.

367
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,461
You mean you want to let her die?

368
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:18,716
She got hurt because of a scuffle
I was involved in.

369
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,552
No. You mustn't.

370
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:26,641
It's nothing, really.
These fingers of mine

371
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,727
can earn the cost of the
medicine in no time at all.

372
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,354
Excuse me, then.

373
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,940
Where are you going?

374
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:37,485
I understand some of the pilgrims
at Iwamoto Temple

375
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:41,114
like to play a little dice
amongst themselves.

376
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:46,828
But what if the Banyu men
decide to come after you again?

377
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,329
Not to worry.

378
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,712
I'll go along
as Master Ichi's bodyguard.

379
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,506
I'll make sure nobody
lays a finger on him.

380
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,217
Shall we go?

381
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,137
See you later.

382
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,147
Here goes then.

383
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:31,039
Just so you know,
I have more money here.

384
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,167
This is all the money
I have to my name,

385
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,503
so bet however much you want.

386
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,965
How much you got there, mister?

387
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,217
About four <i>kan</i> 500.

388
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,971
Four <i>kan</i> 500?
Wow! This blind man's got balls.

389
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,016
This is no time for us
sighted folk to be timid.

390
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,225
700. Even.

391
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,393
One <i>kan</i> 200.

392
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,020
- 500.
- One <i>kan.</i>

393
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,189
- I'm in for 800.
- 500 more to go.

394
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,900
- I'll put in 200.
- I'll take the rest.

395
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:02,904
We've got it.
Four <i>kan</i> 500, all on even.

396
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,740
Huh?
You're all betting on even?

397
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,575
That's right, all on even.

398
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,911
No one wants to bet on odd?

399
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,996
Why would we bet on odd when -

400
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,082
All the money's on even.

401
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,209
Very well.

402
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,003
Let's see what the dice say, then.

403
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,259
Naughty little dice.

404
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:28,096
Hold on a second.
What're you doing with those?

405
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,517
They must have fallen out of my sleeve.

406
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,352
You've got to be kidding!

407
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,354
Kidding?

408
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:40,483
I thought this was a game of dice.

409
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:46,864
In a game of dice,
you bet on the dice in the cup.

410
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,701
Why would anyone bet on dice
outside the cup?

411
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,121
That'd be a pretty silly game.

412
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,705
But you -

413
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,293
Did you think
you could take advantage of me

414
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:02,046
because I'm blind?

415
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,552
Now then,

416
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,388
I believe you all
placed your bets on even.

417
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,890
Let's see what we have, shall we?

418
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,575
Thank you very much.

419
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,243
Wait.

420
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,495
It's even.
- Even?

421
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,291
That's right.
Same as the other dice.

422
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,626
Three and one, even.

423
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,767
Are you convinced now?

424
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,853
Let's divvy this up then.

425
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,438
I was in for 800.

426
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,774
Wait your turn.

427
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,985
My bet was one <i>kan</i> 500.

428
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,738
One <i>kan</i> 300 over here.

429
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,128
I don't get it.

430
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,716
I've been in this racket a long time,

431
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:32,303
but I just don't get it.

432
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,389
It seems unlike you,
to be dwelling on it so endlessly.

433
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,974
Pull yourself together.

434
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,436
All you have to do
is get some new capital,

435
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,356
come back tomorrow
and win fair and square.

436
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,984
The question is
how to get that capital.

437
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,819
I have a way.

438
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,991
The fair at Yugyo Temple
in Fujisawa starts tomorrow.

439
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,744
I'll let you have the space I reserved.

440
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,121
You'll make ten <i>mon</i>
per head bashing.

441
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,958
You can earn your capital there.

442
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,378
You want me to sit in your place

443
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,673
and get bashed on the head
for ten <i>mon</i> a pop?

444
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,178
So that's it.

445
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,808
That's why you chose an alias
that means ten <i>mon.</i>

446
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,560
Because you go around

447
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,354
letting people bash you
on the head for that much.

448
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,356
That's very clever.

449
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:30,027
No, you're not going to sit there
and get your head bashed.

450
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,238
We'll try something different.

451
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,574
Such as?

452
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,163
That.

453
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,834
Wow! That's amazing.

454
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,295
Here! Catch that!

455
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:08,357
All right. Everybody ready?
Here goes.

456
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,737
Place your bets.

457
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,405
Even.

458
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,451
That's 15 <i>kan</i> on even.
Any others?

459
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,120
Anyone for odd?
- Odd.

460
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,581
What do we have?

461
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,958
Five and two, odd.

462
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:45,978
TOCHINKO

463
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,151
Here you are, sir.

464
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,830
Uncle Ichi.

465
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,750
Hey there.

466
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,879
You're awake.

467
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,591
How's your fever?

468
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,677
It's all gone.

469
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,806
Good.
Then you're going to be all right.

470
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,143
Once the fever breaks,
you know you're okay.

471
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,480
I have an idea.

472
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,692
Let's go to the hot springs in Hakone.

473
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:30,072
They say the waters there
are good for anything that ails you.

474
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,657
Okay.

475
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:36,453
I'm so glad you got better so quickly.

476
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,416
You're a lucky girl.
- Uh-huh.

477
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,755
Uncle Ichi.

478
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,676
Uncle Ichi.
- What is it?

479
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,469
Uncle Ichi.

480
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:54,805
What is it?

481
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,899
Uncle Ichi, thank you.

482
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,093
ENOSHIMA

483
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,552
ODAWARA

484
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,387
HAKONE

485
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:45,999
Excuse me, gentlemen.

486
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,584
Don't worry about it.

487
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,550
Hold it.

488
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,219
Don't move.

489
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,889
Are you speaking to me?

490
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,642
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

491
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,019
Now pull back your right foot
very slowly.

492
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:18,115
Look at this.
That was close.

493
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:21,869
Oh, wow.
Thank you very much.

494
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:24,538
- Be careful now.
- I'm very grateful, sir.

495
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,206
That was lucky.

496
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,375
- You're not kidding.
- You've got to be careful.

497
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,087
You never know what dangers might be
lurking around when you can't see.

498
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:45,934
Hey, Roppei.

499
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,273
Let me give you a hand.

500
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,193
Thanks, but I'll be just fine.

501
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,321
It's slippery.

502
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,950
You're very kind.
If you don't mind, then.

503
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,170
Thanks.

504
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,923
You have a very nice master.

505
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:18,342
Thank you, sir.

506
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:25,974
May I?

507
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,855
Did you take little Miki to the baths?

508
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,900
Yes, it was her first time.

509
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,569
She's going to be fine,
all thanks to you.

510
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,404
Do come in.

511
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:50,165
I haven't had a chance
to ask you this before now,

512
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,252
but why are you on the road?

513
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:57,381
Are you on a pilgrimage
of some kind?

514
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,349
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

515
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,769
No, I don't mind.

516
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:14,815
Little Miki's father

517
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:18,902
was a close relative of mine.

518
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,406
He served at a shrine
on Mt. Tsukuba, but -

519
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,951
Served at a shrine?
You mean he was a priest?

520
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,536
Yes.

521
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:33,125
But then somehow or other
he got caught up in this.

522
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,419
Oh, I'm sorry.

523
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,421
I suppose you mean this?

524
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:39,006
Yes.

525
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,550
He went bad.

526
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:45,012
In the end he got tangled up
in a turf war

527
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,682
and got himself killed.

528
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:52,269
What was his name?

529
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,688
Shodayu Tsukuba.

530
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,858
Shodayu Tsukuba.

531
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:02,571
I'm sure you've never heard of him.

532
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,992
He was just one of the thugs
killed in the fracas.

533
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,162
There's no reason
anyone would know his name.

534
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:13,957
He was a common thug hardly worth
more than a piece of trash.

535
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,668
His wife had run out on him,

536
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:21,089
so this child, who was with
a foster family, was left all alone.

537
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,842
And I'm her closest relative.

538
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,053
I see.

539
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,013
And then?

540
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,893
I had never had any luck
finding a husband,

541
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,396
and I was working at Monzencho
on Mt. Tsukuba at that time.

542
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,981
<i>Hello?</i>

543
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:39,775
Do you know it?

544
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:43,236
Yes, a town bustling
with pilgrims to Mt. Tsukuba.

545
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,031
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Can somebody help me?</i>

546
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:49,493
That's right. I was working
as a maid in a tea house there.

547
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,579
But I decided I'd take care
of the child myself.

548
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,040
I taught her to sing
and dance a little, and -

549
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:59,002
<i>Can someone help me?</i>
<i>Is anybody here?</i>

550
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,879
Please excuse me a minute.

551
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,842
Who's there?

552
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,598
Would you know
where the innkeeper is?

553
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,354
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't.

554
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:21,858
I was directed here
at the Kamasaku Inn up the way.

555
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,276
Two of their guests,

556
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,822
Tomonoshin Sagawa
and his servant Roppei,

557
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,408
apparently came down here
for the baths.

558
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:33,286
I need to see them immediately
about a very urgent matter.

559
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:39,376
Well, the baths are
right down these stairs,

560
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:44,756
but since there's no one
at the desk, I don't know -

561
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:48,718
But I suppose I could go
and check for you myself.

562
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,303
I'm much obliged.

563
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,032
I found them.

564
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,330
- Is that you, Kume?
- Why are you dressed like that?

565
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,252
The road can be a dangerous
place for a woman.

566
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:25,589
I thought I'd run into fewer problems
if I dressed like this.

567
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:31,595
But tell me, brother,
how are you feeling?

568
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,432
At one point, I nearly gave up hope,

569
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:38,351
but Roppei took good care of me
and pulled me through.

570
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:41,354
We were low on funds,
the illness was dragging on

571
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:43,148
and I really didn't know what to do.

572
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:46,526
That's why I sent you the messenger.

573
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,237
Sorry to have made you worry.

574
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:53,867
And what about the person
you were looking for?

575
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,918
Nothing?

576
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:05,587
No leads at all?

577
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,385
Would you have
a straw hat or raincoat?

578
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:14,930
A straw hat!

579
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:29,110
Here, sir.

580
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:34,533
- Please take this.
- Thank you.

581
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,368
You're very kind.

582
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:51,383
KAMASAKU

583
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:20,161
It was very kind of you to lend us this.

584
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,707
Don't mention it.
It was nothing.

585
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,627
The young miss asked me
to convey her thanks too.

586
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:29,379
The young miss?

587
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:33,091
That is, I mean,

588
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,928
the master's recovery at long last

589
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:39,556
must be due to the efficacy
of the waters here.

590
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,393
But it certainly does get cold
here in the mountains, doesn't it?

591
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:44,603
Yes, it certainly does.

592
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:46,646
I think there was a scene
in the play <i>Revenge at Hakone</i>

593
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,398
where one of the characters says,

594
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,650
"We're deep in the mountains here

595
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:52,944
where snow comes before the leaves fall.

596
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:54,487
You must have been unbearably cold."

597
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:56,406
That's right.
That's exactly what this is.

598
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,992
We're at least hoping
to leave before it snows

599
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,202
and head farther south
where it's warmer.

600
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:04,664
Now that my girl
is finally on her feet again,

601
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:07,083
I expect we'll be leaving soon too.

602
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,836
Oops, I mustn't be dawdling here.

603
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,382
I need to get my hundred prayers in
before the rain starts again.

604
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:17,010
Praying for your master's recovery?

605
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,387
That's right.

606
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:22,515
Seems like there was something
else he asked me to do.

607
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:25,602
What could it have been?

608
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,107
That's it!
The blind acupuncturist.

609
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:35,195
My master says your treatment
worked wonders.

610
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:38,365
He'd like you to come
and give him another.

611
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:39,532
Is that right?

612
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:41,326
- Can you go right away?
- Sure.

613
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:42,952
Please do, then.

614
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,871
Thanks.

615
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:49,125
- Please give him my regards.
- Thank you for your business, sir.

616
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,683
Sorry,

617
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:07,560
but I happened to overhear.

618
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:10,397
You say you expect
to be leaving soon?

619
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,940
Yes.

620
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:15,402
We can't go on relying
on your hospitality forever.

621
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,450
What happened was all my fault
to begin with.

622
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,869
Haven't I told you
that you mustn't feel that way?

623
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,705
Forgive me.

624
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,501
Please.

625
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:36,756
Couldn't you put off your departure
a little longer?

626
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:44,139
You see, I'm concerned about
how you two will get by on the road,

627
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,224
and I'd like to be able to give you

628
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:50,812
three or five <i>ryo</i>
for your travel needs.

629
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:53,565
Otherwise,

630
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:58,778
I know it's going to weigh
terribly on my heart.

631
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:00,947
That's very good of you,

632
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:06,202
but it's not as if you hurt the child
with your own hands.

633
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,704
What?

634
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,960
I told you not to say that.

635
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,713
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

636
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,550
The thing is,

637
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,386
I'm fond of Miki.

638
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,346
Fond?

639
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,016
I'm very fond of her.

640
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,811
Of Miki?

641
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,025
Master Ichi?

642
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:40,403
Only her?

643
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,239
Only her?

644
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,576
Auntie Otane,

645
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:49,621
it's raining again.

646
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:52,665
HUNDRED-PRAYER STONE

647
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:48,054
Excuse me,

648
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:51,683
but could you not make noise
while I'm doing this?

649
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:54,227
You don't want to startle me
at the wrong moment.

650
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,812
Right, miss?

651
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,823
Miss?

652
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,741
Can you see?

653
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,746
Not at all, sir. I'm blind.

654
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,250
Are you telling me
a blind man sees men as women?

655
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:19,544
No.

656
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:25,383
A blind man sees men as men
and women as women.

657
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:28,261
We see with the eyes of our heart.

658
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:31,764
And in the eyes of your heart,
Kume is a woman?

659
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:34,684
Indeed, sir.
Not only is she a woman,

660
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,270
she is a very beautiful woman.

661
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:41,399
- As if you could tell.
- No, it's true.

662
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,026
Now then,

663
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:46,613
we have a young lady
dressed as a man -

664
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,200
Oh, I see.

665
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,995
So that's the story.

666
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,580
What?

667
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,374
What's the story?

668
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:04,130
The story that I see
with the eyes of my heart

669
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,675
is a story of revenge.

670
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:10,053
You are on a mission
of vengeance.

671
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:11,471
What?

672
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,015
<i>- Master!</i>
<i>- Some officers from Odawara.</i>

673
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,392
<i>They say they're investigating a crime.</i>

674
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,312
A man was killed on the temple grounds

675
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:22,023
while conducting
a hundred-prayer ritual.

676
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,400
It seems the man may be the retainer

677
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:27,403
of a samurai staying at this inn.

678
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:34,744
Roppei! Roppei!

679
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:41,000
There's no sword wound.
He appears to have been strangled.

680
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:44,045
The marks on his neck suggest

681
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:48,675
the use of some kind of string or wire,

682
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,511
but it's hard to say exactly what.

683
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:10,071
Go white, go white.

684
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:12,407
Go red, go red.

685
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,326
Go black, go black.

686
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,501
Quiet!

687
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,298
If you don't simmer down, I'll -

688
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,399
What's this?

689
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,943
It's a float. For fishing.

690
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:53,906
A bright red float.

691
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,742
Bright red?

692
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:58,494
Was it a present from someone?

693
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:02,665
No, we found it
in the pond at the temple.

694
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:21,684
Begin.

695
00:59:22,894 --> 00:59:26,898
<i>In east -</i>

696
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:30,276
No, that's wrong.
We're starting at two.

697
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,904
You started at three just now.
One more time.

698
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,114
One and -

699
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:38,993
<i>In eastern</i>

700
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:41,245
<i>Kazusa</i>

701
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,920
Oh, my,
the rain's splashing in again.

702
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,464
When's it going to end?

703
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:46,602
What's the matter?

704
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:49,230
Nothing.

705
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:51,858
Is something wrong?

706
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:53,943
No, everything's fine.

707
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,571
The bath felt great.

708
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,032
Good to hear.

709
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,744
How about a match?

710
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,664
Win, lose, lose.

711
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:09,417
You have two losses
to only one win.

712
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,087
Maybe we should leave it that way.

713
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,175
It could get scary for me
if I start winning.

714
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:19,719
If something doesn't sit well with you,

715
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:23,723
there's no telling when you might
decide to draw that sword.

716
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:29,562
Oh, that's right.
I almost forgot.

717
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:34,150
I had one more order for a massage.

718
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,487
It's so nice to have work.

719
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,826
You seem to be doing
a brisk business in this town.

720
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,411
Yes, thanks.

721
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:47,079
You know, Ichi,

722
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:51,125
ever since we started
traveling together,

723
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:55,755
I've been practicing seeing things
with my eyes closed, like you.

724
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,299
I suppose that's
one way to pass the time.

725
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:02,887
I think I'm getting so I can see
what's going on behind my back.

726
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:06,599
What did you hide a while ago?

727
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:13,147
Even if you grow eyes
in the back of your head,

728
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:17,276
they won't do you much good
if they're cross-eyed.

729
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:21,280
If you thought I hid
something when I didn't,

730
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:24,617
I think you've still
got a long ways to go.

731
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:28,537
So certification
by the "Plain Old Ichi School"

732
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:30,539
remains a distant dream.

733
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,378
Too bad.

734
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,800
Well, I'll be off to work then.

735
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,094
Uh-huh.

736
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,815
Sir, the acupuncturist
from a while ago is here.

737
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:22,985
He says he thinks he left
something behind in your room.

738
01:04:23,778 --> 01:04:25,321
Thank you.

739
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,115
Much obliged.

740
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,035
This is really quite a storm
we're having.

741
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:38,042
The young lady isn't here?

742
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,920
She's at the guardhouse

743
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,172
in connection with Roppei's killing.

744
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:51,097
So what was it you're missing?

745
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,600
Here it is.
It's just one of the tubes I use.

746
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,649
If I may, sir.

747
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:05,277
Perhaps it's not my place,

748
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:10,825
especially after an acquaintance
of only three treatments,

749
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,035
to be asking such a question.

750
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,620
What is it?

751
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:19,917
Is there some particular reason
why your retainer Roppei

752
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:23,629
would meet such a terrible end?

753
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,548
Why do you ask?

754
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:28,592
One problem with blind folk,

755
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:31,345
especially those of us
who are masseurs,

756
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:34,557
is that we have a keen nose.

757
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:54,952
Roppei was the only one -

758
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:59,165
the only one who knew
the face of our enemy.

759
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:03,085
Knowing neither name
nor anything else about our foe,

760
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:05,004
we needed Roppei to identify him.

761
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:07,423
Neither I nor Kume ever saw him.

762
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:11,343
That has to be why he killed Roppei.

763
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:13,929
I can't think of any other explanation.

764
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:18,976
Is your enemy still in this town, then?

765
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:21,395
He obviously was here
when Roppei was killed.

766
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:23,147
Whether he still is -

767
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,067
But so long as you
and your sister are here,

768
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,613
wouldn't he stick around
so he can kill you?

769
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,824
What would he gain from killing us?

770
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:38,329
We no longer have any way
to recognize him,

771
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:40,706
even if we come
face to face with him.

772
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:45,044
To kill us now would be
a purely gratuitous slaughter.

773
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,755
I see what you mean.

774
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,216
If that itchy nose of yours
has been satisfied,

775
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,051
please be on your way.

776
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:57,973
Might I perhaps ask
just one other thing?

777
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:00,893
If I may ask,

778
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:05,272
what is the origin of this vendetta?

779
01:07:05,356 --> 01:07:07,399
Chess.

780
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:11,320
Chess. It all started
over a game of chess.

781
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:18,994
<i>When my father</i>
<i>was traveling with Roppei,</i>

782
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:22,790
<i>he became acquainted with</i>
<i>a samurai who liked chess.</i>

783
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:25,751
<i>It's an embarrassing story,</i>

784
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:31,590
<i>but a friendly wager</i>
<i>somehow turned sour.</i>

785
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:34,176
<i>I don't know who drew his sword first,</i>

786
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,221
<i>but in any case,</i>
<i>my father was killed.</i>

787
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:42,726
<i>That's why only Roppei</i>
<i>knew who our enemy was.</i>

788
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:47,106
Now that Roppei is dead,

789
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:49,692
we have no means at all
to identify the killer.

790
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:54,363
Without avenging our father's death,
we can't return home.

791
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,615
Our family name will be rubbed out,

792
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:01,287
and Kume and I will be doomed
to wander forever through other fiefs.

793
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,372
There's absolutely nothing we can do.

794
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:08,419
You really have no other clues
about your father's assailant?

795
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:12,131
Not even some flimsy straw
for a drowning man to grasp?

796
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:17,845
We know the man is
an uncommonly quick chess player.

797
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:19,972
Other than that, nothing.

798
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:21,557
No.

799
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,394
Welcome back, miss.

800
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:28,147
Are you all done at the guardhouse?

801
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,275
Yes.
I'm sorry it took so long.

802
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:36,530
Actually, there's one other thing
about how the man plays chess.

803
01:08:36,614 --> 01:08:38,741
According to Roppei,

804
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:42,536
when he has his opponent cornered
and he's down to his last move,

805
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,580
he has a habit

806
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:47,291
of rubbing his fingers
across his nose like this.

807
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,889
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

808
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:08,270
I'm still not having any luck.

809
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,442
I just keep losing.

810
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:15,944
This town must be bad luck for me.

811
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:18,322
As soon as the weather breaks,

812
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:23,285
let's pack up and head on over
to the other side of Hakone Pass.

813
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:27,331
We can go to Mishima or Numazu.

814
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,083
When my luck returns

815
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,919
and I have a chunk of money
in hand again,

816
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:34,254
we can go our separate ways.

817
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:38,884
Say,

818
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:43,097
I figured the kitchen would
complain if it was too late,

819
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,266
so I went ahead and ordered
some sake for you.

820
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:49,687
Wonderful! Excellent idea.

821
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,480
Let's get right to it.

822
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:04,618
It was an odd set of circumstances
that brought us together,

823
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:07,371
but now that it's time for us to part,

824
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:10,916
I find myself feeling
a little wistful somehow.

825
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:16,004
Thank you.

826
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:27,766
Let's figure on leaving
the day after tomorrow.

827
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,522
You know,

828
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:37,025
instead of only as far as
Mishima or Numazu,

829
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:43,115
couldn't we go on traveling
together beyond that too?

830
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:45,492
Don't be silly.

831
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:49,121
No, really. Miki and I
will take care of ourselves.

832
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:51,665
And I promise
we won't become a burden.

833
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,711
You have to understand, Otane.

834
01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:01,175
The man you're looking at is dirt.

835
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:06,555
And everyone who comes
close to him or touches him,

836
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:12,394
in one way or another
gets muddied by that dirt.

837
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:20,569
There's nothing I can do
about being dirt myself,

838
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:25,199
but I don't want you
to get mired in my dirt.

839
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:27,367
You're -

840
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:31,663
You're too -

841
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:44,551
I'm too what, Master Ichi?

842
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,903
Have you -

843
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:07,115
Have you ever been close
with a woman?

844
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:12,454
- Uh-huh.
- You have?

845
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,624
Uh-huh.

846
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,796
Even now, she is close to me.

847
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,465
What's she like?

848
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:27,594
Well, I'm blind, so I can't see her,

849
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:33,016
but she has two ears,

850
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:36,728
two eyes,

851
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:40,732
a nicely shaped nose,

852
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:44,903
and a sweet little mole.

853
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:48,907
That's right. Right here.

854
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:17,185
Her name is Otane, too,

855
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:22,691
but she died a long time ago.

856
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:27,237
She has the same name,

857
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,033
but she's different.

858
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:36,705
She lives on forever in here,

859
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:43,503
deep behind these eyes.

860
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,427
I hate her.

861
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:55,891
But fine, let her stay there forever,
deep behind your eyes.

862
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:14,451
You're going to remember me
forever, too.

863
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:20,082
Or is forever asking too much?

864
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:26,338
Then at least for a week or two.

865
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:35,055
At least you'll remember me

866
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:40,268
as the other Otane,
not the one who died.

867
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,441
At least until that bite
on your hand stops hurting.

868
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:15,887
We've combed every town
along the highway,

869
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:18,140
and we still can't find her.

870
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:21,018
I wonder if she took
some side road along the way.

871
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:22,436
In that case,

872
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:26,565
that Zatoichi guy she was following
must have left the highway,

873
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,192
or else she lost track of him somewhere.

874
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:34,239
Maybe we just overlooked
that straw hat of hers somewhere.

875
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,742
We've come this far.

876
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:39,578
Just to be sure,
let's go as far as Hakone Pass.

877
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:41,663
If we can't find her by then,

878
01:15:41,747 --> 01:15:44,708
we'll give up
and go home to Shimosa.

879
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,528
OTANE

880
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:26,458
So you started following Zatoichi
at Chikura Hot Springs,

881
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:30,045
and you were still with him
on the boat across the channel,

882
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:33,507
but you lost track of him
when you came ashore at Miura?

883
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,591
That's right.

884
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:37,594
And the man you've been
traveling with since then,

885
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,137
he's a different blind man?

886
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,847
You're sure about that?

887
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,893
Zatoichi's the man
who cut down Shodayu Tsukuba.

888
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:49,356
How could I forget the man
who killed my husband?

889
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:52,984
The man I'm with now
goes by just plain Ichi.

890
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:55,070
He's a traveling masseur.

891
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,449
If you don't believe me,
just ask Miki.

892
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,249
That's all right.

893
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:12,587
We'll know him when we see him.

894
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:16,007
We're not the only ones
who want Zatoichi dead.

895
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,468
There's a whole lot of money
on his head.

896
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:21,847
We can't afford to take him lightly.

897
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:27,602
<i>Master Ichi.</i>

898
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:30,647
I have to tell you someth -

899
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:37,988
I drew my fortune at the temple

900
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:41,658
to see whether this is
a good time to start a trip.

901
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:44,870
I mean, I wanted to be sure

902
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:48,290
because it's our first departure
since Miki's illness.

903
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:52,752
My fortune said if we don't start today,

904
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:55,922
the next three or four days
will all be bad.

905
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,466
So I was wondering,

906
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:01,636
what do you think
about starting today?

907
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,638
I see.

908
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:07,475
All right. Let's get going
right away, then.

909
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,812
- You're sure you don't mind?
- No, I don't mind.

910
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:19,487
As they say,
no sense in delaying a good thing.

911
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:30,332
How about you?

912
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
I'll go too.

913
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:40,258
No sense in delaying a good thing.
Nor a bad thing.

914
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:52,604
Here.

915
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:04,032
Otane, shall we be going?

916
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,078
Master Ichi.

917
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,508
Miki's actually

918
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:24,469
my own daughter.

919
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,471
Oh?

920
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:30,267
I've been lying to you.

921
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:33,895
I was -

922
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:38,066
I was the wife of Shodayu Tsukuba,

923
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:40,402
who died by your blade.

924
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:47,409
And so?

925
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,916
But I -

926
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:58,044
I fell in love with you.

927
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,840
I wanted to be your woman.

928
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,142
Thank you.

929
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:13,203
What do you say?
Care for a match?

930
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,497
That sounds good.

931
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,584
I think you were
one up on me, right?

932
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:21,336
That's right.

933
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:23,463
Rock, paper, scissors.

934
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,884
- I go first?
- Right.

935
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,261
Let's see.

936
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,911
- Rook to eight-two.
- Lance to seven-seven.

937
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:57,455
- Gold to three-two.
- King to eight-eight.

938
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:02,419
Pawn to seven-three.

939
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:04,337
Pawn to three-five.

940
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,591
Pawn to five-four.

941
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:11,052
Rook to two-five.

942
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:13,054
Let's see.

943
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,391
Silver to seven-two.

944
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:18,643
Lance to three-seven.

945
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:22,605
Lance to three-seven, you say.

946
01:22:23,565 --> 01:22:26,568
Pawn to eight-five.
- Pawn to same.

947
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:29,904
- Pawn to eight-six.
- Silver to three-two.

948
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:33,366
King to six-two.

949
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,160
Pawn to six-three.

950
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:36,411
Silver to same.

951
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:37,912
Gold to same.

952
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:40,874
King to same.

953
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,250
Lance to six-five.

954
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:46,588
Bishop to six-nine.

955
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:50,008
You can't take it back.

956
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,093
Don't forget.

957
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:58,558
Did you say bishop to six-nine?
Is that your move?

958
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,685
Is that your move?

959
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:02,437
Well, Plain Old Ichi,

960
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:06,065
it looks like you're finished.

961
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:12,447
Pawn to six-four. Checkmate.
- I win!

962
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:32,342
To avenge our father's death!

963
01:23:34,636 --> 01:23:36,137
Don't let the child see!

964
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:48,650
<i>What are you doing?</i>

965
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,905
Miki!
- Auntie Otane!

966
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:59,118
No! Let me go!

967
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:11,297
Wait! Don't attack yet!

968
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:13,591
As soon as we attack, he draws.

969
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:17,095
Since he's blind,
he can't do a thing until we attack.

970
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:19,430
Take your time!

971
01:24:19,514 --> 01:24:22,642
When you're good and ready,
everybody strike at once.

972
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:26,688
Ouch! That hurts!
Let me go! Auntie Otane!

973
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:40,827
Auntie Otane!

974
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,412
Let me go!

975
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:09,856
Auntie Otane!

976
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:46,893
Uncle Ichi!

977
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:16,339
Thank you.

978
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,369
Master Ichi!

979
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:48,621
Uncle Ichi!

980
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:17,274
THE END
