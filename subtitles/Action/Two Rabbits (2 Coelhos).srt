<i>I always wanted</i>

3
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,774
<i>to be many things.</i>

4
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,817
<i>A doctor...</i>

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,985
<i>...astronaut...</i>

6
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,069
<i>...a diver.</i>

7
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,237
<i>To start a band,</i>

Latin music star...</i>

00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,367
<i>Create a blog...</i>

10
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,287
<i>that I'd sell a year later
for a million dollars.</i>

11
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,289
<i>To adopt a stray dog,</i>

12
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,166
<i>paint a picture, learn Spanish...</i>

13
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,877
<i>“Yo no hablo espanhol
pero me encanta Rio”.</i>

14
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,045
<i>To invest in the stock market...</i>

15

<i>Start a campaign
against land mines...</i>

16

<i>and cluster bombs.</i>

00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,842
<i>Write a book...</i>

18
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,926
<i>A book?</i>

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,094
<i>No. A movie script?</i>

20
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,888
<i>Start a revolution, be a Che!</i>

21
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,849
<i>Or maybe not...</i>

22
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,603

<i>Or, if you prefer,</i>

26
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,109
<i>videogames and pornography.</i>

27

“KICKING ASS IN MIAMI BEACH"

28
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,133
<i>I have just come back
from a short time abroad.</i>

29
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,801
<i>I spent two years there.</i>

30
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,512
<i>It was fun.</i>

31
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,932
<i>But it was time to come back.</i>

32
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,393
<i>And now that I'm back...</i>

33
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,187
<i>I've just found a purpose...</i>

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,313
<i>...a path...</i>

35
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,774
<i>...mission to accomplish.</i>

36
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,703
It's Edgar.

37
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,581
Hey, What's up?

38
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,542
<i>A long time ago,
in a galaxy far away...</i>

39
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,920
<i>...I had a bright future.</i>

40
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,255
<i>I always had a connection
to electronic stuff.</i>

41
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,924
<i>It started with remote controls...</i>

42
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,550
<i>Atari, Odyssey, Master System,</i>

43
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,762
<i>then MSX, 286, 386.</i>

44
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,597
<i>I was the family genius,
a big nerd.</i>

45
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,890
<i>When I was in college...</i>

46
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,434
<i>while my friends were drowning
in booze and women...</i>

47
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:07,480
<i>I practiced things
that were absolutely useless.</i>

48
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,149
<i>Then, my first job.</i>

49
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,402
Say... What are you doing
this weekend?

50
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>Well...
...let's just say that.</i>

51
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,782
<i>I felt a certain incompatibility
with the corporate world.</i>

52
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,701
Good morning.
So, is everything ready?

53
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,161
Wait a minute.
Fuck me!!!

54
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,122
You call this shit a layout?

55
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,583
<i>And a certain difficulty
to cope with critics.</i>

56
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,132
“My boss”.

57
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,800
"Me."

58
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,386
People called him the bomb-man!

59
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,721
He is an evil visionary!

60
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,806
He asked me to tie him up
and slap him also...

61
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,058
I like his insanity a little bit.

62
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,893
Asshole!
Douche!

63
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,812
He's an antichrist!
Liar!

64
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,605
A loser, loser. Totally a loser!

65
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,150
They even said he was a faggot,
I don't know.

66
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,234
I'm out of it...

67
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,653
A guy like that has
no plan for his life?

68
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,158
<i>I do have a plan.</i>

69
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,579
<i>A fucked up plan, to be honest,
but it is a plan.</i>

70
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,960
- What's up?
- How are you, kid? You're back?

71
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,462
Yeah, I guess.

72
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,505
So, Ching-Ling brought my stuff?

73
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,090
Let's go there.

74
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,593
Ching, you've got a customer.

75
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,969
How are you?

76
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,846
Your toy!

77
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,766
Open it.
I'm curious to see.

78
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,935
Look at this beauty.

79
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,104
I'll tell you.

80
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,524
- Hold this.
- Okay.

81
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,443
Now, walk that way.

82
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,903
Go ahead.

83
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,238
Right there, it's ok!

84
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,950
Now, come slowly...

85
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,460
What is this, man?

86
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,378
This one...

87
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,465
...when it gets near to this one...

88
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,051
It discharges an electric current,

89
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,636
a proximity sensor.

90
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,638
And what are you doing with it?

91
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,224
<i>What I'm gonna do?</i>

92
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,977
<i>My idea is quite simple:
justice.</i>

93
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,855
<i>To kill two rabbits
with just one blow.</i>

94
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:15,983
“TWO RABBITS"

95
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,988
<i>This plan has been dancing
in my mind for quite a while-.</i>

96
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,074
<i>It was before I went to Miami.</i>

97
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,535
<i>But I perfected it there.</i>

98
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,081
<i>I just need some sort of a click,</i>

99
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:36,295
<i>to find that last piece of the
puzzle and see the whole picture.</i>

100
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,689
Hey, you! Punk!

101
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,731
You moron!

102
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,108
Retarded!

103
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,529
<i>Nice to meet you.
My name is Edgar.</i>

104
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,783
Wake up, man! Give me your watch.
Hurry up, you ass!

105
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,160
You wanna die? Wanna be shot at?
In the head? That's it.

106
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,956
Where's the money? I said money!
You call this money?

107
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,167
Give me your money, come one!
What is that thing over there?

108
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:18,254
- My cell phone.
- Give me that.

109
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,756
- What else do you have? What else?
- Nothing.

110
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,217
Nothing?
Have a nice day, pal.

111
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,889
<i>Shit! I was mugged!</i>

112
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:33,311
<i>What if he'd get a shot off?
It could've been fun.</i>

113
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,647
<i>What could I have done
for him to shoot me?</i>

114
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,691
<i>What if I did this?</i>

115
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>Or this?</i>

116
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:47,658
<i>Oh! FON FON, the teddy bear.</i>

117
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,300
You fucking vagabonds!

118
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,263
Hey, D’Artagnan. Wake up.
Come eat something.

119
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,725
Man, drop that fucking
magazine and come eat something.

120
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,393
I'm coming, bro.

121
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,729
- Come on!
- Just a second, man.

122
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,190
- Mrs. Te. I'm here.
- Come on in.

123
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,233
I've brought food for the guys.

124
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,443
It's all there.

125
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,405
At least the food, I'm starving.

126
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,449
You don't work
And you wanna eat?

127
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,993
Maicon called.

128
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,955
He said it's all good.
Business is up.

129
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,250
- So?
- Uncle Maicon's words: close shop.

130
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,753
- Close shop?
- God knows what he means.

131
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:45,424
<i>This is Bola, aka Carioca.
He's Maicon's right hand man.</i>

132
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:48,678
<i>Who's Maicon?
I'll tell you later.</i>

133
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,931
<i>The right question now is:
what are these guys doing...</i>

134
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:55,101
<i>looking at the Persian carpet
in their living room?</i>

135
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,062
Take the carpet up.
Come on, hurry.

136
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,022
Take her, guys.

137
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,524
<i>This is Miss Puhn.</i>

138
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,818
<i>P + U + H + N</i>

139
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:09,156
<i>But, why is Miss Puhn buried
alive in this fethid hole?</i>

140
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:14,704
<i>It was because of her mother
Mrs. Célia, or Mrs. Puhn.</i>

141
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,747
<i>P + U + H + N</i>

142
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,047
Bling, Bling! Bling, bling!
The Geush Brothers!

143
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,926
<i>Mrs. Celia is a trusted employee
of the Geush Twins...</i>

144
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,015
<i>who got rich with a cheap
TV auction show.</i>

145
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,102
<i>Mrs. Celia is particularly
close to Sasha...</i>

146
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,938
<i>The oldest
and the gayest of them.</i>

147
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,983
<i>So, it happens that Sasha
besides trusting Miss. Celia</i>

148
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,526
<i>her love affair secrets,</i>

149
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,988
<i>trusted also
the company's vault secret.</i>

150
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,828
<i>And it was exactly that secret that ended
up placing Miss. Celia and her daughter</i>

151
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,040
<i>in that, let's say,
difficult situation.</i>

152
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,419
Now you have your money,
where's my daughter?

153
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,962
Where's my daughter?

154
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,465
Easy, easy!

155
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,928
Gimme the glasses!

156
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,227
Fucking coward.

157
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,104
You've shit your pants.

158
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,566
Fuck!

159
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,862
Answer the fucking door!

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,367
Everybody quiet!

161
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,702
Hands on your heads, come on!

162
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,746
Easy, man!
There's a child here.

163
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,998
Shut the fuck up!

164
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,501
What's this?

165
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,008
Where's Maicon in all this shit?

166
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,637
<i>Wait, wait, it's not the time to reveal
who Maicon is.</i>

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,638
<i>Later...</i>

168
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,972
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

169
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,600
I need 144, please.

170
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,937
I think it's December
if I'm not mistaken.

171
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,855
Thank you.

172
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,732
Julia?

173
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,318
- How are you?
- Hi, Rodrigues.

174
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,403
- I'm fine. You?
- Where did you have lunch?

175
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,198
In that new Indian restaurant
down the street.

176
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,449
Is the Indian good?

177
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:20,454
- It's okay.
- I know, very spicy stuff.

178
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,460
- Shoot, say it.
- I'm gonna have to transfer you.

179
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,713
Internal affairs.

180
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,216
They're pressing for
an administrative investigation.

181
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,467
It's come from the top.

182
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,927
But why?

183
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,223
They've found evidence
against the Maicon guy's gang.

184
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,853
We've been after him for 3 years.
Now things will be tough for him.

185
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,901
We've linked him to the jewelry
robbery, the Jew's case...

186
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:55,072
At least eight homicides, armed
robbery, kidnapping and more.

187
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,452
That's okay by me. If they want
it like that, it's their call.

188
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,580
Nobody doubts your honesty...

189
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,791
but many people are annoyed
by this whole story.

190
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,793
Who else will be transferred
with me?

191
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,171
I don't know yet.
But I'll keep you posted.

192
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,797
Okay.

193
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,152
Hi, hi, it's me.

194
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,698
Things got ugly here.
Yeah, come here, now.

195
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,701
No, come here, now.
I'm not waiting.

196
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,995
We must see him, alright?

197
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,830
Okay, we.

198
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,340
<i>Julia thinks she's dying,
but she isn't.</i>

199
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,010
<i>She's just having
a panic attack.</i>

200
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,105
<i>Julia loves the sea...</i>

201
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,821
<i>She loves the sun...</i>

202
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,743
<i>a man's hand...</i>

203
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,916
<i>the wind</i>

204
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,339
<i>birds...</i>

205
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,299
Julia?

206
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,344
My car is here.

207
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,639
You're singing that song again.
Come on, let's go!

208
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,308
This song soothes me!

209
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,728
- You want to take a pill or something?
- No, I don't.

210
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,814
I wanna get over this by myself.

211
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,109
I need to learn how to control
these crazy thoughts.

212
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,111
I can do it.

213
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,656
<i>Julia and Henrique make
a perfect couple.</i>

214
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,120
<i>She is a prosecutor,
he is a criminal's lawyer.</i>

215
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:12,167
<i>At least in crookery
things seemed to be going well.</i>

216
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,421
<i>Julia has exclusive information...</i>

217
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,799
<i>that only people inside the
Prosecutors Office have access to.</i>

218
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,969
<i>With this information,
our friend Henrique...</i>

219
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,430
<i>orients his clients,
creates alibis,</i>

220
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,808
<i>and prepares
his bullet-proof cases.</i>

221
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,979
Come on, Henrique!

222
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,065
That's okay.

223
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,902
What's up Henrique!
How's it going?

224
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:42,281
- Well, and you?
- Cool, man, I need to talk for a second.

225
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,575
Go ahead I'll be right there.

226
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,746
<i>But where are these two going now?</i>

227
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,626
<i>They've come to see their
biggest and only client...</i>

228
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,670
<i>...Maicon.</i>

229
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,319
<i>So who is this Maicon, anyway?</i>

230
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:24,031
Where's Maicon in all this shit?

231
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,999
I'm here, boss...

232
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,923
Here I am!

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,811
- Are you all right, my friend?
- Yes.

234
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,480
Did you do it alright?
Did you wash your hands?

235
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,482
Your zipper is open.

236
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,862
You don't need anything else?
You want a kiss from Bola?

237
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,533
Let's come back.

238
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,286
<i>At first sight,
Maicon is a “nice” criminal.</i>

239
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,916
<i>But who said there
are “nice” criminals?</i>

240
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,293
So, anyone else want
to go to the bathroom?

241
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,964
Now, the pressing
question here is...

242
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,300
who are you again?

243
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,804
<i>This is Roberto,
also known as Tanajura.</i>

244
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,850
<i>He is a policeman who works as
security for the Geush Brothers.</i>

245
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,895
<i>Roberio planned the whole
robbery at the Geush company.</i>

246
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:41,108
<i>Then he decided to hire Maicon's gang
to do the job.</i>

247
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,612
So you're Tanajura.

248
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,200
You fucking Bozo!

249
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,454
Nice to meet you.

250
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:57,207
We haven't had the chance
to meet in person.

251
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:01,211
- You know why we're here.
- No, I have no idea.

252
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,297
Well, my friend...

253
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,466
I delivered it
on a tray for you...

254
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:10,053
to get the Chinese woman
and her daughter.

255
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,682
- So, where's the money?
- There's no money.

256
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,517
There's something else...

257
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,728
she's not Chinese,
she's Japanese.

258
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,771
No, Maicon, she's Korean.

259
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,148
Shut up!
What?

260
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,151
She's Korean.
She's not Japanese or Chinese.

261
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,112
- Let's get it right...
- Shut up!

262
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,159
- So, she's Korean.
- I don't fucking care!

263
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,078
Fuck, I've come all this way
to this shithole

264
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,499
just to settle this shit down!

265
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,084
To settle it “up”.

266
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,465
Well, brother, you must know
that everybody is onto us...

267
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,091
the police know...

268
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,553
So relax. Relax.
Get the man a beer.

269
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,055
Stop fucking around!

270
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,390
If you've fucked this up
and whacked the Chinese girl...

271
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,392
that's your problem, fuck it!

272
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,563
I took the risk, so now I'm leaving
without the money, you know?

273
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:06,026
You do that.
Or else I won't answer for myself!

274
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,320
- You have the money, right?
- Right.

275
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,863
So, where's our share?

276
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,200
I like that, Tanajura's
not fucking around.

277
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,577
Hey, guys, learn with him.

278
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,288
He came here to solve
his problem, right?

279
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,998
But you came at this hour?

280
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,959
- You wanna solve this right now?
- What?

281
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,837
You have working hours now?
From eight to six?

282
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,175
Boss, let's make a deal...

283
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,843
Fuck your deal! Fuck your deal!

284
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,137
I'm not a fool,
Look, I know you...

285
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:40,102
I know you wanted to stab
me in the back, you fucking rat!

286
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,565
- So, you've heard?
- Where's it, you son of a bitch?

287
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:51,321
<i>If there's one thing Maicon
respects, it's his mother.</i>

288
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,575
<i>And, my friend, if there's one
thing that makes him crazy...</i>

289
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,828
<i>that's when someone
calls him son of a...</i>

290
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,834
<i>What did Maicon do?</i>

291
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,921
<i>Well, we'd better back off
to get the whole picture.</i>

292
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:41,747
Fry the fish, Bola!

293
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,098
Fuck, man!
You jumped all over me!

294
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,559
In the cat's mouth, boss!

295
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,313
<i>Maicon had it all planned.</i>

296
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,606
I'll watch the game somewhere else.

297
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,399
<i>He framed Roberio.</i>

298
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,652
The dude shit himself.

299
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,487
He broke the saint's head, man!

300
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,322
- Okay, twelve years.
- Right.

301
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,407
You're a cheat!

302
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:22,537
<i>All of a sudden a magic envelope
appeared in the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

303
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,414
“OPEN IT “
“URGENT”

304
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,253
<i>Photographs, phone calls,
documents.</i>

305
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,839
<i>They delivered a busload
of evidence on a tray,</i>

306
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,175
<i>connecting Maicon to Geusch's theft,</i>

307
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,429
<i>Puhn's death, and
the police officer Roberto's murder.</i>

308
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:44,935
<i>This takes us back to the meeting
with Julia, Maicon and Henrique.</i>

309
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,396
I was just trying
to explain to Maicon...

310
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,773
that the Prosecutors Office
Will come for him very hard.

311
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,192
- He got that, right?
- Right.

312
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,070
And now I want a suggestion
from you. What do I do?

313
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,824
In fact, Maicon,
we have lost the initiative.

314
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,285
The evidence is incontestable,
they will beat you up.

315
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,830
So now I'm fucked.
I want some alternative.

316
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,958
You are right.
You must have alternatives.

317
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,876
My hands are tied there!

318
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,170
They're onto me,
I might get busted.

319
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,383
We've gotta find another way to get
information and plan everything.

320
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,260
It can't be with me.

321
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:23,724
Look, they'll have a warrant
for year arrest by next week.

322
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,727
You must hurry,
they might even get it this week.

323
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,105
Really? And what the fuck
should I do?

324
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,107
Should I lay low,
maybe run away?

325
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,486
No, running away
is just like pleading guilty.

326
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,823
Julia knows a person
who might help you.

327
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:44,786
Yeah, I know someone.
It might work, or it might not.

328
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,329
The man is a state deputy.

329
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,416
He has contacts in the police,
in the judiciary and shit.

330
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,919
- Will he come over to the dark side?
- He's already on the dark side, baby.

331
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,048
The man loves money.
He has helped a lot of people.

332
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,177
Remember that whole
bingo halls scheme?

333
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,181
- Well, this is the man.
- If it weren't for him there...

334
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,225
wouldn't be a single
bingo hall open.

335
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,978
But now they're
all closed down.

336
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,190
Okay, they were open
for ten years.

337
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:18,945
Well, we must be quick.
So, give me a figure...

338
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,407
how much are you willing
to put on the table?

339
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,202
I don't know,
I've got no funds now.

340
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,953
Listen to me.
I'm your lawyer!

341
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,415
I told you not to open
this goddamn parking lot.

342
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,167
This is an investment, man!

343
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,669
I'm renting the upper floor
to a church.

344
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,048
Wait, wait.
Listen to me.

345
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,759
We'll try to get
a politician's help, okay?

346
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:45,722
<i>I would say Julia has a talent
for influencing men.</i>

347
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,072
- Dad.
- Hi, son.

348
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,242
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thanks.

349
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,036
- The restaurant is beautiful.
- Do you like it?

350
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,580
But how much are you paying
that girl...

351
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,041
to scare the clients away?

352
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,171
- The receptionist?
- The “deceptionist”.

353
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,218
- So how are things going?
- Fine. With you?

354
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,847
- I was robbed.
- What? Robbed?

355
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,474
- Did they do anything to you?
- No, no.

356
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:30,976
- Are you alright?
- Sure.

357
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,269
What did they take?

358
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,982
They took my watch,
my iPhone and 15 bucks.

359
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,150
It's the end of the world.

360
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,861
What about Walter?

361
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,072
What about him?

362
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:48,326
Look, son, it's okay.
I've talked to him.

363
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,662
I told him you were back.
There's no problem.

364
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,915
I think he understood.
I'm sure he has forgiven you.

365
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:58,003
He's calmer. I think you should
sit down and talk.

366
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,631
- Yeah, it's a good idea.
- You do that.

367
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,134
If he accepts you apologies,
great.

368
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,428
If he doesn't,
that's his problem.

369
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:10,682
The most important thing
is us, the family.

370
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,018
That's right, Dad.

371
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,855
- We've helped him enough, right?
- True.

372
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,773
Alright, I think I'm going.

373
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,653
What do you mean, you're going?
You're going nowhere.

374
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,698
- I'm going to have a dog...
- No, you'll have lunch with me.

375
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:30,160
- You're eating food.
- I miss the hot-dogs up there.

376
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,579
Hot-dogs? Don't you miss
your father?

377
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,831
How long were you away?
Come on!

378
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:39,294
You're having lunch with me.
I've got something special for you.

379
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,505
Minced meat special.
How about that?

380
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,009
- I hate that.
- I'm just kidding.

381
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,970
Afonso? Prepare
that dish I told you.

382
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,098
That's right.
Steak and French fries?

383
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,184
- That's right.
- Correct?

384
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:05,445
<i>This is Walter.
He's a college professor.</i>

385
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,448
<i>But what is a college
professor doing...</i>

386
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,284
<i>working as the cashier
at my father's restaurant?</i>

387
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,162
<i>Well, it's quite
complicated, but...</i>

388
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,705
<i>right now I would like
to focus on a man...</i>

389
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,292
<i>who's equally important
to my plan.</i>

390
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,175
<i>This is Jader Kerteis,
the state deputy...</i>

391
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,095
<i>that Julia and Henrique
suggested to Maicon.</i>

392
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,641
<i>Mr. Jader, ten years ago,
a politician full of good intentions.</i>

393
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,476
<i>No no, this is not Jader,</i>

394
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,853
<i>this is Zacharia's double</i>

395
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,647
<i>and, ins his party's political
broadcast...</i>

396
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,149
<i>he appeared right after
a Zacharia's impersonator...</i>

397
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,236
<i>who was so bizarre that got
people's attention.</i>

398
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:54,577
<i>Jader slipstreamed it and was elected.
So was Zhacharias, by the way.</i>

399
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,831
<i>Jade is dignity,
Jader is respect...</i>

400
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,582
<i>Jader is honesty.</i>

401
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:05,171
<i>Jader, 888886.
With “Bem Te vi, 88”.</i>

402
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,840
<i>After he was elected...</i>

403
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,009
<i>within a few months
he got a taste of reality.</i>

404
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,469
<i>When he noticed, he was
involved in schemes...</i>

405
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,557
<i>to approve skyscraper construction
in restricted areas...</i>

406
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,893
<i>to favor companies in the
bidding to supply school meals...</i>

407
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,645
<i>and so on.</i>

408
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,731
<i>The other day...</i>

409
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:25,775
I saw the government's
Party political broadcast...

410
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,155
And this is what was said,
the TV host speaking solemnly...

411
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:34,659
“When the disease came, we treated
it the best way we could”.

412
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:38,705
They can't be serious!
This is such cheap advertising!

413
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,709
This is an advertising text
that says...

414
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:47,255
“The health care,
we offer the people...

415
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:52,761
Is really rubbish!”
Not to say crap.

416
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,556
<i>Now moving on to another issue...</i>

417
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,563
Hello

418
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,024
I'm home.

419
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,693
More or less.

420
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,448
No, not yet.

421
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,202
<i>This is Sofia, Jader's wife.</i>

422
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,871
I'm putting it on now.

423
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,456
Okay?

424
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,500
Me too, bye!

425
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:28,630
<i>And she's not so happy with Jader.</i>

426
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,882
- Jader?
- Just a second.

427
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,509
- What, Sofia?
- Your jacket.

428
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:36,429
I'm not wearing a jacket.
Say it, what time?

429
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,474
And now, while he east
his medium rare steak...

430
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,977
accompanied by an elegant
gratin galettes...

431
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,148
he's about to receive a phone call
that will change his life.

432
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,194
- Yeah?
- Jader?

433
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,780
- Hi, this is Henrique.
- Hi, Dr. Henrique.

434
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,574
My assistant
told me about your case.

435
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:00,120
Some more water, please.
Thank you.

436
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,415
So, man, due to his history
this is a complicated deal.

437
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:09,003
I know, that's why my client
needs your expertise...

438
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,213
Your influence.

439
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,590
But, my friend
this caliber is too high.

440
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:17,303
I'll have to think about it,
see what I can do to help.

441
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,889
<i>Listen, deputy, I want you
to know in advance...</i>

442
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,684
<i>that both my client
and my group...</i>

443
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:27,021
we are ready to pay
a small urgency fee...

444
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,023
I know, everybody
has urgency...

445
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:32,777
Besides, we have the election
next year, I'll be very busy.

446
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,904
I have to think about it.
We'll see.

447
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,616
But this is not the right
place to discuss this.

448
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:45,498
- Tell me, do you enjoy jogging?
- Jogging? I do, I do.

449
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,381
<i>The probability theory</i>

450
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:57,093
<i>tries to quantify the notion
of mathematically probable.</i>

451
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,679
- What's up, man?
- Hey, how are you?

452
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,849
- A hot-dog with two sausages.
- You got it.

453
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,685
<i>But I guess not even
such complex formulas...</i>

454
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,438
<i>would be able to quantify
the probability...</i>

455
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,650
<i>of my meeting the asshole
who robbed me 24 hours later...</i>

456
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:16,821
<i>right at my favorite
hot-dog stand.</i>

457
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,158
Things are good here, huh?

458
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,576
- Hello.
- How are you?

459
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,078
I want the usual, with...

460
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,915
“Fon Fon the Teddy Bear”.

461
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,670
With mash and fries.

462
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,300
Good afternoon,
Agent Márcio, please.

463
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,052
- Edgar?
- Edgar.

464
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,763
Hi. We got the man.
Come take a look.

465
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,642
He went to eat the wrong hot-dog
at the wrong place.

466
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,561
I bet that gave him indigestion.

467
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,898
Take a look.
See if it's him.

468
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,860
<i>Velinha woks really hard.</i>

469
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,072
<i>He's a delivery guy
for several food places...</i>

470
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,531
<i>all of them with fancy
Italian names...</i>

471
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:03,785
<i>Pizza Molto, Watashi Watakaro,
Il Pazzo Capperi.</i>

472
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,246
<i>Ilshawarma Dihere and son on.</i>

473
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,958
<i>In fact, he's the owner
of all these pizza places...</i>

474
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,252
<i>because none of them
really exists.</i>

475
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,046
<i>They are all a facade
for his scheme.</i>

476
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,099
No, this guy has a Fon Fon
teddy bear tattoo...

477
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,310
- No, he is not the guy...
- Fon Fon teddy bear?

478
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:33,356
The guy who robbed me
had a Panda bear tattoo.

479
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,693
- He's not the guy.
- Are you sure? Take a good look.

480
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,738
This guy is a friend of a delivery
boy who works for my father.

481
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,782
- He's a working guy.
- A friend?

482
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,106
DEAD END STREET

483
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,493
- Your down, punk!
- Easy...

484
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:31,122
Here, here If you try
anything, I'll kill you.

485
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,707
Easy, easy.
I just need to talk to you.

486
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,959
- Who are you?
- I just need to talk to you.

487
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,545
- I just wanna talk, man.
- What are you up to?

488
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,173
- You like following muggers around?
- Fuck!

489
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,426
- Is this your kinky fantasy?
- I saved your ass today!

490
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,305
- You didn't save shit!
- I'm just want to make an offer...

491
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,434
Are you high, man?
Why are you laughing?

492
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,353
- I have a proposal.
- A proposal?

493
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,356
Loads of cash.
It's a good deal.

494
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,274
Get up, get up.

495
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,984
Get up. Talk.

496
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,278
Wanna spend the rest of your life
delivering pizza...

497
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,530
stealing cell phones
at traffic lights?

498
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,908
A tough guy?
Are you a tough guy?

499
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,660
You followed me here
to laugh at me? Is that it?

500
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,121
You've got one minute to
convince me.

501
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,956
Come on.

502
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,627
There's a bag full of cash.
I know where it's going.

503
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,670
I know the time and the place.

504
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,715
- Whose money is that?
- Car smugglers'...

505
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,801
Mercedes, Lamborghinis,
you know?

506
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,345
Rich people's cars?

507
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,265
You like cars, right?
The guy likes them too.

508
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,352
Tell me more.

509
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,815
I'll tell you the time and place,
we go there and split it.

510
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,983
Split what?
What are we splitting?

511
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,402
This hurts, man...
What?

512
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,238
Am I laughing?
Do I think it's funny?

513
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,449
Am I laughing, asshole?

514
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:52,120
- Man, it's a lot of cash.
- How much?

515
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,164
- Two million.
- Two million Reais?

516
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,582
Dollars.

517
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:02,880
No, man, that's too much!
He's “chicken thief”, Jader!

518
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,926
Don't talk shit. I know how
much they stole from the Jews.

519
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,972
Two millions dollars?
Fuck, that's some serious dough!

520
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,099
I'm telling you,
It's the real deal.

521
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,642
You're fucking with me.

522
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,937
- That's too much money.
- I'm serious. I only want half.

523
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,730
One million's yours.

524
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,399
You bet.

525
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,610
Let's talk about it.
Come on.

526
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:27,905
- Just point that away.
- Shut up. Keep your distance.

527
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,615
Alright? Keep your distances.

528
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,618
Let's talk about over pizza.
Get my helmet.

529
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,087
Who's this guy?

530
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,214
This is Edmar.
Good old Edmar.

531
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,593
- Edgar.
- That's right.

532
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:54,015
He has a good deal going.
He's offering only 50%, man.

533
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,934
But this is something else.
What is there to eat?

534
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,603
There's pizza.

535
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,271
Like always.

536
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,981
I've got the munchies, man.

537
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,567
The munchies?
Then you'll eat with us.

538
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,528
But I'll tell you what,
30% of the deal is yours...

539
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:08,696
the rest is ours.

540
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,824
Hey, man, you don't even
know what the deal is.

541
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,868
So what?
There's just two of us, man.

542
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,581
You're doing it alone?
Who made you Superman?

543
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:23,044
Alright, man? This is Clayton,
my partner, my right hand man!

544
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,171
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

545
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,714
- I'm fucked.
- I'm telling you.

546
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,885
30% alright.
Can I have my cell phones back?

547
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,220
What cell phone?

548
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,472
I'm just kidding.
Here it is.

549
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:37,391
A cool one.
Do I need to give it back?

550
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,977
Hot pizza, mate.

551
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:44,607
- Now you're talking.
- Is there extra virgin olive oil?

552
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,692
Fuck you.
Eat this shit.

553
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:49,237
The only extra virgin
here is you, bitch!

554
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:53,616
You realize that Edgar
had to come back to Brazil.

555
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,703
- This was inevitable.
- I know.

556
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,249
But...

557
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,796
we have to forget
this whole story.

558
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,758
It's all right.

559
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,094
Good.

560
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,346
That's really good.

561
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,016
Do you like working here?

562
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,977
I do.

563
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,728
Why?

564
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,605
You're not thinking
about quitting, are you?

565
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,190
No away.

566
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,277
I like the people here.

567
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,990
- Are you considering firing me?
- No, don't even think about that.

568
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:38,077
No, you've been
very valuable to me.

569
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,706
And money?
Everything ok with your pocket:

570
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,583
Are you in need
of some extra cash?

571
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,670
Money is always good, but...

572
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,550
for what I need,
it's enough to live on.

573
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:57,763
Alright. But if you need something,
You can ask me, Okay?

574
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,640
- Okay,
- Alright?

575
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,937
If you have any problems,
you can talk to me.

576
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,607
I'm asking you to talk to me.
Alright?

577
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,446
<i>Well, I think it's time to tell
Walter's story. And mine.</i>

578
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,114
<i>Our story.</i>

579
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,784
<i>Walter's story is divided
into B, E, and A.E...</i>

580
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,746
<i>Before Edgar and After Edgar.</i>

581
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,462
<i>Well, this is my cue.</i>

582
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:17,718
<i>This is the exact moment
when I enter Walter's life.</i>

583
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,161
<i>Ironically, the accident
brought Walter near my family.</i>

584
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,913
<i>My father was very touched
by his situation...</i>

585
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,333
<i>and offered him a job
at his restaurant...</i>

586
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,836
<i>as Walter had quit
being a teacher.</i>

587
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:37,214
<i>I managed to escape
prosecution...</i>

588
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:42,428
<i>and went for a break
to Miami, Florida, USA.</i>

589
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,310
<i>Velinha, here's the deal.
Pay attention.</i>

590
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,352
<i>Right.</i>

591
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,146
<i>The car with the money
is an armored car.</i>

592
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:56,776
<i>- The guys will be armed.
- We'll figure it out. Don't worry.</i>

593
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,117
This fucking air conditioner
isn't working. Fuck that!

594
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,418
Man, I think we were born
in the wrong country.

595
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,463
- I hear you, man.
- You know where we could be?

596
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,466
Norway, what do you think?
New Zealand maybe.

597
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,593
- Yeah, New Zealand!
- New Zealand is cool.

598
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:26,263
Norway is cold,
and New Zealand only got kangaroos...

599
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,891
- Kangaroos are in Australia!
- Are you crazy?

600
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,272
- Look at that. What a beauty!
- What a ride, man!

601
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,817
- How many could we buy?
- Four. 500 grand a-piece.

602
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,611
- In Brazil...
- And where are we, man?

603
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,405
If you're abroad
you would buy in euros, dollars...

604
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,032
Euro!

605
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:52,081
He says it like a gringo, “euro”!

606
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,585
- Asshole!
- What's he doing?

607
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,088
- Run!
- Easy, this car is armored.

608
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,342
Don't worry, man
I'm gonna run him down!

609
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,767
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck you, asshole!

610
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,231
Get the motherfucker!

611
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,691
Wait!

612
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,318
Fuck, man!
This isn't water!

613
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:24,071
This is gasoline!
This is gasoline!

614
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,866
- Let's get out of here!
- Hurry!

615
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,172
I don't have it!

616
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,383
Come on, Pelé!
Hurry!

617
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:44,401
You go! I'll cover you!
Go on! Get to their car!

618
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:48,906
Come one you fagot!

619
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,407
Assholes!

620
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:52,993
Fucked.

621
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:57,665
Go, Pelé!

622
00:40:57,748 --> 00:41:00,042
We're gangsters, son...

623
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:06,215
You've lost, nigger!
Drop your gun. Do it!

624
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,175
Come on!

625
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,136
- Where's the money?
- There is no fucking money.

626
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,055
Where's the fucking bag?

627
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,348
- Where?
- Over there.

628
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,391
Don't point, nigger!

629
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,934
- It's over there.
- Show it to me.

630
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,852
- Don't point! Move your ass!
- Fuck you, kid.

631
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,187
Go on!

632
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,815
Open it, nigger!

633
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,694
- There's a locksmith down the street.
- You're a funny guy?

634
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:28,112
- Shit.
- You're a funny guy?

635
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,571
Where's the key?

636
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,491
- It's in the car over there.
- You're a tough guy?

637
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,411
Come one!
Move your fat ass!

638
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:36,996
- Move it.
- You'd better kill me.

639
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,289
- Go ahead and kill me.
- Open it!

640
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,750
You open it.
It's armored.

641
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:46,213
Suck this, motherfucker!
This fuck armored!

642
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:48,590
So this is armored?

643
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,845
- Watch him!
- Go on, go on.

644
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,055
- Don't move!
- Motherfucker!

645
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,641
Wait, I'm opening it.
Wait, easy!

646
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,143
- Please, be patient!
- Come here.

647
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,644
Who will suck it now?

648
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,229
Wait! Easy, man!

649
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,690
Come on!
Easy, easy!

650
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:07,317
- Wait!
- Come on!

651
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:15,868
Motherfuckers!

652
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,871
Those guys robber us
on a shitty little motorbike!

653
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,622
Put your fucking arms down.

654
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,541
Fuck that shit!

655
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,209
We're fucked!

656
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:30,924
Hi!

657
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,385
- Is it here?
- Fuck no. Are you crazy?

658
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,262
Want me to walk around
with the candy?

659
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,889
It's in my car down there.

660
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,141
- Let's go.
- Come one, naughty boy.

661
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,482
Hi.

662
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,860
I'm where we have arranged!

663
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,362
What?
Are you kidding me?

664
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,865
What do you mean with
“ they've stolen the money”?

665
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,534
That's way to weird!

666
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,873
I haven't told to anyone,
not even to my wife.

667
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:05,918
Ok! Ok!
We talk later, bye.

668
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,212
Son of a bitch!

669
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,715
It's so weird!

670
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,885
Holy fuck, man!

671
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,721
I'm telling you, you loony.
Be careful with that.

672
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:22,184
Do you know what's in there?
This is not for kids.

673
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,103
I'm not playing around.

674
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,772
Thanks, man.

675
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,066
You take care.

676
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:51,213
Time's runnin' out, man.
Things are tough.

677
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,423
I know, Maicon, but...

678
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,927
I don't know what to tell you.

679
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,514
Who would've thought this
could happen, you know?

680
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,434
- Do you have any more money?
- No, I don't. What?

681
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,602
Even If I had.

682
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:09,731
I say that cos' were the same
situation as the Portuguese guy.

683
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:10,941
What Portuguese guy?

684
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:15,028
- The one from the toilet joke.
- What joke, man?

685
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:18,740
The Portuguese guy dropped
a 10-dollar note in a toilet.

686
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,826
But it wasn't a clean toilet...

687
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,663
It was like a gas station one
covered in shit.

688
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:28,542
He didn't have the balls
to fish the note out.

689
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,669
You known?
What did he do?

690
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:35,215
He took a 50-buck note
and dropped it in the shit, too.

691
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:39,011
You see?
Then it all changed.

692
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,638
He changed the way
he saw things...

693
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:45,267
because now there were 60 bucks
there in the shit...

694
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,438
and for 60 bucks he was willing
to stick his hand in...

695
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,191
and that's how
he got all his money back!

696
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,736
That's really funny.

697
00:44:56,445 --> 00:45:00,032
But you're here to solve
a very serious problem.

698
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:02,075
- Another problem.
- Fuck...

699
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,869
Your wife robbed me.

700
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,246
No, Maicon, Julia?

701
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,916
No, Josiane.
Do you have another wife?

702
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,584
No, Maicon. Not Julia.

703
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,836
Julia, your wife.
That fucking snitch.

704
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,505
No, you're making a mistake.
She has nothing to do with it.

705
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,717
And to prove you're not
together with her in this...

706
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,594
You're gonna finish her.

707
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:24,264
No, Maicon, Julia is my wife...
Maicon, my wife!

708
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,018
For God's sake!
You must be kidding me!

709
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,397
Am I fucking with you?

710
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,984
Do I look like
I'm fucking with you?

711
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,861
Am I fucking with you?

712
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:41,865
You choose, Henrique.

713
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:43,742
Either you finish the cunt...

714
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:48,288
or we do you
and then we do her.

715
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,751
Don't do this!

716
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:54,670
Look at me.

717
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,546
Look at me, you fuck!

718
00:45:56,797 --> 00:46:00,884
Stop crying. You point
this gun in her face...

719
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,178
- No, Maicon.
- And you shoot.

720
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,848
Shoot her in the face,
do you understand?

721
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,767
Shoot her in the face.

722
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:13,814
Here. This is your job.

723
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,946
Hi, is it open?

724
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,206
Ju?

725
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:17,627
I need to talk to you.
Where are you?

726
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:22,758
Mr. M wants to see us.
It's because of the robbery.

727
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,135
He didn't want to talk
over the phone.

728
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:29,222
He sent me a text
with GPS coordinates.

729
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,183
He's getting meaner.

730
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,744
Where are we?

731
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,789
It's really far.
I'm just following the GPS.

732
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,461
No, Julia, don't tell me
you're having a fit again.

733
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:04,299
I can't breathe.
I'm scared.

734
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,760
- Scared of what?
- Of having a meltdown.

735
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:10,597
Relax. This is just your head,
you're fine. Let me grab you a pill?

736
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:11,116
- Ju!
- What is this?

737
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,537
- What is this?
- You ruined our lives!

738
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,998
- Are you crazy?
- Why did you do it?

739
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,833
You're pointing a gun at me!

740
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,043
- Shut up!
- Stop it! Turn away!

741
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,670
Why did you...?
Turn away from me!

742
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,630
- Turn away!
- Calm down...

743
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:26,882
You ruined our life!

744
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:31,344
I didn't do anything!
Let me explain what happened!

745
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:32,596
Calm down!
Let me speak. Listen.

746
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,348
Calm down, remember everything
We've been through.

747
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,559
Let your heart calm down.

748
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:42,022
Are you calmer now?
What's wrong?

749
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:45,484
What's wrong?
Where are you going?

750
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:49,237
Come here! Wait!

751
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,714
Henrique?

752
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:16,097
Dear God.

753
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:34,533
That piece of shit robbed me
and he wanted to kill you!

754
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,117
- What are you saying?
- I found out.

755
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:39,579
It was this piece of shit
who planned the robbery!

756
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:41,915
- There's more...
- Are you crazy?

757
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,084
I called him and told him...

758
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,211
...that it you have
robbed the money

759
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,922
and to prove his innocence he'd
have to shoot you in the face.

760
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,592
- Asshole!
- Stop it, baby!

761
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:53,718
Are you crazy?

762
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:56,096
Asshole!
Why did you do this?

763
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,597
To be sure you were not
part of the scheme.

764
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,933
What if he had shot me?

765
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,478
I wouldn't let him do that
to my child.

766
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:05,564
- Don't touch me.
- It's a blessing in disguise.

767
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:08,358
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

768
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,585
- I need to talk to you.
- Excuse me.

769
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:29,337
Go check upstairs.

770
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,633
- Well...
- I miss you.

771
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:37,554
The baby is yours, I'm sure.

772
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,473
I know.
Woman's intuition, right?

773
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,518
- Yeah, you could say that.
- That's great, Julia.

774
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:46,396
So, what are you doing?
Have you talked to him?

775
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:47,814
Of course not.
Are you crazy?

776
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,775
- I'll fix your problem first.
- Don't worry about it now.

777
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,986
We need to be patient, baby.

778
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:58,033
You'll be so sexy, baby.
Don't even think about abortion.

779
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,202
- Hi, man.
- What's up, Henrique?

780
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,246
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

781
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,124
Your wife was telling me
about the solution to our problem.

782
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,585
- I was saying that...
- Let's take a seat.

783
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,422
- Come here...
- Get off me!

784
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:15,091
Look, you think
you're so clever, right?

785
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:19,929
So clever! How can you be so sure
that he planned this robbery?

786
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:23,266
Here, my love. Here!

787
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,852
Here, nigger. Look.

788
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:30,315
That easy?
There's even an address.

789
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,442
I'm calling Maicon.

790
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,570
We found this
at the asshole's office.

791
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:38,073
- So what?
- And the prick wrote down...

792
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,533
the number of the idiot
who did the job!

793
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,118
You're an idiot.

794
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,621
You're fine people, but nobody's
going rip me off like that.

795
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,165
- You're the idiot!
- No way.

796
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,794
Where's your money now?
Where is all the fucking cash?

797
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:53,254
- Tell me!
- Take it easy, baby.

798
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,924
It's taken care of.
Let's go home.

799
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,801
Let's get lost.

800
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:03,723
<i>Did you see
the TV show last night?</i>

801
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,058
<i>What TV show?</i>

802
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,852
The reality show.
Do you know who was eliminated?

803
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:10,605
It was the sexy blonde girl
or the queer.

804
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:13,608
<i>I know, the show you were
talking about the other day.</i>

805
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:15,068
Yeah. Did you see who got eliminated?

806
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:18,405
<i>- I don't watch it.
- I think it's all a set up.</i>

807
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:21,950
The dude's kicked out
and the blonde will...

808
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:28,498
<i>What happened, man?</i>

809
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:29,791
Talk to him.

810
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,085
They grouped together
to eliminate the guy.

811
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,586
What guy?

812
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,049
They grouped together
to eliminate the guy!

813
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,467
<i>What guy, man?</i>

814
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:42,053
They grouped together
to eliminate him!

815
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:45,598
<i>What are you saying?
Do me a favor.</i>

816
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:48,143
<i>Bring me my cell phone up here.</i>

817
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,938
No problem.
Where is your phone?

818
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,858
<i>I don't know.
It's on the table somewhere.</i>

819
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:58,361
- Say, you're taking it.
- I'm taking it up there.

820
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:01,781
- Say you're going up.
- I'm going up.

821
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:04,993
I'm coming.

822
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,289
The roof caved in!

823
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:13,960
Don't move, man!
Don't move!

824
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,712
Shit! Son of a bitch!

825
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,929
- What's up, Velinha.
- Who are you?

826
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:27,599
Santa Claus.
Bringing you a present.

827
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,934
Santa Claus doesn't do shootings.

828
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:32,937
Brother, I'll give you
just one chance.

829
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,733
I don't kill you,
and you give me my money.

830
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:39,152
Whose money, man?
I don't even know you.

831
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,780
- Who are you closed with?
- I'm gonna close you, nigger!

832
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:45,241
- Give me my fucking money!
- What are you talking about?

833
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,577
- Clayton!
- He's gone, my friend!

834
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,498
- What did you do to my brother?
- He's sitting on the Devil's lap!

835
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:57,921
Hey, loser, take this.

836
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,798
Let's fucking
tear the place down!

837
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:09,724
- Wait, brother!
- Want another round?

838
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:11,726
Look here! I'm done.

839
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,229
Let's talk this out, okay?

840
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:17,482
- You want some pizza?
- Son of a bitch!

841
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:28,868
What, it jammed?

842
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,918
That's one ballsy nigger!

843
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:39,587
Where is my money?

844
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,050
You're giving me the finger?

845
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,594
I'm gonna cut it off.
Bring me the sword.

846
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,888
It's in the car, Bola.

847
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,140
I didn't think
we were gonna use it.

848
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:54,310
We're in the middle of the slums,
it's dangerous out there...

849
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,563
And you want me
to go fetch a sword?

850
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:00,233
What's that in your hand?
Go get it.

851
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,527
Gonna do a fucking schedule
for the usage of this dawn sword.

852
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:04,028
Let me cut his head off.

853
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:07,657
You wanna cut his head off?
The finger is mine.

854
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,700
Deal.

855
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:12,537
So, are you telling me or not?
Will you wait for the sword to arrive?

856
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:19,043
Go look around, go on.
The fucker's not talking.

857
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:26,426
Hey, nigger, I'm gonna
castrate you like a poodle.

858
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,094
Get it?

859
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:36,978
Bola, I found the money!

860
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:42,025
You see?
It didn't take me very long.

861
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,235
He put the suitcase
inside the oven, man!

862
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,654
- It's nice and hot.
- Way to go.

863
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,911
Why did you change bags?

864
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:55,163
THE BAG

865
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:31,324
Velinha? Velinha?

866
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:34,661
Hey man! Come on in!

867
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:36,871
Velinha, Edmar came
for his portion.

868
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:38,706
- This is my friend Edgar.
- What's up?

869
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,584
- Who's that?
- That's good old Fininho.

870
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:44,295
He's my boy, you known?
A great partner.

871
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,713
Hey, what's that suitcase?

872
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:49,842
I told you.
We're sharing the cash...

873
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:52,428
but this Louis Vuitton bag
is for my mother.

874
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:57,850
With this kind of cash you can
buy the whole Louis Vuitton factory!

875
00:57:57,934 --> 00:57:59,477
- Look at that!
- Fininho...

876
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,188
Look at all that cash, man!

877
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:06,234
Fininho, thanks for that day
you helped me, okay?

878
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,694
- Velinha, man?
- Right?

879
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,487
- Thanks, man.
- What's the fuck, Velinha?

880
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,906
- What is this?
- Come on, Clayton!

881
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,410
This is for your mother, too.
She was there when I needed her.

882
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,662
It's all ours, brother.
You deserve it.

883
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:19,747
Fininho, come here.
Give it back.

884
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:22,041
US$ 600,00 for me,
you take the rest.

885
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,880
- Okay! Look at me!
- 007 in the house, man!

886
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,842
- Look at me!
- Shit, man!

887
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,428
- Totally 007!
- It's all ours.

888
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:35,930
- It was a pleasure, man.
- Thanks.

889
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:37,765
Good luck.

890
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,184
Just lost my patience with you.
One or two?

891
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:42,353
- One.
- Two.

892
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,648
Motherfucker!

893
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,862
- Suck it up your ass.
- Shit, man.

894
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,947
- Give me the cell phone.
- Fuck.

895
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:56,159
- Give it to me and shut up.
- Be quick, I'm low on credit.

896
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:00,705
Big Boss?

897
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,708
- Good evening, everybody.
- Good evening.

898
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:12,542
Today I would like to talk to you
about a theme that is always relevant...

899
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,679
at least in our country...

900
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,890
we're gonna talk about corruption.

901
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,396
Hello? Hi.

902
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,817
Okay, I'm putting it on now.
Okay?

903
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,361
Overbilling.

904
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,322
Tax evasion.

905
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,407
Buying elections.

906
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,326
Nepotism.

907
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,912
Buying judges, buying cops...

908
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,997
Bribery.

909
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:45,541
Money concealed
in underpants...

910
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:48,503
why the hell have we
heard those words...

911
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:50,755
and lived with those words...

912
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,967
for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
100, 500 years.

913
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:58,387
Why don't we do anything?
Why doesn't the situation change?

914
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:00,932
Suggestions?

915
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,309
<i>- Hi.
- Deputy?</i>

916
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:04,477
Hi, talk to me.

917
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,729
Maicon, here, I have your money.
This time it's for real.

918
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:09,190
Alright. Where will it be?

919
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,067
What do you mean?
The usual place.

920
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,653
- Jader?
- What, Sofia?

921
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:14,737
Your jacket.

922
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:16,155
<i>- Hello?
- I'm not wearing a jacket.</i>

923
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:18,282
<i>- Deputy?
- Okay.</i>

924
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:21,369
<i>- Say it, what time?
- 11:30 h.</i>

925
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,746
I'll be there. Alright.
Bye.

926
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:26,958
I was watching you on TV.

927
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,378
You know that deputy
that was with us in Manaus?

928
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:33,464
- What's his name?
- That's Hernandez.

929
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:36,425
Hernandez, that's right.
Hernandez.

930
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,095
I thought he was mocking you.

931
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:42,014
You known, when you
went up to speak...

932
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:45,643
I think he started to badmouth you
with that other guy...

933
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,478
He's just a queer.

934
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,440
Do you want anything, Sofia?

935
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:53,693
A little money.

936
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,444
- May I?
- Of course!

937
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:59,240
I'll give it to you.
How much do you want?

938
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:02,034
One, two hundred...

939
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:07,707
Well. I must go now.
Okay?

940
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,792
Bye!

941
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,718
Your ass is still nice and firm!

942
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:22,805
You will see what's good!

943
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,185
Ouch!
That's a sexy little ass...!

944
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,439
- Calm down. No, no, no.
- Why not?

945
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,025
- The play is over.
- Are you cooling me off?

946
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:37,987
Just for now, because you're late.
Did you forget?

947
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,697
Alright.

948
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,742
- I'm really late.
- That's right.

949
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:44,827
Come here.

950
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,540
No matter what happens,
I love you. Okay?

951
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,585
Bye.

952
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,690
Stop, stop.

953
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:17,526
Julia, come here.

954
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:23,532
Come with me to deliver this suitcase.
Hop in.

955
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:27,870
- Why is that?
- Cos you're beautiful, perfect.

956
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:30,039
Come on.

957
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,084
Are you asking me
or ordering me?

958
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:04,282
Deputy, this is Maicon.
Listen, we're changing the place.

959
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:07,535
Okay, Alright.
I know where it is.

960
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,370
I know.
I'll be there shortly.

961
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,788
Bye.

962
01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:52,997
Julia?

963
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,377
TWO YEARS BEFORE

964
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,545
<i>Julia loves the sea.</i>

965
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:47,301
<i>Hi.</i>

966
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,305
<i>I love the sea, you know.</i>

967
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,600
<i>She loves the sun.</i>

968
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,567
<i>A man's hand.</i>

969
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,905
<i>The wind.</i>

970
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,743
Do you want it?

971
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,870
No.

972
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,127
I love you.

973
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:27,258
What did you say?

974
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,136
- I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you did.

975
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:33,139
I heard you speak.

976
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:35,266
- Did I?
- Yeah.

977
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:38,185
- Say it again.
- I love you.

978
01:05:38,436 --> 01:05:42,106
I love you.
I said I love you.

979
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:46,193
- You can't say that.
- I can. I love you.

980
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:47,611
Out of the blue?

981
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:51,615
- It was not out of the blue...
- Why are you saying it now?

982
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:54,452
- I said it because...
- I know why.

983
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:55,703
Because it's important...

984
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:58,456
You're saying that now
because you wanna fuck me.

985
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:00,958
I'm warning you...

986
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,420
taking me over to your place
might me dangerous.

987
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:05,921
Why?

988
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:08,507
Oh, why?

989
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:13,053
Because we met in a shrink's
waiting room, baby.

990
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:20,561
So, we can be the Xanax couple.

991
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:24,273
Mr. and Mrs. Rivotril.
What do you say?

992
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,609
I'm in.

993
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:28,527
Yeah.

994
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,571
You wanna be that?

995
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,533
A couple of loonies
around town?

996
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:13,322
- Fuck!
- Watch out!

997
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:36,095
You suffered a big blow
to your head.

998
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:39,348
You need to stay
in the hospital overnight.

999
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,269
Son...

1000
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:47,189
- Julia...
- Calm down, son.

1001
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:49,984
- Julia...
- Calm down.

1002
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,033
Two people were killed.

1003
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:02,204
A seven-year old boy
and his mother.

1004
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:06,584
You'll have
to be strong now, son.

1005
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:16,468
<i>Justice in Brazil is peculiar.
People kill and steal...</i>

1006
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:19,763
<i>but there's always a way
to escape imprisonment.</i>

1007
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,807
<i>The sentence is commuted
for good behavior...</i>

1008
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,976
<i>or you only serve
one third of it.</i>

1009
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,228
<i>Sometimes you don't
even go to jail.</i>

1010
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:28,522
<i>That was my case.</i>

1011
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:32,693
<i>It was this friendly justice
that let me walk free...</i>

1012
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,530
<i>with a little help
from deputy Jader.</i>

1013
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:42,369
<i>Besides, in my case the judge
didn't want any problems.</i>

1014
01:08:42,453 --> 01:08:45,247
<i>He had other interests.</i>

1015
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:47,958
<i>Boats.</i>

1016
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,661
So?

1017
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:26,830
You didn't like my teddy bear.

1018
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,918
I loved this bear.
I think he's cute.

1019
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,671
But I want this bear now...

1020
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,382
who will never ever leave me.

1021
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,966
What?

1022
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:45,557
Say it.

1023
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:46,934
What do you wanna say?

1024
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:49,645
- You didn't miss me, did you?
- I really missed you.

1025
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:53,065
No, you didn't. You were very
well looked after. By two men.

1026
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,109
- Yeah, but I was thinking of you.
- I know.

1027
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:58,487
Hey, it's true!
I was thinking about you.

1028
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,117
Why did you have to leave?

1029
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:13,627
Well, let's go over the plan
one more time. You must...

1030
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:17,423
No, I don't want to go over
this plan again. I know all about it.

1031
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:19,383
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1032
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,887
THE PLAN

1033
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:26,265
<i>Ok, let's go over it.</i>

1034
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,434
<i>First I plant one ideas
on Maicon's head.</i>

1035
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,811
<i>You must be cold...</i>

1036
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,855
<i>with respect to this case.</i>

1037
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,651
<i>If you messed up and lost the money,
it's your problem, man!</i>

1038
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:39,069
<i>Fuck it!</i>

1039
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:44,158
<i>After chaos has taken over,
I collect all the evidence...</i>

1040
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:47,077
<i>and hand it to Rodrigues
at the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

1041
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:48,579
<i>He'll love it.</i>

1042
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:50,664
<i>That's when my situation
there will tighten up</i>

1043
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:53,417
<i>and so will Maicon's, consequently.</i>

1044
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,420
<i>At the Prosecutor's Office
there's no more way.</i>

1045
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,297
- They're watching me.
- I'll need to transfer you.

1046
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,135
<i>- Then enters Deputy Jader.
- Two million.</i>

1047
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:05,679
- Reais?
- Dollars.

1048
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:09,516
<i>When the deal is set,
you find someone to get the money.</i>

1049
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,602
<i>Ok. I'll do my tricks.
Then what?</i>

1050
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,103
<i>Well, with the money
in our hands...</i>

1051
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:17,191
<i>I'll find a way to link
Henrique to the robbery.</i>

1052
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,902
<i>I can plant something
in his office.</i>

1053
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:21,320
<i>I don't know,
I 'II think of something.</i>

1054
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:25,073
<i>We take the money and disappear!</i>

1055
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,075
<i>Freedom, man...</i>

1056
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:30,329
I'm worried, you know.

1057
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:32,998
About what?

1058
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:37,586
I fear what Maicon
might do to Henrique.

1059
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:40,464
I like him,
he's not a bad person.

1060
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:46,804
Nobody is bad.
Henrique is not bad.

1061
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,098
Is Maicon bad?
Is the deputy bad?

1062
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:53,560
Nobody is bad. People just
go the wrong way sometimes.

1063
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:58,857
That's why I believe in punishment...

1064
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:01,985
in real justice.

1065
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,571
- What?
- Punishment is the way...

1066
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:05,656
What do you mean?

1067
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:09,076
Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?

1068
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,744
You're not God.

1069
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,957
You're doing this
for the money, baby.

1070
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,501
At least I am.
I don't want this life.

1071
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,711
I want to be happy.

1072
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,214
I want to be free,
I want to love you.

1073
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,216
Don't you agree?

1074
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,427
Why are you so quiet?

1075
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:29,388
Why are you so quiet?

1076
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:31,306
Why are you quiet?
You tell me now.

1077
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,683
Are you hiding
something from me?

1078
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:36,103
- Of course not.
- I knew it.

1079
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:40,148
Little kitten, come on.

1080
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:42,651
Do you swear?

1081
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,361
I do. I do.

1082
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,280
Do you swear that
we'll get this money and leave...

1083
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,823
...and be happy, you and I?

1084
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:52,369
You and I
and this little being right here.

1085
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:55,831
I had forgotten.

1086
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,583
Really?

1087
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,668
I can't be smoking!

1088
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:02,504
I must stop this shit.

1089
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,386
Can I tell you something?

1090
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:11,972
You can.

1091
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:14,808
I want a girl.

1092
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,728
I really do.

1093
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:23,567
Answer... Answer...

1094
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,746
Aren't you going to answer?
Who is it?

1095
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:38,624
It's the bank manager,
I won't answer the phone.

1096
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,179
Answer it, girl...

1097
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:57,851
It's them.
Let's go!

1098
01:13:57,935 --> 01:13:59,061
Let's go!

1099
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,204
Julia, stop!

1100
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,124
Stop!

1101
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:04,668
Stop right there!
Not one more step!

1102
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:07,045
Drop that suitcase
and get out of there!

1103
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:10,215
He's armed! He's armed!

1104
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,081
What's up?

1105
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,667
Here.

1106
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,012
Hi.

1107
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,223
Hi.

1108
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:08,065
This is very fragile.

1109
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:17,199
You must place it in something
that he always carries with him.

1110
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,118
Do you think you can?

1111
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:22,871
Of course.

1112
01:16:36,343 --> 01:16:38,095
Who is this fuck?

1113
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:48,855
Down!

1114
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,982
- Maicon, Bola was shot!
- Julia!

1115
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:02,786
Edgar!

1116
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:12,754
- Come with me, Julia.
- You're gonna die, “Menudinho”!

1117
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:23,640
Fucking Stop right there!

1118
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,104
Oh, you punk!

1119
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:38,822
Come on!

1120
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:42,492
Stop! Stop!
Get out of the car!

1121
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:44,578
- Get out!
- Get him!

1122
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:52,502
Get down! Fuck!

1123
01:17:57,549 --> 01:18:00,510
Stop! Stop!
Come on, deputy!

1124
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:03,847
Go, go, go!

1125
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,557
What's that noise?
What's that noise?

1126
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,517
- There's a bomb in the suitcase.
- What?

1127
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,275
What the fuck was that?

1128
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,122
- Put the suitcase up here.
- I'm not touching it!

1129
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:30,832
- Put it up here!
- I'm not touching it!

1130
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:33,418
Or else it will explode,
it has a proximity sensor!

1131
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:34,711
What?

1132
01:18:35,003 --> 01:18:38,215
If the deputy gets near it,
the suitcase will explode.

1133
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,555
Put the suitcase up here!

1134
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:04,241
Your Honor!
That's your million dollars right here!

1135
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,673
See you there!

1136
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:25,387
This is an ungrateful world.

1137
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,515
I saved this asshole,
and this is how he thanks me!

1138
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,853
He's getting near us!
He's getting near us!

1139
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:35,647
This thing is gonna explode!

1140
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,024
- I'm not on his tail.
- Faster, faster!

1141
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:51,663
The bus!
Watch out! Stop!

1142
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:59,754
Where did you
fucking learn to drive?

1143
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:02,549
- The fucking bus got in the way!
- Drive! Drive!

1144
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,142
Where did he go?

1145
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,728
Fucking punk!

1146
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:21,818
- Over there! That's his car!
- That's my suitcase!

1147
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,821
- That's my money!
- He must've run.

1148
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:30,744
Where is the prick?
Where is the prick?

1149
01:20:36,124 --> 01:20:38,585
Get you suitcase
and let's beat it!

1150
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,379
My money... My Money.

1151
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:17,082
What? A faggot?
No, never! He's a real man!

1152
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:18,291
It's a God's man!

1153
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,501
It's my hero!

1154
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:22,545
It's amazing his capacity,
it's marvelous!

1155
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:23,838
Exemplary citizen!

1156
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:27,300
It's terrific! He's a champion,
a total champion.

1157
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:29,594
Call me, Edgar.
Got my number?

1158
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,598
<i>We have confirmed that
the man killed in the explosion...</i>

1159
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,558
<i>this morning
in Baixada do Glicério</i>

1160
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:38,853
<i>was really the state deputy
Jader Kerteis.</i>

1161
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:42,399
Holy crap! Holy crap!

1162
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:43,775
Are you aware
that we are fucked?

1163
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:48,530
How could you place a bomb there
and not tell me?

1164
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:51,324
And I know this Maicon,
he is crazy!

1165
01:21:51,408 --> 01:21:53,493
He'll go to the end of the world
to get his money!

1166
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:57,163
He'll do anything to get his
money. You know that, don't you?

1167
01:21:57,247 --> 01:22:00,083
He knows who I am.

1168
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:03,378
- Give me the cell phone.
- I don't have it.

1169
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:06,047
- Where is it?
- In my pants.

1170
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:11,094
- Dad?
- Hi, son.

1171
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:13,221
I need to talk to you now.

1172
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:14,597
What's going on?
Where are you?

1173
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:16,683
- Is the restaurant full?
- More or less.

1174
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:19,394
- Walter didn't come to work.
- Don't leave there.

1175
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:22,564
Don't leave, no matter what!
I'm coming over.

1176
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:23,940
Bye.

1177
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:28,236
I'm going to the restaurant.
I can't leave my father alone.

1178
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,405
- You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay.

1179
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:32,198
- Are you sure?
- You stay here.

1180
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:34,325
- Will you be careful?
- Stay here.

1181
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,244
I'll be back soon.

1182
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:47,213
Dad?

1183
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:50,300
- What happened, Edgar?
- Come with me.

1184
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,844
- Why? What happened?
- I'll explain on the way.

1185
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:55,263
Explain what?
Something happened to Walter?

1186
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:57,640
- Is that why he didn't come?
- Yes and no...

1187
01:22:57,724 --> 01:23:00,018
- What do you mean?
- I'll explain.

1188
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,312
Explain what?
What's going on, Edgar?

1189
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:05,190
- What happened?
- We can go.

1190
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:11,654
Dad.

1191
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:13,990
Shut it.

1192
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,785
A presidential suite, son?

1193
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:20,747
Julia?

1194
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,418
My son, where did you
get the money for this?

1195
01:23:25,502 --> 01:23:26,878
Dad.

1196
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:30,924
Julia?

1197
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:33,218
She must've gone out
to buy something.

1198
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:41,309
Julia?

1199
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:48,900
Were you calling me, Edgar?
Nice photo, huh?

1200
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,278
What have you done with Julia?

1201
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,698
That's what I ask you,
my friend.

1202
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:57,992
Where is my money
and that whore?

1203
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:01,329
I don't know anything about
any money or any whore.

1204
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,541
I'll ask again.

1205
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:10,046
Where is my money
and that cunt?

1206
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,631
Get his old man!

1207
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:13,174
- Get him!
- What is this?

1208
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:14,717
Calm down!

1209
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:16,678
- Don't! Don't!
- Hold him down!

1210
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:28,064
<i>- Bring the old man here.
- Stop! Let me go!</i>

1211
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:29,399
<i>Wait, man!</i>

1212
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:31,025
<i>- Wait!
- Hold him!</i>

1213
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:36,573
- That's enough!
- Wait! Let's talk!

1214
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,408
- Hold him down!
- Wait!

1215
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:40,493
Gag him! Come on!

1216
01:24:40,577 --> 01:24:42,745
- Gag this old prick!
- Dad!

1217
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,998
Dad!

1218
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:59,804
- That's enough.
- We'll only bleed you a little bit.

1219
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:03,224
- Scalpel, Rato.
- Scalpel.

1220
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:06,394
Where will it be?

1221
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,730
- The spleen.
- I can get the appendix here.

1222
01:25:08,813 --> 01:25:11,316
The appendix will bleed
too much and he will die fast.

1223
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:12,900
It can't be...

1224
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:15,153
- So? Appendix or spleen?
- Spleen.

1225
01:25:15,236 --> 01:25:18,990
- It's not easy to get it right.
- Just fucking do it!

1226
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,534
Dad! Dad!

1227
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,208
Dad...

1228
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,544
- Injection, Rato.
- Alright.

1229
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:33,963
- Done.
- One down.

1230
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,090
Edgar?

1231
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:39,302
Your father suffered a small
incision in his spleen...

1232
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,678
he will bleed a little...

1233
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:44,766
but with this injection
he will live for more six hours.

1234
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:46,351
Okay?

1235
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:48,728
Is your father diabetic?

1236
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,271
Son of a bitch!

1237
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:52,148
Well, this way
you make my job harder.

1238
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,817
- We need to check his pressure.
- Six hours, Edgar.

1239
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,653
I'll wait for your call.

1240
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,531
- Bring the old man.
- We need to check his pressure.

1241
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:02,575
Fuck his pressure!
Just bring him!

1242
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:04,952
But we need to monitor him.
Cut it! Just do it!

1243
01:26:05,036 --> 01:26:06,579
Come on!

1244
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:19,759
Julia! Where were you?

1245
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:21,594
- Where were you?
- Are you ok?

1246
01:26:21,678 --> 01:26:22,804
Where were you?

1247
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:25,139
I was buying
some fresh clothes for us.

1248
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:27,266
I was looking from the hall.

1249
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,268
- Did you see my father?
- I did.

1250
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:32,689
They pierced my father
with a fucking sword!

1251
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,316
Is your father alive?
Is he dead?

1252
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:38,111
- I don't know...
- Is your father alive?

1253
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:41,864
- Are you hurt?
- I only have six hours...

1254
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:46,285
You're limping.
Did they hurt you?

1255
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:51,624
Walter?

1256
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:55,837
- They took my father.
- Why all this shit?

1257
01:26:57,672 --> 01:26:59,882
I need to do that thing
I asked you.

1258
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:02,427
Do you understand?

1259
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,721
Do you remember
everything I said?

1260
01:27:04,804 --> 01:27:06,597
Can I trust you?

1261
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:08,975
Here, boss.

1262
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:12,228
Say it, boy.

1263
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:15,481
Bet my balls that you would call.

1264
01:27:16,566 --> 01:27:18,860
So, I want to make a deal
with you.

1265
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:22,530
What deal? I'll give your
money back, what else?

1266
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:25,408
But now your situation's
got worse.

1267
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:28,161
Who told you
I just want the money?

1268
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:30,621
- There's one more thing.
- Say it. I'm listening;

1269
01:27:30,705 --> 01:27:34,333
<i>The girl is the only thing
that's non-negotiable.</i>

1270
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:36,085
<i>The girl is mine.
Right?</i>

1271
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:38,212
So, that's what I have in mind.

1272
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:42,049
You are free. You and your father
can go to hell, I don't care.

1273
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:44,010
I only have half the money.

1274
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:46,512
- What about the other half?
- I've spent it.

1275
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:48,014
I got you.

1276
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:52,143
It's your compensation
for the girl, right? Okay.

1277
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:56,189
I'll let you have half the money,
pretty boy.

1278
01:27:57,482 --> 01:27:58,775
Is that a deal?

1279
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:01,110
I choose the place,
and only one car...

1280
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:04,071
If I see a second car, I quit.

1281
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:06,157
And fuck you all!

1282
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:15,249
They're here.
Come on, pickup the old man!

1283
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,001
Stop!

1284
01:28:18,169 --> 01:28:19,587
Stop! Stop!

1285
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:22,006
Stop right there, Edgar!

1286
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:35,770
Dad?

1287
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:38,898
- Get the woman here.
- Get off me!

1288
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,735
- Give me the bag.
- Edgar!

1289
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:48,324
- Edgar!
- I missed you, baby.

1290
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,745
You shouldn't have done
that to me.

1291
01:28:56,666 --> 01:29:02,839
So, Edgar...
did you enjoy my girl?

1292
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,720
You have balls indeed,
you'll keep half the money.

1293
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:13,140
Unfortunately, you won't
be able to use it.

1294
01:29:54,348 --> 01:29:55,766
Guys, to wrap it up...

1295
01:29:55,850 --> 01:30:01,188
I would like to read a passage
from a text I really appreciate...

1296
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:03,983
a text about death.

1297
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:09,030
“Death gives meaning
for our life...

1298
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:11,824
and even more importantly...

1299
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:15,953
death creates
a special value for time.

1300
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:19,624
If our time in this life
were undetermined...

1301
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:22,668
life itself would
lose its meaning.

1302
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:28,507
We would probably be butt-naked
and wielding spears.

1303
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:32,845
Death is nature's
most powerful agent...

1304
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:38,684
it comes to take away the old
and make room for the new. It is true.

1305
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,227
Our efforts to avoid it...

1306
01:30:40,311 --> 01:30:44,732
and turn our short stay here into
something minimally memorable...

1307
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:48,277
is our reason."
isn't it?

1308
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:54,700
That is, there is life
only because there is death.

1309
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:01,958
"La muerte".

1310
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,212
See you tomorrow,
ladies and gentlemen.

1311
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:37,785
The boy traded you,
did you know that?

1312
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:41,664
He sold you for half the money.

1313
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:45,584
That's the jungle, baby.
Every man for himself.

1314
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:53,426
But did you really think that
after all this I'd let you walk?

1315
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,389
Especially if you have
my son in your belly.

1316
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:10,192
- Maicon?
- What?

1317
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,155
Can I tell you something?

1318
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:16,282
Say it, baby.

1319
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:23,998
I lied to you.

1320
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,208
What?

1321
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:30,463
The baby is not yours.

1322
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:32,798
It's Edgar's.

1323
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:36,135
And there's one more thing.

1324
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:40,514
It's a girl.

1325
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:05,706
- Julia!
- Crazy chick!

1326
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,002
Stop! Stop!
Stop this shit!

1327
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:11,462
Listen, son!

1328
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:13,589
What about that red thing,
what the fuck is that?

1329
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:16,884
Well, this one is different,
want to see? I'll show you.

1330
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:18,969
This one, have a look...

1331
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:22,014
We connect and then...

1332
01:33:28,354 --> 01:33:30,689
It works the same, but as inverse.

1333
01:33:31,232 --> 01:33:33,317
Right, the same,
but I didn't get shit!

1334
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,027
Bye, see ya!

1335
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:36,612
Thanks, auntie!

1336
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,830
What happened, Maicon?

1337
01:34:34,712 --> 01:34:37,923
I don't believe it!
Son of a whore!

1338
01:34:42,428 --> 01:34:44,680
Now I'm gonna kill this bitch!

1339
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:22,027
<i>Sometimes we need stand away
from the paper...</i>

1340
01:36:22,236 --> 01:36:27,241
<i>...to understand the whole sketch
with more clarity.</i>

1341
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:30,953
2 YEARS LATER

1342
01:36:32,154 --> 01:36:41,654
