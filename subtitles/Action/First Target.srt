I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:02,510
He was a good man.

35
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:05,212
That number he gave you

36

37

<i>I mean, I'm a journalist,

This stuff is way
out of my league.

45
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,206
Do you know what your brother
did for a living?

46
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,976
He was a nonprofit lawyer
for the Grovener Foundation.

47
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:36,744
Danny wasn't a lawyer.

48
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,279
He was a counterintelligence
operative

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,815
<i>with the foreign service.</i>

50
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,483
Danny wasn't a spy.

51
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:44,118
No, he wasn't a spy.

52
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,753
He was a spy hunter.

53
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:47,788
<i>He was one of the best.</i>

54
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,557
So you worked with him?

55
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:50,992
No.

56
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,760
Well, not exactly.

57
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:54,095
Let me see that file.

58
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:57,965
Do you know how he died?

59
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:00,601
Um, cops said there was
no sign of trauma,

60
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,802
but heavy internal bleeding,

61
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:04,405
Like some acute
allergic reaction.

62
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,073
Nosebleed?

63
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,408
How did you know that?

64
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,677
Custom poison
fits the profile.

65
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:14,148
It looks like your brother
was following a Russian agent.

66
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,317
This russian agent
got to him first.

67
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:17,985
How is this possible?

68
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,720
Just 'cause
the cold war ended

69
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,188
Doesn't mean
all the spies went home.

70
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,124
<i>Look, Aaron, I know
this might be a lot</i>

71
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,759
<i>for you to take in
right now,</i>

72
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,193
but I think your brother
brought us together

73
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:27,795
so we could finish
what he couldn't.

74
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,298
Spies.

75
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,466
Custom poison.

76
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,702
I-I want justice
for my brother,

77
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:35,803
but I'm just a reporter.

78
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:36,971
I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

79
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,206
Right here.

80
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:45,112
The Russian embassy?

81
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,257
<i>So Danny knew the target</i>

82
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:58,426
<i>was going to a function
at the embassy today.</i>

83
00:04:58,427 --> 00:04:59,627
All I got to do
is just go in

84
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,095
like Danny was planning to
and catch him.

85
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,097
Yeah, but you're leaving out
a couple of important details.

86
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,433
For one, Danny knew
who the hell he was looking for.

87
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,334
And two,
he had time to plan.

88
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,636
<i>You, on the other hand,
are looking for a ghost</i>

89
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,771
with only a couple of hours.

90
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,740
True, but I have Danny's notes,
and one advantage--

91
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,875
the spy thinks that the only guy
who could catch him is dead.

92
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:15,943
He won't be expecting me.

93
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,711
All we gotta do
is get in there,

94
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,913
identify the threat,
eliminate it

95
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,381
without causing
an international incident.

96
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,650
It wouldn't be the first time
we caused one.

97
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,651
Hey, dude.

98
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:24,919
Who are you?

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,854
I count
at least 50 soldiers

100
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,522
and security goons
on the embassy grounds alone.

101
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:29,523
<i>Breaking in's
not an option,</i>

102
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:32,326
not even for me.

103
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,828
Yeah, but even if you could,

104
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,496
I'm not sure these notes
are gonna be a huge help

105
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,897
in finding Danny's killer.

106
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:38,399
No, they're all
in some kind of code.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,667
Code?

108
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,135
Cool.

109
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,670
This guy, Alexei Volkov--

110
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,038
He shows up
all over Danny's notes.

111
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,874
It's as good a place
as any to start.

112
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,843
Yeah, um, listen,

113
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:51,712
Do you mind excusing us
for a moment?

114
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,885
Listen, don't tell me
to take a breath

115
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,553
or tell me how hard
this is gonna be.

116
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:00,855
I know he was a friend.

117
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:03,991
No, I told you stories
of what happened in Kosovo.

118
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,993
Danny was the only guy
that would come back

119
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:09,396
And get me and pristina
during the shelling.

120
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:11,565
The idea
that he died alone?

121
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:12,867
His killer's
still out there.

122
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,568
I can't live with that.

123
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,737
Look, we're talking
about invading

124
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:19,340
Sovereign Russian soil
on a high-security day.

125
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,574
Now, look, we can do it.

126
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,710
I'm just saying,
let's be smart about it.

127
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,045
Take our time, plan it out.

128
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:28,549
Danny's killer's gonna be
inside that embassy today.

129
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,419
I don't care
what their security looks like.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,155
I'm gonna go in
and get him.

<i>So Volkov is chief

00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:13,097
Yeah.

163
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,599
The department of defense
put me on the list.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,034
Maybe they can help.

165
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:17,935
I'll try the D.O.D.
social office for you.

166
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,604
Do you know who put you
on the list there?

167
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,039
Uh, Fred Galvis.

168
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:26,110
The Secretary of Defense?

169
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:29,013
Yeah, he asked me to make
the rounds for him here tonight.

170
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,384
<i>All right, listen.</i>

171
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,952
<i>I put a call
into Galvis' office</i>

172
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,154
<i>to give him a heads-up.</i>

173
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,556
<i>But I ended up
having to leave word.</i>

174
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,058
Hopefully, he's not still
holding a grudge

175
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,492
after what you did
to his boat...

176
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,227
<i>and his house.</i>

177
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:44,929
<i>Oh, God,
and that poor horse.</i>

178
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,831
Well, maybe the horse
wasn't really your fault.

179
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,266
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

180
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,268
Peter Blanchard from state
calling for the secretary.

181
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:51,803
<i>It's about a guest
at today's event</i>

182
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:52,804
<i>At the Russian embassy,</i>

183
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,038
A Mr. Baxter.

184
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,406
C.C.

185
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:56,941
C.C. Baxter.

186
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,976
<i>I'm sure he's quite busy,</i>

187
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,812
<i>but if you could just...</i>

188
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,280
<i>Oh.
Yeah, I'll hold.</i>

189
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,819
Mr. Secretary.

190
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,854
Uh, of course.

191
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,956
<i>I-I'll do
what I can. I...</i>

192
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:15,760
He wants to talk to you.

193
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,894
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,229
<i>Mr. Chance,</i>

195
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,964
<i>I don't know what it is
you're up to,</i>

196
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,999
<i>and I'm not sure
I want to know.</i>

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,368
<i>but you said that you'd
ask for a favor,</i>

198
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,637
<i>and I honor my commitments.</i>

199
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,973
Thank you, sir.

200
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,577
He wants to speak
with you.

201
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:36,748
Mr. Secretary?

202
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:41,319
How exactly do you guys know
the Secretary of Defense?

203
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,222
He wasn't always
the Secretary of Defense, and...

204
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,656
You're not
our first client.

205
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,959
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

206
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:50,461
Please enjoy yourself.

207
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,662
Thanks.

208
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:55,133
Excuse me, Mr. Baxter.

209
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,435
I thought you'd like to know
your guest has already arrived.

210
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,505
Guest?

211
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,540
Great.

212
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,842
<i>Wait a minute.
What guest?</i>

213
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:06,043
Well, whoever it is,
they're gonna be

214
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,179
looking for Danny's face,
not mine.

215
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,381
Fine, stick with Volkov.

216
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,083
<i>I'm not exactly sure
if he's our spy our not,</i>

217
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:13,918
<i>but like you said,
he's all over Danny's notes.</i>

218
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,919
So...

219
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,521
Just see
where he leads you.

220
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,789
What about you?

221
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,056
You having any luck
breaking Danny's code?

222
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,292
It's a simple
beaufort null cipher, dude.

223
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:22,593
Piece of cake.

224
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,029
What, weren't you
ever a boy scout?

225
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,731
No. Were you?

226
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,800
Order of the arrow,
troop 337.

227
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,401
Do a good turn daily.

228
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,807
Hey, 121467.
What--what's that mean?

229
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:38,009
Don't know.
Still working on it.

230
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,111
I thought you said
it was simple.

231
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:41,379
It's not a code, all right?

232
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,581
It's something else--
a password or something.

233
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:44,749
Well, obviously
it's important.

234
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,018
Look, it's on the line
three times.

235
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,252
What about all these words
surrounding them?

236
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,754
Maybe that'll give it
some context.

237
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,923
Respect
personal space, dude.

238
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,431
"insulin, charcoal...

239
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:02,333
Atropine, pRussian blue."

240
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:03,367
Wait a minute,
aren't these all--

241
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,602
Treatments for poison?
Yeah.

242
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:07,138
Didn't help Danny, did it?

243
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,508
Sorry.

244
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,682
Looks like the guy was trying
to piece things together.

245
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,550
He was closing in
on this guy named Raven.

246
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,019
That's probably
the code name to our spy.

247
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,921
Mm-hmm, and Danny
also thought

248
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,389
he may have had
the antidote with him.

249
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,557
Look.

250
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:28,593
It's common practice.

251
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,862
Look, if you were handling
a substance like that,

252
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,630
Wouldn't you maybe want to have
the antidote close by,

253
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,232
just in case
you got any on you?

254
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:46,177
Dude.

255
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,648
Chance...

256
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,917
<i>Chance,
we have a problem.</i>

257
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,219
I think whoever poisoned Danny
also got to Aaron.

258
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,755
You sure?

259
00:12:57,756 --> 00:12:59,724
Chance, this is Guerrero.
I'm sure.

260
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,058
Listen, Guerrero,

261
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,159
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

262
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,394
<i>Retrace Aaron's steps.</i>

263
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,062
See if you can find out
where it happened,

264
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:06,898
Maybe identify the poison.

265
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,499
Oh, he's way
ahead of you, apparently.

266
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,601
Anything in Danny's notes
about an antidote?

267
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:13,571
Only somebody named Raven
may actually have the antidote.

268
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:16,140
<i>Raven may be
the code name for our spy.</i>

269
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:18,309
Well, right now
we have only one suspect.

270
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,646
I think it's time Volkov and I
had a little chat.

271
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,281
Hurry.

272
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:31,923
♪ ♪

273
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,659
Looks like most of the exits
have a key-card access.

274
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,294
I'm gonna have
to liberate one of those.

275
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,762
Just give me a minute,
will you?

276
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,563
I need to create
a little distraction.

277
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,904
C.C. Baxter?

278
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:50,775
You're late.

279
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,576
And not at all
what I expected.

280
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,649
<i>Man, I hope you're not
waiting on my help on this.</i>

281
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,818
Thanks.
Um, I'm sorry.

282
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,887
Are you sure you have
the right guy?

283
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:04,789
Security said you'd arrived,
pointed you right out.

284
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,157
And you are...?

285
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,960
Carrie Jacobs...

286
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,861
Your guest.

287
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,897
Carrie, of course.

288
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:15,066
<i>Oh, man, I don't like
this at all.</i>

289
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,902
<i>Why in the hell would Danny
have invited a guest?</i>

290
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:19,236
There's not much
happening here.

291
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:21,005
Why don't we take
a quick walk outside,

292
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,173
Get to know each
other better?

293
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,180
Excuse me
just a minute.

294
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,181
Mm-hmm.

295
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,148
She's a hooker.

296
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,550
I beg your pardon?

297
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:33,551
<i>Danny must have hired her.</i>

298
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,686
Why would Danny
have hired her?

299
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:36,821
'cause he's a degenerate,

300
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:39,023
Partly because
arm candy is good cover.

301
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,291
Showing up alone
attracts attention.

302
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,094
Is everything all right?

303
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:44,895
Yeah. L-listen, I...

304
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,931
I'm not gonna be
needing a date...

305
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,667
tonight, but, um...

306
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,701
thanks for coming.

307
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:53,337
Uh...

308
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,639
I'm sorry, you...

309
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,441
You think
I'm a prostitute?

310
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:59,143
A $40 prostitute?

311
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,444
Well, I--

312
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,579
Oh!

313
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,198
Got him.

314
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,633
<i>Great, see where he leads you.</i>

315
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,101
<i>I'll check on Guerrero</i>

316
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:25,536
<i>and see if he's gotten
into Aaron's apartment yet.</i>

317
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:02,940
Hi.

318
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,876
Feedin' the cat.

319
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:06,811
Ah.

320
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,022
Closing in.
Stand by.

321
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,874
Who's he talking to?

322
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,675
Spetsnas.

323
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,911
<i>Special forces
to guard a cocktail party?</i>

324
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,713
That's overkill,
even for these guys.

325
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:17,982
They know something's
going down today.

326
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,283
Uh-huh.

327
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,896
That was a close one.

328
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:08,332
Volkov's got the heavy hitters
together for something.

329
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,167
He was talking
about trying to apprehend

330
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,236
an unknown subject.

331
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,738
You know what I'm thinking?

332
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:17,241
<i>That they're looking
for the same spy we are.</i>

333
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,811
They're looking
for the same spy we are.

334
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,506
<i>Looks like a guard roster.</i>

335
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,542
They're not kidding around.

336
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:54,545
Whoever Danny's target is,
the Russians want him bad.

337
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,924
<i>Winston...</i>

338
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,859
Hang on a second.

339
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,361
What do you got?

340
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,962
<i>I just left
Aaron's apartment.</i>

341
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:14,732
The poison's here, dude.
It's airborne, and it's lethal.

342
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:22,006
<i>But Chance was in there too.</i>

343
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,308
Winston, we have a problem.

344
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,902
<i>You got in there not long
after Aaron did,</i>

345
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:36,671
<i>so I don't know how much time
that gives you</i>

346
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,839
<i>in terms of symptoms.</i>

347
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,407
<i>Which are?</i>

348
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,242
Uh...

349
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,044
Swings in body temperature,

350
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:44,412
Um, dizziness.

351
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:48,249
<i>Degraded dexterity
and motor skills.</i>

352
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,551
Chance?

353
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,220
<i>Chance, are you
still reading?</i>

354
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,055
Still here,
just not listening.

355
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,357
<i>Hey, ignoring this is not
gonna make it go away.</i>

356
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:57,558
<i>Now, we may need
to change the plan</i>

357
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,659
<i>and get you out of there.</i>

358
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,894
There's only one way
out of here.

359
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:01,262
I find the threat
before the Russians do,

360
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,765
or Aaron and I
run out of time.

361
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,300
There are two things
I know to be true.

362
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,668
If I were a prostitute,

363
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:09,570
I'd be a damn
expensive one.

364
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,406
And you are not
C.C. Baxter.

365
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,607
Did the hooker just punch you
in the face?

366
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,810
I don't think
she's a prostitute.

367
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,302
Okay, let's--

368
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,407
Last night
Danny turns up dead,

369
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,409
And then you turn up
using his cover.

370
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,911
Doesn't take a genius
to figure out

371
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,245
You're the spy
we've been hunting.

372
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,246
We?

373
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,614
Now you're gonna
come with me,

374
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:54,715
and we're gonna
exit the embassy,

375
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,951
And you're gonna answer
my questions.

376
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,586
No, I'm not.

377
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:01,189
One, I'm not a spy.
I'm a friend of Danny's.

378
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,492
Two, the femoral artery bleeds
just as fast as the jugular.

379
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,628
And three, I've been poisoned by
the spy that you're looking for.

380
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:08,963
I don't find him, I die.

381
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,064
So I think maybe we're looking
for the same guy.

382
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,499
Now, don't take this
the wrong way,

383
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,800
But I'm having a little bit
of a hard time breathing,

384
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,902
So can you just
get off of me, please?

385
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:26,547
I suppose you're one
of those scumbag mercenaries

386
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,249
that Danny always
talked about.

387
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,018
<i>Yeah, Danny and I had
some pretty good times.</i>

388
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,121
That's not
exactly what I meant.

389
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,655
You seem a little sheltered
for C.I.A.

390
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,491
Plus, you don't really
fight dirty enough.

391
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,593
So I'm guessing...
F.B.I.?

392
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,461
Emma Barnes.

393
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,363
I was Danny's liaison
with the bureau.

394
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:44,532
We were working together
to track down

395
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,200
a freelance spy,
codename Raven.

396
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,502
<i>He's been
a major security breach</i>

397
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,803
<i>for us for years--</i>

398
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,805
Stealing intel,
selling to anyone who'll pay,

399
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,207
and leaving a trail
of bodies in his wake.

400
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,542
Well, apparently,
he wasn't just a problem for us.

401
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,611
Volkov had a small army
on the lookout for him.

402
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:59,046
If the Russians
get a hold of him,

403
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,248
he'll give them
everything--

404
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,517
Classified information,
state secrets.

405
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:04,118
We'll never be able to stop
the bleeding.

406
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,853
Not sure how much I care
about that.

407
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,188
But if we're gonna
help each other,

408
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,123
I need to know
what was gonna happen today.

409
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:17,231
Raven stole the plans for
some kind of weapons prototype,

410
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:19,700
something the U.S. Government
would very much prefer

411
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,335
not to fall
into the wrong hands.

412
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:24,305
He's gonna sell those plans
here today at the embassy,

413
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,740
use this event as a cover.

414
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,275
If we don't catch him
making the sale,

415
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:30,044
which my intel
has going down at 5:00,

416
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,045
<i>he cashes out
and vanishes.</i>

417
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,880
And I lose my shot
at the antidote.

418
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:35,049
Let's get moving.

419
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,685
You first.

420
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,053
I don't ever turn my back

421
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:40,988
on someone
who does this for money.

422
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,524
<i>Well, I don't think
I like her very much.</i>

423
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,725
Neither do I.

424
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:45,760
I didn't get your name.

425
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,328
Sure didn't.

426
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,770
Well, it took you
long enough.

427
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:59,273
Feel free to bring it up
at my next performance review.

428
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,842
Hey, dude.

429
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,511
Is that a defibrillator?

430
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,580
Nah.

431
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,516
Yeah, sorry.
Didn't want to alarm you.

432
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:11,886
Maybe we should revisit
that idea of getting a doctor.

433
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,354
I've already reached out
to the guys I can trust locally.

434
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:14,689
One of them's dead,
the other's in prison.

435
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,192
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

436
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,098
You're sure you know
what you're doing?

437
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,867
You could say I got some
experience in this area.

438
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,543
<i>All right, Guerrero's here</i>

439
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,211
<i>working on deciphering
Danny's notes.</i>

440
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,547
<i>We'll see if there's any
information about the drop.</i>

441
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:42,250
<i>You're cutting it pretty close.
It's almost 5:00.</i>

442
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,252
Where do you think
security went?

443
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,153
Probably fanned out
across the complex,

444
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,154
looking for the drop.

445
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,489
Okay, if Raven goes
through the trouble

446
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,591
to set up a meeting
inside the Russian embassy,

447
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:53,628
Wouldn't he want to have it
in a place you'd least suspect?

448
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:54,795
It's gonna happen right here.

449
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:55,930
You still there?

450
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,565
I'm here. I'm here.
Go ahead.

451
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,634
<i>You're in a crowded room.
You want to have an exchange.</i>

452
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,901
You don't want anybody
to know about it. How?

453
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,370
<i>Well, for sure
you want to avoid</i>

454
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,971
passing anything
hand to hand.

455
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,307
Something hard to monitor.

456
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,408
<i>Uh, wireless,</i>

457
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,609
<i>Bluetooth.</i>

458
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,177
Hey, yeah.

459
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,379
<i>You know, that's it.</i>

460
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,080
That's it--
the exchange is gonna happen

461
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,615
<i>via bluetooth device.</i>

462
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:15,750
I got a pairing number
right here.

463
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,518
Give me that.

464
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,552
<i>Here it is.</i>

465
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:20,688
Try this--121...

466
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,457
<i>467.</i>

467
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,393
You got it?
121467.

468
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,861
<i>I'll give it a shot.</i>

469
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,398
Who are you talking to?

470
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,399
I like to talk to myself.

471
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,566
Do you have a cell phone
I can borrow?

472
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,737
Bluetooth connections
are harder to hack into

473
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:37,738
than phone signals.

474
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:40,508
Unless we have
a pairing code.

475
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:43,911
Phones are linked.
We're in business.

476
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:46,914
Raven's downloading proof
that he has the plans.

477
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:53,554
This isn't a drop.
This is an auction.

478
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:55,222
<i>Why sell to one buyer
when you can get a rom</i>

479
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:56,390
full of the richest men
in the world

480
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:57,625
<i>to bid against each other?</i>

481
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:58,759
<i>It's perfect--
when it's over,</i>

482
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,594
everybody just walks away
scot-free.

483
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,796
Bid's already
over $20 million.

484
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,297
<i>Bidders
are dropping off fast.</i>

485
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:04,632
If he makes this sale,
we lose him.

486
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,300
Bluetooth range
is only a few dozen meters.

487
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,635
He's gotta be
in these rooms.

488
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,903
Which one?

489
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:09,937
Let's find out.

490
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:11,472
Type in, "this transaction
has been halted

491
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,174
by the U.S. Government."

492
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,644
What if this doesn't work?

493
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:19,046
Well, you get to haul my corpse
to a federal prison.

494
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,930
Hey, there, pal.

495
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:02,556
"Victor Shukoff."

496
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,458
He was a big-time
oil magnate.

497
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:06,360
He must have been
the buyer.

498
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:08,596
Raven made sure we never
got to question him.

499
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:17,872
Don't move.

500
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:33,918
You're not
what I thought you were...

501
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,490
not a neanderthal.

502
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:41,659
The thing that you pulled
with the bluetooth back there...

503
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,695
very impressive.

504
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,665
I'm so happy
you're impressed.

505
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,002
And just so you know,
when this is all over

506
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,270
<i>and I get out of here,</i>

507
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:54,439
I am gonna make sure
that you are recognized

508
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,907
for everything
that you did here today.

509
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:58,977
<i>When you get out of here?</i>

510
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:02,313
The bureau will figure out
some sort of bargain

511
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,949
for my release, eventually.

512
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,618
And what about me?

513
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:07,952
Well...

514
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,223
The poison will kill me

515
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:14,125
before we can figure out
a way out of here.

516
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:19,531
But listen, if you need me
to do anything for you...

517
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:23,401
You know, after the fact...

518
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,303
Just let me know.

519
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,886
Hey!

520
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:31,970
what am I to do, hmm?

521
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,339
When a prominent
Russian oilman

522
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,474
Is found murdered

523
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:39,110
in my courtyard
of my embassy,

524
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:41,146
stolen Russian property

525
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:44,215
found in his possession,

526
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:49,387
and two americans found
standing over the body

527
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,224
with the murder weapon...

528
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:56,794
I am forced to ask myself
this question...

529
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,135
which one of you is Raven?

530
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:19,017
Hey! Hey!

531
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,452
Aaron. Aaron.

532
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,288
Hey, get in here!

533
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,262
Aaron! Aaron!

534
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:32,664
I'm pretty sure
he can't hear you.

535
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:34,098
His heart stopped.
I know.

536
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,067
We're gonna start it again.

537
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,102
The instructions?

538
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,271
You were reading
the instructions?

539
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:41,673
They put these things
on school buses now.

540
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,741
We're not children here.
We can figure this thing out.

541
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,244
You said you were experienced
at this kind of thing!

542
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,879
I got experience putting people
in this situation,

543
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,614
not getting them out of it.

544
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,450
See?
Get on with it,
would you?

545
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,451
Sure.

546
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:54,686
All right.

547
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,755
nothing.

548
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:02,927
Come on, Aaron, come on.

549
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:06,397
Thank God.
We've got a pulse.

550
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,132
Uhh.

551
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,968
Let's not throw
a party yet, dude.

552
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,936
<i>The poison's
shutting down his system.</i>

553
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,504
We bought him
a little time, but...

554
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,907
If we don't get
the antidote soon...

555
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,312
<i>neither one of us will talk
under these circumstances.</i>

556
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,814
We're being held
unlawfully.

557
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,515
You think we murdered Shukoff,
but if you checked our hands,

558
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,317
You wouldn't find
any gun residue.

559
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:29,187
<i>Proves nothing.
Maybe.</i>

560
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:31,489
But somebody in this complex
has proof on their hands

561
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,658
that they
fired a gun recently.

562
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,727
Now, if you puthe word out
that you're taking samples,

563
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:38,630
I guarantee you
Raven would make a run for it.

564
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:40,865
You're the head cop.

565
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,101
Think like a cop.

566
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:46,638
This is exactly
what Raven wants--

567
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,373
Danny's poison
to look like a Russian hit.

568
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:49,807
They frame us
for Shukoff's murder.

569
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,709
We're going back and forth
with each other

570
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,944
while he gets away.

571
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:56,281
You have every reason to lie.

572
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:57,615
Why should I believe you?

573
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:13,998
Listen...

574
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:17,368
I'm a friend
of Raven's last victim.

575
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:21,306
Thing is,
I've been poisoned too.

576
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,707
And I've got...

577
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,076
30 minutes
or less to live.

578
00:31:25,077 --> 00:31:26,978
Now, everything's out.
We're all telling the truth.

579
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,714
And we all want
the same thing.

580
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,992
The state department liaison

581
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:42,627
is demanding access
to see you.

582
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:47,598
Watch them.

583
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,035
Are you out of your mind?

584
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,603
You just compromised my cover
on my entire project.

585
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,272
And for what?
To save your own butt.

586
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,974
Well, I'm kind of
attached to it.

587
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:59,377
But that's not what
I'm thinking about right now.

588
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,912
No? What's that?

589
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:02,547
How does he know we're here?

590
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,852
The two of you all right?

591
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,854
So far.

592
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,090
I want you to know
I'm going to formally protest

593
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,391
<i>the treatment
you've received here.</i>

594
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,726
This is outrageous!

595
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,060
Mr. Blanchard,

596
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,196
I agreed to allow you access
to see these two,

597
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,998
<i>to show that they have
not been mistreated.</i>

598
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:22,734
If we can agree
this is the case,

599
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,369
then I will
ask you to leave.

600
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,536
I can't agree to that.

601
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,839
You've caught
two american spies here.

602
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,007
How can I be sure if I leave,
they'll be treated fairly?

603
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:31,442
We're not spies.

604
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,277
Of course you are--

605
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:34,779
A spy known as Raven,

606
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,581
<i>Caught in the act,</i>

607
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,582
and who, when captured,

608
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,916
managed to kill
three soldiers

609
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,985
and the chief of security.

610
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:03,641
Where's the antidote, Raven?

611
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:38,973
What are you doing?

612
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,875
Looking for keys.

613
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,110
Can't we just pick it?

614
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:46,714
Right. Next idea.

615
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,719
Did you get all that?

616
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,288
I didn't get much,
but I heard gunfire.

617
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,355
You all right?

618
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:55,723
<i>For the most part.</i>

619
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,158
Blanchard's got a key on him.

620
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:00,595
Potomac Motor Inn,
room 12.

621
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,297
<i>It's right down the road.</i>

622
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:03,932
Maybe he's got the antidote
stashed in there.

623
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,233
<i>All right, room 12.
We're on our way now.</i>

624
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,868
We'll pick you up
at the embassy, west gate.

625
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,540
What are you doing?

626
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,442
This doesn't look good
for either one of us.

627
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,911
There's evidence on this thing
of what just went down.

628
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:19,614
I can make my case,
clear my name.

629
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:20,582
Excuse me.

630
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:24,152
What are you doing?

631
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:29,090
Oh, what's the matter
with you?

632
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,159
The video of this entire thing
was stored in there.

633
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,727
I know. It's got my face
on there too.

634
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,095
We can't have that
floating around.

635
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:35,864
It's bad for business.

636
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,098
Sorry.
Sorry?

637
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,132
Sorry?
You're sorry?

638
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,868
How am I gonna prove
any of this?

639
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,703
That sounds like
a tomorrow problem.

640
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,770
Let's get out of here.

641
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:45,306
There's another exit.

642
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:47,408
Service entrance
by the east gate.

643
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,278
Damn it! They must
have found the bodies.

644
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,447
That doesn't look
promising.

645
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,060
Shouldn't I drive?

646
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,618
He's got to keep it cold.

647
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,667
Dude, I got the antidote.
I'm heading to you now.

648
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:45,426
Now what?

649
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,230
Don't even think about it.

650
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,264
You got a better idea?

651
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,947
All right,
we're going up and over.

652
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,865
Come on.
A little help here.

653
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:42,816
Come on, on your feet.

654
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:44,484
I need to get you
to the hospital.

655
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,719
I don't think I can get up.

656
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,221
No, you--you can't die.

657
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,555
You're my only witness
to this whole mess.

658
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,691
Witness?
I lost Raven.

659
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:52,059
I was involved
in an international incident

660
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,827
on Russian soil, and...

661
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,930
if I lose you,
then who'gonna back me up?

662
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,133
And besides that--

663
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:07,441
This is gonna hurt, dude.

664
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:08,542
Who the hell are you?
Ohh.

665
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,812
No one special.
Nice dress.

666
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,013
Let me see that.

667
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:14,615
That did hurt.

668
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:18,652
Come on, let's go.

669
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,687
Let's go!

670
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,323
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Sorry, lady.

671
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:25,525
How--how am I gonna
get in touch with you?

672
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:26,727
No, no, you can't
just disappear.

673
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,299
I'm--I'm gonna have
to owe you one.

674
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,437
See ya.

675
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,667
Russians are claiming
that Chechen terrorists

676
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,802
<i>tried to seize
their embassy.</i>

677
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,137
"an investigation continues

678
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:13,373
"as to whether the FBI
had an undercover agent

679
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,676
within the compound
at the time of the attack."

680
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,377
I'm gonna prove
what happened.

681
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,079
Ah, yes.

682
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,915
Your phantom witness, right?

683
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,084
Not a phantom,
a person...

684
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:25,786
with fingerprints...

685
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:30,357
That the lab
just pulled off of this.

686
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,663
All right, mystery man,

687
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:38,932
<i>Who are you?</i>

688
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:45,872
<i>Hey.</i>

689
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,575
Yeah?

690
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:49,543
You got a visitor.

691
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:55,816
Hi.

692
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:58,085
How you feeling?

693
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,754
Better.

694
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:01,722
Come on in.

695
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,299
I read your article.

696
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,202
Danny would've been proud.

697
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,136
Thank you.

698
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,307
And thank you...

699
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:21,908
For everything.

700
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,747
But I actually had
one more question.

701
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:28,215
Sure.

702
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:30,016
What?

703
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,918
I need to know--

704
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,454
Who was my brother, really?

705
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:40,160
He was a lot
of different people.

706
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:43,096
He was whoever he had to be
to get the job done at the time.

707
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,433
That's what made him so good.

708
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,301
No one could ever quite
pin him down.

709
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:50,704
It's kind of
the nature of the job.

710
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:52,773
Sounds lonely.

711
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:54,408
See, when you're
a guy like Danny,

712
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:55,876
You can't have
any attachments.

713
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:57,177
It distracts focus,

714
00:40:57,178 --> 00:41:00,547
Puts people you care about
in danger.

715
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,017
I'm guessing that's why
he never told you.

716
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:14,528
Thank you.

717
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:23,670
Couple of things.

718
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:27,140
One, if anybody asks,
we never met.

719
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:30,277
And if I call,
pick up the phone.

720
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:31,611
It might be important.

721
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,613
You got it.

722
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:34,781
Take care.

723
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,493
What's up with you?

724
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,595
I got an alert somebody
just ran your prints

725
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:49,763
at the F.B.I.

726
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,500
Oh, yeah.

727
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,268
It must have been climbing
over the wall.

728
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:57,504
I think I got my prints
on her side of the handcuffs.

729
00:41:57,505 --> 00:42:00,474
You left your prints?

730
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:01,675
Why the hell would you leave
your prints?

731
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:02,809
I didn't do it on purpose.

732
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,747
You didn't forget
to wipe 'em

733
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,349
So she'd have a way
to find you eventually?

734
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:12,853
I saw the two of you
before we picked you up.

735
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,387
You think I'd risk everything
for a woman?

736
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:15,555
What am I, 14?

737
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,591
So it was a mistake?

738
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,433
Yes.

739
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:30,203
You're sure?

740
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,806
Yes.

741
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,911
Winston, if I never
see that woman again,

742
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:39,146
it'll be too soon.

743
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:44,085
Uh-huh.

744
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:58,164
