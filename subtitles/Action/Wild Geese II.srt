00:00:46.35,00:00:47.70
He's a madman!

00:00:50.55,00:00:52.30
I must warn the President!

00:00:55.19,00:00:56.94
Giant spider!

00:01:07.83,00:01:11.51
And they say you scientists[br]are supposed to be smart.

00:03:24.35,00:03:27.23
The Iegendary Captain James West.

00:03:27.99,00:03:30.35
And I finaIIy got him aII to myseIf.

00:03:30.55,00:03:33.78
And sureIy you shouId feeI free[br]to treat him just...

00:03:34.51,00:03:35.78
...bad.

00:03:47.35,00:03:48.58
DarIing....

00:03:49.63,00:03:52.62
HoId on to that for me for one second,[br]wouId you?

00:03:57.63,00:03:59.70
GeneraI McGrath's boys.

00:03:59.95,00:04:02.38
Waiting for y'aII for a week,[br]you show up now.

00:04:03.07,00:04:05.87
You wouIdn't be working up here tonight,[br]now, wouId you?

00:04:06.39,00:04:10.35
Working? Now wouId you be working[br]if you were up here with you?

00:04:10.71,00:04:12.22
I didn't think so.

00:04:14.23,00:04:15.79
Wagon's coming!

00:04:22.19,00:04:24.55
Come on, McGrath's waiting[br]on this stuff.

00:04:34.31,00:04:35.95
Pack it up good, VirgiI.

00:04:36.19,00:04:37.70
Next stop, New OrIeans.

00:04:52.51,00:04:54.23
I'm not working!

00:04:55.07,00:04:56.19
ProbIem soIved.

00:04:56.39,00:05:00.91
You can't just ram a man's personaI[br]things into some hoIe Iike that.

00:05:01.15,00:05:02.71
Is that so?

00:05:03.11,00:05:04.78
I didn't mean it Iike that.

00:05:05.31,00:05:06.95
Damn, this crate's heavy!

00:05:11.03,00:05:12.70
Oh, Jim!

00:05:13.11,00:05:16.86
Much as I'd Iike to take credit for[br]that, you might wanna hand me my gun.

00:05:40.11,00:05:44.34
That was fun! Which one of you boys[br]wants to strip down and go next?

00:05:44.95,00:05:46.30
Bet you do.

00:05:50.23,00:05:51.66
Sure couId use some cIothes here!

00:05:56.87,00:05:57.83
WeII, weII.

00:05:58.23,00:05:59.66
We got us a shy nig--

00:06:07.43,00:06:08.23
Pants!

00:06:41.95,00:06:44.15
There was blood on the saddle

00:06:44.39,00:06:45.98
And blood on the ground

00:06:46.19,00:06:48.78
And a great big puddle of blood

00:06:48.99,00:06:50.55
All around

00:06:59.83,00:07:03.46
Oh, I'm so sorry.[br]That won't be possibIe. I have...

00:07:03.71,00:07:04.94
...tonsiIIitis.

00:07:12.23,00:07:14.38
I'm stiII waiting on my guns[br]and ammunition.

00:07:14.59,00:07:16.71
I see my men have brought[br]your merchandise.

00:07:17.55,00:07:18.43
GeneraI McGrath...

00:07:18.63,00:07:21.10
...your weapons are being deIivered[br]as we speak.

00:07:21.31,00:07:24.35
Now, shaII we go upstairs[br]and check the merchandise?

00:07:25.03,00:07:27.23
Direct me to the poot, sir.

00:07:27.63,00:07:29.91
I want something young and creamy.

00:07:30.15,00:07:33.22
A gamer that takes to the crop[br]and the spur.

00:07:33.43,00:07:35.82
You drive a hard bargain.[br]AII right, 50 cents.

00:07:36.07,00:07:39.19
I'm very fIattered,[br]but I'm just not interested.

00:07:39.43,00:07:41.63
You gotta be interested.[br]You're a whore!

00:07:43.15,00:07:45.90
I may be a whore, but I work aIone!

00:08:05.51,00:08:06.74
Now I'm working.

00:08:17.75,00:08:18.63
Ma'am.

00:08:24.27,00:08:25.54
Nitro!

00:08:26.43,00:08:30.34
This is not the way[br]you transport nitro!

00:09:14.47,00:09:16.27
What's your name, missy?

00:09:16.55,00:09:17.78
Dora.

00:09:18.47,00:09:20.03
My mother's name was Dora.

00:09:20.27,00:09:21.75
Oh, reaIIy?

00:09:22.59,00:09:24.66
What kind of Iady are you?

00:09:26.67,00:09:28.31
She's mine!

00:09:30.63,00:09:32.43
I feeI Iike a ditty.

00:09:32.79,00:09:34.46
Go on, girI! Sing!

00:09:36.03,00:09:37.38
Okay, it's a ditty.

00:09:38.43,00:09:39.86
''Sons of the South.''

00:09:40.39,00:09:41.74
Here you are.

00:09:48.83,00:09:49.87
Tempo.

00:10:10.31,00:10:11.43
Back on up, now.

00:10:24.35,00:10:26.94
GeneraI ''BIoodbath'' McGrath.

00:10:27.27,00:10:30.58
Sons of the South, come to glory

00:10:30.83,00:10:32.34
Sons of the South

00:10:32.59,00:10:34.07
Arise

00:10:55.67,00:10:58.90
That's a Iot of ham[br]for these skinny Iegs, Iet me teII you!

00:11:04.91,00:11:06.87
That's a new one. Look!

00:11:09.31,00:11:11.14
Let me out! PIease!

00:11:11.35,00:11:13.74
-This room's occupied.[br]-I'II say.

00:11:20.63,00:11:22.59
Don't Iet the ear frighten you.

00:11:22.83,00:11:24.31
I Iost it at Chickamauga.

00:11:24.75,00:11:26.18
ReaIIy? One can hardIy notice.

00:11:26.39,00:11:30.14
WouId you heIp me undress? I aIways[br]have troubIe undoing this cIasp.

00:11:30.35,00:11:31.75
Thank you.

00:11:35.55,00:11:36.38
What's this?

00:11:36.59,00:11:38.87
Why, it's a deep, deep pooI.

00:11:39.19,00:11:43.26
Maybe it's your oId swimming hoIe,[br]generaI. Are you feeIing sIeepy?

00:11:43.59,00:11:44.74
Yes, I'm sIeepy.

00:11:45.31,00:11:47.22
Now you'II be my IittIe doggy.

00:11:47.43,00:11:50.34
When I say ''speak,'' you'II teII me[br]everything. Understood?

00:11:51.23,00:11:52.14
Very good.

00:11:52.39,00:11:56.18
Which scientist is in that sack[br]in the other room. Dr. Escobar? Speak.

00:11:58.79,00:12:00.91
You can speak words, you stupid mutt.

00:12:01.35,00:12:03.91
Who do you work for?[br]Who paid you to kidnap Escobar?

00:12:04.87,00:12:07.07
No, watch the swirIing spiraI.[br]Watch the--

00:12:07.27,00:12:08.31
Bad dog!

00:12:08.51,00:12:09.70
Bad dog! Watch--

00:12:09.95,00:12:10.86
Damn!

00:12:11.11,00:12:12.46
Stay! Stay!

00:12:12.99,00:12:13.87
Bad dog!

00:12:18.95,00:12:21.62
Didn't mean to startIe you.[br]Looked Iike you couId use heIp.

00:12:21.83,00:12:24.11
Looks can be deceiving,[br]dark stranger. I'm fine.

00:12:24.35,00:12:25.62
I'm sure you are, ma'am.

00:12:25.99,00:12:29.35
Big, sturdy gaI Iike you[br]probabIy gets top doIIar too.

00:12:30.35,00:12:31.50
Here you go.

00:12:32.31,00:12:35.70
Run aIong. I'm gonna sing[br]my oId friend McGrath a IuIIaby.

00:12:35.91,00:12:37.26
I need him!

00:12:37.91,00:12:41.11
You got your money. Run aIong![br]Have a IittIe dignity.

00:12:41.31,00:12:42.38
West!

00:12:56.15,00:12:57.82
That'd be an awfuI career decision.

00:13:07.11,00:13:09.47
West! West! Go! Go get him!

00:13:22.95,00:13:24.18
Get Escobar out of here!

00:13:24.43,00:13:25.62
Stop or I'II squeeze.

00:13:29.75,00:13:31.34
U.S. Army! Stay out of my way, Iady!

00:13:31.75,00:13:33.26
I'm not a Iady! I'm a U.S. marshaI!

00:13:33.75,00:13:35.26
Stay out of my way!

00:13:35.47,00:13:38.86
''Get out of my way, get out of my way.

00:13:39.23,00:13:40.87
U.S. Army.

00:13:41.11,00:13:42.38
U.S. marshaI.''

00:13:42.59,00:13:44.02
Oh, dear!

00:13:45.67,00:13:47.50
FederaI agents inside, sir.

00:13:47.75,00:13:51.35
So Miss Lippenreider informs me,[br]Mr. Hudson.

00:13:55.35,00:13:57.50
StiII, I beIieve[br]good manners dictate...

00:13:57.75,00:14:00.39
...that we shouId send out[br]the weIcome wagon.

00:14:09.55,00:14:10.43
Now what?

00:15:02.39,00:15:03.98
Whoa, there, partner!

00:15:04.19,00:15:06.42
The war may have got you[br]40 acres and a muIe...

00:15:06.63,00:15:10.34
...but you can't just traipse into the[br]President's office. Give me that gun.

00:15:10.87,00:15:12.35
What, that one?

00:15:13.39,00:15:14.43
What about that one?

00:15:19.63,00:15:21.59
-That'II get you kiIIed.[br]-GentIemen!

00:15:21.83,00:15:25.14
Don't make Captain West any Iater[br]than he aIready is.

00:15:29.91,00:15:31.58
There've been a Iot of death threats.

00:15:31.83,00:15:34.55
The Cabinet made me hire[br]these damned detectives.

00:15:35.35,00:15:36.34
Drink?

00:15:36.59,00:15:37.50
Cigar?

00:15:37.75,00:15:39.47
Don't mind if I do, sir.

00:15:39.75,00:15:42.47
So I understand you Iet[br]GeneraI McGrath get away.

00:15:42.79,00:15:44.83
That's not exactIy the way it happened.

00:15:45.07,00:15:48.22
-Some haIf-a-sissy masquerading as--[br]-Artemus Gordon.

00:15:48.59,00:15:49.39
You know him?

00:15:49.59,00:15:53.06
Of course. He's the best marshaI[br]I've got. A kind of genius.

00:15:53.31,00:15:57.78
Gordon has proven himseIf as a cunning[br]operator, with a rapacious inteIIect.

00:15:57.99,00:16:00.55
Nothing wiII stop him[br]from compIeting a mission...

00:16:00.79,00:16:04.18
...except maybe the impuIsive actions[br]of a headstrong cowboy.

00:16:05.11,00:16:06.23
Who are you, mister?

00:16:06.47,00:16:08.43
What do you mean, who am I?

00:16:08.75,00:16:10.66
I am the President of the United States.

00:16:11.19,00:16:12.10
Wrong answer.

00:16:15.75,00:16:16.94
Who are you?

00:16:18.39,00:16:21.14
I am the President of the--[br]I'm Artemus Gordon.

00:16:22.03,00:16:23.35
How did you know?

00:16:25.23,00:16:27.82
The President went to West Point.[br]That says Harvard.

00:16:28.03,00:16:29.59
Very observant.

00:16:32.63,00:16:34.78
Somebody mind teIIing me[br]what's going on?

00:16:35.23,00:16:36.55
President Grant....

00:16:38.15,00:16:39.82
Sir, these are periIous times.

00:16:40.31,00:16:43.62
I was mereIy demonstrating how someone,[br]using the art of disguise...

00:16:43.87,00:16:47.78
...couId penetrate into the very boweIs[br]of the White House, sir.

00:16:48.03,00:16:51.26
You're cIever, Gordon. One day[br]it's going to get you kiIIed.

00:16:52.11,00:16:53.59
Like today.

00:16:55.07,00:16:59.38
And, West, not every situation caIIs for[br]your approach of ''shoot first...

00:16:59.63,00:17:01.30
...shoot Iater, shoot some more...

00:17:01.51,00:17:04.55
...then when everybody's dead,[br]try to ask a question or two.''

00:17:05.15,00:17:06.47
Working together wiII be good.

00:17:06.67,00:17:08.74
-Working together?[br]-With aII due respect--

00:17:08.99,00:17:11.74
You'II work the way your[br]Commander in Chief teIIs you to.

00:17:12.15,00:17:14.35
WeII, I was coming to that, sir.

00:17:22.75,00:17:25.71
GentIemen, America's top scientists...

00:17:25.95,00:17:28.59
...in the fieIds of physics,[br]hydrauIics, expIosives...

00:17:28.83,00:17:33.22
...aII kidnapped in the Iast year, and[br]aII by GeneraI McGrath, it now appears.

00:17:33.59,00:17:36.50
You two have been working[br]on the same case the whoIe time.

00:17:37.15,00:17:39.19
Why did it take so Iong[br]to figure it out?

00:17:39.43,00:17:43.14
One of us was trying to catch McGrath,[br]and the other was trying to marry him.

00:17:43.39,00:17:44.71
We don't have time for this.

00:17:46.19,00:17:47.83
OnIy one week, if we beIieve this.

00:17:48.95,00:17:51.18
''GeneraI Grant,[br]the scientists you seek...

00:17:51.43,00:17:53.86
...are in my empIoy creating[br]a weapons system...

00:17:54.07,00:17:56.43
...beyond the paIe[br]of contemporary imagination.

00:17:56.67,00:17:58.98
I suggest you put[br]your affairs in order.

00:17:59.19,00:18:02.71
You have one week before you wiII[br]surrender the U.S. government.''

00:18:03.07,00:18:05.87
The Ietter was deIivered today[br]with that cake.

00:18:08.51,00:18:10.71
-It's marzipan, isn't it?[br]-CarefuI.

00:18:13.35,00:18:14.58
It's McGrath, sir.

00:18:14.79,00:18:17.91
McGrath may be a vicious kiIIer,[br]but a mastermind he is not.

00:18:18.51,00:18:21.23
So whom do we seek?[br]After consuIting with InteIIigence--

00:18:21.47,00:18:24.27
McGrath is on his way to New OrIeans.[br]The Ionger we stay here...

00:18:24.51,00:18:26.79
...the farther he gets.[br]I don't need InteIIigence.

00:18:27.03,00:18:28.59
You'd rather reIy on stupidity.

00:18:28.83,00:18:30.58
I am Ieaving today for Utah...

00:18:30.79,00:18:34.54
...where the transcontinentaI raiIroads[br]wiII be joined at Promontory Point.

00:18:35.23,00:18:36.95
You two are the best I've got.

00:18:37.15,00:18:39.06
Put aside your differences...

00:18:39.27,00:18:42.66
...and find this madman,[br]whoever he is, and stop him.

00:18:43.39,00:18:44.90
You have one week.

00:18:45.47,00:18:46.38
Dismissed.

00:18:54.15,00:18:55.14
GentIemen.

00:18:55.47,00:18:57.35
The Wanderer is at your disposaI.

00:18:57.63,00:18:59.62
Engine number five, track six.

00:18:59.87,00:19:02.70
Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.

00:19:03.43,00:19:04.47
Thank you.

00:19:09.59,00:19:10.39
Figures.

00:19:10.63,00:19:11.59
My new invention.

00:19:11.79,00:19:16.50
The Bi-VaIve Interior Combustion[br]Twice-Exhausted Bi-AxIe Nitro-CycIe.

00:19:16.75,00:19:18.10
Save it. Got a train to catch.

00:19:22.39,00:19:24.35
Not if I catch it first.

00:19:46.47,00:19:47.95
Nice horse!

00:20:08.19,00:20:09.23
Gordon!

00:20:14.87,00:20:16.94
Stop the train!

00:20:23.19,00:20:25.31
Hey! I'm warning you!

00:20:25.55,00:20:26.95
Gordon! Stop the train!

00:20:27.55,00:20:29.46
Come in. Have a seat.

00:20:29.71,00:20:31.46
Stop the train!

00:20:31.71,00:20:33.70
Stop smiIing at me!

00:20:43.19,00:20:45.34
How nice of you to drop in.

00:20:46.07,00:20:47.22
AII right....

00:20:48.79,00:20:52.54
Let's drop the beards, the bikes,[br]the fake boobies.

00:20:52.79,00:20:55.78
Let's set that needIepoint aside[br]and handIe this Iike men.

00:20:56.03,00:20:59.18
As a matter of cIarification,[br]this is not needIepoint.

00:20:59.95,00:21:01.38
This is needIepoint.

00:21:02.03,00:21:04.59
I'm putting the finaI touches[br]on my Iatest invention.

00:21:04.83,00:21:06.82
I caII it The ImpermeabIe.

00:21:07.07,00:21:08.79
It's a vest.[br]When worn under cIothing...

00:21:09.03,00:21:11.99
...it can stop any buIIet,[br]fired even at cIose range.

00:21:12.23,00:21:14.59
-Is that so?[br]-But I haven't tested it fuIIy yet.

00:21:14.83,00:21:15.63
Guns.

00:21:16.07,00:21:20.11
I find them primitive and unnecessary[br]if one's done one's proper pIanning.

00:21:20.35,00:21:24.58
I have aIways feIt that aIIowing any[br]situation to degenerate into vioIence...

00:21:24.83,00:21:26.79
...constitutes a faiIure on my part.

00:21:27.03,00:21:28.07
WeII, Mr. Gordon...

00:21:28.59,00:21:29.71
...you faiIed.

00:21:35.23,00:21:37.62
AII right, Mr. West,[br]we'II settIe this...

00:21:38.23,00:21:39.66
...Iike men.

00:22:00.55,00:22:02.11
I Iove this train.

00:22:05.27,00:22:06.34
Cheers!

00:22:07.39,00:22:09.70
WhiIe you're down there,[br]feeI free to make use...

00:22:09.95,00:22:12.75
...of my Sub-Carriage Inter-RaiI[br]VehicuIar Egressor.

00:22:13.19,00:22:14.86
I designed it myseIf!

00:22:18.27,00:22:21.02
I've been thinking.[br]Maybe the President's right.

00:22:21.27,00:22:24.87
We shouId put aside our differences[br]and work together.

00:22:26.95,00:22:28.94
Fight each other aII you pIease.[br]Harm my train...

00:22:29.19,00:22:30.51
...I'II douse you Iike dogs.

00:22:30.75,00:22:32.63
That's my truffIe reduction sauce.

00:22:33.07,00:22:36.35
Let's get on about our President's[br]business, shaII we?

00:22:36.87,00:22:38.22
-Where to?[br]-New OrIeans.

00:22:38.51,00:22:40.71
Why don't we Iet[br]Professor Morton decide?

00:22:40.95,00:22:44.10
I don't need some nobody professor[br]teIIing me where to head.

00:22:45.11,00:22:49.02
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,[br]kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.

00:22:53.95,00:22:55.78
That's a man's head.

00:22:56.27,00:23:00.31
This magnetic coIIar was found about[br]six feet away, near his body.

00:23:00.55,00:23:02.27
StiII trying to figure that out.

00:23:02.51,00:23:03.58
That's a man's head.

00:23:04.19,00:23:08.18
According to the RetinaI Terminus[br]Theory, a dying person's Iast image...

00:23:08.43,00:23:11.58
...burns into his eyebaII Iike a photo.[br]Perhaps there's a cIue.

00:23:11.83,00:23:14.82
I give you Morton's Iast image.

00:23:15.07,00:23:18.43
That's a man's head.

00:23:26.23,00:23:30.62
Refraction of the Ienses causes the[br]image to appear upside down, so we....

00:23:39.23,00:23:40.22
That...

00:23:40.91,00:23:43.06
...is a man's...

00:23:46.11,00:23:47.10
...head.

How about this?[br]Come as my manservant.

00:24:32.71,00:24:34.54
Why, yes'um, Master Gordon!

00:24:34.79,00:24:38.54
I swears I'd be deIighted![br]I sing, I dance for you, sir.

00:24:38.79,00:24:42.75
I swears none of the white foIks'II[br]know I'd rather shoot myseIf...

00:24:42.99,00:24:44.98
...than pIay your damn manservant.

00:24:45.19,00:24:47.15
You must wear something.[br]It's a costume party.

00:24:47.35,00:24:49.02
This is aII I need to wear.

00:24:49.27,00:24:51.18
If you insist on a firearm,[br]I have something...

00:24:51.43,00:24:53.99
...you'II find intriguing.[br]I designed it to go...

00:24:54.27,00:24:55.75
...with this.

00:24:56.99,00:24:58.90
Jim West does not wear costumes.

00:24:59.19,00:25:00.70
Very weII. What's your pIan?

00:25:00.95,00:25:03.86
I was thinking I'd go[br]as a government agent...

00:25:04.11,00:25:06.15
...who'II kiII[br]GeneraI BIoodbath McGrath.

00:25:06.39,00:25:10.18
An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a[br]room fuII of white former sIave owners.

00:25:10.43,00:25:11.70
You'II win first prize.

00:25:11.91,00:25:15.34
Listen, the art of disguise is[br]what we need to get into the party...

00:25:15.59,00:25:17.47
...to find the kidnapped scientists...

00:25:17.71,00:25:21.10
...before they're forced to create[br]something that'II destroy the U.S.

00:25:21.35,00:25:23.99
You and I have been handpicked[br]by the President.

00:25:24.23,00:25:27.78
Our freedom is at stake,[br]and this is our duty as men.

00:25:28.03,00:25:30.67
You go as a riverboat captain,[br]and I'II be a saIoon girI.

00:25:31.43,00:25:33.99
Let me teII you something about[br]your art of disguise.

00:25:34.23,00:25:37.46
That night at Fat-Can's, it wasn't[br]difficuIt to see you weren't a woman.

00:25:38.15,00:25:39.47
I was propositioned by three men.

00:25:39.71,00:25:41.06
You Iooked nasty.

00:25:41.31,00:25:42.87
Just butt-ugIy.

00:25:43.11,00:25:45.62
I mean, your breasts were[br]hard and stiff...

00:25:45.87,00:25:48.86
...and stuck out Iike a coupIe of[br]rusty cannons on a sunken ship.

00:25:49.11,00:25:51.38
These breasts are a work of art.

00:25:51.63,00:25:53.90
AestheticaIIy[br]and scientificaIIy perfect.

00:25:54.31,00:25:55.54
They Iook Iike shit.

00:25:57.71,00:25:59.14
-Touch them.[br]-I'm not touching those!

00:25:59.39,00:26:01.11
Afraid you're wrong?[br]Touch my breasts!

00:26:01.35,00:26:03.07
Just one. Touch one!

00:26:04.63,00:26:05.86
Happy? I'm touching them.

00:26:06.11,00:26:07.18
I knew it!

00:26:07.43,00:26:08.78
Squeeze it gentIy.

00:26:09.11,00:26:12.34
Not that hard! Now you've shifted[br]aII the buckwheat around.

00:26:12.75,00:26:14.15
Buckwheat? That's your probIem.

00:26:15.63,00:26:16.42
What are you doing?

00:26:27.27,00:26:28.38
Now touch my breast.

00:26:33.27,00:26:35.22
That's what a breast shouId feeI Iike.

00:26:35.47,00:26:36.54
Very nice.

00:26:36.91,00:26:40.18
-Now touch yourseIf.[br]-Oh, my God, I'm hard!

00:26:44.47,00:26:46.11
I was just gonna jot down a note.

00:26:49.31,00:26:50.98
You couId put a gun on that.

00:26:51.19,00:26:53.07
Then where wouId I keep my penciI?

00:26:53.67,00:26:57.14
I think you underestimate[br]the convenience of a pocket.

00:27:24.79,00:27:27.14
What are you doing here, boy?

00:27:28.07,00:27:29.34
I sorry, sir.

00:27:29.83,00:27:30.94
I was hoping....

00:27:32.03,00:27:33.38
I was hoping I wouIdn't...

00:27:34.35,00:27:36.46
...have to break your nose.

00:27:51.59,00:27:52.91
White foIks.

00:27:54.71,00:27:56.35
Get your hands off me!

00:27:56.55,00:28:00.18
Put me in the dungeon with those smeIIy,[br]bearded men, but I won't get on that!

00:28:00.39,00:28:02.46
-You appIied for the position.[br]-A standing-up one!

00:28:03.03,00:28:04.54
I'm an entertainer.

00:28:07.47,00:28:10.30
Stop compIaining. You'II enjoy it.

Ma'am.

00:28:40.07,00:28:42.54
Are you here aIone, Mr. West?

00:28:42.79,00:28:47.46
I'm Iooking to surprise an oId friend,[br]GeneraI McGrath. You haven't seen him?

00:28:47.71,00:28:51.26
I don't think that name was[br]on our guest Iist. And I wouId know.

00:28:51.55,00:28:54.30
I am Dr. LoveIess' personaI assistant.

00:28:54.51,00:28:56.15
Dr. ArIiss LoveIess?

00:28:56.39,00:28:58.11
Funny how some foIks think he's dead.

00:28:58.43,00:29:01.55
Tonight is his coming-out party.

00:29:05.19,00:29:08.23
See anybody that Iooks famiIiar?

00:29:09.43,00:29:11.15
Matter of fact, I do.

00:29:11.39,00:29:12.58
I am jeaIous.

00:29:12.83,00:29:13.94
Don't be.

00:29:18.59,00:29:21.34
Meet me Iater in the foyer.

00:29:26.47,00:29:30.75
Mine eyes have seen the glory[br]Of the coming of the Lord

00:29:31.11,00:29:35.42
He is trampling out the vintage[br]Where the grapes of wrath are stored

00:29:35.67,00:29:39.95
He has loosed the fateful lightning[br]Of His terrible swift sword

00:29:40.23,00:29:44.67
His truth is marching on

00:30:01.35,00:30:05.02
Don't you just hate that song?

00:30:12.83,00:30:16.06
Why, y'aII Iook Iike[br]you've seen a ghost.

00:30:16.71,00:30:19.38
It's me, dear friends.

00:30:20.11,00:30:22.02
AIive and kicking.

00:30:23.03,00:30:25.22
WeII, aIive, anyway.

00:30:26.11,00:30:27.46
We may have Iost the war...

00:30:27.87,00:30:31.18
...but heaven knows we haven't Iost[br]our sense of humor.

00:30:33.19,00:30:35.54
No, not even when we Iost a Iung...

00:30:35.83,00:30:37.31
...a spIeen...

00:30:37.55,00:30:39.03
...a bIadder...

00:30:39.27,00:30:41.15
...two Iegs...

00:30:41.35,00:30:44.23
...35 feet of smaII intestine...

00:30:44.47,00:30:48.98
...and our abiIity to reproduce,[br]aII in the name of the South!

00:30:49.23,00:30:52.43
Do we ever Iose our sense of humor?

00:30:54.99,00:30:57.87
Now, I owe a deep debt of gratitude...

00:30:58.11,00:31:01.02
...to our friends from across the sea[br]for their comfort...

00:31:01.23,00:31:03.03
...and kindness.

00:31:04.39,00:31:06.66
So mi casa es su casa !

00:31:09.47,00:31:12.70
Let the party begin!

00:31:15.39,00:31:16.90
Mr. West.

00:31:21.47,00:31:23.06
How nice of you to join us...

00:31:23.31,00:31:26.03
...and add coIor[br]to these monochromatic proceedings.

00:31:26.27,00:31:27.70
When one comes back[br]from the dead...

00:31:27.95,00:31:30.46
...I find that an occasion to stand up,[br]be counted.

00:31:31.55,00:31:35.83
Miss East informs me that you expected[br]to see GeneraI McGrath here.

00:31:36.07,00:31:37.30
I knew him years ago...

00:31:37.51,00:31:40.94
...but I haven't seen him[br]in a coon's age.

00:31:41.99,00:31:44.26
It'd be difficuIt[br]for a man of your stature...

00:31:44.51,00:31:46.66
...to keep in touch with[br]even haIf the peopIe you know.

00:31:47.47,00:31:51.86
Perhaps Miss East wiII keep you from[br]being a sIave to your disappointment.

00:31:52.35,00:31:54.91
BeautifuI women encourage you[br]one minute...

00:31:55.15,00:31:57.03
...then cut the Iegs out[br]from under you.

00:31:57.27,00:31:59.22
Quite. WiII you excuse me?

00:32:00.87,00:32:01.90
Thank you.

00:32:38.35,00:32:41.50
You're in for a big surprise[br]when you get this one in the saddIe.

00:32:43.23,00:32:44.79
Stupid cowboy!

00:32:45.27,00:32:47.07
He mistake you for me.

00:32:54.43,00:32:56.90
Dr. LoveIess, our cause is[br]in a grave situation.

00:32:57.11,00:33:01.31
Since the nitro and guns were destroyed,[br]Iice and demoraIization has set in--

00:33:01.55,00:33:03.58
GeneraI McGrath, if I may interrupt.

00:33:03.87,00:33:06.46
Your men wiII have[br]their weapons tonight...

00:33:06.71,00:33:11.30
...and they wiII be part of the greatest[br]miIitary victory of this century.

00:33:11.55,00:33:13.30
So have your men...

00:33:13.71,00:33:14.70
...here...

00:33:17.47,00:33:18.79
...at 1 0:00 tonight.

00:33:20.79,00:33:22.70
You, sir, are a pip.

00:33:23.15,00:33:25.62
I'd foIIow you into[br]the jaws of Cerberus hisseIf.

00:33:26.19,00:33:27.75
And so you shaII.

00:34:03.55,00:34:06.11
PIease! Somebody heIp me out!

00:34:30.83,00:34:33.82
I said to meet me in the foyer.

00:34:34.23,00:34:35.38
Foyer?

00:34:35.75,00:34:37.94
I've never been much good with French.

00:34:43.35,00:34:44.67
Au contraire.

00:34:46.63,00:34:48.74
So Iet's see, Mr. West.

00:34:49.67,00:34:52.74
Are you a dangerous spy of some sort...

00:34:52.99,00:34:55.63
...or just a handsome cowboy...

00:34:56.03,00:34:56.86
...who Iikes to...

00:34:57.67,00:34:58.99
...poke around?

00:35:00.03,00:35:01.91
I beIieve I'm that second one.

00:35:04.79,00:35:06.62
East and West.

00:35:09.47,00:35:12.19
Never the twain shaII meet.

00:35:39.75,00:35:43.14
First, I'd Iike to reiterate[br]that you make one ugIy woman.

00:35:44.67,00:35:47.58
Second, whiIe you were out here,[br]I found out Dr. LoveIess...

00:35:47.83,00:35:50.14
...is meeting McGrath and his troops[br]in an hour.

00:35:50.39,00:35:52.27
You go right ahead, enjoy the party.

00:35:52.51,00:35:54.07
I'm gonna save the RepubIic.

00:35:54.31,00:35:57.14
By the way, boobies Iook great tonight.[br]Nice and perky!

00:36:01.31,00:36:02.71
Hang him!

00:36:11.83,00:36:16.22
We need to teach y'aII a Iesson[br]about how to behave in poIite society.

00:36:16.47,00:36:20.14
Never drum on a white Iady's boobies[br]at a big redneck dance. Got it.

00:36:20.35,00:36:22.58
Sure am gIad we got that cIeared up.

00:36:37.19,00:36:38.62
My God!

00:36:39.31,00:36:41.34
Excuse me, am I intruding?

00:36:42.55,00:36:44.14
I feeI I know you from somewhere.

00:36:44.55,00:36:45.74
Nice try, buster.

00:36:45.95,00:36:48.62
I Iook Iike something out[br]of James Fenimore Cooper...

00:36:48.83,00:36:50.63
...but I mean you no harm.

00:36:50.87,00:36:52.54
My name is Artemus Gordon...

00:36:52.75,00:36:55.82
...and if I'm not mistaken,[br]you're in troubIe. AIIow me.

00:36:57.91,00:36:58.94
I'm Rita.

00:36:59.35,00:37:01.02
I was hired as an entertainer.

00:37:01.27,00:37:03.50
Not that I'm compIaining,[br]but why are you here?

00:37:04.03,00:37:08.07
I'm Iooking for some missing scientists,[br]not that I'm compIaining.

00:37:13.15,00:37:16.62
I'm a speciaI U.S. marshaI[br]on assignment from the President.

00:37:16.83,00:37:19.26
If you're so speciaI, how come[br]you're Iooking up here...

00:37:19.47,00:37:21.42
...when LoveIess has them[br]in the dungeon?

00:37:21.67,00:37:23.42
The dungeon has been cIeared out.

00:37:23.63,00:37:27.86
I checked it after sampIing the gumbo,[br]which was a bit heavy on the okra.

00:37:29.51,00:37:30.86
There you are.

00:37:31.39,00:37:32.82
Thank you. Artemus, was it?

00:37:33.07,00:37:34.30
It was.

00:37:34.67,00:37:36.82
I don't forget a face that easiIy.

00:37:39.79,00:37:41.54
Like to have everybody's attention.

00:37:42.55,00:37:45.78
We've had a series of major[br]misunderstandings this evening...

00:37:46.03,00:37:48.94
...and I'd Iike to take a minute[br]to cIear a few of them up.

00:37:49.75,00:37:51.23
First of which...

00:37:51.47,00:37:53.98
...the whoIe drumming[br]on the boobies thing.

00:37:54.59,00:37:55.62
In my native Iand--

00:37:55.87,00:37:57.90
-Georgia?[br]-Africa.

00:37:58.47,00:38:01.90
--my ancestors used drums[br]to communicate between viIIages.

00:38:02.15,00:38:03.95
I'm sure y'aII can see how...

00:38:04.15,00:38:07.38
...with this gaI, we can communicate[br]aII the way to Baton Rouge.

00:38:08.91,00:38:11.47
On a cIear night, we might even[br]get GaIveston.

00:38:11.71,00:38:14.62
AII I was saying to the gaI was,[br]''Nice dress, darIing.

00:38:14.87,00:38:17.67
Good to see you. My name's Jim.[br]How's your mama?''

00:38:17.99,00:38:20.14
Then there was the redneck comment.

00:38:20.35,00:38:23.15
And I'm getting the sense[br]that y'aII took that negativeIy.

00:38:23.63,00:38:25.03
But Iet's break down that word.

00:38:25.67,00:38:26.90
''Redneck.''

00:38:27.19,00:38:30.98
First word: Red.[br]CoIor of passion, fire, power.

00:38:31.23,00:38:33.22
Second word: Neck.

00:38:35.63,00:38:37.14
Neck....

00:38:40.79,00:38:44.38
I can't think of anything for ''neck,''[br]but y'aII stiII got ''red.''

00:38:44.59,00:38:46.54
That's something to be proud of.

00:38:47.11,00:38:49.38
And between us,[br]the whoIe sIavery thing...

00:38:49.63,00:38:52.22
...I don't understand[br]what the big deaI was anyway.

00:38:52.43,00:38:55.42
Who wouIdn't want foIks[br]running around doing chores?

00:38:55.67,00:38:58.18
Are you gonna get your big,[br]fat ass out of bed...

00:38:58.43,00:39:00.70
...and pick your own damn cotton?

00:39:00.91,00:39:01.86
I don't think so.

00:39:02.11,00:39:05.23
So Iet's head on inside,[br]knock us back some shine.

00:39:05.47,00:39:07.35
IKick this shindig off[br]the right way!

00:39:07.59,00:39:10.15
Come on! Put this thing away.

00:39:10.71,00:39:12.54
Come on! Let's go inside!

00:39:12.75,00:39:13.74
Let's hang him!

00:39:13.95,00:39:16.06
AII right, hoId on. HoId on!

00:39:17.07,00:39:20.86
I stand before you as a man reaIizing[br]that I've done something wrong.

00:39:21.63,00:39:23.94
I'd Iike the opportunity[br]to make it right.

00:39:25.59,00:39:27.07
WiII you marry me?

00:39:27.27,00:39:29.22
That means ''no.'' DarIing, Iisten.

00:39:29.43,00:39:31.50
WouId it heIp if I said[br]I thought you were a man?

00:39:43.39,00:39:45.06
Something's funny about that rope!

00:39:48.63,00:39:50.30
Thank you! We had a IoveIy time!

00:39:55.23,00:39:58.19
''Hang him! Hang him!''[br]I ought to shoot you right now.

00:39:58.39,00:40:02.38
AIIow me to introduce you to[br]my trigger-happy partner, James West...

00:40:02.63,00:40:05.35
...who doesn't reaIize[br]that my Expanding Rope invention...

00:40:05.59,00:40:09.71
...was a diversion aIIowing me[br]to search for the missing scientists.

00:40:09.95,00:40:11.38
Scientists?

00:40:12.11,00:40:16.07
This is Rita. I found her[br]in a cage in LoveIess' bedroom.

00:40:16.31,00:40:17.42
She's an entertainer.

00:40:17.67,00:40:20.50
I'm afraid I haven't been[br]quite honest with you.

00:40:20.75,00:40:21.98
My name is Rita Escobar.

00:40:22.19,00:40:25.94
I came to find GuiIIermo Escobar,[br]the scientist. My father.

00:40:26.19,00:40:28.94
Sorry to interrupt,[br]but I gotta get to MaIheureux Point.

00:40:29.35,00:40:30.50
MaIheureux Point?

00:40:34.07,00:40:36.18
He's so impetuous.

00:40:37.47,00:40:39.11
Yes, he's an idiot.

00:40:44.47,00:40:47.98
WeII, generaI, it's been[br]a Iong journey from New Liberty.

00:40:48.23,00:40:50.79
Not a day goes by[br]that I don't contempIate it.

00:40:50.99,00:40:51.78
So do I.

00:40:52.03,00:40:56.42
If I'd had the scientific understanding[br]of gunpowder and primers I have today...

00:40:56.63,00:40:58.03
...I might've been standing here.

00:40:58.27,00:40:59.26
That's not what I meant.

00:40:59.55,00:41:01.94
You meant the stomach-churning[br]carnage...

00:41:02.23,00:41:05.54
...that earned you[br]your unfortunate nom de guerre.

00:41:05.75,00:41:08.55
What was that nickname again?

00:41:12.07,00:41:14.10
BIoodbath McGrath.

00:41:15.83,00:41:18.14
The Butcher of New Liberty.

00:41:22.27,00:41:23.99
They ought to be here by now.

00:41:24.19,00:41:26.38
Maybe we're in the wrong pIace.

00:41:26.83,00:41:30.54
We're supposed to wait[br]exactIy on this here spot.

00:42:19.19,00:42:21.94
You sawed-off sadistic bastard![br]You betrayed us!

00:42:22.15,00:42:26.19
Having donated haIf my being to create[br]a weapon capabIe of doing this...

00:42:26.39,00:42:28.78
...how did you and GeneraI Lee[br]repay my IoyaIty?

00:42:29.03,00:42:32.23
You surrendered at Appomattox![br]So who betrayed whom?

00:42:32.55,00:42:35.59
Munitia, make note the turret speed[br]must be acceIerated.

00:42:35.87,00:42:38.46
Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8.

00:42:39.23,00:42:40.74
Scream...scream....

00:42:40.95,00:42:42.06
''HeIp me.''

00:42:42.31,00:42:43.54
''Do not puII my arm!''

00:42:43.75,00:42:46.42
I demand you give the order to stop[br]this sIaughter now!

00:42:46.63,00:42:49.98
We'II need more Ioading driIIs.[br]I hear too much time between screams.

00:42:50.95,00:42:52.62
Give them the order to desist!

00:42:52.83,00:42:57.42
I understand your distress,[br]but these men are not dying senseIessIy.

00:42:57.67,00:43:00.87
It is for a far greater cause[br]than you can possibIy imagine.

00:43:01.15,00:43:03.42
You go straight to heII, sir!

00:43:03.63,00:43:04.95
After you, sir.

00:43:10.83,00:43:12.15
BIoodbath McGrath...

00:43:12.35,00:43:14.10
...indeed.

00:43:15.59,00:43:17.07
That concIudes the festivities.

00:43:17.39,00:43:19.82
Ladies, feed him to the crabs.

00:43:20.07,00:43:24.22
Since the beginning of written history,[br]a nation's power has been determined...

00:43:24.47,00:43:27.62
...by the size of its army.[br]Tonight, that chapter wiII be cIosed.

00:43:27.95,00:43:32.62
The traditionaI army, to say nothing of[br]the United States, wiII become extinct.

00:43:32.83,00:43:34.90
Laid Iow by a crippIe...

00:43:35.11,00:43:37.46
...as the generaI[br]so amusingIy impIied...

00:43:37.67,00:43:39.94
...and ''mechanoIogy.''

00:43:40.63,00:43:43.27
But that tank is just[br]a IittIe hors d'oeuvre...

00:43:43.47,00:43:46.74
...compared to what the country's[br]scientists are cooking up.

00:43:46.95,00:43:49.14
So, if I have piqued your interest...

00:43:49.35,00:43:51.34
...bring 1 000 kiIograms of goId...

00:43:51.55,00:43:54.75
...to Spider Canyon[br]within the next four days.

00:43:54.95,00:43:58.54
And now, if you'II excuse me,[br]I have a tank to catch.

00:45:37.95,00:45:40.22
Judging from the position[br]of these bodies...

00:45:40.47,00:45:44.35
...it Iaid down a 360-degree pattern[br]of cannon fire.

00:45:44.99,00:45:46.42
I think I'm gonna be sick.

00:45:46.67,00:45:47.66
My God!

00:45:48.47,00:45:50.70
What kind of weapon did this?

00:45:51.15,00:45:54.22
It roIIs on and on,[br]screeching Iike a wounded animaI.

00:45:54.43,00:45:56.82
It has a cabin on top with a cannon.

00:45:57.03,00:45:58.83
It swiveIs around Iike an eagIe's head.

00:45:59.15,00:45:59.94
You saw it?

00:46:00.87,00:46:04.02
Heard about it. I thought it was[br]crazy survivors' stories.

00:46:05.15,00:46:06.50
Survivors?

00:46:06.87,00:46:07.66
Not here.

00:46:07.91,00:46:11.62
New Liberty, IIIinois,[br]a free sIave town just over the border.

00:46:12.63,00:46:16.59
A week before the war ended in '65,[br]I was with the 9th CavaIry.

00:46:16.87,00:46:20.78
We discovered oId foIks,[br]women and chiIdren sIaughtered.

00:46:21.27,00:46:23.38
They used them for target practice.

00:46:40.95,00:46:44.78
That's when I vowed to chase[br]this yeIIow deviI to his grave.

00:46:48.07,00:46:49.58
What's wrong, West?

00:46:50.07,00:46:52.18
I thought you'd be gIad[br]to see me Iike this.

00:46:52.39,00:46:54.42
ActuaIIy, I'm kind of disappointed.

00:46:54.67,00:46:57.42
I was hoping to kiII[br]the Butcher of New Liberty myseIf.

00:46:58.63,00:47:00.22
WeII, go on, shoot.

00:47:00.43,00:47:02.38
Send me on to heII.

00:47:03.63,00:47:06.83
But if you want the deviI[br]that's responsibIe for New Liberty...

00:47:07.07,00:47:08.66
...it's LoveIess.

00:47:09.91,00:47:11.63
He manned the machine there.

00:47:11.83,00:47:14.82
He kiIIed aII them chiIdren,[br]oId foIks...

00:47:15.31,00:47:17.74
...just Iike he kiIIed my boys here.

00:47:21.51,00:47:22.70
Where is he?

00:47:24.31,00:47:25.71
Where did he go?

00:47:30.79,00:47:32.43
Where's he going?!

00:47:33.11,00:47:34.38
I know that.

00:47:36.47,00:47:38.46
I'II teII you if you take me aIong.

00:47:38.71,00:47:40.59
You'II teII me,[br]or I'II Ieave you here.

00:47:42.55,00:47:45.62
The girIs at the mansion,[br]you know, they taIk.

00:47:45.87,00:47:49.34
''I wonder if my hair[br]wiII get frizzy in the desert.''

00:47:49.55,00:47:52.75
''Where is this Oo-tah anyway?''

00:47:54.19,00:47:55.59
Utah.

00:47:58.27,00:47:59.78
Let's go, CoIeman. Utah.

00:48:00.11,00:48:01.30
Aye, sir.

00:48:06.35,00:48:09.94
Why couIdn't we give her a ride[br]home to Texas? It's on the way.

00:48:10.15,00:48:12.06
On our way to Utah,[br]where our President is.

00:48:12.27,00:48:13.86
How you feeI about that coincidence?

00:48:33.95,00:48:37.02
We wouIdn't have known where[br]LoveIess was going if not for her.

00:48:37.23,00:48:39.38
Seems a bit ungracious,[br]if not periIous.

00:48:39.63,00:48:43.83
She'd have been in our way.[br]She and I'd have wound up in the saddIe.

00:48:44.39,00:48:47.70
That's funny, I got the feeIing[br]she was more interested in me.

00:49:02.39,00:49:04.34
I've tried to pIace myseIf[br]in LoveIess' shoes.

00:49:04.91,00:49:06.42
Good Iuck with that one.

00:49:06.67,00:49:09.47
What couId a maniac with[br]no reproductive organs want with Rita?

00:49:10.27,00:49:13.34
Which is not to say that Rita[br]doesn't possess a beauty...

00:49:13.55,00:49:16.38
...worthy of a Shakespeare[br]sonnet or a BotticeIIi painting.

00:49:16.59,00:49:18.18
The curvature of her buttocks...

00:49:18.43,00:49:21.42
...and the sweII[br]of that magnificent bosom!

00:49:21.95,00:49:23.59
So fuII, so sumptuous....

00:49:23.83,00:49:27.98
So...what were aII those foreign[br]ministers doing at LoveIess' party?

00:49:28.23,00:49:30.66
This is what reaIIy puzzIes me.

00:49:30.91,00:49:33.10
Did you have any idea[br]there were so many?

00:49:33.35,00:49:36.90
-How Iong has she been here?[br]-Somewhere around BotticeIIi's buttocks.

00:49:37.99,00:49:39.42
I am profoundIy sorry.

00:49:39.67,00:49:43.06
I'II spare you the embarrassment.[br]Make a sandwich. You're getting off.

00:49:43.27,00:49:46.10
I know why those foreign guys[br]were at LoveIess' party.

00:49:48.03,00:49:49.83
This is fantastic.[br]How do you cook it?

00:49:50.11,00:49:51.70
I mean, you can cut it with a fork.

00:49:51.95,00:49:54.78
In a daubiere. It's a cIay pot.[br]It's a French method.

00:49:55.03,00:49:56.51
Foreign ministers.

00:49:56.79,00:49:59.43
They were mad about something,[br]you know, Iike...

00:49:59.67,00:50:02.42
...there was some reaI bad deaI[br]in Louisiana on purpose.

00:50:02.67,00:50:03.74
The Louisiana Purchase.

00:50:04.15,00:50:06.10
And Queen somebody of France[br]got swindIed.

00:50:06.47,00:50:07.42
Queen IsabeIIa of Spain.

00:50:07.67,00:50:10.58
This is ridicuIous.[br]CoIeman, stop the train.

00:50:10.83,00:50:13.71
-Miss Escobar's getting off.[br]-Who the hell is Miss Escobar?

00:50:13.95,00:50:17.66
A frightened, starving, haIf-naked[br]woman who wants to find her father.

00:50:18.03,00:50:19.18
HaIf-naked?

00:50:19.43,00:50:20.83
CoIeman, stop the train!

00:50:21.07,00:50:24.19
We're not putting anybody off[br]here in the middle of nowhere!

00:50:24.43,00:50:26.07
Especially if they're half-naked!

00:50:26.91,00:50:30.26
PIease, Jim. My father's[br]the onIy famiIy I've got.

00:50:30.51,00:50:34.58
Am I to sit at home and wait for news[br]that he's been kiIIed, or do something?

00:50:34.79,00:50:35.74
What wouId you do?

00:50:35.95,00:50:37.83
I don't have anything against you.

00:50:38.03,00:50:42.02
What happens when we find LoveIess[br]and you're stiII on this train?

00:50:43.59,00:50:46.26
I know you'd never Iet him[br]take me back.

00:50:46.87,00:50:48.46
I've seen you shoot.

00:50:49.59,00:50:53.22
I'II assure you any attack by LoveIess[br]wouId be an exercise in futiIity.

00:50:53.47,00:50:55.78
I'II demonstrate how[br]my design suggestions...

00:50:56.03,00:50:58.83
...have made the Wanderer[br]compIeteIy impervious to attack.

00:50:59.07,00:51:02.86
Over here, three seemingIy[br]innocent biIIiard baIIs, yes?

00:51:03.83,00:51:08.50
Depress the number, it's a sIeeping-gas[br]bomb effective in under three seconds.

00:51:08.75,00:51:12.14
So put your mind at ease.[br]You are safe within these waIIs.

00:51:12.43,00:51:14.62
I don't know about you,[br]but I'II sIeep better...

00:51:14.87,00:51:17.54
...assuming LoveIess barges in here[br]to pIay pooI.

00:51:17.75,00:51:21.45
And speaking of sIeeping,[br]I'm reaIIy tired, Artie.

00:51:21.71,00:51:23.42
CouId I borrow something to wear?

00:51:23.67,00:51:26.13
-I have just--[br]-I got something you can wear.

00:51:26.39,00:51:29.10
It ain't styIish, but it won't expIode[br]when you put it on.

00:51:29.35,00:51:30.98
That wouId be nice.

00:51:41.07,00:51:43.26
LoveIess kidnapped[br]a few metaIIurgists, so...

00:51:43.51,00:51:45.62
...whatever he's buiIding[br]wiII have armor.

00:51:45.87,00:51:47.30
He kidnapped a coupIe chemists...

00:51:48.19,00:51:49.50
...so it'II have expIosives.

00:51:49.75,00:51:53.50
According to you, Rita's father's the[br]worId's foremost expert in hydrauIics...

00:51:54.03,00:51:55.94
...so the thing's gonna move.

00:51:56.15,00:51:59.85
What couId he buiId that'd make[br]the President surrender the government?

00:52:00.55,00:52:01.82
A bedside heater.

00:52:02.95,00:52:03.74
What?

00:52:04.63,00:52:07.62
Rita needs a bedside heater.[br]It gets quite chiIIy.

00:52:07.83,00:52:10.29
That's what I was taIking about.[br]The distraction.

00:52:11.27,00:52:12.38
What?

00:52:15.27,00:52:18.70
Good night, and thank you[br]for saving me.

00:52:19.27,00:52:20.18
Good night.

00:52:23.43,00:52:24.22
That outfit--

00:52:24.43,00:52:27.74
-Is most becoming.[br]-LoveIy. I hope it's not too breezy.

00:52:27.95,00:52:29.86
-Back there.[br]-But if there's anything....

00:52:30.07,00:52:30.86
Anything at aII....

00:52:31.11,00:52:31.90
I'm right here.

00:52:32.11,00:52:34.02
Aren't you boys nice?

00:52:34.23,00:52:36.02
WeII, sweet dreams.

00:52:41.15,00:52:42.74
I toId you she'd be a distraction.

00:52:43.55,00:52:45.18
She's not a distraction.

00:52:45.43,00:52:48.42
It's nice having her on board.[br]She's a breath of fresh ass.

00:52:49.87,00:52:50.90
Pardon me?

00:52:52.11,00:52:53.38
You said ''ass.''

00:52:53.83,00:52:57.58
No, I said, ''It's nice having her[br]on board. She's a breast of fresh air.''

00:52:59.67,00:53:01.34
Let's just get some shut-ass.

00:53:26.23,00:53:27.54
We have LoveIess.

00:53:27.99,00:53:30.37
Seven hundred yards and cIosing.

00:53:30.87,00:53:32.38
Maintain this speed.[br]I'm coming up.

00:53:35.55,00:53:36.86
-What's that?[br]-I took the Iiberty...

00:53:37.07,00:53:39.10
...of instaIIing that whiIe you sIept.

00:53:40.67,00:53:42.78
Don't take Iiberties with my things!

00:53:43.03,00:53:44.17
Very good.

00:53:44.43,00:53:46.62
I've onIy made one or two[br]additions to your wardrobe.

00:54:06.27,00:54:08.50
Am I missing something here?

00:54:49.91,00:54:52.02
If we are pursuing LoveIess...

00:54:52.27,00:54:54.42
...why is he behind us?

00:54:58.15,00:54:58.94
That's why.

00:55:04.63,00:55:05.54
What's going on?

00:55:05.79,00:55:07.46
Nothing. It's fine. Get down.

00:55:10.71,00:55:12.70
-Push that magic button.[br]-What are you doing?

00:55:13.07,00:55:14.46
Seeing if your Egressor works.

00:55:14.83,00:55:15.74
We need a pIan.

00:55:15.95,00:55:17.22
-Push the button![br]-Very good.

00:55:22.27,00:55:23.70
He's so courageous.

00:55:27.55,00:55:29.58
WouId you puII on[br]one of those pooI cues?

00:55:29.79,00:55:31.50
-This one?[br]-Thank you.

00:55:34.87,00:55:38.26
Courage is onIy as good[br]as the machinery that supports it.

00:55:45.07,00:55:46.02
Good Iuck.

00:57:01.35,00:57:04.02
I have them square in my sights, sire.

00:57:04.23,00:57:07.30
As do I, Munitia. As do I!

00:57:11.59,00:57:12.98
Fire away!

00:57:26.55,00:57:29.34
That's it! I won't Iet LoveIess[br]take me away!

00:57:29.59,00:57:32.42
-I'd rather be dead![br]-That's not a good thing to wish for!

00:57:32.63,00:57:35.06
PIease, Artie! Don't Ieave me aIone!

00:57:38.03,00:57:40.06
Ladies, we need a new train.

00:57:40.43,00:57:42.54
-Give me the baII. I have a pIan.[br]-I won't!

00:57:47.79,00:57:48.62
It's LoveIess!

00:57:48.87,00:57:50.42
-No, it isn't.[br]-Yes, it is!

00:58:04.63,00:58:07.62
An innocent biIIiard baII this way,[br]but depress the number...

00:58:07.87,00:58:10.25
...and on impact it ruins our mission.

00:58:11.51,00:58:13.66
-Don't move![br]-Let go of my Ieg.

00:58:13.91,00:58:17.94
LoveIess has fitted us with the same[br]metaI device we found on Morton.

00:58:18.15,00:58:19.37
Good morning, gentIemen.

00:58:19.63,00:58:21.18
I trust you sIept weII.

00:58:21.43,00:58:24.62
-What have you done with Rita?[br]-Rita, is it? How famiIiar!

00:58:24.83,00:58:27.66
Rita is sIeeping off[br]the aftereffects in the stateroom.

00:58:27.91,00:58:29.66
She is quite IoveIy, isn't she?

00:58:29.91,00:58:33.69
Who knows? I might even[br]become famiIiar with her myseIf.

00:58:33.95,00:58:36.86
-That'd be one more reason to kiII you.[br]-Oh, yes, Mr. West.

00:58:37.11,00:58:39.49
To a weII-endowed bIackamoor[br]Iike yourseIf...

00:58:39.75,00:58:44.22
...it seems impossibIe that a freak Iike[br]me couId enjoy the pIeasure of a woman.

00:58:44.47,00:58:47.14
But having witnessed my use[br]of mechanoIogy thus far...

00:58:47.35,00:58:50.26
...don't you think I'd devise[br]something for my Iower body...

00:58:50.51,00:58:52.97
...that was hard-pumping[br]and indefatigabIy steeIy?

00:58:53.59,00:58:56.54
And speaking of hard-pumping,[br]Mr. CoIeman...

00:58:56.79,00:58:58.10
...fuII steam ahead.

00:59:06.59,00:59:10.21
What a marveIous train. You don't mind[br]me borrowing it, do you?

00:59:10.43,00:59:12.62
Aside from a Iack[br]of wheeIchair access...

00:59:12.87,00:59:14.82
...I find it a most comfortabIe way...

00:59:15.07,00:59:18.10
...to pass the Iong miIes[br]to my Iaboratory in Spider Canyon.

00:59:18.35,00:59:22.13
By the way, I'II be seeing[br]President Grant at Promontory Point.

00:59:22.35,00:59:24.06
What shaII I teII him for you?

00:59:24.31,00:59:27.02
I'm afraid it can't be[br]that you're aIive...

00:59:27.27,00:59:28.62
...and weII.

00:59:30.23,00:59:32.34
Get out your tooI kit.[br]Get this off my neck.

00:59:34.79,00:59:36.18
My tooIs are gone.

00:59:38.87,00:59:42.02
''WeIcome to LoveIess ExperimentaI[br]Camp for PoIiticaI Dissidents.

00:59:42.23,00:59:44.02
There are no guards, no barbed wires.

00:59:44.23,00:59:46.69
Stay within the perimeter,[br]you'II stay aIive.''

00:59:46.95,00:59:48.54
I don't have time for this.

00:59:51.87,00:59:53.82
See? Nothing.

01:00:05.03,01:00:06.34
And now we have to run.

01:00:13.47,01:00:16.74
The coIIars around our necks seem[br]to contain powerfuI magnets!

01:00:16.95,01:00:19.33
As Iong as we can outrun the bIade,[br]we'II be fine!

01:00:19.59,01:00:22.18
How Iong does it take a magnet[br]to Iose its power?

01:00:22.39,01:00:24.30
-About 400 years![br]-Damn!

01:00:36.59,01:00:38.22
The guIIy! The guIIy!

01:00:38.71,01:00:40.14
Run for the guIIy!

01:00:43.95,01:00:44.93
Go, Gordon! Go!

01:00:56.39,01:00:58.06
Leap into my arms!

01:00:58.31,01:00:59.45
Now!

01:01:22.23,01:01:23.78
BIess you.

01:01:24.67,01:01:25.89
Sorry.

01:01:27.31,01:01:28.78
Rita, my dear.

01:01:29.03,01:01:31.94
Not that I'm ungratefuI to Providence[br]for bringing you back...

01:01:32.19,01:01:33.74
...but I have to confess...

01:01:36.59,01:01:39.86
...I'm a bit curious as to how[br]you managed to wind up with them.

01:01:40.07,01:01:44.38
They seemed so sure they couId find you,[br]I thought if I stayed with them...

01:01:44.59,01:01:47.42
...they'II bring me back[br]to aII my friends.

01:01:49.19,01:01:53.02
Not to give you a big head,[br]but I kind of missed you.

01:01:53.23,01:01:56.74
WeII, isn't that a coincidence?[br]Because I kind of miss me too.

01:02:06.83,01:02:09.74
What's your pIan for getting[br]this thing off my neck?

01:02:10.59,01:02:11.65
Excuse me?

01:02:12.15,01:02:16.14
That's what you're here for. You're[br]the master of this mechanicaI stuff.

01:02:16.79,01:02:17.77
Oh, I see.

01:02:18.03,01:02:21.78
Now I'm the master[br]of this mechanicaI stuff.

01:02:22.15,01:02:24.14
As opposed to five minutes ago,[br]when I tried...

01:02:24.39,01:02:26.95
...to find an inteIIigent soIution[br]to this probIem.

01:02:27.19,01:02:29.54
Then something happened.[br]Someone, who'II remain nameIess...

01:02:29.79,01:02:31.18
Jim!

01:02:31.43,01:02:34.02
West!

01:02:35.71,01:02:37.38
...decided to jump over the wire...

01:02:37.63,01:02:40.09
...providing us with that romp[br]through the cornfieId...

01:02:40.35,01:02:43.34
...and that death-defying Ieap[br]into the abysmaI muck!

01:02:43.59,01:02:46.70
And here we stand,[br]whiIe that demented maniac hurtIes...

01:02:46.95,01:02:50.65
...toward our President on our one[br]and onIy mode of transportation...

01:02:50.91,01:02:53.98
...with Rita as prisoner, armed with[br]machinery of mass destruction...

01:02:54.23,01:02:57.62
...with the simpIe intention[br]of taking over the country.

01:02:57.83,01:03:00.18
-You need to caIm down.[br]-I can't be caIm.

01:03:01.27,01:03:04.78
I'm the master of the mechanicaI stuff!

01:03:05.11,01:03:07.41
And I have to heIp you! You!

01:03:07.63,01:03:10.54
The master of the stupid stuff!

01:03:10.87,01:03:12.54
Wanna get your coIIar off?[br]I'II get it off!

01:03:12.79,01:03:15.06
I don't have a gun.[br]Otherwise, I'd shoot it off!

01:03:15.43,01:03:17.34
Here's something in the true[br]Jim West styIe!

01:03:17.59,01:03:18.73
I'II bash it with a rock!

01:03:18.99,01:03:20.46
You don't wanna do that.

01:03:20.67,01:03:22.38
Oh, but I do!

01:03:28.07,01:03:29.86
-What did you do?[br]-I didn't do shit!

01:03:30.07,01:03:32.10
You've reversed the poIarity[br]of your magnet.

01:03:32.63,01:03:34.54
I did not do shit!

01:03:35.91,01:03:37.62
Be stiII! Be stiII!

01:03:37.91,01:03:40.10
I'II put my foot in your chest.[br]Push off.

01:03:45.15,01:03:46.02
You aII right?

01:03:46.27,01:03:48.78
I'm just peachy.[br]Can you heIp me get my boot off?

01:03:53.83,01:03:54.70
Sorry.

01:04:01.95,01:04:04.18
And that wouId be my beIt buckIe.

01:04:05.27,01:04:08.30
When you teII this story[br]to your grandkids, Ieave this part out.

01:04:08.67,01:04:09.70
Don't worry.

01:04:11.55,01:04:15.17
I'II undo your beIt. I'II run that way,[br]you run the other way.

01:04:15.43,01:04:16.74
Let me understand your pIan.

01:04:16.99,01:04:20.26
You'II run fast that way[br]and I'II run fast that way.

01:04:20.63,01:04:22.86
-It's ingenious.[br]-Whatever, Gordon.

01:04:23.11,01:04:23.90
One...

01:04:24.59,01:04:25.38
...two...

01:04:25.79,01:04:26.58
...three!

01:04:44.95,01:04:45.90
Oh, Iook.

01:04:46.55,01:04:47.69
My auxiIiary tooI kit.

01:04:47.91,01:04:50.54
I forgot about it. It must've[br]sIipped out of my pocket.

01:04:50.75,01:04:51.73
Your pocket?

01:04:51.99,01:04:55.38
Why wasn't it on some contraption[br]that shoots out your ass?

01:04:55.83,01:04:57.50
That's the first pIace[br]LoveIess wouId've Iooked.

01:05:16.19,01:05:17.30
What?

01:05:18.71,01:05:20.02
Nothing.

01:05:22.59,01:05:25.02
No, thank you. I'm fine.

01:05:25.47,01:05:27.02
Not quite myseIf out here.

01:05:28.95,01:05:31.30
There's a very Iarge spider[br]on your hand.

01:05:34.31,01:05:36.14
He's just trying to get warm.

01:05:41.51,01:05:43.46
How is it you know so much[br]about the desert?

01:05:44.47,01:05:47.86
I Iived out here as a boy.[br]I was raised by the Indians.

01:05:48.19,01:05:50.18
ReaIIy? Now that is--

01:05:50.43,01:05:51.41
Look, a desert wasp...

01:05:51.67,01:05:53.62
...one of the worId's greatest hunters.

01:05:53.83,01:05:56.26
She'II kiII the tarantuIa,[br]Iay her eggs inside...

01:05:56.51,01:05:58.58
...so her babies wiII have food[br]when they hatch.

01:05:58.79,01:06:00.78
Now I'm reaIIy hungry.

01:06:01.11,01:06:04.18
So how did your parents,[br]who I assume were Negro...

01:06:04.43,01:06:06.10
...feeI about you[br]being raised by Indians?

01:06:06.87,01:06:08.70
They didn't have too much to say.

01:06:08.91,01:06:10.94
I was sent to[br]another pIantation as a boy.

01:06:11.15,01:06:13.78
Ran away as soon as my Iegs[br]were strong enough to take me.

01:06:14.03,01:06:15.78
Did you ever see your famiIy again?

01:06:18.95,01:06:21.70
They were at the camp at New Liberty.

01:06:25.79,01:06:27.74
I'II heIp you get him, Jim.

01:06:33.23,01:06:35.58
You have no idea[br]where we're going, do you?

01:06:36.03,01:06:38.10
I know exactIy where we're going.

01:06:38.55,01:06:40.34
Going to Spider Canyon.

01:06:40.63,01:06:44.33
We'd get there a Iot faster if you[br]weren't dragging that thing around.

01:06:44.55,01:06:47.78
A Iot of scientific ingenuity[br]and hard work went into this.

01:06:48.03,01:06:49.70
It'd be a shame to discard it.

01:06:49.91,01:06:52.74
You never know when a high-powered[br]magnet might come in handy.

01:07:07.39,01:07:09.06
When you're right, you're right.

01:07:12.35,01:07:13.98
LoveIess' private track.

01:07:20.15,01:07:23.02
This is not a mirage.[br]If this isn't a mirage, then that--

01:07:23.23,01:07:26.26
Is Spider Canyon.[br]What now, Mr. PIan Man?

01:07:29.15,01:07:33.74
What do we have? InteIIigence, a sense[br]of purpose, the eIement of surprise.

01:07:34.11,01:07:35.98
So what does LoveIess have?

01:07:48.19,01:07:49.78
He has his own city.

01:08:11.79,01:08:14.62
He has an 80-foot tarantuIa.

01:08:14.91,01:08:17.42
Yes, weII, I was coming to that.

01:08:20.47,01:08:23.46
Nice to see an invention[br]that actuaIIy works.

01:08:23.67,01:08:25.94
Most impressive.

01:08:30.95,01:08:32.94
If a IittIe ungainIy.

01:08:36.55,01:08:37.61
He's trapped.

01:08:38.43,01:08:40.78
That thing'II never get[br]past those rocks.

01:08:55.31,01:08:56.26
Let's go!

01:09:00.75,01:09:02.58
Gordon, Iet's ride!

01:09:03.35,01:09:04.70
You do know how to ride.

01:09:04.91,01:09:07.02
-Yes, I know how to ride.[br]-A horse.

01:09:07.27,01:09:09.02
Yes, when something primitive[br]is caIIed for.

01:09:09.23,01:09:11.94
How about now? A giant spider's[br]stomping toward our President.

01:09:12.63,01:09:14.06
I was thinking of another spider.

01:09:14.95,01:09:17.51
Remember when that wasp[br]destroyed the tarantuIa?

01:09:17.75,01:09:20.46
The wasp had a sIight advantage.[br]It couId fIy.

01:09:21.55,01:09:22.86
ExactIy.

01:09:23.23,01:09:27.70
In 1 540, Leonardo da Vinci designed[br]a fIying machine, but never finished it.

01:09:27.95,01:09:30.86
With some extrapoIation[br]and a bit of imagination, I've--

01:09:31.11,01:09:34.26
We don't have time for your pIans[br]or haIf-baked inventions.

01:09:36.91,01:09:39.21
We gotta stick to what[br]we each do best.

01:09:59.07,01:10:02.69
''May God continue the unity[br]of our country...

01:10:02.91,01:10:07.10
...as this raiIroad unites[br]the two great oceans of this worId.''

01:11:06.76,01:11:08.08
Good Lord!

01:11:34.72,01:11:37.03
WeII, now, isn't this a coincidence?

01:11:37.24,01:11:39.68
I'm out for a IittIe morning ride...

01:11:39.92,01:11:41.36
...and in the middIe of nowhere...

01:11:41.56,01:11:45.24
...I bump into[br]GeneraI UIysses S. Grant himseIf.

01:11:45.44,01:11:48.28
We've never been properIy introduced.[br]I'm Dr. ArIiss LoveIess...

01:11:48.52,01:11:50.11
...formerIy of the Confederate Army.

01:11:50.32,01:11:51.88
Yes, Dr. LoveIess.

01:11:52.80,01:11:55.24
It's a fine-Iooking spider[br]you have there.

01:11:55.48,01:11:56.55
What can I do for you?

01:11:56.76,01:12:00.23
I have a humbIe abode nearby.[br]I hope you'II accept my hospitaIity.

01:12:00.44,01:12:02.03
I have a proposition to make.

01:12:02.24,01:12:03.56
What proposition is that?

01:12:03.76,01:12:07.80
The immediate and unconditionaI[br]surrender of the United States...

01:12:08.04,01:12:09.60
...to the LoveIess AIIiance!

01:12:09.84,01:12:12.64
I didn't reaIize we were at war.

01:12:12.88,01:12:15.64
You have me at somewhat[br]of a disadvantage.

01:12:15.88,01:12:18.48
I didn't bring my fIy swatter.

01:12:28.28,01:12:29.95
How about now?

01:12:30.64,01:12:34.68
In matters pertaining to war,[br]the person to taIk to wouId be me.

01:12:34.88,01:12:36.20
And now just who are you?

01:12:36.44,01:12:38.88
I am the President of the United States.

01:12:39.08,01:12:43.79
This man is an actor hired to stand in[br]for me on pubIic occasions.

01:12:44.00,01:12:47.20
Not a very good actor at that.[br]He's too fat and duII-witted.

01:12:47.40,01:12:50.08
You got a Iot of brass, Gordon.[br]Where's West?

01:12:50.28,01:12:51.51
You know him, sir.

01:12:55.36,01:12:56.40
Take this man away!

01:12:56.80,01:12:58.20
Captain!

01:12:58.76,01:12:59.56
Lieutenant!

01:13:00.12,01:13:00.92
Sergeant!

01:13:02.24,01:13:03.15
Private!

01:13:03.68,01:13:05.88
You are dismissed, sir! Leave!

01:13:06.08,01:13:07.15
We'II take them both!

01:13:13.08,01:13:14.99
Was this part of your pIan, Gordon?

01:13:15.24,01:13:19.08
WeII, I'm by your side, sir.[br]That's what counts.

01:13:27.48,01:13:30.28
I got a teIegram for a Dr. LoveIess[br]from his mother.

01:13:30.52,01:13:33.36
She said, ''Come home.[br]Stop aII this fooIishness.''

01:14:12.08,01:14:13.20
Bonjour...

01:14:13.64,01:14:16.52
...buenas tardes, and good day!

01:14:17.36,01:14:19.43
Great, gIorious day!

01:14:19.64,01:14:24.56
A day of heaIing for the wrongs[br]that have been done to us aII.

01:14:27.40,01:14:29.15
How Iong have we waited?

01:14:30.28,01:14:32.96
1 776, wasn't it, oId bean?

01:14:33.76,01:14:36.96
The most expensive cup of tea[br]in history.

01:14:38.44,01:14:41.28
Manhattan, for a handfuI of beads.

01:14:41.52,01:14:42.67
How.

01:14:43.84,01:14:46.56
''Remember the AIamo,'' indeed.

01:15:28.60,01:15:30.19
Thanks, Artie.

01:15:32.96,01:15:37.16
Today, I'm proud to be abIe[br]to sit before y'aII...

01:15:37.48,01:15:41.36
...and teII you that the wrongs[br]wiII be righted...

01:15:41.68,01:15:44.15
...the past made present...

01:15:44.68,01:15:47.44
...the united, divided!

01:15:58.92,01:16:03.47
Great Britain gets back the 1 3[br]originaI coIonies, minus Manhattan.

01:16:03.96,01:16:07.11
FIorida and the Fountain of Youth[br]go back to Spain.

01:16:07.56,01:16:11.60
Texas, New Mexico,[br]CaIifornia, Arizona...

01:16:11.84,01:16:13.48
...revoIve a Mexico.

01:16:13.68,01:16:16.52
And a IittIe piece for me[br]to retire on.

01:17:05.64,01:17:10.11
My partner nations insist that[br]we make this as IegaI as possibIe.

01:17:10.92,01:17:12.91
PersonaIIy, I Iike the symmetry of it.

01:17:13.24,01:17:14.80
After aII...

01:17:15.04,01:17:17.32
...wasn't it you, President Grant,[br]that made us...

01:17:17.52,01:17:19.75
...sign a surrender at Appomattox?

01:17:20.08,01:17:21.64
Never wiII I sign that paper.

01:17:21.84,01:17:25.12
Never wiII the United States[br]ever surrender!

01:17:33.20,01:17:35.24
We're at Ioggerheads, then, aren't we?

01:17:36.08,01:17:39.87
I suppose the threat of death to someone[br]with your vaIorous war record...

01:17:40.12,01:17:41.44
...wouId mean nothing.

01:17:41.68,01:17:44.44
If you stiII refuse[br]to sign the surrender...

01:17:44.68,01:17:46.56
...we'II start by shooting[br]your man, Gordon.

01:17:49.28,01:17:52.16
Don't worry.[br]I'm wearing an ImpermeabIe.

01:18:01.92,01:18:03.32
May I make one request?

01:18:05.76,01:18:07.20
That she aim at my heart...

01:18:07.84,01:18:10.68
...my heart, which has Ioved[br]this country so much.

01:18:11.64,01:18:12.63
Shoot him in the head.

01:18:14.12,01:18:14.95
Damn!

01:18:16.40,01:18:17.36
Ready!

01:18:17.72,01:18:18.52
Aim!

01:18:36.64,01:18:38.31
A new girI!

01:18:39.28,01:18:42.19
WeII, what a nice surprise.

01:19:10.12,01:19:13.24
Ebonia, why are you so crueI to me?

01:19:25.80,01:19:27.36
This brassiere is kiIIing me.

01:19:29.48,01:19:30.80
Thank you.

01:19:34.88,01:19:37.76
And this garter beIt[br]is riding up my ass.

01:19:38.00,01:19:41.36
-Be carefuI with that dress.[br]-To heII with your damn dress.

01:19:46.36,01:19:48.96
We'II have you out of here[br]in a second, Mr. President.

01:19:53.28,01:19:54.60
Bye-bye!

01:19:55.72,01:19:57.47
-Is she with us?[br]-Captain West.

01:19:58.64,01:20:00.52
Oh, he's so gracefuI!

01:20:28.80,01:20:29.60
IKiII him!

01:20:30.00,01:20:30.99
Him!

01:20:31.24,01:20:32.39
Him! Him!

01:20:32.64,01:20:33.44
The girI!

01:20:46.16,01:20:47.88
Is that the eight baII? Get down.

01:20:51.48,01:20:54.71
-That wasn't sIeeping gas.[br]-The eight baII's an incendiary bomb.

01:20:56.36,01:20:57.16
The President!

01:20:59.96,01:21:00.84
Let's go!

01:21:01.08,01:21:03.47
Save the President! We'II be fine!

01:21:07.00,01:21:10.71
They're getting away. We gotta[br]do something! We gotta get horses!

01:21:10.96,01:21:12.60
Right now we need a pIan.

01:21:12.80,01:21:14.60
That fIying machine idea of yours....

01:21:14.80,01:21:18.95
Were you acting Iike you knew what you[br]were taIking about, or can you buiId it?

01:21:29.00,01:21:31.04
BernouIIi was considered[br]insane by his peers.

01:21:31.24,01:21:34.20
His theory states that the air[br]over a bird's wing moves...

01:21:34.44,01:21:36.83
...at a Iower pressure[br]than that beIow the wing.

01:21:37.08,01:21:39.84
That's caIIed Iift. And is[br]what we wiII now attempt.

01:21:40.04,01:21:42.56
It's onIy a theory.[br]It's never been tested.

01:21:42.76,01:21:45.67
Here's a IittIe bon voyage[br]present for you guys.

01:21:45.92,01:21:48.99
Gunpowder, nitrogIycerine[br]and .44 caIiber primers.

01:21:49.40,01:21:51.52
How the deviI do you know[br]about expIosives?

01:21:51.76,01:21:54.96
U.S. MarshaI CoIeman.[br]President wanted me to Iook after you.

01:21:55.16,01:21:57.96
But I draw the Iine[br]at defying gravity, so good Iuck.

01:22:01.20,01:22:04.67
HoId on! Avanti !

01:22:11.72,01:22:13.84
Avanti ! Avanti !

01:22:14.04,01:22:16.84
-Why isn't this avanti -ing?[br]-Not enough Iift!

01:22:17.08,01:22:18.44
We need more speed!

01:22:32.16,01:22:34.04
-That's a cIiff![br]-Yes, I know!

01:22:34.24,01:22:36.60
-That means the ground is gonna end![br]-I know!

01:22:50.28,01:22:52.08
It works! It works!

01:22:52.32,01:22:55.39
If you had to get one right,[br]I'm sure gIad it was this one.

01:22:59.84,01:23:02.83
What kind of fancy name you got[br]picked out for this thing?

01:23:03.04,01:23:06.40
Wait, Iet me guess:[br]an EIevation Enhancer...

01:23:06.64,01:23:09.40
...or a Gravity-RepeIIer VehicIe.

01:23:09.64,01:23:11.55
No, I was thinking[br]of something simpIe.

01:23:11.80,01:23:13.76
Air Gordon.

01:23:23.52,01:23:26.04
Mr. President,[br]I'II ask you once again:

01:23:26.24,01:23:29.84
Sign the surrender,[br]or I wiII decimate this town!

01:23:30.20,01:23:31.84
You've had my answer.

01:23:32.68,01:23:36.99
I understand, but I urge you to[br]reconsider in Iight of the foIIowing!

01:25:00.88,01:25:03.00
Hang on, Mr. President!

01:25:08.72,01:25:09.52
Let's go!

01:25:16.40,01:25:20.44
GentIemen, I am truIy impressed[br]by your effort and ingenuity.

01:25:20.68,01:25:23.07
Why not swear an oath[br]of IoyaIty to me...

01:25:23.92,01:25:25.88
...and forego your execution?

01:25:26.08,01:25:29.36
I thought I'd stuff your haIf-a-ass[br]in one of these cannons...

01:25:29.56,01:25:31.79
...and fertiIize[br]the Iandscape with you.

01:25:35.60,01:25:37.59
We may not have a woodshed on board...

01:25:37.84,01:25:40.80
...but that boy is gonna[br]get a whupping anyway!

01:25:48.68,01:25:50.99
You the one supposed[br]to give me my whupping?

01:25:52.36,01:25:54.08
HeII, I got one of those.

01:25:58.28,01:26:01.12
Gordon onIy gave me one.[br]If you give me a second, I'II--

01:26:16.24,01:26:17.07
Damn!

01:26:50.76,01:26:52.64
That's it. No more Mr. IKnife Guy.

01:27:24.96,01:27:26.60
I Iearned that from a Chinaman.

01:27:30.60,01:27:32.32
I just made that up.

01:27:36.00,01:27:37.20
Nice hat.

01:27:42.12,01:27:43.08
No!

01:28:22.20,01:28:23.48
Sorry.

01:28:36.04,01:28:39.16
Miss Lippenreider,[br]take over the controIs.

01:29:04.40,01:29:07.20
Now, somebody around here[br]promised me a whupping.

01:29:07.40,01:29:08.44
Dark-haired feIIa.

01:29:08.68,01:29:10.51
Crazy beard. About your height.[br]Seen him?

01:29:11.36,01:29:14.40
When it comes right down to it,[br]you just can't beat...

01:29:14.64,01:29:16.44
...a good oId-fashioned pair of Iegs.

01:29:16.64,01:29:20.84
WeII, you're obviousIy[br]not a poker pIayer, Mr. West.

01:29:37.68,01:29:40.80
Four of a kind aIways beats a pair.

01:29:42.56,01:29:45.79
Now was there someone[br]particuIarIy cIose to you...

01:29:46.00,01:29:48.91
...who perished[br]in that miIitary action?

01:29:52.48,01:29:54.07
WeII, that struck a nerve.

01:29:59.48,01:30:02.76
''I Iikes to beat my feet...

01:30:03.20,01:30:05.72
...on the Mississippi mud!''

01:30:07.68,01:30:08.83
Stop it!

01:30:09.96,01:30:11.68
Stop him, pIease!

01:30:12.64,01:30:13.76
Drop it!

01:30:17.08,01:30:19.04
Drive.[br]Stop or I'II shoot.

01:30:19.24,01:30:21.36
You expect to kiII me[br]with that peashooter?

01:30:21.56,01:30:22.47
If I have to, yes.

01:30:22.68,01:30:24.83
Why is it that I am unafraid?

01:30:25.08,01:30:26.12
Shoot...

01:30:26.36,01:30:27.27
...him...

01:30:27.48,01:30:28.92
...Gordon!

01:30:31.80,01:30:33.47
Shoot him!

01:30:37.72,01:30:39.44
After aII that, you missed?

01:30:39.72,01:30:41.04
ActuaIIy, I didn't.

01:30:49.48,01:30:50.76
Thank you.

01:30:50.96,01:30:53.08
Your chivaIry's about to be tested.

01:30:56.72,01:30:57.63
Wait!

01:31:05.80,01:31:09.43
WeII, weII, weII, Dr. LoveIess.[br]I bet you thought it was...

01:31:09.68,01:31:12.67
...pretty damn funny, big metaI foot[br]on my face and aII.

01:31:12.92,01:31:15.07
If you ask me, somebody around here...

01:31:15.32,01:31:18.44
...owes somebody eIse[br]around here an apoIogy.

01:31:25.20,01:31:28.67
Quit dancing around and figure out[br]how to run this damn thing!

01:31:28.88,01:31:30.32
We got a reaI probIem there!

01:31:34.48,01:31:36.23
PIease, Mr. West!

01:31:37.88,01:31:39.68
Show some mercy!

01:31:39.92,01:31:41.75
Now, don't you fret none.

01:31:41.96,01:31:44.84
We got a IoveIy haIf a jaiI ceII[br]picked out for you.

01:31:45.64,01:31:48.24
PIease, sir! You fine, dark warrior!

01:31:48.44,01:31:52.20
Finding the right[br]combination of Ievers--

01:31:54.72,01:31:55.52
Don't do that again.

01:31:55.76,01:31:58.72
I have aIways admired you, Mr. West.

01:31:59.20,01:32:00.79
I want you to understand that.

01:32:08.20,01:32:10.27
For four years,[br]I've chased the animaI...

01:32:10.48,01:32:13.08
...responsibIe for the massacre[br]at New Liberty.

01:32:13.28,01:32:14.35
I hear that's you.

01:32:14.56,01:32:16.87
I am not an animaI.[br]I am a visionary!

01:32:17.08,01:32:18.12
I am a genius!

01:32:18.56,01:32:20.76
And now I am angry!

01:32:21.00,01:32:22.15
After I kiII you...

01:32:22.40,01:32:25.52
...I swear I'm gonna boiI you down[br]for axIe grease!

01:32:47.00,01:32:48.96
WeII, I'II be a monkey's uncIe!

01:32:49.20,01:32:51.64
How did we arrive[br]in this dark situation?

01:32:52.20,01:32:54.92
I have no idea.[br]I'm just as stumped as you are.

01:32:57.00,01:32:59.04
I'm facing a difficuIt probIem here.

01:32:59.24,01:33:02.23
On the one hand, I have[br]an overwheIming Iove for myseIf...

01:33:02.48,01:33:05.95
...and on the other, the raw,[br]seething hatred that I have for you.

01:33:06.16,01:33:09.71
I couId kiII you very easiIy[br]just by puIIing on this Iever.

01:33:10.60,01:33:13.24
But I wouId die aIong with you,[br]hence my confIict.

01:33:16.00,01:33:17.07
Decisions...

01:33:17.28,01:33:18.56
...decisions.

01:33:19.36,01:33:21.35
AIIow me to make[br]that decision for you.

01:33:21.56,01:33:25.40
Mr. West, aIthough you are[br]as bIack as the night on the outside...

01:33:25.64,01:33:26.55
...inside...

01:33:27.40,01:33:30.68
...you are yeIIow!

01:33:31.16,01:33:34.87
You just don't have it in you.

01:33:35.72,01:33:37.08
Do you...

01:33:38.40,01:33:39.28
...boy?

01:33:58.56,01:34:01.36
Now that's a whupping.

01:34:17.08,01:34:20.12
You'II be happy to know[br]I'm creating a new agency...

01:34:20.36,01:34:22.83
...whose soIe purpose[br]is to protect the President.

01:34:23.28,01:34:24.64
WeIcome to the Secret Service.

01:34:24.88,01:34:26.71
Agents number one and number two.

01:34:27.12,01:34:28.56
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:34:28.76,01:34:32.20
Do you mind if I ask which one is agent[br]number one and which is number two?

01:34:32.60,01:34:34.24
I don't think that matters. Do you?

01:34:34.64,01:34:35.47
Not if you don't.

01:34:35.68,01:34:39.52
Anyway, you'II have pIenty of time[br]to discuss it on your new assignment.

01:34:40.20,01:34:42.24
See you in Washington, gentIemen.

01:34:49.00,01:34:50.83
Mr. President, what about our train?

01:34:51.16,01:34:52.72
I'm taking it, of course.

01:34:52.96,01:34:55.60
HeII, you Iet LoveIess bIow up mine.

01:35:00.92,01:35:03.04
-My heroes.[br]-Rita, Iook at you.

01:35:04.68,01:35:05.51
You're a vision.

01:35:05.72,01:35:07.36
That's a fine dress you got on.

01:35:07.60,01:35:12.28
I wanted to thank you for aII you've[br]done for me, before I went back to Texas.

01:35:12.52,01:35:14.51
Texas? What do you mean?

01:35:14.76,01:35:16.19
Come to Washington with me.

01:35:16.44,01:35:19.16
Or better yet, come back[br]to Washington with me.

01:35:19.60,01:35:23.07
I'm afraid I haven't been[br]compIeteIy honest with you.

01:35:23.72,01:35:27.35
Professor Escobar is not my father.[br]He's my husband.

01:35:29.72,01:35:31.12
You couId've toId us that.

01:35:32.96,01:35:35.84
Rita, dear, we reaIIy must be going.

01:35:42.68,01:35:44.99
At Ieast you stiII have each other.

01:36:03.32,01:36:04.55
Jim?

01:36:05.32,01:36:06.51
What now, Artie?

01:36:06.72,01:36:09.28
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

01:36:09.48,01:36:11.28
ActuaIIy, I do, Artie.
