1
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:00,037
No matter what, I can't
believe he'd do this to me.

2
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,672
3 women
at once?

3
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,366
2 girls and.

4
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,044
Who is she'? Their fucking
grandmother? I mean, what?

5
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,672
The man is
a sick bastard.

6
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,310
He's not that bad.

7
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,950
It was on
his business card.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,159
It was a joke.

9
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,324
You're better off
without him. Okay?

10
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,596
Now can we change
the subject?

11
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,966
We've been talking about your
ex since we left Pristina.

12
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:45,806
Whoa!

13
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,886
What the fuck
are you doing?

14
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,188
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

15
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,991
<i>Whoo-hoo!.!</i>

16
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,168
Hey, it's time
to go.

17
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,341
We got to get
out of here.

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,038
Wilson, let's go!

19
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,774
Private, we're leaving!

20
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,053
Hang tight.

22
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,850
Not seeing
anything you like?

23
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,856
Our orders
are very specific.

24
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,688
We're looking for something
a little more high-grade.

25
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,988
I got two smoke
shows coming up.

26
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,896
Brand-new, fresh
fucking racehorses.

27
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,592
Sit down, give me
2 minutes.

28
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,328
You need some positive male
attention for a change.

29
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,169
I mean...

30
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,072
Move on.

31
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,145
Hey, you two
Polacks are up.

32
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,843
Let's go.

33
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,810
Now! Let's go!
Come on!

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,085
<i>All right, all right.</i>

35
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,157
<i>Gentlemen, give it up
for our next act.</i>

36
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,887
<i>We got some European
beauties for you.</i>

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,917
High-grade enough
for you?

38
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,217
Yeah,
these two will work.

39
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,824
Look at
those fake titties.

40
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,966
Well, there you go.

41
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,976
Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,243
Damn, l could
tear that shit up'

43
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,373
Yeah.

44
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,385
Beautiful.

45
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,543
Oh, my gosh.

46
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,917
Grind on her,
baby, come on now.

47
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,990
Put her down
nice and soft.

48
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,157
Excellent
taste as always, Sergeant.

49
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,085
Grind on her.
Grind it' baby!

50
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,153
Sergeant, good job.
Good job.

51
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,106
I need to pee.

52
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,509
Pee'? Wait, wait, wait.
Don't go.

53
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,978
You can pee on me.

54
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,175
You dirty little boy.

55
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,411
Oh!

56
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,116
I love you, baby.
I love you!

57
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,523
Dirty dog.

58
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,420
You're a sicko.
You're sick, dog.

59
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,196
Private, accompany
our guest to the latrine.

60
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,061
Thank you.

61
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,768
Right this way,
ma'am'

62
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,910
Thank you
for the escort.

63
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,055
That's a long-ass piss.

64
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,178
My turn.

65
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,268
What's your status?

66
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,978
2 minutes,
but I may not have it.

67
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,817
- Hold your position, I'm coming.
- Oh' my God.

68
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,251
We'll rendezvous later.

69
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,186
Mina.
Just do it!

70
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,650
Activity in Sector C.

71
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,817
Copy that.

72
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,555
Ma'am.

73
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,836
Ma'am.

74
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,578
Oh!

75
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,012
Security, we have a CIV
unaccompanied on the base.

76
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,145
I repeat, a CIV
unaccompanied on the base.

77
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,554
Where the fuck did she go? You
were supposed to be with her.

78
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,854
I don't know
she just disappeared.

79
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,232
What the hell are
you doing in here?

80
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,733
Just me.

81
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,765
Drop your weapon!

82
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,952
<i>We are Code Orange in Sector 3.
This is not a drill.</i>

83
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,966
Show me
your fucking hands!

84
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,509
Mina!

85
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,522
Don't move!

86
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,620
Put your fucking
hands up!

87
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,362
Get 'em up!

88
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,992
What do you want?

89
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,002
Who sent you?

90
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,400
It's nothing personal.

91
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,099
What isn't personal?

92
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,733
This.

93
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,145
Mina, where are you?

94
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,011
<i>Tatiana, go, save yourself.</i>

95
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,111
It's too hot.
Mina.

96
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,648
So, what's it gonna be?

97
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,746
What's what gonna be?

98
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,984
The new name of
the restaurant?

99
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,390
I think the space is
too small for

100
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,484
"Bitch Who Broke My Heart
and Took Half of My Shit."

101
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,462
Dude.
What? Too soon?

102
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,227
You can change it to
Catalina Spanish Bitch-re.

103
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,358
You know what
you need, man?

104
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,869
You need to get out
of Brooklyn.

105
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,668
Cat's gone, Jules,
that's a fact

106
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,207
whether I'm here
or somewhere else.

107
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,937
That's right, but, look,
we need to go somewhere too.

108
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,479
Take your mind off the whole
restaurant thing and this chick.

109
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,309
Emmett cut that on the bias. On the bias.
You know better.

110
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,509
Yeah, chop, chop.

111
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,917
- Hi Michelle. Let's see what you've got.
- Looks good.

112
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,319
Needs acid. Just a little
bit, though' okay?

113
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,380
Sure.

114
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,221
it needs sea salt.

115
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,721
Hey, man. Uh.

116
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,956
You ever thought
about making short ribs

117
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,396
or like cooking burritos
or something? Mmm?

118
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,057
Why don't you go
clean the dishes for me, man?

119
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,260
Really?
Come on, lazy ass.

120
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,200
The dishes?
Watch out.

121
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,932
<i>This ain't
12 Years a Slave.</i>

122
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,205
Brown.

123
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,334
Party of two for Friday.

124
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,771
That's correct.

125
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,113
I am looking for
Mr. Anthony Hester.

126
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,377
I'm sorry,
sir, we're closed.

127
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,750
I would like for it
to be a surprise.

128
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,079
We're closed, sir.

129
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,983
You can't go back there.

130
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't even try it!

131
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,005
Whoa whoa. Please. Take
your hand out, slowly.

132
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,097
- Slowly.
- Okay, please.

133
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,974
Dimitri Vetrok.

134
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,849
Cooking Network.

135
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,848
I am here about a food
expo in New Orleans.

136
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,321
You are a contestant in this
year's final cook-off.

137
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,915
No, I'm not.
Try again, you fuck.

138
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,655
My fault, I got
your chest all wet.

139
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,196
No, you are.
You're in there.

140
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,492
I entered you
in the contest.

141
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,291
- What?
- Yeah.

142
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,459
You did?
Yeah.

143
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,830
I am?
Yes.

144
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,403
Congratulations.

145
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,564
You're in there.

146
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,265
Man, what's
the matter with you?

147
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,467
You signed me up
for the Louisiana

148
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,168
Bayou to Bourbon
Street Food Expo?

149
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,473
And I entered you
in the final cook-off.

150
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,275
First place, 50 large.

151
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,213
Yeah? I got nowhere to stay.

152
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,146
I got us. You forget I got
family down in New Orleans.

153
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,278
That's my culture.

154
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,822
Culture?
Yeah.

155
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,154
Who that said, "They're
going to beat them Saints?

156
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,025
You know, Mama gonna cook you
a big shrimp basket. Sorry.

157
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,357
You know what? Hey, remember this?
Mmm.

158
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,167
- Mardi Gras, '99.
- Oh, shit.

159
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,667
Remember I was
throwing all those beads

160
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,430
to 8th-grade honeys
with the flat chests?

161
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,527
You remember that.
That was good.

162
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,068
You remember, uh,
Ms. Hogan's class?

163
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,237
Oh,
epic breasts. Epic.

164
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,667
You know, she
confiscated all my beads,

165
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,440
didn't show me
as much as a.

166
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,783
Mmm but that was
a Fat Tuesday.

167
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,642
So what's it gonna be?

168
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,017
Look, my uncle
can put us up

169
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,216
and give us a home
base for the expo.

170
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,791
All right.
Fuck it, New Orleans.

171
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,522
Ah one word.

172
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,789
N'awlins.

173
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,221
Say it with me...

174
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,355
N'awlins.

175
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,477
Look at that

176
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,541
We in the
Big Easy, baby.

177
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,970
They didn't have that
last time we were here.

178
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,837
Oh, I'm ready. You ready?

179
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,156
Right?
Nice.

180
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,923
Hey!
Jackhole.

181
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,728
Big Ray.

182
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,801
What's up, man?
Hey, baby.

183
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,427
Good to see you.
Looking good, brother.

184
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,698
Always.
What'd you expect?

185
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,864
Man the whip is nice.

186
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,929
Absolutely.

187
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,100
Let me get these
bags real quick.

188
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,609
Yeah,
right here.

189
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,868
Thanks, man,
I appreciate it.

190
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,572
This is, uh, my friend and
business partner, Anthony Hester.

191
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,273
How you doing, man? Anthony.
Hey. Ray Boudreaux.

192
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,749
Welcome to the Big Easy.
Love it.

193
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,014
Ain't that big, ain't
always easy, but it's home.

194
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,181
Yeah. So, uh, what happened
to Jenkins corner store?

195
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,453
He retired. But your little friend
Simone, she's staying in there.

196
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,293
Whoa. "Big Bone"
Simone, huh?

197
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,920
Yeah, that big girl.
What?

198
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,999
Okay, she used to eat all
the gumbo and everything.

199
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,327
Jambalaya. All the gumbo.
Everything,

200
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,560
The dirty rice.
Ate it all up.

201
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,364
Went to the ass. To the hips?
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah...

202
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,563
Well, yeah.

203
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,804
In fact, she said one of
you guys can stay with her

204
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,272
'cause I only got
one couch upstairs.

205
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,571
Okay, well, then, uh, look, I'm
gonna stay upstairs with Big Ray.

206
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,009
Yeah, that's all right.
And uh, you know...

207
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,636
Go on and take
that for the team.

208
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,907
Stay with Simone.
Okay.

209
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,745
But she's good. She's
big, but she's sweet.

210
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,680
You'll like her.
So that's not her?

211
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,398
I missed you!
Wow! Look at you!

212
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,201
You look great!
Uh.

213
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,797
Look at...
You got so big.

214
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,935
And you got so small.

215
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,307
But like a good
small, though.

216
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,369
Yeah?
You look so good.

217
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,471
Oh. Is this your friend?

218
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,778
Anthony, nice
to meet you.

219
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,943
I think I'm staying with you.

220
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,212
Oh, I was just telling
Anthony

221
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,256
that you're gonna be staying
with Big Ray upstairs.

222
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,388
Well, whatever
you guys want'

223
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,360
I know what I want.
Want me to show you inside?

224
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,489
Cool, all right. I'm
go ahead and, uh...

225
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,394
See you
at dinner huh?

226
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,867
Yeah, take care.
All right.

227
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,723
Uh, you know, Antoine,

228
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,818
guests in my house
don't have to cook.

229
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,364
Oh, it's Anthony, please.

230
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,990
It's my pleasure. I like
to earn my keep you know?

231
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,927
You want to come over here
and taste this stuff?

232
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,468
Ah, no, no, no, no.

233
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,937
I'm looking forward.

234
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,363
<i>Big Ray.</i>

235
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,739
Um listen, y'all
might want to bring

236
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,072
a little something
extra to eat tonight.

237
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,704
No, no. Just bring a
little somethin'-somethin'

238
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,717
All right. Come on m. Get
this food in here. Come on.

239
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,082
Angie?

240
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,935
ls any of
this vegetarian?

241
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,067
All right, come on.

242
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,271
All right,
who wants the good stuff?

243
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,337
Antoine, he made
these ribs.

244
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,277
Okay? Come on.

245
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,316
Lord, we would
like to thank you for

246
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,182
bringing this strong
family together today.

247
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,586
And thank you for the bounty
that you have placed upon us.

248
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,953
In Jesus' name, amen.

249
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,990
And thanks
for bringing the beer.

250
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,116
So rude!

251
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,063
Who made all this?

252
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,726
I miss food.
Yeah.

253
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,731
Hey, Big Ray, you tried
that sauce with the ribs?

254
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,205
Oh, yeah. The sauce
was wonderful.

255
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,297
Right?
Mmm-hmm.

256
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,275
Did you try
that sauce?

257
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,970
Did y'all try
the barbecue sauce?

258
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,069
What are you doing with
yourself these days, Jackhole?

259
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,914
Jay, um, lives
in New York.

260
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,214
I'm a private investigator.

261
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,021
- A what?
- A private dick.

262
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,649
And, uh..

263
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,318
Private detective,
or dick.

264
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,692
I'm a dick, okay?
I'm a dick. All right?

265
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,164
Bullshit.

266
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,098
I don't know why
it's so funny. I mean it's true.

267
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,231
We have an office space
we just leased out.

268
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,497
We solve cases.

269
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,564
<i>Yes, we solve cases.</i>

270
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,769
We've gotten cases.

271
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,539
How many cases?
A lot of cases.

272
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,136
Yeah, we...
A lot of cases.

273
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,148
We had one big case
that put us on the map.

274
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,219
But then all of the rest of them
were like little branch cases.

275
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,722
Uh, cheating husbands, alimony
checks not being there.

276
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,951
Child support things, those cases.
We had a murder case.

277
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,257
So' you're in people's
drawers and pocketbooks?

278
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,422
Something like that. You know.
Hey, sex sells'

279
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,432
What's the name of
this crackerjack outfit?

280
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,430
It's called the Juan
Detective Agency.

281
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,002
You and who else?

282
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,805
You and who?

283
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,376
You and me.
That's okay, Jackhole,

284
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,278
y'all probably just
in it for the pussy.

285
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,979
But that's a good reason
to be in anything.

286
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,884
Ain't that right, baby'?
That's what I'm talking about.

287
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,191
Hey' Hey.

288
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,982
What's going on?

289
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,060
From the Halls of Montezuma.
Wilson.

290
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,028
- Hey, hey.
- What's up, man?

291
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,191
I was wondering when
you were showing up.

292
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,892
What's going on, man?

293
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,701
You all right, brother?

294
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,930
Hey, come and have
a seat, man.

295
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,165
Excuse me for being rude.
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,866
My military
friend here, Nina.

297
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,908
Hi.

298
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,533
Pleased to meet you.
Welcome.

299
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,868
Come on in.

300
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,856
<i>So you don't
remember anything?</i>

301
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,501
It's just a blank.

302
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,730
Doctors say that it probably
won't ever come back.

303
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,077
But I saw
the official story,

304
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,045
and it just doesn't
make any sense.

305
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,282
They said it was
a training exercise.

306
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,611
What kind of training exercise kills
the 3 highest-ranking officers,

307
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,517
his sergeant
and a doggone.

308
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,611
Civilian.

309
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,247
Yeah, a civilian.

310
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,447
Civilian?

311
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,515
Stripper.

312
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,997
There's rumors going
around that she was...

313
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,225
You know me' Jay.

314
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,531
I mean I love the ladies' but I
would never hurt nobody.

315
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,898
You know that

316
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,077
<i>Now, they're saying it's
some kind of gang rape gone wrong.</i>

317
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,072
Now, look, my cousin
may have blue balls

318
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,548
and absolutely zero game,
but he's no rapist.

319
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,647
So you want
to clear his name?

320
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,152
Yeah, and it wouldn't
hurt to gain some points

321
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,312
with the southern
relations.

322
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,857
Look, I know I got you into this
competition, and now I'm asking you to.

323
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,152
Nah, man, don't worry about that.
I'll drop out

324
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,488
No, I'm not saying that
I'm saying we do both.

325
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,360
I say we clear my cousin's
name and win the contest.

326
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,394
What do you think?

327
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,333
I say we got
our next case.

328
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,629
My man.

329
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,035
Let's go inside,
it's cold.

330
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,508
You have failed
in your mission'

331
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,513
The Wolf still
needs the plans.

332
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,151
<i>That is courteous,
but unnecessary.</i>

333
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,581
Mina's body and personal effects
have been moved off base.

334
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,687
For the moment,
I do not know.

335
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,988
But that will change.

336
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,057
<i>Mina's body
cannot be autopsied</i>

337
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,497
<i>or the nature of our gifts
will become known.</i>

338
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,001
<i>And this will bring
unwanted attention.</i>

339
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,867
<i>Is that clear?
Mmm.</i>

340
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,031
<i>Expect my call.</i>

341
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,167
Mina.

342
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,511
<i>You need some positive
male attention for a change.</i>

343
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,569
Hi, welcome to
Uptown Speed Dating.

344
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,637
Hi-.

345
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,944
So, are you ready
to mingle?

346
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,040
Um...

347
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,388
Yes. Okay, great. So
what's your name?

348
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,747
Um...

349
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,451
My name is Ludmila.

350
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,255
Hi, it's really nice to meet you.
I'm Andrew.

351
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,556
Nice to meet you, too.

352
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,564
How's it going? Jeff.
Gabriel.

353
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,894
Bobby. Very nice
to meet you.

354
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,624
How are you doing?
Where are you from?

355
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,894
I'm from Croatia.

356
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,028
Mmm, Russia.

357
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,469
I am from
Czech Republic.

358
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,641
I like to play soccer.
You like soccer?

359
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,674
I love dancing.

360
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,602
And skiing.

361
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,772
And, uh...

362
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,448
Do you like Chekhov?

363
00:23:59,038 --> 00:23:59,982
Who's Chekhov?

364
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,518
Yes, the original
series Chekov.

365
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,111
Not that douche from the J.J.
Abrams reboot.

366
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,958
<i>My favorite of his would have
to be The Cherry Orchard.</i>

367
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,651
Up here. Yeah?

368
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,922
Yes.

369
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,120
Switch.

370
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,756
I am a professional gambler.

371
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm an actor.

372
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,302
I am hoping to be a
real estate one day.

373
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,996
Do you like real estate?

374
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,798
Um, I'd like to have
a house on the beach.

375
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,238
You look like someone who would
do very well on a beach.

376
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,870
That was very awkward.
I shouldn't say it that way.

377
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,482
I'm just a fitness buff,
a gambling fiend.

378
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,950
Go out every night and
try to pick up women.

379
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,078
Uh, I'm a fashion designer.

380
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,815
A gym teacher.

381
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,084
I work with children,
sick children.

382
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,352
Switch.

383
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,126
I love your eyes
and your teeth'

384
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,560
Your smile is very pretty.

385
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,257
Your chin is amazing.
My chin?

386
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,492
It's a strong chin.

387
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,501
I don't like these girls
who have the chins,

388
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,798
they start over here
and go all the way down.

389
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,839
I like your eyes a lot.

390
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,998
My eyes or my ass?

391
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,372
You have the most amazing
eyes I've ever seen.

392
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,344
And I'm not a breast guy,
so I think we might work out.

393
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,675
Switch!

394
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,814
You don't have
a nametag.

395
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,281
I'm Eric.

396
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,545
This is Cody
and Dustin.

397
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,651
Always bring your buddies
with you on a date?

398
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,127
My cousins.

399
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,389
Family is very
important to me.

400
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,933
I see.

401
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,926
What do you
like to do, Eric'?

402
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,338
Wind-surfing,
cooking classes,

403
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,374
watching movies in bed.

404
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,734
Killing people?

405
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,542
Depending on the threat
they pose to my employer.

406
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,606
Yes.

407
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,954
You have the blueprint
of the American exo-armor.

408
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,185
Give them to us,

409
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,228
and you won't
have to die.

410
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,026
That's gentlemanly
of you, Eric

411
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,327
Switch!

412
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,793
I do try.

413
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,775
Sir, you need
to switch your table,

414
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,207
You only get 5 minutes.
I know she's pretty, but.

415
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,572
Speed dating, you
have to, like, move.

416
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,637
Come on, buddy,
time's up'

417
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,184
I know she's really pretty.
Come on.

418
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,583
Bye.

419
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,185
Can't seem to find
normal people at these things.

420
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,459
Okay, um, I'm Steve.

421
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,088
I'm recently divorced.

422
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,299
Boy, you are beautiful.

423
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,936
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,202
I've been out of the game
for a while, I guess.

425
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,410
You know what,
I don't like this place.

426
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,842
Do you want to go
back to your place?

427
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,007
Whoa.

428
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,846
Uh, yeah.

429
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,779
What do you think?
Nice.

430
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,416
Beautiful day
for a beautiful girl.

431
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,590
Why don't you have a seat, and
I'll go get some stuff for us.

432
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,650
<i>Okay! -</i>

433
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,302
Toad style.

434
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,817
I see you know
scorpion style.

435
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,071
Seriously, you're
cramping my style.

436
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,113
<i>Here we go.
Yoo-hoo!</i>

437
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,052
Do you have a blanket?

438
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,552
It's a little chilly.

439
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,882
Yeah, of course.

440
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,594
She likes you, it's okay.
She likes you' really.

441
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,678
Shh.

442
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,983
Is everything okay?

443
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,890
Yeah, everything's fine!

444
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:16,088
Quiet!
I'm on a date, okay?

445
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,464
A kiss of Tainted Love.

446
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,312
Your girlfriend
is very lucky.

447
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,790
All right.
Red or white?

448
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,848
Um' whiskey.

449
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,126
Whiskey?
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,419
Steve!

451
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,686
Could you change
the music?

452
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,162
What would you
like to hear?

453
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,495
Just play
something different

454
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,009
Is that good?

455
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,842
I'm really not
into country music.

456
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,440
Do you have
any classical?

457
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,520
I'll see what I can
find on the radio.

458
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,610
Thank you!

459
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,832
We shall meet again.

460
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,498
Hi-.

461
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,274
You know, maybe we should have
drinks inside. It's a little cold.

462
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,014
Look, Ludmila.
Yes?

463
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,941
You seem like
a really nice girl.

464
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,352
I mean, maybe
a little high-maintenance, but

465
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,818
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

466
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,882
Sorry.

467
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,561
Okay?

468
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,975
Pull!

469
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,690
So, Mr. LaMonde.

470
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,385
How's the richest
redneck I know?

471
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,330
Yeah. I know
where that is.

472
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,113
Oh, yeah. What do
you know about it?

473
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,722
I didn't want any
forensics tampered with.

474
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,431
God bless the Corps,
but their brass

475
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,662
ain't above
covering their asses.

476
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,304
Plus, we got
appropriations coming up'

477
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,204
Got to keep
things clean.

478
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,568
Pull!

479
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,343
Well, we'll have to
pick this up next time.

480
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:58,913
Who?

481
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,859
Coroner.
Plaquemines Parish.

482
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,951
She'll be safe there.

483
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,225
Pull!

484
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,783
Ongoing investigation.

485
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,712
Dead end.

486
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:31,810
Ah, not necessarily.

487
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,687
I asked him where a guy could go
to pay for some tail around here.

488
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,656
She She's?
Strip club?

489
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,153
I think so.

490
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,854
Big booties?
Big booties

491
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,396
You got singles?

492
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,636
Hello.

493
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,970
Yeah, I see 'em.

494
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,576
Private eyes?

495
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,110
I'll be back
in a sec.

496
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,974
Hey, okay, now.

497
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,676
Ooh. Don't throw it on me.

498
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,445
It's my birthday.

499
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,019
He's got a beard.

500
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,292
What the fuck
do you want?

501
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:15,888
You run this spot?

502
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,991
It's my club. We don't
allow dicks back here.

503
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,297
Especially no
private dicks.

504
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,728
What do you
boys want?

505
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,897
We want to know
about that escort

506
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,099
that was killed
at Fort Polk.

507
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,198
We got dancers here.

508
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,706
Artistes.

509
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:32,411
Girls want to push pussy on their
own time, that's their business.

510
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,949
Kindly go
fuck yourselves.

511
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,109
You know anybody
that'd want to hurt her?

512
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,413
What did I say,
motherfucker?

513
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,124
Let's get out of here.

514
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,715
No, no, no. Hold up.

515
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,259
One of the men that was wounded
that night was my cousin.

516
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,261
Now somebody gonna give
me some damn information.

517
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,561
I don't give a fuck if it
was your mama in drag.

518
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:51,692
My mama?

519
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,598
Um, right by the balls.

520
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,105
<i>I got your gun.</i>

521
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,874
Get your ass on your knees.
Get on your knees.

522
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,040
Hey, big man!
Put him down.

523
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,246
Get on your knees, too. Come
on, corn-fed. Hurry up.

524
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,079
Uh...

525
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,917
You can go on and go. It
might get a little bloody.

526
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,288
Get a little blood
on your two-piece.

527
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,793
I'm gonna send you a friend
request, though. Okay.

528
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,452
Here, go on and take the gun.
That don't smell right.

529
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:22,790
All right. I'm about to go
Helen Bingham on his ass.

530
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,993
All right. Talk. Mmm.
Talk.

531
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,595
It was 2 white girls. Russians,
come in from Galveston

532
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,432
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that

533
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,497
What else,
motherfucker?

534
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,133
I don't know shit
about the other girl.

535
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,908
The one that got killed. They
moved her to Plaquemines Parish.

536
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,073
Who told you that?

537
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,741
It's professional
courtesy to.

538
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,478
Professional courtesy?

539
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,076
Fuck! It was
Beau LaMonde.

540
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,146
He's got a gator farm up
in Lake Pontchartrain.

541
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,383
He loves to run his mouth when
his drawers getting worked on.

542
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,117
I swear
that's all I got!

543
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,159
That's all you got? Huh?
Mmm?

544
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,696
That's all I got.

545
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,233
You got a thong
on, too.

546
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,493
Stay on your
fucking knees.

547
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,696
Yeah.

548
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,999
Why you got
a gold thong on?

549
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,670
Fucking bastard.

550
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,768
Let's go, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

551
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,980
We got to make
a right or left?

552
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,015
You got a GPS, man?

553
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,276
"Mid 20s, excellent
physical condition.

554
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,882
"Signs of pre-mortem
intercourse.

555
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,050
"Contusions,
head and neck.

556
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,748
"Multiple bullet wounds.
One fatal shot to the head."

557
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,414
What are you
doing, man?

558
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,481
What? Looking for
identifying marks'

559
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,054
No tan lines,
nice body.

560
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,767
Oh. Fully shaven.
Brazilian.

561
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,234
Vag piercings.

562
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,338
Not a stripper.

563
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,670
Why do you say that?

564
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,937
Well, because there's
too much hardware

565
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,568
that gets in the way
of the software.

566
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,506
The piercings get caught
in a guy's teeth,

567
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,776
sounds like a door knocker.

568
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,508
He'd knock a nipple off.

569
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,644
Catastrophe, he can't
make it ram like that.

570
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,250
Pretty good hands,
nice hands.

571
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,882
No nail polish.

572
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:05,917
Hmm.

573
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,163
This tattoo though.

574
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,288
I've seen it before.

575
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,060
Where?

576
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,896
I don't remember.

577
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,666
Um...

578
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,470
Hit the lights.
Hit the lights!

579
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,707
Uh...

580
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,177
Hey, man, let me m.
Come on, man!

581
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,310
There's no room, man.

582
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,856
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, man!

583
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,185
Damn n.

584
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,021
Whoa...

585
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,119
Goodness! Oh, okay.

586
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:42,821
Okay?

587
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,874
Oh, Lord.

588
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,726
Oh, man.

589
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,508
Hey, what you waiting for?

590
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,042
Those girls definitely weren't strippers.
Yeah. I told you.

591
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,516
I had to lay next to a dead guy.
He was musty.

592
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,211
Bucket list, man.

593
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,484
- Shit! Get down!
- Watch it!

594
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,784
Hurry up!

595
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,859
Oh, I think I got hit.

596
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,867
Okay.

597
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,432
Jay?

598
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,808
Oh! Hey!

599
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,680
What happened?

600
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,272
Uh, just a little
complication in the case.

601
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,340
Complication?

602
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,817
Yeah. It's all good.

603
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,978
Do you need some
help with that?

604
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,352
Maybe.
Okay, great.

605
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,186
Sit. Just sit down.
Okay.

606
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,123
I'll be right back. Okay.
All right.

607
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,289
Breathe, breathe.

608
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,097
What are you doing?
Take your pants off.

609
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,869
I've seen you with less
clothes on than that before.

610
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,870
All right. Uh, okay.
Okay.

611
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:41,472
I remember when you used to give
me looks when we were kids.

612
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,681
I guess I was a little chubby
chaser back then, right?

613
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,580
No, I mean, but
you've changed, girl!

614
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,910
Tattoos and everything. I can do tats.
That's what I do now.

615
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,913
Well, I admire a man
who will risk his life

616
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,288
to save his family.

617
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,555
What can I say? That's what I do.
I risk for the family.

618
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,732
You really grew up.

619
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,313
So, that's it. Julian's
cousin's completely innocent'

620
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,848
Mmm, I knew it.

621
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:23,051
But if you're just gonna
whack the top brass,

622
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,381
why go somewhere
where you're guaranteed

623
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,045
to get caught
and killed yourself?

624
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,748
I think they were at the
base for something else.

625
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,349
We just don't know what it is yet.

626
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,425
My man.

627
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:32,961
So, what's the bad news?

628
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,765
What's the bad news?

629
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,430
You and Jackhole let some
motherfucker shoot up my goddamn car?

630
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,742
Oh, son of a bitch!

631
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,876
If it makes you feel any better,
Jules got a flesh wound.

632
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:50,912
Good, God damn it!

633
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,811
Where's your motherfucking
flesh wound?

634
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,393
If it wasn't
the Chinese,

635
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,952
who were they?

636
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,432
I don't know.

637
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,259
But they obviously had
the same intel we did.

638
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,437
Whoever they were, you will
have to deal with them.

639
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,377
And your former
employer, Mr, Cordray.

640
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,408
I will inform the Wolf that
these plans are incomplete.

641
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,587
We will have to
find another way.

642
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,174
Boss.

643
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,805
Boss, wake up.
Boss.

644
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,646
What?
Camera 3.

645
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,584
Go check it out.

646
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,912
Casey?

647
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:43,919
Casey?

648
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,323
Oh, fuck!

649
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,781
Bitch!

650
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,921
Two men who came by,
who were they?

651
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,388
Who were they?

652
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,135
Couple pie-ass Pls
from New York.

653
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,064
I didn't tell
them nothing.

654
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,401
I know what
you told them.

655
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,938
You fucking shot me.

656
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,972
I have something for the pain.

657
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,740
This is how
I'm going out?

658
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:41,909
Yes.

659
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,509
No bitches
on my tip?

660
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,831
Is that better?

661
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,130
Actually, yeah.

662
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,105
I want you to know

663
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,935
it's nothing personal.

664
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:06,100
I don't give a...

665
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:55,880
Sounds good.

666
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,155
Thank you, partner.

667
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,024
Hey, Big Ray,
let me ask you a question.

668
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,688
Hit me, Antoine.

669
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:04,494
Remember those, uh,
ribs that I made?

670
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,692
Yeah.

671
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,194
What was wrong
with them?

672
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,331
Well, there was nothing
wrong with them exactly.

673
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,309
In fact, I don't think I've ever
had a rib sauce so precise.

674
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,705
What they lacked was

675
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,874
passion, spontaneity.

676
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,477
See, there's three things
in life you got to riff,

677
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,785
Cooking, playing jazz,
and fucking.

678
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,616
So, what do I do?

679
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,683
Man, you know how
to fuck, don't you?

680
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,784
Good-looking white boy like
you must get plenty of tail.

681
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,155
See, you got to...

682
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:38,226
You got to give
yourself over to it.

683
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,798
Just riff' brother.
Just riff.

684
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,368
I don't really do that

685
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,539
Yeah. Well, the levees
wasn't built in a day.

686
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,201
I can help you with
the cooking and the jazz,

687
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,338
but the fucking you got to
do on your own.

688
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,474
See, it's like this. It's about the...
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

689
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,675
About the...

690
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,485
When you get the good
food, you say...

691
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,021
Mmm.

692
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,254
Right? And when you get
the good jazz, you say...

693
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,485
Mmm!
Mmm!

694
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,053
And, boy' you get
that good pussy,

695
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,119
it's sure gonna
make you say.

696
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,391
Mmm!
Mmm!

697
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,499
Let's go back to the...

698
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:12,590
Come on.

699
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,930
That's what I'm talking about.
Then you got to say.

700
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,396
Mmm!

701
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:19,941
I feel dirty.
I feel dirty now.

702
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,566
Grab your nuts.
Grab your nuts.

703
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,071
Hold on to them nuts,
say... Mmm!

704
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,402
Mmm!

705
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,142
Mmm!
Mmm!

706
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,674
One more time, say...

707
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,306
Mmm!

708
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,551
<i>Baby, you go!
that good pussy</i>

709
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,681
<i>Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about</i>

710
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:39,928
<i>Spread them pretty legs and let
me sink between them, yeah</i>

711
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,993
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

712
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,162
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

713
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,136
I think I'm ready.
I think I'm ready.

714
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,603
Let me hear that fucking.

715
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,695
Mmm!

716
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,998
Ow!
Ow!

717
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,975
And finally you say.

718
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,818
All right, all right.

719
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,479
You got it, baby.

720
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,885
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

721
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,619
Let me make you some breakfast, yeah?
All right.

722
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,090
What do you want?
What do you want?

723
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,252
Some pussy.

724
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:02,168
Welcome to
the Barataria Bayou Barn!

725
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,408
I'm Guy Mancini.

726
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:09,341
<i>And this is
Americana Chophouse!</i>

727
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,188
Today on the Chophouse,
we are going to feed you

728
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:16,350
the filet mignon
of the bayou.

729
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,154
The American alligator.

730
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,793
We are going
to cue 'em

731
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,057
and stew 'em and feed
'em to you good folks.

732
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,190
And this particular gator that
we're going to enjoy today

733
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,202
came right out of
the bayous behind us.

734
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:31,732
Before we go
any further though,

735
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:32,899
I would also like
to say thanks

736
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:35,443
to the man who provided us with
the space and the game today,

737
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,274
Mr. Beau LaMonde.

738
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,644
Looking very sharp
back there.

739
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,705
Wait.
Isn't he the one.

740
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,012
Cordray mentioned. Probably
tipped off the assassins.

741
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,815
Go try and
get close to him.

742
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,253
Well,
first things first

743
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:48,721
Got to have a nice,
sharp knife.

744
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,349
So, we're going to
start up here, high.

745
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,893
- Can you hang on to it for me?
- Yeah.

746
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,826
Keep this thing from
spinning right here.

747
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,459
It's like that saying.

748
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,037
"Bravest man I ever saw, the
first to eat an oyster raw."

749
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,901
I'd like to see the first guy who
wrestled one of these things

750
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,065
and go, "I'm hungry."

751
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,543
You got to go on in there, you
got to go through the rib cage.

752
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,403
But you don't want to
bypass the stomach either.

753
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,573
'Cause we found a 12-pound
catfish in one of them one time.

754
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,743
We smoked it up with some pecan shells.
It was delicious.

755
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,013
Okay, here we go.

756
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,217
Feel around in the stomach right there.
You see it?

757
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,280
See the stomach
right there?

758
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,223
Feel around, see if you can
find anything in there.

759
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,120
You feel anything?

760
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:28,891
I got something solid.

761
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,626
Well, it could be a turtle.
They eat those whole.

762
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,291
You can make
a soup out of that

763
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,390
No, I don't think
it's a turtle.

764
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,595
Let's see.
Can you get it out?

765
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,296
It's not a turtle.

766
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,394
Hmm.

767
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,337
Oh-ho!

768
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,432
Fuck.

769
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,704
Whoa,
that's not a turtle.

770
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,144
Let's, uh,
put that in a pan.

771
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,875
Never found one
of those before.

772
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,280
That's... Getting a little
too curious about...

773
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:05,493
What is it?
Are you missing somebody?

774
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,068
Whoa, what's up,
Beau? What is that?

775
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,764
I'm cutting open a gator,
I'm cooking this food. What the hell is that?

776
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,936
That was definitely that
girl from the morgue's hand.

777
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:14,169
She had the tattoo.

778
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,006
She also had these
weird metallic implants.

779
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,341
Wasn't on the
Coroner's report.

780
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,340
That ought to raise
a red flag at Homicide.

781
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:24,809
Or not.

782
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,647
What was that?

783
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,849
That's Louisiana
justice.

784
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,217
We got to get by
that water, man

785
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,918
There's going to be more
evidence around there.

786
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,326
The water? Like, where
the gators are? Yeah.

787
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,365
And they're doing gator shit,
like devouring human parts?

788
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,400
You know what we gotta do over there too, right?
We're gonna look.

789
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,764
No, you going
to look over there.

790
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,464
Hell' no, I'm not going there.
We're both going over.

791
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,561
Come on. Let's go.
What?

792
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,867
Man' I hate gators.

793
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:53,681
<i>Sir, I can't understand you.</i>

794
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,240
<i>What?</i>

795
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,844
<i>Could you speak
English please?</i>

796
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,852
They probably dumped
the body over by the bridge.

797
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,019
Just keep
your eyes open, all right?

798
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,791
I got 'em open.
I'm looking.

799
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,791
I don't like the look
of this water.

800
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,039
Shit, look. It's right there.
See?

801
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,870
See what?

802
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:28,078
You want me to what?

803
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,579
Like kill 'em?

804
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,224
You understand that?

805
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:38,385
I'm going to send
the other two dudes.

806
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:42,392
We got two creepers on the
northwest side of Upper Kenter.

807
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,830
Take 'em out.

808
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,056
Them two dudes.

809
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:48,625
Look at 'em.

810
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,399
Little mini steps.

811
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,462
Creeping

812
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,437
I can't get wet.

813
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,480
I can't believe you're
making me do this, man.

814
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,914
I thought our friendship
meant more.

815
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:04,916
You know the largest gator ever
found was 1809, Louisiana.

816
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,913
Really?
19 feet, 1,000 pounds.

817
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,747
Okay, that's not cool, man.
Wrong timing.

818
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,485
Give me your hand.

819
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,420
Oh, fuck!

820
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:16,931
- Reach.
- Pull, pull!

821
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,258
It was your idea, you know.

822
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,604
Dude, don't
let me fucking...

823
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,338
Grab it.
I got it. Fuck.

824
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:29,334
Dude, this is the same one that
we found in that girl's hand.

825
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,102
Pull me out, man.
Hey, is that a gator?

826
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,078
Pull me, man! Pull me!

827
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,146
Oh, Shit! Shit! Pull!

828
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:42,986
Go, go, go, man!
Come on!

829
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,526
Come on. Come on!
Come on, run!

830
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,157
Come on.

831
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,692
Come on.

832
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,802
You know how to drive one of these?
My cousin had one.

833
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,703
Come on, come on.
Lay low!

834
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,231
Push, man, push!
Come on!

835
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,384
Where should we go? I don't know!
Just keep going!

836
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:21,294
Hey, skeletal augmentation
with titanium alloy.

837
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,857
These are not ordinary
assassins, man.

838
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,873
Who's that?
Can you see?

839
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,946
- Holy shit!
- She's shooting.

840
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,210
Go this way!
Go down that canal.

841
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,550
Fuck, I don't know
where this leads, man.

842
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:01,763
Push it faster!

843
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,301
Anthony' faster!

844
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,352
You missed us, bitch!
We're out of here!

845
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,421
Wait a minute.
She's gaining on us.

846
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,088
She's got the scope.
Come on!

847
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,062
You gotta go side to side. Side to side!
We gotta shake them!

848
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:40,898
We're not
losing her!

849
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,944
I think there's something up here.
Make a left.

850
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,180
Hold on, man!
Hold on!

851
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,122
Hold on! Hold on!

852
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:58,352
Can't this thing
go faster?

853
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,723
Big bump! Hold on!

854
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,673
Motherfucker! Yeah!
Whoo!

855
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:24,844
Fuck!

856
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:27,947
Bio-enhanced assassins.

857
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,388
That's some real
black ops shit.

858
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,448
Who are they? What did
they want at Fort Polk?

859
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:33,654
I've been thinking,
maybe it's some kind of

860
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,787
ultra high-tech
weapons system.

861
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,229
And I've been
thinking about that tattoo.

862
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,430
I know I've seen it
somewhere, like, on a woman.

863
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,629
I'm gonna need your
help remembering that.

864
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:43,797
Yeah.

865
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,306
Last year, my physics
adviser had a meeting

866
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,704
with some researchers
at Fort Pork'

867
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,970
- and he came back and he...
- Simone.

868
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,337
You mind if we talk
about this later?

869
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,476
Okay, sure.
I'm gonna be in my room.

870
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,506
All right. You ready
to get to work?

871
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,085
Yeah. Cue the music,
let's do it.

872
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,414
Baby, get it right there.

873
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,651
Oh.

874
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:08,822
Hey.

875
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:10,990
What is going on here?

876
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:14,159
Ah, how do
I say this?

877
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:16,634
Julian's got what he calls
a pornographic memory.

878
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,264
You mean
photographic memory?

879
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
No.

880
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,204
Total sexual recall. He says he can
literally never forget a fuck.

881
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,211
I need quiet.

882
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,278
Right now he's going
through his memory banks.

883
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,475
For fun?

884
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,915
For the job.

885
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,318
Okay, okay.

886
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:35,557
You're saying he's going
into this memory of his

887
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,854
and recalling all the girls
he's ever slept with?

888
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,886
How long could
that possibly take?

889
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,228
Oh. Ooh.

890
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,764
You got 15 minutes.

891
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,231
Oh, do that right there.
Ooh, girl!

892
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,472
<i>Oh, yeah,
I remember that night.</i>

893
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,872
<i>She had so many tattoos.</i>

894
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,144
<i>She had, like,
Egyptian hieroglyphics.</i>

895
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:06,778
<i>"Savage North or "South,"
or something like that.</i>

896
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,721
<i>No. That's not it.</i>

897
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:10,258
<i>Jessica, I remember her.</i>

898
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,789
<i>Yeah. She kind of had
a little mustache, but...</i>

899
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,557
<i>No, that wasn't</i> a <i>tattoo.</i>

900
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:17,098
<i>- Ah, twerking Tina.</i>
- Yeah.

901
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,167
<i>Yes. Twerking Tina.
Where's that tattoo?</i>

902
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,963
<i>No, she had
a butterfly. Oh!</i>

903
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,930
<i>My Asian persuasion.
The tramp stamp.</i>

904
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:25,598
And the sleeve.

905
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,639
<i>Oh, but she would
slap so hard.</i>

906
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,501
<i>No, damn it!</i>

907
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:32,508
Ooh.

908
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,413
<i>Flapjacks. Yes, I know
she had a tattoo.</i>

909
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,550
<i>Oh, it was a rose.</i>

910
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,052
<i>I'm looking for
that damn scorpion.</i>

911
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,046
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

912
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:42,748
<i>The two wild strippers.</i>

913
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,782
<i>They had
a lot of tattoos.</i>

914
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,221
<i>What were their tattoos'?
Oh, that's right.</i>

915
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,958
<i>What did she have, like a
magic dragon or something?</i>

916
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,094
<i>No, it wasn't a scorpion.</i>

917
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,725
<i>Oh, but she was
working her body.</i>

918
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,066
<i>Then we went to Pinkberry
after that.</i>

919
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,764
Ooh, Simone.

920
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,830
<i>Girl, you slimmed up.</i>

921
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,140
<i>What was
you doing, Herbalife?</i>

922
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:05,213
<i>Oh, yeah. She had a fire dragon.
it was like a phoenix.</i>

923
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,743
No!

924
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,249
You are so bad.

925
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,082
<i>She didn't have a tattoo,
why is she in this sequence?</i>

926
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,448
Get me out of here!

927
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,146
Oh!

928
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,551
How long was I under?

929
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:19,854
3 hours.
Any luck?

930
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,762
No, wrong context

931
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,457
Simone, you said you,
uh, know a professor

932
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:26,761
who did some work
at Fort Polk?

933
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,666
Oh, yeah.
My physics advisor.

934
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,502
He wanted
to get physical.

935
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,704
I didn't do it.
I could've got an A.

936
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,240
They offered me a lot of money for a
few equations, and I turned them down.

937
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,045
So, uh, what they were making
was pretty expensive, huh?

938
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,953
It was revolutionary.

939
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,486
But by now I'm sure
it's being developed

940
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,647
by every
industrialized country

941
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,692
and every big corporation
with a robotics division.

942
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,721
I heard the Chinese
are particularly interested.

943
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,594
Enough to hire assassins
to infiltrate a US base?

944
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,891
That's about as much as
I'm comfortable saying.

945
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,830
Anyway, remind Simone she
owes me, uh, extra credit.

946
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,840
Okay.
Thanks for your time.

947
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:06,966
Appreciate it.
Mmm-hmm.

948
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,442
All right. Get that
extra credit, huh?

949
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,329
<i>Ms. Wollcroft.</i>

950
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,465

951
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,664
How can I help you?

952

<i>Is there
a question here?</i>

955
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,912
<i>I want to know what
you people are up to.</i>

956
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,078
Ask yourself if that's something
you'd really like to know.

957
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,113
<i>Because I can oblige you.</i>

Do yourself a favor,

leave others to
the professionals.

961

Good day.

962
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,903
It is gone.

963
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,938
Worried about
your safety?

964
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,778
That is good.
You should be.

965
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:26,617
The Wolf needs you.

966
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,245
To do what?

967
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,689
Extrapolate from
incomplete blueprints.

968
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,062
Fill in what
we are missing.

969
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,600
As of this morning, Fort
Polk will no longer house

970
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,645
the military's exo-project.

971
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,011
Security there is about as
tight as my wife's rear end.

972
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,316
I had a feeling
you'd ask me that

973
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,557
Turns out that girl's body
up and walked off after all.

974
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:05,624
Right after I told you
where she was.

975
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,924
Now you, son,
are not your daddy.

976
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,334
Frankly, I don't know
what you are.

977
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,566
I do know your
ambitions go beyond his,

978
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,576
and it's got you mixed up with
folks he wouldn't approve of.

979
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:29,012
As chair of the Senate committee
on national security,

980
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,778
I know a hell of a lot.

981
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,451
Take my advice,

982
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,956
don't leave
the country.

983
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,657
Wouldn't want to have
to serve an indictment

984
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,784
to some spider
hole somewhere.

985
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,523
Go on,
we're done here.

986
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,799
Go on with you now. Go on.

987
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,163
Motherfucker.

988
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,311
Yes, this is Dragovic.

989
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,847
Keep working.

990
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,078
<i>What did you say?</i>

991
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,056
<i>What did you say'!?</i>

992
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,218
<i>What did you say'!?</i>

993
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,690
Yeah.

994
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:55,759
<i>New orders
from the Wolf.</i>

995
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,099
You are going to pay a
visit to Senator Barnes.

996
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:01,869
And thus time,
Tatiana,

997
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,501
do not fuck it up.

998
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,877
Who has jurisdiction over Fort Polk?
Non-military, I mean.

999
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,415
Senator James Barnes.

1000
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:10,041
All right, we're
gonna hit Barnes office

1001
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,245
in Baton Rouge
in the morning'

1002
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,845
Wait, Barnes is in
town this weekend.

1003
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,952
Today's the annual
gala for Tulane alumni.

1004
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,252
Gussain is supposed
to go.

1005
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:20,517
Hmm.

1006
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:24,130
Whoa! She got
those Helen Binghams.

1007
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,099
Wow. You really
don't stop, do you?

1008
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,600
What? Hang on, no. I know
where I saw that tattoo.

1009
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,873
Oh, shit.
Bingham.

1010
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:38,546
Pay attention. I have a
little business to attend to.

1011
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,180
Catalina, take this.

1012
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,642
Look after Mummy,
will you?

1013
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,117
<i>Of course. The Order
of the Ghost Scorpion.</i>

1014
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,978
Order of
the what now?

1015
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,919
It was this
post-Cold War experiment,

1016
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,720
<i>an attempt to fill the power
vacuum after the Wall came down</i>

1017
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,261
<i>An international consortium
of assassins.</i>

1018
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:02,826
Here.

1019
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,040
Do you need
a moment?

1020
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,177
What did you
say your name was?

1021
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,579
Bingham.
Helen Bingham.

1022
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,452
<i>Bojan Dragovic
was a godfather and guru.</i>

1023
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,216
An expert in
irregular warfare

1024
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,757
and bio-enhancement
technologies.

1025
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,315
The titanium bones.
That's right.

1026
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,452
<i>He created a cadre
of super-assassins.</i>

1027
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,664
<i>After the oligarchs bought
out Russian intelligence,</i>

1028
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,169
<i>Dragovic brought the organization
into the private sector,</i>

1029
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,332
<i>working with whoever
was willing to pay.</i>

1030
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,399
<i>Most recently, a financier
known as the Wolf.</i>

1031
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,175
How do you
know all this?

1032
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:47,340
I just know where to look,
Tor, Deep Web Wikipedia.

1033
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,686
What? What is it?

1034
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,423
Uh, it's Professor Gussain.

1035
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,256
Mmm.
It's for you.

1036
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,699
The Wolf plans to
kill Barnes today.

1037
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,634
I got to get this number to Barnes
security, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1038
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,030
Gussain contacted us.

1039
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:13,073
So what?

1040
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,835
That means he's too scared
to contact anyone else.

1041
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,275
Even the Senator's
security.

1042
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,970
The Wolf's got
people everywhere.

1043
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,877
If we're going to do something,
we've got to do it on our own.

1044
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,004
Where's this gala at?

1045
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:27,344
Still so much like the intern
I took on 20 years ago.

1046
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,289
You couldn't take no for
an answer then either.

1047
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,527
I suppose that's part of your
appeal to your investors.

1048
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,861
I'm glad you made
it tonight' James.

1049
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,761
After our last meeting.
Oh, oh, oh.

1050
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:41,927
Even old friends don't
always see eye-to-eye.

1051
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,996
I hope you don't need my
affirmation anymore, Hannah.

1052
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,009
No but I'll always
need your vote, Senator.

1053
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,773
Ah.

1054
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,139
If you'll excuse me.
Of course.

1055
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,744
This is Hannah Wollcrcft.

1056
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,319
Yes, I'll take
the call.

1057
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,761
Hey, what time
are we starting at?

1058
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:14,926
Already started, man.

1059
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,264
Oh, shit.

1060
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,170
Play it cool. Play it cool.
Play it cool.

1061
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,241
I need to see some IDs.

1062
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,437
You
know, she got my ID.

1063
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,639
Oh!
You got the.

1064
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,182
I keep 'em in here.
Mmm-hmm.

1065
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,945
Yeah, I left them at home. What?

1066
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,178
Girl, check
the left titty.

1067
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,509
Check the left titty.

1068
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,647
You need ID just to get
into a wedding reception?

1069
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,123
Oh, no, wedding reception
is right around this corner.

1070
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,251
First floor,
the Bayou Room.

1071
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,316
Great,
thank you.

1072
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,656
Take care, guys. Let
me see your ID, man.

1073
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,128
- You really work here?
- Bye!

1074
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:45,928
And these spots normally
have rooms we can cut through, so...

1075
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,492
Yeah, we'll go. We'll
find another way through.

1076
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,592
All right.

1077
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:54,633
Whoever would've guessed me
tossing Terrible Timmy out of the ring

1078
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:57,075
would literally land
him in the lap of love?

1079
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,011
Look at this couple,
aren't they great?

1080
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,141
Hey, man, high 5.
Look at this hot couple.

1081
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:04,844
I mean, come on.

1082
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,223
Enough of me
and the word games.

1083
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,189
Let's hear some of
Tina and Tim's friends'

1084
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,089
words of
encouragement and love.

1085
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:16,694
You, sir, you. Red tie,
come here for a second.

1086
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,788
You. Come here.

1087
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,023
You sure you want me?

1088
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,966
Just say something
about this great couple.

1089
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,627
No, you.

1090
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,544
Well, uh...

1091
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,206
What can I say about the
bride and groom, right,

1092
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,214
that hasn't already
been said, huh?

1093
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,978
Well, I met...

1094
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:43,215
Tim.
Tim?

1095
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,349
Met Tim in a, uh..

1096
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:49,855
A mini-bar
in Little Tokyo,

1097
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,689
and we got into some small
talk' had some short ribs.

1098
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,027
And what can I say
about the bride, right?

1099
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,572
She's so effervescent.

1100
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,137
Tina?

1101
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,868
Tina?
Yeah.

1102
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,708
Twerking Tina?

1103
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:08,180
It is a small world.

1104
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,443
You know what I mean.

1105
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:15,583
Tina and I, uh,
met at a strip club...

1106
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,418
Mall. Strip mall,
met at a strip mall.

1107
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,856
And, um...

1108
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,223
I always said,
with that kind of ass.

1109
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:26,461
Assets. She has many assets
that work in her favor.

1110
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:31,465
And I always thought that she
was destined for big things.

1111
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:35,073
Obviously, we all know that big
things come in small packages.

1112
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,734
Or smaller
packages, right?

1113
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,574
Anyways, do you
still have that tattoo?

1114
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,244
She has a great
tattoo of a cowgirl

1115
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,410
holding a lasso.

1116
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,853
So every time
she'd twerk,

1117
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,480
the lasso would just.

1118
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,252
It would whip like that.
It would just do

1119
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,260
a little whip like that

1120
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:55,091
It was a pelvic thrust
that she would do.

1121
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,857
Anyways, we all
have a style.

1122
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,421
I have a style.
You all have a style.

1123
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,962
Breaking Bad,
you have a style.

1124
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,967
And if tiny Tim
can handle that,

1125
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:05,267
then more power to you,
and if he can't...

1126
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:07,069
Then, girl'
you need to call me.

1127
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,440
All right, okay.

1128
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:21,778
Ah!

1129
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,120
This isn't a fair fight!

1130
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,824
How many of y'all
want some?

1131
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,758
- Come on. Dump this shit.
- Switch!

1132
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,701
Okay, okay!

1133
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:36,999
Hold up!
He got my ribs!

1134
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,127
My balls.

1135
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,228
Get off of him now!

1136
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,176
Put him down!

1137
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:47,973
Oh, you...

1138
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,516
Let me get mine! Let
me get on my feet.

1139
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,321
Y'all lucky I don't
call my cousins!

1140
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,015
You know you're
the only one I love.

1141
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,690
All right, come on.

1142
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:03,786
What was that?

1143
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,924
What? I got caught in
my pornographic memory mode.

1144
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:06,989
Worlds collide, okay?

1145
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,090
Hey will you guys
knock it off?

1146
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,864
We got a life to save.
We gotta find the Senator.

1147
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,583
All assets are in place.
You are weapons free.

1148
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,521
Excuse me.
Remember me?

1149
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,685
<i>Mmm?</i>

1150
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,286
Oh, shit.

1151
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,360
Relax.

1152
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:41,429
Everything's
going to be fine.

1153
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,236
Close your eyes.

1154
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,749
Almost there.

1155
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,694
<i>I have
eyes on him.</i>

1156
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:17,704
The Order has lowered
its standards, huh?

1157
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,433
No more world
powers for clients.

1158
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,007
No more finger on
the pulse of history.

1159
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,407
Now you're just
another corporate tool.

1160
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:24,638
A cog in the wheel.

1161
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,010
Shut up, Mr. Hester.

1162
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:29,372
Whoa.

1163
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,775
Jay?

1164
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:32,544
Jay?

1165
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,021
Hello? Jay? Wake up, baby.
Come on.

1166
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,546
Wake up!

1167
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,392
Do you like Chekhov?

1168
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,100
You don't mean chief navigator
of the Enterprise,

1169
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,498
<i>so Cherry Orchard,
Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters...</i>

1170
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:04,644
A little
college Russian.

1171
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,219
Tatiana, kill him.

1172
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,924
I want you to know

1173
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,702
it's nothing personal.

1174
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,436
I think it is.

1175
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,938
Ah, for fuck's sake,
Tatiana.

1176
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,682
Stand down,
I repeat, stand down.

1177
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,408
Report back
for instructions.

1178
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,736
How dare you
interrupt our work!

1179
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,738
ls our deal off?

1180
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:10,447
No. Our deal is no
longer necessary.

1181
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:15,717
The Olsen twins
are waiting for you.

1182
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,518
Right? Right?

1183
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,650
<i>Sh.</i>

1184
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,887
Listen, I'm going to
try to go get some help,

1185
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,156
'cause he needs to
go to the hospital.

1186
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,562
Keep that head up.
Hey, hey' hey!

1187
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:25,654
<i>Mmm.</i>

1188
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,758
Come here.
Come here.

1189
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,308
The Wolf wants
to see both of you.

1190
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,842
Now.

1191
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,417
Dragno?

1192
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,218
And here
I thought all this

1193
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:55,386
daddy-issue, killer-cow
bullshit was just a sales ploy.

1194
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,232
Only because I can
see you're hurting.

1195
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,230
Tonight, our chief
Chinese competitor,

1196
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,067
having developed
their own exo-project

1197
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,766
in parallel with
the US military,

1198
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,433
agreed to a merger.

1199
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,912
We no longer need the US
government or their exo-armor.

1200
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,276
We have our own.

1201
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:17,040
It's so much more civilized
that way, don't you think?

1202
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,112
Our Chinese counterpart made the
merger conditional in dissolving

1203
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,350
all of our previous
entanglements.

1204
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,587
Which unfortunately
means all of you.

1205
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,758
Dispose of them.

1206
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,096
If a black
market weapons dealer

1207
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,931
fucked the madam of a
cripples-only orphanage

1208
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,732
while Gordon Gekko
came on their faces,

1209
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,431
the thing they'd make
would be you'

1210
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:40,529
The Wolf.

1211
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:49,740
You flatter me.

1212
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:01,385
This time make sure the
bodies are never found.

1213
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,339
Your handler got
what he deserves.

1214
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:14,430
So will you.

1215
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,470
My handler?

1216
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,137
He was the only father
I've ever known.

1217
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,638
I lost my family.

1218
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:22,307
No one fucking cares.

1219
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,010
And no more talking. We're
almost to the drop zone.

1220
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:28,150
There's no reason
to go on.

1221
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,518
Yeah?

1222
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,680
There's always stripping, if
you need a reason to live.

1223
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,191
Jules' you okay, man?
Yeah.

1224
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:34,989
Non-lethal dose
of Propofol.

1225
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,030
But he's going to wish
he didn't wake up.

1226
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,463
You need a reason to go
on, how about vengeance?

1227
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,124
We'll help you.

1228
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,627
Hey, man.

1229
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,263
So the bodies
don't float.

1230
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,351
Hey, what's going
on back there' guys?

1231
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,487
Hey, man, I don't
approve of all of that.

1232
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,112
What was it, the stripping
or the vengeance?

1233
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,772
All right,
I need a little help.

1234
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,179
Need a little
help, guys!

1235
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,480
Tony, get him out!

1236
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:40,717
You know what
you're doing?

1237
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,319
I learned
in the army.

1238
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,232
Tank's been shot.
We're losing fuel fast.

1239
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,202
We'll have just enough
to reach our destination.

1240
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,500
What's that?

1241
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,134
Vengeance.

1242
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,868
We're going to
the Wolf's den.

1243
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:58,377
The Wolf's Den?
Is that a strip club?

1244
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,135
We have
severed all ties.

1245
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,566
So it's a clean start.

1246
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,306
<i>We're very happy</i>

1247
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:31,173
<i>And now, Ms. Wollcroft,
I present to you,</i>

1248
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,537
proof of concept and a
token of our friendship.

1249
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:08,314
They're not
slowing down.

1250
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,277
- Take care of it.
- Yes, ma'am.

1251
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:24,226
All right, what's the plan?
What's the plan?

1252
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,224
You jump.
I'll crash land.

1253
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:28,431
Crash? You ain't got
a better plan than that?

1254
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,296
There's got to
be a better plan.

1255
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,004
If things had
been different.

1256
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:35,337
I know, it would've
been great.

1257
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:38,210
Come on, man,
we got to go.

1258
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,075
We're jumping, man.
Go, go. Jump.

1259
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,239
I'm scared of heights.

1260
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,224
O-M-G!

1261
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,675
Whoo! Whoo!

1262
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,543
Come on, man.
Go, go!

1263
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,818
Go! Move! Move! Go!

1264
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,378
I don't wanna die!

1265
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,055
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1266
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,893
Come on!
Come on!

1267
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,489
Come on! Come on!
Come on, man!

1268
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,965
Oh, God!

1269
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:38,230
Fuck!

1270
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,295
Get down, man!
Get down!

1271
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,238
We got to move.

1272
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:45,143
Stay down!
Stay the fuck down!

1273
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,506
Oh, my God!

1274
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,621
What happened?

1275
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,864
What happened?
You see something?

1276
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:11,471
Shit.

1277
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:13,703
They're dead.

1278
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,031
Stop right there!

1279
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,271
You're enhanced,
I'm enhanced.

1280
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,905
So why don't we just fight this
out like civilized people?

1281
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,849
<i>You have a lifetime of training
on me, I'll give you that.</i>

1282
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,515
But I have the best combat
software money can buy.

1283
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:03,981
<i>What is it
you always say?</i>

1284
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,115
It's nothing personal.

1285
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,256
This time
it is, bitch.

1286
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,108
Hey!

1287
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,240
Drop your weapons!

1288
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:39,786
We're
private detectives!

1289
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,717
- Hands where we can see 'em!
- We're on the same team!

1290
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,155
Wait! Stop! They're the good guys.
They're with me.

1291
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,784
Hey!
Oh, my God!

1292
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:47,690
Come on, guys, sweep the house.
Come on in.

1293
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:49,558
Sweep the house.

1294
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:52,464
Go on and sweep
the house, bro.

1295
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,931
There's some
bad guys in there.

1296
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,592
It was crazy.
I had to slide.

1297
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,864
I picked up a gun.
I started shooting back.

1298
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,061
Thank you for
your cooperation.

1299
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,038
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

1300
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,598
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1301
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,609
Just want you to know,
I blamed it all on you.

1302
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,112
Good, 'cause
I blamed it on you' too.

1303
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:08,341
<i>Damn!</i>

1304
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,714
They found
Dr. Gussain this morning.

1305
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:12,774
- Yeah?
- Alive.

1306
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:14,114
<i>Mmm.</i>

1307
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:16,747
Get him down! Get him down!
Watch it!

1308
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,651
Let's get him
out of here.

1309
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,784
Oh, and they arrested
Beau LaMonde.

1310
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,918
Oh, see?
It's good.

1311
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,627
Show me
your hands, now!

1312
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,202
Guess there's
nothing left to do but

1313
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,827
go get on a plane
back to New York, huh'?

1314
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:33,668
No, we're not going nowhere, you still
got a competition to win. Let's go.

1315
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:35,998
All right, Anthony.

1316
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,102
Take care of yourself. You, too.

1317
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,147
Take care. Hey.

1318
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:44,480
You cleared Wilson's name and you
caught some really bad folks.

1319
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,678
You done us proud.
Thanks, Big Ray.

1320
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,549
Maybe I can visit more often.
Oh, hell no.

1321
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:51,087
But listen, you are gonna kick out
for the bodywork on that Caddy,

1322
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,817
Mr. Big Fancy Pl.

1323
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:56,329
And you tell Antoine I
said, "Riff that shit up."

1324
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,957
Big Ray, man.

1325
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,564
It's you, man.
You the man.

1326
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,568
Take care.
Nice sweater.

1327
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,632
You know what,
fuck you.

1328
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,101
And the action
is fast and furious here

1329
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,574
as our chefs are preparing
their catfish courtbouillon.

1330
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,308
It's gonna be some
seriously good food here.

1331
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:13,675
It's already
smelling wonderful,

1332
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:15,146
and we haven't even
lit the fire yet.

1333
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:17,683
We'll be back here on
Bayou to Bourbon Street

1334
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:19,116
right after this.

1335
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,490
Can we get some
stage hands up here

1336
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,718
and push this table
out of the way?

1337
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:26,849
Sorry, coming through.
Excuse us.

1338
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,359
Anthony, where you been?
You're a little late.

1339
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:29,987
Is this our chef?
Hey, how y'all doing?

1340
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:31,497
Hi, Anthony Hester.
Sorry about that.

1341
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,533
Hi, Chef Tardy,
how are you'?

1342
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,194
Who's this? Are Batman
and Robin gonna cook?

1343
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,201
No, I'm just his manager.
Manager?

1344
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:41,340
You could've managed to get
him here quicker, you think?

1345
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,966
I love this guy, right?

1346
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,133
You got this.

1347
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,679
Shit, man, I
haven't had any prep time.

1348
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:47,873
What? What are you
talking about?

1349
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:51,041
Remember what Big Ray said, "Let
it flow, just let it flow."

1350
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,584
Back in 5, people.

1351
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,017
All right, let it flow.
Flow on out of here.

1352
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:56,556
4, 3, 2.
Off the stage.

1353
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,612
Calm down,
Chef Boyardee.

1354
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:00,920
And we're back here on
Bayou to Bourbon Street,

1355
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,825
and the action is
fast and furious.

1356
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,457
I'm Guy Mancini, and you can
see our chefs are really

1357
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:08,267
flying into it.

1358
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,594
Yeah, and what do
we see over here?

1359
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:13,639
Jamie is Knocking out. It looks
like Jamie is making a mirepoix.

1360
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,267
Yeah, all of our chefs are really...
Jay, what's he doing?

1361
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,375
...really
getting involved.

1362
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:21,277
Oh, he's focusing his energy.
He'll be all right.

1363
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:24,543
Tearing it up over here as they
prepare their catfish courtbouillon.

1364
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,014
He looks paralyzed.

1365
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,553
No, no, no. He knows
what he's doing.

1366
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,585
<i>You got to give
yourself over to it.</i>

1367
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,851
<i>Just riff, brother.
Just riff.</i>

1368
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,957
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do that.

1369
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:39,026
We've got a lot
of action going on.

1370
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:40,291
Let's see what he
does with his fish,

1371
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,732
'cause everybody else
is so far ahead of him.

1372
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:44,495
Come on, Anthony.

1373
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:45,864
Looking
good, Anthony.

1374
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,099
I know
you can't really rush art,

1375
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,732
but we are gonna rush our catfish
courtbouillons over here.

1376
01:27:49,798 --> 01:27:50,776
Oh, there it is.

1377
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,743
- Looking at him.
- Scoring his fish.

1378
01:27:54,136 --> 01:27:55,581
Oh, Jesus,
it's a fire!

1379
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,082
Anybody ever seen anything like this before?

1380
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,581
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're looking at a winner.

1381
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,154
Wow, it's smelling
really good, too.

1382
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:03,348
You're the best!

1383
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:05,350
Around.

1384
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:10,059
And next up is Chef
Anthony Hester's new creation

1385
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,325
of, uh, catfish amandine.

1386
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,831
We'll start
with you, Carol.

1387
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,692
I see some...

1388
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:18,594
This dish is superb.

1389
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,333
...real soul
in here.

1390
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,806
I can taste the
passion in this dish.

1391
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:25,708
This dish is
very complex,

1392
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,371
to the point of
being dangerous.

1393
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,486
<i>Crotch crickets
ruining your love life?</i>

1394
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:36,921
<i>Annoying chirping sounds from your
neither regions keeping you up all night?</i>

1395
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,686
<i>Try Crick-a-cil, the number-one
crotch crickets-be-gone cream</i>

1396
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,089
<i>and take back
your night.</i>

1397
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,389
<i>Side effects may include
dry mouth, fever,</i>

1398
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,929
<i>rabbit ears, flatulence,
loose bowels, dandruff,</i>

1399
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,726
<i>snot bubbles, and premature balding.
Consult your doctor.</i>

1400
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,134
And our judges
have conferred.

1401
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,864
And after tasting all
of our entries today,

1402
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,563
they have come
to a conclusion.

1403
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:55,333
And the winner of today's
Bayou to Bourbon Street Festival

1404
01:28:55,397 --> 01:28:58,173
is none other than.

1405
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,988
Alligator cheesecake? Mmm-hmm.
We can do that.

1406
01:29:11,046 --> 01:29:12,286
Okay?

1407
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,327
Yeah, and if you see Big
Ray, tell him I said hi.

1408
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:15,853
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you.

1409
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,022
How's Simone?
Hey. She's good.

1410
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,827
I told her maybe I'll fly
down for Mardi Gras. Ah!

1411
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:23,595
<i>Anthony Hester.</i>

1412
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:28,597
<i>I understand that you have
a restaurant up in New York.</i>

1413
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,767
<i>Yes. What's the name of it?
Give it a plug.</i>

1414
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,773
<i>Uh... Uh...</i>

1415
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,737
<i>Name. Name
of the restaurant.</i>

1416
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,510
It's... Hey,
man, I like the new name.

1417
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:37,982
<i>I'm kind of in between names.
Thanks, Jules.</i>

1418
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,418
Okay, here we go
right here.

1419
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:46,924
Your marinated kale.

1420
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,857
And that is
your fresh salad.

1421
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,934
All right, it's good. Come, come.
Go, go, go, Table 3.

1422
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,057
Mr. Hester.

1423
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,163
I have no weapons.

1424
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:16,246
Your whole body
is a weapon.

1425
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,548
What other parts
of you are enhanced?

1426
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:25,354
Want me
to show you?
