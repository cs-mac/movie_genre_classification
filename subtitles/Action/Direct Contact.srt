1
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,548
You think you're
a big shot.

2
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,316
Don't you?

3
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,047
No.

4
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,702
You've been nine
months here. You
pay nothing.

5
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,499
I'm sorry.

6
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:31,609
Are you stupid?

7
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,751
That's all I've got.

8
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,582
I should kill you
right now.

9
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,219
And what are
you waiting for?

10
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,768
<i>[Plate clanks]</i>

11
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:04,103
That's no way to
start a friendship.

12
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,502
Visitor.

13
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,731
You don't look
to good, M r. Riggins.

14
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:45,869
I'm Clive Connelly.
I'm an attache at the
American Embassy in Gorna.

15
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,031
I'm here to help you.

16
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,203
Well, I've been here
for... almost a year now.

17
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,715
The American government
is a little reluctant to
help an ex Special forces

18
00:06:56,782 --> 00:07:00,047
who gets himself locked up
for smuggling weapons.

19
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,586
You fucked up.

20
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,383
No shit.

21
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,719
<i>Mike. Hope you don't</i>
<i>mlnd me calling</i>
<i>you Mike.</i>

22
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,384
I understand you got
a problem with authority.

23
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,485
<i>You think you're special.</i>
<i>Laws don't apply to you.</i>

24
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,430
Obviously, you're
wrong about that, pal.

25
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:17,400
So, get to your point.

26
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:22,735
Well, you're a permanent
resident in the worst fucking
prison in the world.

27
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:27,244
You owe a lot of money
to a couple of very
dangerous men.

28
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:30,076
You stay in here
much longer you're
gonna be a dead man.

29
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,412
<i>You're a dead man</i>
<i>on the outside, unless...</i>

30
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:34,474
Unless what?

31
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,747
I got a
proposition for you.

32
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,086
One that could
get you out of here

33
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,456
with $100 thousand
in your pocket.

34
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,754
<i>We have a complex</i>
<i>situation.</i>

35
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,424
One that's a little
too politically
delicate for us

36
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,591
to be directly
involved in.

37
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,296
An American citizen
has been kidnapped.

38
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,271
She's been held
for the past 18 months

39
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,932
<i>at a compound</i>
<i>near the Black Sea</i>

40
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:01,444
by this man,
Vlado Karadjov.

41
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:03,604
He calls himself
a warlord.

42
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,444
So, why didn't you go
get her yourself?

43
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,609
<i>I guess</i>
<i>diplomacy failed.</i>

44
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:12,177
The fuck wanted money.
The American government
doesn't pay ransoms.

45
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:19,959
All right.

46
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,797
I get you the girl,
but it's gonna cost
you 200 thousand.

47
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,967
Fine.

48
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,629
When do I get
my money?

49
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:31,639
Ten thousand now.

50
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,470
The rest when you
deliver the girl.

51
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,477
Twenty now.

52
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:39,309
I just happen to have
an extra ten grand.

53
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:43,978
<i>Now, my number</i>
<i>Is on speed dial</i>
<i>on the cell phone.</i>

54
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:47,318
And this is a list
of people that may
be helpful to you.

55
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,655
<i>There could be</i>
<i>one problem.</i>

56
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:52,990
The girl might resist.
We think she's
been drugged.

57
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:54,927
What do you mean?

58
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:57,830
<i>One negotiator was</i>
<i>allowed to talk to her.</i>
<i>He got the impression</i>

59
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,664
that she was developing
sympathy for her kidnappers.

60
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:04,069
<i>Which Isn't that</i>
<i>uncommon when you've been</i>
<i>kept for this long a period.</i>

61
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:10,668
<i>The first guy you should</i>
<i>visit Is here, Zoran Posternoff.</i>

62
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,009
<i>He runs nightclub</i>
<i>In the city center</i>
<i>named...</i>

63
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,946
<i>Club 33.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

64
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,473
Where's Zoran?

65
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:18,907
<i>Riggins.</i>
<i>What the hell are</i>
<i>you doing here?</i>

66
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,742
Business.

67
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:23,681
Business?
Sit down.

68
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,812
Business?
You owe me
30 thousand.

69
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:34,084
I got ten
right here.

70
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,422
And?

71
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:37,258
The rest
if you help me.

72
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,922
How?

73
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:42,195
I need to see
Vlado Karadjov.

74
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,766
Why?

75
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,098
He's holding an
American girl hostage.

76
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,441
Take my advise.

77
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:57,779
Karadjov has powerful
allies. Nobody
fucks with him

78
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,547
and lives to tell
about it. Nobody.

79
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:13,622
So, where can
I find him?

80
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,462
Okay.

81
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,469
Wait here.

82
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:21,665
I'm gonna see what
I can do for you, okay?

83
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:35,410
H i, you want
a drink?

84
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,979
You read my mind.
I'll have rakia.
Make it big.

85
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,490
Okay.

86
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,495
You American,
you stay in Gorna?

87
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,155
Well, that depends
on you two.

88
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,196
<i>Here's to having</i>
<i>a good time.</i>

89
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,335
You're coming with us.

90
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,612
<i>Hold him down.</i>

91
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:22,195
You still owe me
ten. Remember. Ten.

92
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,530
N ice to see
you haven't changed.

93
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,400
Get him out of here.

94
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:28,597
Move!

95
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,710
What are you doing
in my city?

96
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,084
I'm here
about a woman.

97
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,382
What woman?

98
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,224
Ana Gale.

99
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:53,887
How much?

100
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,897
What do you mean?

101
00:12:55,965 --> 00:13:00,732
<i>Each time someone comes</i>
<i>with a bigger offer,</i>
<i>only not big enough.</i>

102
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,237
How much this time?

103
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,739
Nothing.

104
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,405
Nothing?

105
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,737
Nothing.
Her family
wants her back.

106
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,442
If you come here again,

107
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,577
I'm not going
to just shoot you.

108
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:22,590
See, I don't
like guns.

109
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:27,425
You shoot people,
and hospitals keep
them alive.

110
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:36,136
<i>We're through.</i>

111
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:00,626
What else you got?

112
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,322
What else?

113
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:06,127
You got the Glock G22
that can open a hole
inside of a tank.

114
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,464
Beretta <i>92</i>
with auto-fire.

115
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,630
Also, <i>AK47</i>
with extended rounds.

116
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:15,472
Uh, titanium hull points.
What else you can
possibly need?

117
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:20,344
How about some night
division optics and
stun grenades. <i>C4.</i>

118
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,473
Are you going
to fight the
fucking army?

119
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,644
And some remote
bomb triggers.

120
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,312
Whatever.

121
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,982
<i>I got an appointment</i>

He's friends with

125
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:41,324
The Butcher of Sobrewsky,
he made M Milosevic look
like a lump.

126
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,665
I know.

127
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:46,399
You don't have
a chance. No.

128
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:51,037
Where is that base?

129

00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,795

00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,292
Vlado Karadjov.

00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:36,300
You weren't?

162
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:37,965
No!

163
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,975
You weren't
drugged or something?

164
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:43,137
What? No!

165
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,976
Well, why were you
with Vlado then?

166
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:47,312
Because I wanted to be.

167
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,477
I work for a help
organization.

168
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:52,487
I came here two
years ago after
a meningitis outbreak.

169
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:58,016
Once we got it under control,
he me made an offer to take
care of his hemophiliac son.

170
00:25:58,094 --> 00:26:00,994
<i>Look, something
isn't right here.

171
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:04,032
What's not right is
that <i>you</i> kidnapped me.

172
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,158
My information says
you were abducted.

173
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:09,033
<i>You better check</i>
<i>your sources agaln.</i>
<i>I'm going to the Police...</i>

174
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:13,040
<i>Look, park your tongue
so I can think.

175
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,170
All right. I'm gonna
take you to the American
Embassy in Luka.

176
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,680
Why?

177
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,182
Because they're
paying me to
bring you back.

178
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:26,278
Paying you? I was at
the embassy five months
ago to extend my visa.

179
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,018
All right. Well,

180
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:31,559
I can't go back
without you, so
you're coming with me.

181
00:26:31,627 --> 00:26:35,586
Get in the car.
Hey, stay quiet.

182
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,801
Sit.

183
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,818
<i>Good morning. American Embassy.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

184
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,948
Mike Riggins for
Mr. Clive Connelly.

185
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,457
<i>Are you sure, sir?</i>

186
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah, I'm sure.
He's an attache
for you guys.

187
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,326
<i>I'll check, sir.</i>
<i>Please, hold.</i>

188
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,457
<i>Hello, sir?</i>

189
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,830
Hello.

190
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,960
<i>There's no one</i>
<i>lasted by that name.</i>

191
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,300
Did you check
all departments?

192
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,341
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>No listing</i>
<i>for Clive Connelly.</i>

193
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,308
No Clive Connelly?

194
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,073
<i>No, sir.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

195
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,341
Hello.

196
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,316
Mike. Clive Connelly.

197
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,319
I called the Embassy.
You're no attache.

198
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,514
<i>Mike, let me explain.</i>

199
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,988
Explain what?

200
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,150
Mike, Clive Connelly
is not my real name.

201
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,989
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

202
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,155
It's an alias I use.
I told you this is
a sensitive situation.

203
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,496
It's bullshit.
I spoke to this girl.
She wasn't kidnapped.

204
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,163
<i>Mike, she's been brainwashed.</i>
<i>She lives In an army</i>
<i>camp, for God sakes.</i>

205
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,002
She's become sympathetic
to her kidnappers.
I told you that.

206
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,666
What?

207
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,506
<i>Ask her her name.</i>
<i>Go ahead, ask her</i>
<i>her name.</i>

208
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,876
What's your name?

209
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,209
My name?

210
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,373
<i>Your name.</i>

211
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,848
Ana Gale.

212
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,509
Ana Gale.

213
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,679
<i>She's lying.</i>
<i>Her real name</i>
<i>Is Ana Robbins.</i>

214
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,688
What does that prove?

215
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,190
<i>It proves that In</i>
<i>her state of mlnd</i>
<i>she can't be trusted.</i>

216
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,522
Neither can you.
How do I know who
the hell you are?

217
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,028
Do you think
I could have got
you out of prison

218
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,031
without pulling
political strings?

219
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,363
What?
Whats he saying?

220
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:36,372
<i>Lets meet somewhere</i>
<i>and I'll prove to you</i>
<i>everything I said Is true.</i>

221
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,374
<i>Mike, where are you now?</i>

222
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:40,535
Somewhere close.

223
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,079
<i>Listen, there's
a reservoir just
outside of town.

224
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,875
<i>No. A public place.</i>

225
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:48,543
The town center
main plaza in
30 minutes.

226
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,382
<i>Okay. Bring</i>
<i>the girl, all right?</i>

227
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>J Just bring the money.

228
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:55,884
Prick.

229
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,927
What'd he say?

230
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,720
He said your real name
is Ana Robbins.

231
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:04,095
That was my birth name.

232
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,066
So why did you
lie about that?

233
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:09,070
I took my mother's
maiden name over
a year ago, okay?

234
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:12,733
I don't care any more.
I'm gonna see that guy.
Find out what the problem is.

235
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:14,070
And me?

236
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,906
You're gonna stay
right here.

237
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,775
Fine.

238
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,249
What the hell?
Get off me!

239
00:30:26,322 --> 00:30:28,290
No!

240
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:29,790
Sorry.

241
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,689
M Mike.

242
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,818
You got 20 seconds
to give me my money.

243
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,486
Thats not necessary.

244
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,996
And the snippers?

245
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,326
What are you
talking about?

246
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,162
Call them off, you
lying piece of shit.

247
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:48,826
They're there for
our protection.

248
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,167
You got 10 seconds.
Seven. Six.

249
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:57,370
All units stand down.
All units stand down.

250
00:31:57,444 --> 00:31:58,502
Where's my money?

251
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,012
Where's my girl?

252
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,514
Somewhere safe.

253
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,675
You shouldve brought
her with you, M Mike.

254
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:06,844
You must be
fucking joking.

255
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,356
Maybe we got off on the wrong
foot. I shouldve been more
forthcoming. The situation...

256
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:14,222
Has changed.
I wanna know who the fuck
you are and who sent you.

257
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:18,059
I work for the U S government.
Its a special division
of the C IA.

258
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,861
<i>Thats why I was able</i>
<i>to work the prison</i>
<i>deal for you.</i>

259
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,525
Why?

260
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:23,864
We want the girl.

261
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:25,369
She wasn't kidnapped.

262
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:28,874
Yes, I know that.

263
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,238
Who is she?

264
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:32,743
Iùs none of
your business.

265
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,871
I wanna see
my money now.

266
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:40,385
M ike, I'm prepared to offer you
substantially more money if
you get the girl to me now.

267
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,216
That sounds like
a real good offer.

268
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:45,381
I think I have a better one.
How about fuck you?

269
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:47,721
What the fuck is
wrong with you, huh?

270
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:51,058
<i>Drago wants you dead.</i>
<i>Vlado wants you dead.</i>
<i>You have nowhere to go.</i>

271
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:53,723
Maybe if I bring her
back, they'll pay me.

272
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,733
Sit down, M ike.
Sit down!

273
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,736
Wanna kill me?
Go ahead. You'll
never find her.

274
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:20,851
Move! H urry!

275
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,162
Stay on him.

276
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,777
He's on a black bike.
A black bike.

277
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,374
Keep an eye out
for the girl.

278
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:55,187
Connelly,
we're approaching
the city center.

279
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:08,461
That jackass.

280
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:10,870
Where the hell does
he think he's going?

281
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,907
<i>Drago, he's headed</i>
<i>rlght towards you.</i>

282
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,703
Do not lose that
son of a bitch.
Do not lose him.

283
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,311
<i>M r. Robblns?</i>

284
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,955
<i>Cllve Connelly on</i>
<i>the phone for you.</i>

285
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:50,291
About time.
What do you
have for me?

286
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:52,626
I'm still
working on it.

287
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:56,464
<i>What do you mean you're</i>
<i>worklng on lt? I hear Ana</i>
<i>Is not wlth Vlado any more.</i>

288
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,127
<i>Yeah, thaùs rlght.</i>

289
00:36:58,203 --> 00:36:59,966
So, whaùs the problem?

290
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,802
There's no problem.

291
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:04,638
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.

292
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,807
<i>No, Cllve, you don't.</i>
<i>Because If you dld, we</i>
<i>would have Ana rlght now.</i>

293
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:13,181
What if this guys
goes AWO <i>L and decides to
cross the border with her?

294
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,153
General Drago, who
controls the borders,
is on our payroll.

295
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:18,485
Riggins won't get across
and it won't happen.

296
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:21,321
Well, that better be
the fucking case, Clive.

297
00:37:21,393 --> 00:37:23,588
<i>I've got a lot</i>
<i>on the llne here.</i>

298
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:30,029
<i>See what you can</i>
<i>flnd out about</i>
<i>thls Rlgglns guy.</i>

299
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,728
Right away, sir.

300
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:36,900
All right. We're...

301
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:41,443
Damn it!

302
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,547
<i>Drago, we need</i>
<i>to talk.</i>

303
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:53,556
When I find that fucking
American, I will kill him.

304
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,956
Not likely.

305
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:00,360
Riggins is very,
very well trained.

306
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:03,525
<i>General, the guy walked</i>
<i>Into your camp, blew</i>
<i>the place to shlt</i>

307
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,068
and walked out
with the girl.

308
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:07,695
Excuse me. What
are you saying,
I'm incompetent?

309
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,036
No. I'm saying you don't
understand who the fuck
you're dealing with.

310
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:13,201
The American
I'll kill for free.

311
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:15,540
What do you
propose for

<i>stand down.</i>

633
01:26:26,062 --> 01:26:28,223
So,

634
01:26:28,298 --> 01:26:32,291
now that you're
a rich woman

635
01:26:32,368 --> 01:26:33,733
what are your plans?

636
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,904
I thought I'd
kidnap you for
a change.

637
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:46,140
But this time
we'll do it right.
