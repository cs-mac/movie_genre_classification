1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,091
Okay, jerks.
Let's be quiet and quick.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,641
Pete, take the bag.
Terho, keep guard.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,849
Fatso, don't do anything.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,570
Don't do anything.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,405
You see anyone?
- No.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,483
Okay. Let's go.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,929
Anybody see us?
- I don't think so.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,686
The idiot's jaw is gonna drop
when he sees this.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,171
Shit!

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,445
Plaza named after national
soccer team player -opening ceremony 11 a.m.

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,009
Dad, wake up.

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,845
Dad, wake up!

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,810
Go watch cartoons with Pete.

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,891
Pete, wake up!

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,089
Pete, wake up!

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,444
What time is it?
- Eleven.

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,008
Eleven! Pasi, get up!

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,050
I'll be right there.

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,126
When we heard Tuukka was
moving back to his hometown -

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,841
and joining his old soccer team,

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,882
we knew we had to honor
the moment with something special.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,964
Here's a gift from the municipality:

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,727
a miniature statue
of soccer player jari Litmanen.

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,971
Thank you.

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,961
I've been watching your career
since you played for United.

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,523
It must've given you a boner.
- Not really. - Dummy.

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,447
I want to thank the municipality
and United, of course.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,208
Even after 20 years,
the grin on his face pisses me off.

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,727
We'll wipe it off this summer.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,481
I hope the statue is more
durable than the person it depicts.

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,768
Thanks.
- I hope you get hit by a car.

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,891
Tuukka will drive your pathetic team
to the bottom of your division.

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,205
Tuukka will drive his dick
into your grandpa's butt.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,485
To make it short, let me reveal-

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,924
ilari Kivela's concrete statue
titled <i>Scissor</i> Kick.

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,483
Next up is the band
from Niinivaara High School.

37
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,370
Someone's written on it.

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,249
I LIKE COCK
- Faggot!

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,200
You know what?
Your dad was a drunk-

40
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,489
and your wife ran off
with a hockey player!

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,171
That's it. He's dead. Idiot!

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,091
Get him!
- Suck my fart!

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,770
United!

44
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,851
BRONSON CLUB PRESENTS

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,443
Defense! Idiots!

46
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,170
You'd be better off
playing beach ball!

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,722
KuPa is bigger than the globe!

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,164
Knuckleheads!

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,401
It'll die in a minute.
just a minute.

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,245
C'mon, this is soccer!

51
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,526
<i>Third division! Third division!</i>

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,923
<i>KuPa will make it
into the third division!</i>

Local team one step closer
to next division

58
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,681
A ten-year wait is finally over.

59
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,251
This is so our summer.

60
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,483
I couldn't sleep
because I was thinking about it.

61
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,486
Go kill yourself.
- Why can't you be supportive?

62
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,166
You're not supportive either.
- In what?

63
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,561
In things that are important to me.

64
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,770
I've listened to you bullshit
about soccer for years.

65
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,922
You never ask me how I feel.

66
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,290
If I'd only known... - Take
your hand off before I break it.

67
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,081
Larvio. - Grumpy.

68
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,925
My name is Vuorinen.
- Want to buy a fitness ball?

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,449
Where were you two nights ago?
- Pussy hunting. - Nowhere.

70
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,490
You don't know anything about this,
do you?

71
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,405
Funny.
Wish I could take credit for it.

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,971
What about these?

73
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,169
I want to talk to you in private.

74
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,731
Get lost.

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,967
Nice beard. Gillette.

76
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,642
Doesn't ring a bell.
I hope they catch the criminals.

77
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,649
This is unacceptable.
- Very.

78
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,123
You're a grown man.

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,769
Why not do something useful instead
of goofing off with your friends?

80
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,126
You mean like become
a small-town cop? - Touché.

81
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,290
My friend is a shift manager
at the factory. - Bravo.

82
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,762
You can call him
if the store gets crowded.

83
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,211
What a Nazi. You held up great.

84
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,649
You're no informer.
Even though you look like one.

85
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,766
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

86
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,965
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

87
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,442
<i>Happy birthday, dear jari</i>

88
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,080
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

89
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,567
Hush. Dad's gonna give a speech.

90
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,647
The day you were... Quiet!

91
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,523
The day you were born
was a big day.

92
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,606
First there was soccer player
jari Litmanen, then you.

93
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,922
You'll start playing soccer soon.

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,651
You'll show
your killer banana kicks, -

95
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,690
and the United kids
will be in the hospital...

96
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,325
Let's raise our hats.

97
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,164
Happy birthday, son.

98
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,722
Happy birthday to Grandma's darling!

99
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,369
One more time. Harder.

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,971
KuPa!

101
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,650
This is Dad's gift to you.
- What can it be?

102
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,008
He'll practice six times a week.

103
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,325
Open this one.
- What's in there?

104
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,730
They're a bit big.

105
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,282
I think they're a bit big.
- Who's that?

106
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,489
It's jari Litmanen.
Remember what I taught you?

107
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,407
Terho's gift.
- That's a big one.

108
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,087
You all remembered what we agreed.

109
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,844
Then fat boy's gift.

110
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,800
A garbage truck!
- That's right.

111
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,249
Isn't it nice?
- Very nice.

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,482
Happy birthday, jari!

113
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,361
You can drive the truck like this.

114
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,451
You can back it up.

115
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,606
I think I made it pretty damn clear.

116
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,842
Something soccer related.

117
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,046
And then the fatso goes and buys
some retarded tractor.

118
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,683
How can it be so difficult?

119
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,006
How are things with Mona?

120
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,124
What do you mean?

121
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,005
She sent a card.
With cute bunnies and all.

122
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,401
It's a hell of a lot better now.

123
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,044
I feel better.

124
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,131
I can focus on KuPa's games.

125
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,611
Besides, my mom cooks
better than she ever did.

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,371
Doesn't she?

127
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,046
Monkko!
- Yes, Kaikkonen?

128
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,767
When are you finally going
to finish fixing your house?

129
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,402
While you're at it,
why don't you take my trash out too.

130
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,244
Will this ever end?

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,685
Choke on shit.
- You'll be hearing from me!

132
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,682
Great guy.
- Oh yeah.

133
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,611
I need a favor.

134
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,764
I have a customer meeting
at four tomorrow.

135
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,161
Jari has practice at the same time.

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,529
It's his first practice.
- I'll take care of it.

137
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,451
My man.

138
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,689
Come here! You'll have more space!

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,370
Cross the ball!

140
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,126
You want to play?
- No.

141
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,323
Why not?
- Because.

142
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,642
Spread out!

143
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,927
You sure?
- Yes.

144
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,884
Just to make Dad happy.

145
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,165
()Okay-

146
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,250
That way!

147
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,931
Come to this side, too,
so that you get to run.

148
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,121
Okay. Let's continue.

149
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,128
You want to play another day?
- No.

150
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,170
In that case your dad's
going to kick my ass. - Yes.

151
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,482
Not interested in playing, huh?

152
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,808
I think he was a bit nervous.

153
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,008
Dads sometimes get disappointed
when that happens.

154
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,970
If you only knew...

155
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,531
Oh, you're not his...?
Oh no. He's not my son.

156
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,291
I just brought him here.
- Okay.

157
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,644
Which way are you headed?
- We're headed...

158
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,690
Where are you headed?

159
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,929
I'm headed that way.

160
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,960
So are we. Pete.

161
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,885
Emmi.

162
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,724
Jari.
- Hi, jari.

163
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,088
What's going on with that hand?
- I've no idea.

164
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,605
Let's go, jari.

165
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,370
It's annoying that people think
ice hockey is our national sport.

166
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,366
Two world championships and
people think we own the world.

167
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,409
You can't even see the puck.

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,210
Couldn't we all just kick a ball?

169
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,731
What?

170
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,091
What?
- Why haven't we met before?

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,883
I haven't been here before.
- Where? On earth?

172
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,924
I'm here because I couldn't find
a summer job coaching in Helsinki.

173
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,766
And because I get to stay
at a friend's house. He lives here.

174
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,851
I understand.

175
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,530
Have a nice summer... I'll call you.

176
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,485
How?

177
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,409
You don't have my number.

178
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,811
Err...

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,288
You really want me to call you?
- Maybe.

180
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,009
Really really?
- Maybe maybe.

181
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,691
Damn.

182
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,084
Here.
- Someone named Igor will answer?

183
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,844
Then you'll ask for me.

184
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,971
Bye!

185
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,610
My son needs skates.

186
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,601
The skates are around the corner.
If you can't find the right ones, -

187
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,610
please come back and I'll help you.

188
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,645
What did you just do?
What's wrong with you?

189
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,169
Yesterday you would've told her
only jerks play hockey.

190
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,091
You would've made him
try on soccer shoes.

191
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,764
God dammit. You got laid! Where?
How many times? For how much?

192
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,049
I haven't gotten laid.
I got something better.

193
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,881
A blow job?
- No.

194
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,482
I realized why
my past relationships have failed.

195
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,480
Relationships? Why the plural?
- I've wasted time on women -

196
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,371
who make me choose
between them and soccer.

197
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,569
What's the name of
this stinking swamp monster?

198
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,850
Emmi.
- When are you going to get laid?

199
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,445
Oh, pussy

200
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,484
We'll see what happens tonight.
We're painting the banner tonight.

201
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,371
Commander will get mad
if you don't show up.

202
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,681
12-month Euribor
with an 0.85 interest margin.

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,971
Then there's a fixed interest
rate loan or an interest rate cap.

204
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,407
You'll find all the details here.

205
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,564
I'm sure we'll find you
the right alternative.

206
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,923
KuPa is climbing
into the third division -

207
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,923
for the first time in ten years -

208
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,971
and you're skipping tonight because
of some chick you just met?

209
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,282
You're an idiot
and she must be too.

210
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,364
And you won't get pussy.
- Maybe I don't want it.

211
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,648
What do you want? A wife?
- Maybe.

212
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,211
I don't get it.

213
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,646
Is it her?
- Yeah. I'll call her later.

214
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,849
This is Commander speaking.
I'm Pete's friend.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,971
A bunch of us guys were thinking
of wining and dining tonight.

216
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,203
I understood you and Pete
had similar plans, -

217
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,648
so I'd like to ask you
if you'd like to join us.

218
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,203
Pete's women are
Commander's women. My women.

219
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,931
At eight.

220
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,723
See you. Bye. Kisses.

221
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,684
Thanks.
- No problem.

222
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,161
Did you have to? You ruined it.
- Great.

223
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,641
You should know one thing.

224
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,488
There's something
she doesn't know about us. - Yes?

225
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,650
Dinner will be ready soon.
We'll have pancakes for dessert.

226
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,610
Just a minute.

227
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,567
You all go to soccer games
every now and then, like Pete?

228
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,082
No, we don't.
- Never.

229
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,170
We do every now and then. Right?

230
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,126
You said no talking soccer...
- The boys are trying to say-

231
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,284
that we sometimes
go see soccer games.

232
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,608
We don't take it too seriously.

233
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,362
Some people collect stamps.
Others hunt.

234
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,440
We like to support our local team.

235
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,129
There are more important things
in life. - Like friends and family.

236
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,323
I guess.
- 'I guess"?

237
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Why be a fan if you don't give it
a hundred percent?

238
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,685
When Pete graduated,
we skipped the graduation party.

239
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,923
We headed to the field
to prepare for the next game.

240
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,731
This is what going to games
sometimes meant?

241
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,011
Little Pete was afraid you'd walk
away if you found out he's a loser.

242
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,925
Pete's in love.

243
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,885
The mother of all photos.
Everybody quiet.

244
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,890
This is our boy jari.

245
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,485
Pete...
- No.

246
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,480
When we open this page...
- We're not going to play now.

247
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,331
You play an instrument? Play!

248
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,330
Of course you will.
- Okay.

249
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,966
<i>Nothing is as lovely
As watching Jari Litmanen</i>

250
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,360
<i>In the spring
When the earth starts smelling good</i>

251
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,007
<i>I head to the soccer field
Where the grass is fuming green</i>

252
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,604
<i>It's welcoming jari litmanen
On the field</i>

253
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,926
<i>The darkness is gone
We 're walking towards the light</i>

254
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,606
<i>jari and me
-jari and me</i>

255
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,531
<i>The children of light
Hand in hand</i>

256
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,364
You can leave if you want.
I'll understand.

257
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,365
They're idiots.

258
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,800
You want to go out,
just the two of us?

259
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,201
Take my underwear off?
- Yeah, yeah.

260
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,766
We don't have to talk anymore.

261
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,368
This is going well.
- Yes, it is.

262
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,565
What's happening?

263
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,687
I think you know what happened.

264
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,003
()Okay-

265
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,085
This was my first time.
Maybe that'll explain it.

266
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,730
Was that a joke?

267
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,644
It is if it's funny.

268
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,523
Okay. We'll do it again.
- Okay.

269
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,441
Hi-Hi

270
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,329
How are you?
- I'm good.

271
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,124
How are you?
Everything okay?

272
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,723
Yeah. - I didn't realize
this apartment was so big.

273
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,601
You were in a hurry
to lose your virginity. - True.

274
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,887
It was a joke.
- I'll go take a shower.

275
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,770
Make yourself at home.

276
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,449
Bye.
- Bye.

277
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,087
Good job, Pete Larvio. Good job.

278
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,045
I heard that.

279
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,891
Hi!

280
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,962
Did you meet Pete?

281
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,851
Hi.

282
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,291
I got lost.

283
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,728
Tuukka Tiensuu. Have we met before?
- What?

284
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,004
Did I go to school with you?

285
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,649
Elementary school and junior high.
- That's right! Pete the Mudman.

286
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,411
I thought you were dead.
- I'm not.

287
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,847
I see.
- It's a small world.

288
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,565
I told you about him.

289
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,246
Tuukka is my good friend
and roommate.

290
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,927
And your ex. Don't forget that.
- That was ages ago.

291
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,845
It wasn't that long ago.
- It was years ago.

292
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,846
We were different people then.
- No, we weren't.

293
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,810
We already argued
about this in Venice.

294
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,167
The city of love.
- Gross!

295
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,324
We have to go out to eat some time.
- Good idea.

296
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,970
A great idea.

297
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,368
Kemmi's defence is so weak.
- Rask moves like a freight train.

298
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,807
Oh, Ruud Gullit.

299
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,123
Glad you could make it.
Spill the details.

300
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,041
No way.
- Then we have nothing.

301
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,450
You think Beerbelly wouldn't tell
if he got laid? - I would.

302
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,608
You'd have a press conference.

303
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,810
Okay, what's going on?
And what's with that notebook?

304
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,406
We're undercover.
Like my dad used to say:

305
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,609
Know your enemy and
your victory is guaranteed.'

306
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,250
That's a fine stetson.

307
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,646
You got dirt on King's face.

308
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,167
You have to keep his face clean.

309
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,885
Why did he wave at us?

310
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,804
Idiot.

311
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,247
<i>Tuukka had a dick in his butt
Yalla yalla yalla yalla ay!</i>

312
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,003
<i>Then he used it as a toothpick
Yalla yalla yalla yalla ay!</i>

313
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,524
<i>Yalla ay! Yalla ay!
Yalla yalla yalla yalla ay!</i>

314
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,727
<i>Tuukka had a dick in his butt
Yalla ay yalla ay!</i>

315
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,368
Pete. What is it?

316
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,091
I've got a sore throat.
I can't sing.

317
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,651
United!

318
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,689
Tuukka, we got a gift for you!

319
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,524
We made a banner for you!

320
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,887
TUUKKA IS A MACHINE
ON AND OFF FIELD

321
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,482
You're pathetic! Clown!

322
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,211
Homo!

323
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,411
Put a dick in your mouth!
- You do that!

324
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,245
You and your mother, too!

325
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,007
No, you!
- No, you! And your mother!

326
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,768
Put your fat friend's dick
in your mouth! - Anytime, cobra!

327
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,930
Let's make some noise.

328
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,731
Good job!

329
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,287
Tuukka! Tuukka!

330
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,651
Who's gonna take <i>a</i> dick
in their butt now?

331
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,331
Let's find out.

332
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,402
Fuck you, Matias!

333
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,331
We're gonna send you packing!

334
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,881
You banana brain!

335
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,609
Your dad was a homo!

336
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,731
What the hell?

337
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,008
United and KuPa
compete for third division

338
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,570
Good morning.

339
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,646
Another hat trick for Tuukka?
- Of course. The other team sucks.

340
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,529
Someone's in a bad mood.

341
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,251
"My name is Pete Larvio. I'm upset <i>'</i>

342
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,049
"I'm upset because of
Tuukka Tiensuu's hat trick.'

343
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,765
Is this annoying?
- Yes.

344
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,962
Is this?
- Very.

345
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,409
Is this?
- Stop! Stop!

346
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,006
You have to stay out of this.

347
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,284
Listen. Promise me
you'll stay out of this.

348
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,283
I just want you to be happy.
- Then you have to trust me.

349
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,125
Pumpkin...

350
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,131
Pumpkin?

351
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,325
You should go.

352
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,524
You're done?
- Yes.

353
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,122
What did he have to say?
- Nothing special.

354
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,243
Nothing special'?
- Nothing special.

355
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,525
You know what?

356
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,207
What happened before was special.
- True.

357
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,403
Was it better than sex with Tuukka?

358
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,489
Don't be silly!

359
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,245
You can tell me.

360
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,368
I know this is a bit silly, but...
- You're right.

361
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,809
It's just one of those things
I have to know.

362
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,644
You really have to?
- Yes.

363
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,366
It was better. - With me?
- Yes.

364
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,202
Why?
- This continues?

365
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,285
Our circle of trust session
started off really well.

366
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,246
We're sharing our deepest secrets.
- You haven't shared any.

367
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,609
I'll share mine later.

368
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,206
I won't tell you.
- Emmi.

369
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,930
I can't.
- Why not?

370
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,651
It'll destroy our relationship.
- Please.

371
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,531
With Tuukka it was...

372
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,004
Yes? just spit it out.

373
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,251
Pretty painful.

374
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,962
What do you mean?
- Forget it.

375
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,043
Tell me.
- What?

376
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,124
Why was it painful?
- I can't remember.

377
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,521
Tell me why it was painful.

378
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,728
Well, because...
- Because...

379
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,882
...Tuukka has...
-...Tuukka has...

380
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,567
...a very large dick.
-...a very large dick.

381
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,485
Yes.
- Right. Tuukka has a giant dick.

382
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,847
But it wasn't nice.

383
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,130
You realize he'll have
the upper hand on me forever?

384
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,762
There's a solution.
- I'll kill and castrate him.

385
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,287
Another solution.
- Castrate first?

386
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,608
A third solution.
- Castrate only?

387
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,651
The three of us will spend
quality time together. - No. No!

388
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,290
I know what we'll do.

389
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,241
Does this shirt look <i>a</i> little gay?
- No. You look good.

390
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,210
It's better than a sweaty t-shirt.
- If someone sees me, -

391
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,091
you can tell them
I'm on drugs or something.

392
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,404
I'm sure no one will see you.
- Symphony of Me?

393
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,085
What does it even mean?

394
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,449
Tuukka chose it.
His friend acts in it. - Right.

395
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,844
Hey, you promised to be nice to him.

396
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,730
Compliment him.

397
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,367
Congratulations
for having a majestic dick!

398
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,571
You can say he looks good.
- No, I can't.

399
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,321
Give him a compliment
or I'll get mad.

400
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,043
Promise. - I promise.
- You don't want to see me mad.

401
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,244
Hi. You're here already.

402
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,122
Hi, Pete.
Nice shirt. Fits you perfectly.

403
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,325
Just kidding.
- It's from your closet.

404
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,891
Let's go in.

405
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,291
Tuukka.

406
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,486
I just wanted to say that

407
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,129
you have nice hands.

408
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,010
Thanks. Yours look very energetic.

409
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,171
You want to go?

410
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,970
Nice hands?
- I didn't...

411
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,169
From: COMMANDER

412
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,801
Thank you. That was incredible.

413
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,085
Thanks.
This is my good friend Amalia.

414
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,971
Emmi, my friend and roommate.

415
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,805
Pete is Emmi's...

416
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,364
What did you think?
- I liked it a lot.

417
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,648
I'm no expert, but I think -

418
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,531
the language of movement
was wonderful.

419
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,365
I'm proud of Tuukka.
- What about you, Pete?

420
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,686
I agree. It was powerful,
challenging and emotional.

421
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,207
But I would've liked to see
a twist in the end.

422
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,125
What do you mean?

423
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,522
<i>The</i> Sixth Sense.
- I haven't seen it.

424
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,526
It's American. - Bruce Willis
plays a psychiatrist, -

425
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,160
who finds out
he's the ghost in the film.

426
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,800
That was a surprise.
Gave me the chills.

427
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,603
I mean, it was a surprise
when you walked onstage -

428
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,401
and took off...
I mean they ripped off your...

429
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,047
And finally there was the...

430
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,810
...eclipse of the dick.

431
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,889
Thank you one more time.
We'll talk later.

432
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,330
I'll call you.
It was lovely to see you.

433
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,641
What was the show about, anyway?

434
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,610
Just because you don't get it
doesn't mean it's shit.

435
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,649
What was there to get?

436
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,371
And why did Tuukka show his dick?

437
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,320
For your information:
smaller ones grow just as...

438
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,326
How can you be so immature?
- Me? Immature?

439
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,243
You know what's immature?

440
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,801
Showing off your dick.

441
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,483
Is that so?
- It is.

442
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,808
Maybe you should go home then.

443
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,810
Oh, is that what you want?
- Yes.

444
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,971
Fine.

445
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,247
Here's your shirt. Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,851
Why did Mona leave?
- She's a slut and she slept around.

447
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,925
I don't believe you.
- I saw it. - You didn't.

448
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,325
Okay, I didn't. - So seriously...
- Stop.

449
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,326
You clearly have personal problems
you want to take out on me.

450
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,165
So what is it? Talk to me.

451
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,131
Emmi's ex.

452
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,644
They're roommates and best friends.

453
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,689
As if that isn't enough, -

454
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,605
he's got a pretty big..-

455
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,249
...cock? How big?
- Well...

456
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,365
Gigantic?
- Yes.

457
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,649
A megalomaniacal anaconda?
- An insane fire hose.

458
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,606
What can I do?
I have nothing on him.

459
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,282
It's your elitist tongue-in-cheek
sense of humor-

460
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,408
against a giant mushroom head.

461
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,002
I bet my money
on the mushroom head.

462
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,371
Game over.

463
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,848
We'd like to buy skates for my son.

464
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,562
Where can I find them?
- Nowhere.

465
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,801
Your ad said
Bauer Elite junior skates on sale.

466
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,684
My son wants to skate.

467
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,729
You'll never be anything.

468
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,886
You can find skates
around the corner.

469
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,011
Asshole.

470
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,130
Didn't get laid, huh?

471
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,762
Let's go to the bar tonight.
- No.

472
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,684
We'll go on a raid.

473
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,285
Women, hide your wallets.
Here we come.

474
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,765
You'll get wasted.

475
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,161
I guarantee you'll be happy.

476
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
Can I come?
- We're not going anywhere.

477
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,804
Even if we were,
you're too late to sign up.

478
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,001
I just signed up. - You didn't
e-mail the application as a PDF.

479
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,249
I haven't seen the application.
- Of course not.

480
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,687
No one told me.
- Of course not.

481
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,243
How was I supposed to know?
- There is no application.

482
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,050
So you're coming?
- Yes.

483
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,170
No. - Yes.
- Hell no!

484
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,051
Why the fuck
are you swaying like that?

485
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,283
There's a club next door
if you want to dance.

486
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,684
What would you like, boys?
- Two double Scotches and beers.

487
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,890
A small Pepsi Max.

488
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,802
This ain't
no fuckin' underage disco.

489
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,281
You get wasted
and throw up everywhere!

490
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,083
I don't want to. - Get the fuck out
if you don't like the concept!

491
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,242
I think we'll manage without you.

492
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,451
I'll drink on one condition:
come to a KuPa game. - Hell no!

493
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,887
Then I won't drink.
- What a loss.

494
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,889
But I won't leave either.

495
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,931
Touché.

496
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,367
Sirkku. A double Scotch and beer
for our cab driver here.

497
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,766
I could've become the next
jari Litmanen or Mikael Forssell.

498
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,446
This one guy said
I could've gone far.

499
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,604
Guess how many times
I can bounce the ball?

500
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,208
1131. Think about it.

501
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,130
Two beers and
he's ready to pee in his pants.

502
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,443
Vesander and I
are like two peas in a pod.

503
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,682
Let's go to my place.

504
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,320
We'll make love.

505
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,650
Afterparty at Sirkka's house!
- It's Sirkku.

506
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,609
Afterparty at Sirkku's house!

507
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,448
I'm going home.
- You can't! This is what you need.

508
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,369
This? - Yes. Watching Terho
disgrace himself, getting wasted, -

509
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,602
an afterparty and getting groped.

510
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,570
This is an essential part
of getting over it.

511
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,365
Let yourself go.

512
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,049
Surrender, young man.

513
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,600
You want me to sing some more?
- Go ahead.

514
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,165
<i>Tonight girls won't say no...</i>

515
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,925
Tonight I'll make you a man.

516
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,730
Hell no.

517
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,802
The most printed book
in the world is not the Bible.

518
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,769
It's the IKEA catalogue.

519
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,044
You know what that proves?

520
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,724
It proves that pussy makes
the world go around, not God.

521
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,967
I'm your dear coworker, so tell me -

522
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,883
what is wrong
with your girl's pussy? - What?

523
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,609
Or are you a man's man?
A manly man?

524
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,846
Her roommate is someone we hate.
And her ex.

525
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,527
How do I know
if she's what I think she is?

526
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,445
I mean,
she dated that hazardous waste.

527
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,767
Are you sure he's hazardous waste?

528
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,881
You're whining about heartache -

529
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,283
in some old woman's backyard
on a Sunday morning.

530
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,522
You should be somewhere else, -

531
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,968
not here being groped
by old ladies.

532
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,050
Clown.

533
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,204
What are you going to do?

534
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,405
Wish me luck.

535
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,291
Luck.

536
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,962
Hi. I'd like to talk to Emmi.

537
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,322
You know what time it is?
- Yes.

538
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,051
She's sleeping.
- No, she's not. Emmi!

539
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,611
Come to the door!

540
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,241
I'm sorry I woke you up.
- What is it?

541
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,607
Can I talk to you alone?
- Why?

542
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,651
It's personal and
I don't think we need Tuukka here.

543
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,211
Thanks.

544
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,963
What do you want?
- I want you.

545
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,369
And I want to apologize for being
an immature idiot at times.

546
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,888
I'll work on it. - Why didn't
you just make a drunk call?

547
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,088
I'm not drunk. Anymore.

548
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,844
I was pretty drunk.

549
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,402
Now [just have a headache
and I'm tired.

550
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,168
Everything okay? - Yes.
One short moment. Thanks.

551
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,722
No KuPa victory
has ever felt as good -

552
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,611
as when you laugh at my jokes.

553
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,967
Or at least that's how it feels now.

554
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,203
I've known KuPa a lot longer
than I've known you.

555
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,684
The strange thing is that you're
a meaningful person in my life.

556
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,129
I'm not very experienced
with women, so...

557
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,921
Sorry, but this is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

558
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,171
Really?

559
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,166
Hands down. - I've never
apologized to anyone before.

560
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,645
I believe you.

561
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,164
Err, I'd still... So...

562
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,570
...did I pass?

563
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,964
What's the situation?

564
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,608
Why don't we have a cup of tea.

565
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,371
You want croissants?

566
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,131
Yes.

567
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,091
Thank you.

568
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,529
This shows you who's a real fan.

569
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,364
Let's have a barbeque!

570
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,090
KuPa wins again

571
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,722
Hey, there's someone else here.

572
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,491
Tuukka Tiensuu secures
fifth victory for AC United

573
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,129
Show them, Pettersson!

574
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,162
Who the fuck is Pettersson?

575
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,365
<i>KuPa will always be
Finland's best team!</i>

576
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,125
Crucial game between
local teams set for Sunday

577
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,211
Hi.

578
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,402
Hi. Tuukka.

579
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,931
I made cauliflower au gratin.

580
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,321
If you're not headed to
a Michelin restaurant,join us.

581
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,487
You don't need a third wheel.
- C'mon. Three is better than two.

582
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,881
Okay. I'd be happy to join you.
I'll just unpack my bag.

583
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,451
Great.

584
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,603
Tuukka, I have to say that -

585
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,923
I might have misjudged you
all these years.

586
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,564
To be honest with you,
I had a preconception of you -

587
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,564
and it wasn't
the most flattering one.

588
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,883
You've always hated me.
- Hate is a strong word.

589
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,122
I have to admit that -

590
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,483
I had doubts about you.
And still do.

591
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,210
When I heard that -

592
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,523
Emmi was dating
the legendary Pete the Mudman...

593
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,001
What is this Mudman thing?
- Nothing.

594
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,404
In elementary school we had plum
pudding at the Christmas party.

595
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,803
Pete was an angel in the play...
- Tuukka, please.

596
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,760
Don't tell the most
embarrassing moments of my life -

597
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,843
to the woman I love.
- Pete.

598
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,205
Pete. It was 20 years ago.
- Right.

599
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,567
Of which
I spent 10 years in therapy.

600
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,681
That's really funny.

601
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,446
It's not the same.
- Don't yell.

602
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,002
You have to see the real-life
jari Litmanen's statue.

603
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,006
When you get off work,
we'll drive to Lahti to see it.

604
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,049
To Lahti? How lovely.
- Oh yes.

605
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,524
I go back to school
right after my summer job.

606
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,763
Oh, that's right.
The statue won't go anywhere.

607
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,491
I guess so.
- I have a suggestion.

608
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,291
Promise you won't reject it
right away.

609
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,408
Come with me to Helsinki.

610
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,961
I know we haven't known
each other that long, -

611
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,849
but I like the idea.

612
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,606
I've never felt this way before.

613
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,764
And you don't have to stand
on the sidelines at forty.

614
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,244
What would I do then?
- Hello? You'll play with me!

615
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,562
Hey...

616
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,371
Munchkin.
- What are you doing?

617
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,051
Munchkin.

618
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,210
Tuukka does that.
And it's pumpkin.

619
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,007
How did you know?
- I saw him do it.

620
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,210
Sorry for ruining your thing.
- It's just a joke.

621
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,249
He once apologized and did it.

622
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,449
We can come up
with something of our own. - Yeah?

623
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,921
Of course.
- Like this:

624
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,811
That's better.

625
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,684
So, did you call my friend
at the factory? - No, I didn't.

626
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,525
I don't think we've met.
- I guess not.

627
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,444
Markku.
- Emmi.

628
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,682
Hi.
- You can call him Grumpy.

629
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,251
Grumpy.
- Markku.

630
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,843
Hope everything goes well tomorrow.
- Hope so.

631
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,927
I'll keep an eye on you.
- Bye.

632
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,323
Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

633
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,168
Who was that?
- I know him from school.

634
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,802
You're still having
a guys' night tonight? - Yeah.

635
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,601
Commander's come up with some
project. I'll see you tomorrow.

636
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,683
Look! Here he comes.

637
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,442
Look, jari!

638
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,561
Where's Terho?
- He's on a date.

639
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,531
On a date?
- It's about time he gets laid.

640
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,887
Kids, tonight is full of surprises.

641
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,248
Surprises? - Tonight even
monkeys will dance. Get up!

642
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,011
What's the surprise?
- You'll see.

643
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,960
Tell me now.
- It won't be one if I tell you.

644
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:18,049
Guys, check these out.
- Sartlila, they're for the game!

645
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,566
Fatso! Idiot!

646
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,086
Freakin' fatso! You're gonna die
if you don't throw it out!

647
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,607
A night of surprises!

648
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,290
Guys, what are you doing?
- Watch out!

649
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,086
You sure this is a good idea?
Let's get out of here.

650
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,083
Let's go.

651
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,363
Don't do this.
Please, let's not do this.

652
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,091
You know whose window that is?
- Yes, I do.

653
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,483
This is no joke.
We might end up in real deep shit.

654
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,281
Stop. You'll give me diarrhea.

655
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,683
What should I write?
- Write 'Commander is the best.

656
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,888
Right. And my number.
- What?

657
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,730
Idiot!
- Do something!

658
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,291
Who?

659
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,370
Holy shit.
- What is it?

660
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,851
We need a change of plan.
- What?

661
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,323
Jari Litmanen's honor is
in our hands. - Whose? What?

662
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,529
Is Litmanen there?
- His statue is in there.

663
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,131
What statue?
- Stupid!

664
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,045
We're not going
to steal Litmanen statues.

665
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,524
Of course we are.
- Come down, for fuck's sake!

666
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,450
The idiot's not going to notice
it's gone. - I'm out of this.

667
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,568
This is crazy.
- I'll go.

668
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,849
Go.
- Come down.

669
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,844
Come down! I'll go.

670
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,971
Go ahead.

671
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,326
This is so cool.
- We'll so blow this. - I know.

672
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,811
What?

673
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,491
Pete!

674
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,411
Pete!

675
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,131
Yesterday this defender hit me
right in my calf, from behind.

676
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,089
My thighs are so tight.

677
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,451
Pumpkin.

678
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,888
You sure you want me
to wash only your back?

679
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,882
Let's make some music...

680
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,362
What the fuck are you doing?

681
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,409
We came to see where you went.

682
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,770
We're the happy thieves.
- Yeah, yeah. Go!

683
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,244
Quick!
We got jari!

684
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,601
<i>Nothing is as lovely
as watching jari litmanen</i>

685
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,364
I'll go get dressed.

686
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,402
Is it okay if we eat a little later?

687
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,967
Yes. Yes.

688
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,362
That's it.

689
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,290
Yes! Yes! Yes!

690
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,851
Pete.

691
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,443
Save yourself and the statue.

692
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,001
You have to leave me here.
- Come on.

693
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,571
I'm stuck.

694
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,209
Shit.
- What the fuck?

695
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,443
Go! Go! Go!
- Wait!

696
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,011
He.
<i>s</i> in!

697
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,966
This was a perfect gig!

698
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,762
We waited ten years.
This day will be remembered forever.

699
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,925
Anybody else hungry? - Sports
store salesman, put a scarf on.

700
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,445
My humble thanks.

701
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,401
Hi.-Hi.

702
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,324
Is this the atmosphere?

703
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,927
When will I feel like I belong?

704
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,562
Where's your date?
- She took her daughter to ballet.

705
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,084
Holy shit.
You're dating a single mom?

706
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,042
What's so funny, plumpy?

707
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,171
Fatso was this close to getting rid
of his virginity last night.

708
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,970
A couple of centimeters.

709
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,926
Isn't Emmi coming?
- She is.

710
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,040
Pete. I need to tell you
something about Emmi.

711
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,921
Larvio.
Isn't that your favorite boy?

712
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,845
What the fuck?
Tuukka won't be playing?

713
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,284
Who's that other guy?
- It's his dad.

714
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,445
It can't be his dad.
It would be a sick relationship.

715
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,410
Right.
- Why does he have crutches?

716
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,281
Emmi's coming.
- Not a word about last night.

717
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,488
A gentleman never kisses and tells.
- Hi.

718
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,007
Where are your hot pants?

719
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,686
Put a scarf on. Today's a big day.
- Hi.

720
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,327
What's the matter?
- I guess it's your lucky day, huh?

721
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,891
What? - A bunch of teenagers
broke in through Tuukka's window.

722
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,327
He busted his knee chasing them.

723
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,643
And now he can't play.
- He didn't see anything?

724
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,044
No. He said it was dark and all.

725
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:33,209
Teenagers? - if I see them, I will
saw their pathetic little dicks off.

726
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,290
So will I.

727
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,442
It's not your fault.

728
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,209
Today's a big day.

729
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,206
I don't want to let anything
ruin it. - Let's make some noise.

730
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,044
KuPa! Bigger than the globe!

731
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,204
We're so going
into the third division.

732
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,486
United! - Matias, I saw an ass
running around in the woods!

733
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,291
Go stick your little dick in it!

734
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,370
That's it. Do it!

735
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,768
Do it.
- Score!

736
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,562
Jesus motherfuckin' Christ!

737
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,166
It was close.

738
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,403
This game sucks big time.

739
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,643
Tuukka is a homo!
- You can't yell that anymore!

740
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,247
Why not?
. He's not playing!

741
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,609
Besides,
you can't call a homo 'homo.'

742
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,446
Or you can, but it's not funny.

743
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,482
Get it?
- Sure.

744
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,489
Good job, boys!

745
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,842
What did I tell you?

746
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,044
This is so great!
We'll climb into the third division.

747
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,329
Calm down, guys.
There's still time left.

748
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,441
It's a done deal.
Matias! Choke on a cucumber!

749
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,606
Eat poop, diarrhea faces!

750
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,163
I told you this was going to happen,
didn't I? - You did.

751
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,687
You're idiots!
- Ugly idiots!

752
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,250
I wish I'd never been born so that
I wouldn't have to see this shit.

753
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,890
I'll come with you.

754
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,927
Commander.
Can we watch the game? - No.

755
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,050
It'll be over soon.
- I don't want to watch crap.

756
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,248
C'mon, guys!

757
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,284
This is an important game!

758
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,321
Now!
- I won't be fooled that easily.

759
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,203
Penalty kick!

760
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,281
I told you we'd make it into
the third division, didn't I? - Yes.

761
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,684
It's not looking good.

762
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,608
If this one goes in,
I'll go on a diet.

763
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,722
I think I love you.

764
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,164
You say that because
your team won. - Maybe.

765
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,330
But I think I have feelings
for you. - You think?

766
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,768
I do!
Quiet. I think I love you.

767
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,524
That's enough!

768
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,091
Slop!

769
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,846
I love you too!
- Me too!

770
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,287
Let's go party!
- Sure!

771
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,128
KuPa! Bigger than the globe!
- That's right.

772
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,448
Quiet. Stop.

773
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,687
We waited ten years,
but it was worth it. - Yeah.

774
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,208
This is the happiest day of my life.
- True.

775
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:32,163
Vesander, welcome to our club.
Asshole. - Grow pubes, boy.

776
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,087
Vesander, you're in my gang now.

777
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,244
Pete is a great guy.
Hold onto him. - I will.

778
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,926
You don't find guys like him easily.

779
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,765
Cheers.
To the third division and Emmi.

780
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,248
Don't break Pete's heart.
- I couldn't do that.

781
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,845
You sure?

782
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,446
What?
- What are you talking about?

783
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,683
I found a photo.
- What photo? - Yesterday.

784
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,010
How did you get this?

785
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,767
I couldn't fit in the closet...
- I gave it to you.

786
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,924
No. I got under the bed
and found it...

787
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,323
Shut up!
- Is Tuukka the ex with a big dick?

788
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,609
How big? - A giant mushroom.
- A horse cock?

789
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,525
So it wasn't teenagers
who broke in. - Emmi.

790
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,763
So you've known all along he's gay?
- Shut up!

791
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,329
Only you are stupid enough
to steal a jari Litmanen statue.

792
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,484
It was an accident.
- Whose idea was it?

793
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,011
What a surprise.

794
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,251
It was an accident.
- Was it fun? - Yes.

795
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,164
No.
- Tuukka busted his knee!

796
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,008
We never meant to hurt anyone.
I'm not like that.

797
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,571
Asshole.

798
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,522
We were supposed to party...
- Shut up for once, midget!

799
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,604
Emmi. Please, don't go.

800
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:57,130
I know women. She'll be back.
Believe me.

801
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,571
In the spirit of fair play -

802
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,248
and on behalf of United fans:

803
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,891
congratulations.

804
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,446
A victory is a victory,
no matter how it's achieved.

805
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,969
If you don't get lost, you'll find
yourselves in the cemetery.

806
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,522
We come here for reconciliation
and this is what we get?

807
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,889
Jerks like you ruin the reputation
of division soccer.

808
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,841
Pussy juice like you ruins
the reputation of all little girls.

809
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,050
Oh shit.

810
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,925
Time to go, huh?

811
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,931
Let's go!

812
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,248
Annukka!
- Hi.

813
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,283
We're the only married men
in our gang, right?

814
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,610
Fuck.

815
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,685
Emmi!

816
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,285
Fuck.
Emmi. Please listen to me.

817
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,681
Give me a minute.
- The clock's ticking.

818
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,491
I didn't time this.
- Spit it out!

819
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,087
I had no idea about the idiotic plan
for Tuukka's apartment.

820
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,608
You were there.
- Yeah, I was.

821
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,562
So you lied. Why?

822
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,165
Why?
- I don't know. I'm stupid.

823
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,766
Tuukka was right from the beginning.

824
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,329
I was an idiot and told him -

825
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,802
that even though you're
emotionally handicapped, -

826
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,841
you're the nicest and most genuine
person I've ever met.

827
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,723
I feel I can trust you.

828
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,291
You can.

829
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,009
Was this just a joke to you?

830
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,171
No.

831
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,170
<i>Emmi</i>

832
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,611
Fuck.

833
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,484
Where have you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

834
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,644
It doesn't matter. We broke up.
- Of course it matters.

835
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,168
You hid information.
Let a spy enter our camp.

836
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,731
Let it be.

837
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,202
Why didn't you tell me?
- You would've gone crazy.

838
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,926
You're right. I would've.

839
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,569
I'm so tired.

840
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,921
Climbing takes its toll on you.
We waited ten years.

841
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,001
Then we'll wait ten years
to get into the second division.

842
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,642
You think we'll be standing
on the sidelines at forty? - Yes.

843
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,371
What else would I be doing?
Good night!

844
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,045
Monkko!
- It's this close, Kaikkonen!

845
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,481
KuPa celebrates climbing up
- big day for fans

846
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,882
That's music to my ears.

847
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,923
My throat hurts. - The dark side
of success is fucking your palate.

848
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,762
Although I can't sense
the success here.

849
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,889
What did you think of the game?
- It was shit.

850
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,082
That counter wasn't
made for sitting. Attention!

851
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,569
What is your problem?

852
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,804
The building will be bulldozed.

853
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,487
They're going to build
a friggin' shopping mall here.

854
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,723
You can get the hell out.
Have a nice life.

855
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,646
Who was that cranky moped-riding
midget? - Simo, your boss.

856
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,451
That was Simo?
- That was Simo.

857
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,164
I imagined him differently.
- Where am I gonna find a new job?

858
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,802
I've got a big lady to feed.
- Kill the fatso.

859
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,569
Now you'll have time
to focus on your women.

860
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,571
Stud.

861
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,284
Fuck.

862
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,801
How do you like it here so far?

863
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,931
I like it.

864
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,366
I always knew
you were a smart guy.

865
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,404
Unlike the imbeciles
you were forced to hang outwith.

866
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,731
Yeah.

867
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,880
Larvio, you're my man.

868
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,609
We're going out
for a drink after work.

869
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,283
Why don't you join us.
- I'll think about it.

870
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,730
The boss is coming too.

871
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,124
There will be a position open
in the automation department soon.

872
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,770
Two shifts.

873
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,008
I'm sure you'd like it.

874
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,006
Here we go. Black shots.
The company's paying.

875
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,046
Pete. Welcome to our team.

876
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,887
Matias said you're a good guy.
- It was nice of him to hire you.

877
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,249
You'll be friends when you
forget about the soccer incident.

878
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,244
Pete and I are smart enough -

879
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,529
not to let soccer
ruin our friendship.

880
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,001
Especially now
that the girl is gone.

881
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,448
Who? -Tuukka Tiensuu.
He won't play anymore.

882
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,082
Why not? - He found
something more interesting.

883
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,402
What's that?
- Dick work.

884
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,329
How did you know?
- That he's a homosexual?

885
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,602
He said so in an interview.

886
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,162
He said he's in love
with his boyfriend Stefan.

887
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,369
Stefan must be over 50.
- He could've done better.

888
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,646
Now that we got rid of fruity pants,
let's drink to it.

889
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,803
I'm more into ice hockey.
- Who isn't?

890
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,770
To the Finnish National Hockey Team!

891
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,161
Pete, have a shot.
For the hockey team! - Larvio!

892
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,731
What are you...

893
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,571
Pete.

894
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,407
You must understand
you're nothing without Tuukka.

895
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,201
Besides, he was too good
for hockey jerks like you.

896
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,160
In Commander's words:
Choke on shit.

897
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,409
You're late.
Emmi left for Helsinki already.

898
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,930
I wanted to talk to you.

899
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,048
I'm really sorry for everything.
Especially the knee.

900
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,811
It was the world's
dumbest thing to do.

901
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,327
I wondered what that smell was.

902
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,361
It smells rotten. Like a sewer.

903
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,209
Anyway, here's the statue.

904
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,251
Sarttila forgot to give it back.
- Forgot?

905
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,882
Well.. - You can fondle it
when we're gone.

906
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,091
Uh-huh.

907
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,684
Where are you going?
- To Playa del Ingles.

908
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,408
I admit; it's pretty gay.

909
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,444
Stefan has bad taste in things
other than his hat. - I heard that.

910
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,491
Tuukka.

911
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,368
I want you to know I'm really sorry.

912
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,569
I didn't want
the season to end like this.

913
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,003
It doesn't matter.

914
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,763
But you owe me a knee.

915
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,564
There's room in the backseat.

916
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,366
We're headed the same way,
aren't we?

917
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,649
You're a bunch of losers.

918
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,371
You're dumb as a whale's ass.

919
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,491
How come
it's so difficult to understand -

920
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,529
that it's KuPa?

921
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,251
Ku and Pa.
- KuPa.

922
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,811
Larvio.

923
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,284
We're revising our stuff since
we can't joke about gays anymore.

924
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,001
But there's no point
until fatso learns his ABC's.

925
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:16,963
Pete. Are you gonna play tonight?
- Of course he is.

926
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,565
Rim

927
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,882
What?
I think I lost a girl

928
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,251
Go!

929
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,608
Don't come back without her.

930
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,761
Okay. - I'll be back
before next season starts.

931
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,125
I promise.

932
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,250
See you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Bye.

933
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,642
This division is a joke.

934
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,009
We'll crush them.
- Easily.

935
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,565
Okay, Fanatics.
Let's make some noise.

936
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,689
Get off your asses!

937
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,843
<i>We'll climb into the second division</i>

938
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:07,042
<i>KuPa will always be
Finland's best team!</i>

939
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,044
What is this shit?

940
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,009
