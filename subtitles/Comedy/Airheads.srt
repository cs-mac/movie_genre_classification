00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:19,630
<i>(DJ) Oh, yeah! That was for all you pinheads
too hip to take off your jackets in the 95° heat.</i>

2
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,308
When the weather gets like this
it brings all you nutbags out...

3
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:29,267
...and since I am a trouble magnet, I have
one thing to say to you bozos: back off.

4
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:33,309
<i>Here's the Sons of Thunder from their album
Scrambled Eggs and Wobbly Legs.</i>

5
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:39,443
This is Ian the Shark on the station with
more hair, more flair, yet so debonair: KPPX.

6
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:43,996
Rebel Radio-oh-oh-oh-oh!

7
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,655
Hey! Hey! You've gotta check in here!

8
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:25,277
Get Security on the second floor.
We've got a bogey in elevator one.

9
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,613
It's that guy in the delivery uniform again.

10
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,996
OK, be wild. Be as wild as you wanna.

11
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:35,505
If you feel like wetting yourself, go with it,
OK? Anarchy's good. They like anarchy, OK?

12
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,124
- But what are we supposed to say?
- What? Don't say anything.

13
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,381
Jeez, do you wanna blow this? You know
how much these stupid hats set me back?

14
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:46,806
- Hi.
- Oh, no. Hey, excuse me?

15
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,383
Mike, it's him. The wacko's back.

16
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,931
Yeah, I'm up here in A&R right now.

17
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:03,230
I'm not goin' anywhere.

18
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,036
Oh, hey, dude.

19
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,529
- Hey, hi. Are you an executive here?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:14,080
How you doin'?
My name's Chazz. Chazz Darby.

21
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:19,507
I'm in this band and we've got this incredibly
sweet demo. I think you should hear it.

22
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,540
I can't take that tape from you.
It's called unsolicited material.

23
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:28,381
Hey, but this is the real thing, man. This is
rock 'n' roll. None of that gimmicky stuff.

24
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:32,388
I would love to hear it,
but if it's unsolicited, I can't touch it.

25
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,600
We've been trying to get solicited...

26
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:38,388
Well, then maybe a gimmick would help.
The cream always rises, OK?

27
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,808
Super-duper. Thanks.

28
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,811
All right, dude. Thanks a lot. Whoa!

29
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:46,902
You again!
You just can't learn, can you, scumbag?

30
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,443
Take care now.

31
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,495
Here's your tape.

32
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,331
Hey. How was your day?

33
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,719
Oh, Gary is a tremendous asshole.

34
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:10,551
He had this whole stack of invoices
and he made me arrange them by date.

35
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,928
- He's such a tweaker.
- It sucks.

36
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:17,852
- Did you mail the rent?
- You, uh... you didn't leave me a stamp.

37
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,268
Well, maybe you could have
gone and bought one.

38
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,357
Ow!

39
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,854
Chazz! What the hell
happened to my make-up?

40
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,192
It fell in the toilet.

41
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:35,616
Shit! Babe, come on.

42
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,240
- I told you not to leave it on the tank.
- You ruined my make-up, butt!

43
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,583
What's this attitude, Kayla?
Know what I've been through today?

44
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,876
I guess you woke up
when the sun was warm...

45
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:49,424
...and rode your Harley up and down Melrose
impressing all the 15-year-old girls, right?

46
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,961
I was down at Palatine Records.
That's where I was.

47
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:57,058
Really? What happened?

48
00:05:57,142 --> 00:06:01,010
I had a meeting with
a big record executive and, uh...

49
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:03,180
What did he say? Why didn't you tell me?

50
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:05,681
Well, we talked about solicitation...

51
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:10,687
...and the guy said he'd snap us up
in a second if it weren't for the lawyers.

52
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,485
- Did he like the tape?
- I was about to give it to him...

53
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,193
...then a security guard showed up
and ruined everything.

54
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,408
<i>(sighs)</i>

55
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,663
- Come on.
- Please.

56
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,911
Hey, it's true. I'm making
really good contacts. I am.

57
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:29,748
When they hear this song they'll go apeshit.
It's just gonna take time. What's the big deal?

58
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:35,262
<i>The "big deal" is that I'm doing the bullshit
work and you're living the rock 'n' roll life.</i>

59
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:39,426
- I wanna live the life, too.
- I'm doing this for us.

60
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,218
Come on, babe. You know that
once I make it you got a free ride.

61
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,186
I'm gonna treat you like gold.

62
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,225
Chazz, it's been months.

63
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:51,606
<i>Maybe you should get a job.</i>

64
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:59,408
This is my job. I am trying managers, record
executives, club owners. That's hard work.

65
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:02,945
You get to sit in a nice office all day
smoking and drinking coffee.

66
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,578
- Oh!
- This is bullshit!

67
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,537
- Oh, my snout.
- You bastard!

68
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,210
I hate you. You are nobody
and you are never gonna be anybody.

69
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,046
You're treating me like I'm a goober
after I wrote this song for you?

70
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,090
You wrote that song before you even met me.

71
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:23,299
- So?
- So you get out!

72
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:26,677
Get out now! Get lost!

73
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,430
- OK, OK, OK, OK. Kayla!
- Go!

74
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,431
- Keep going!
- Kayla!

75
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,730
You poser!

76
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,688
I always knew you were a loser!

77
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:38,937
Everyone warned me!

78
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:42,107
I hate your music! I always have!

79
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:46,988
She booted you out again, huh?

80
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,658
What a bitch.

81
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,826
I mean, that that happened.

82
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,706
Hey, she's gonna be jealous
in six months from now...

83
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:57,798
<i>...when we're on the cover
of Rip magazine lookin' cool.</i>

84
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:00,172
- Shut up.
- I'm just sayin'.

85
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:02,880
- Rex.
- What?

86
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:06,257
I told you to stock the end caps
and mop the employee lounge.

87
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,602
- Too late. I'm outta here.
- I'll tell Covington.

88
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,762
Oh, be quiet.

89
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:20,979
Hey, Chazz, what's up?

90
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,152
- He's movin' in with us for a while.
- Great! We can rock out after breakfast.

91
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:30,740
Things are gonna happen to us no matter
what that chimp from Palatine Records says.

92
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:35,125
<i>You see, that's just it. You think
everything's gonna happen to you.</i>

93
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,250
You gotta make it happen.

94
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:42,415
How many practices have you missed
cos you're cleaning up some stiff's pool?

95
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,043
Get in the truck, dingus.

96
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,724
I'll be right there.

97
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,491
Man, Chazz is right. All we gotta do
is make our own action, you know?

98
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:12,444
That's the way it is, little bro.
D'you think Tommy Lee waited for the bus?

99
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:16,322
Man, he hustled. That's how come
he gets to pork Heather Locklear.

100
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,204
Yeah, well, we got the look, man.
We're gonna be huge.

101
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,169
Yeah, we're almost there.

102
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:26,925
Chazz says once we get a contract, chicks
with breast implants pick out your clothes.

103
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:30,047
Cover your mouth.
You're shooting phlegm all over my ass.

104
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,056
Say "gesundheit". I say it for you, man.

105
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:37,219
Honey, I'm home.

106
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,313
- Hey, Pip, check this out.
- Oh! Oh!

107
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:46,486
The Incredible Crash Dummies. Whoo!

108
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,530
You must have five-fingered
most of the store by now.

109
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:53,032
Oh, man. Most of these guns
are discontinued anyway.

110
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,616
Like this Uzi water pistol.
They got rid of it cos it looked too real.

111
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,784
<i>- Yo!
- (baby voice) Mama.</i>

112
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:07,128
Wow. Now you got yourself
a whole arsenal here.

113
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,422
<i>(electronic siren)</i>

What are you doing?

115
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:18,807
Pepper sauce. Active ingredient: capsicum.

116
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:22,310
You blast this in somebody's face
and they're all like "Oh! Oh!"

117
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:27,314
Some Hollywood Boulevard trash
comes shimmying up the rain pipe...

118
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,645
- Hey!
- Whoa!

119

<i>(cheering)</i>

121
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,789
That's right.

122
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,993
Rock 'n' roll!

123
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:47,953
OK, we're here to party tonight...

124
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,620
...with our little buddies...

125
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,836
...the Sons of Thunder.

126
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:59,259
Sons of Thunder? Didn't we blow them off
the stage at Chez Bang six months ago?

127
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:05,719
So why don't all you little idiots
press your faces up against the speakers...

128
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:09,017
...and blow your brains out!

129
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:15,896
Look at this crap. What do we
give away first, hats or hair-care products?

130
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,240
Girls, you wanna get us
a couple of drinks, please?

131
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,287
Ooh, serious bumper.

132
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:27,410
You wanna punch it up, Ian?
You're as spunky as a corpse.

133
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,621
The Sons of Thunder,
for Christ's sake? Pablum.

134
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:34,545
- How can you even tell these bands apart?
- I read the trades.

135
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:38,962
First of all I'd like to say thanks to Ian
and Rebel Radio for playing our single...

136
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:41,343
...and basically getting us signed.

137
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,307
Is this on?

138
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:49,392
# Don't hate me

139
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:51,639
Look at them stupid pantaloons.

140
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:55,398
- That's what we gotta do.
- Looks like they got a load in them pants.

141
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,275
No, they played this song on the radio, and
they got an album. That's what we gotta do.

142
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:04,115
# Your lips are full, your head is empty

143
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,953
# This faded Valentine is what you sent me

144
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:13,453
All we've got to do is get 'em
to play the tape and we're golden.

145
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,381
- This is never gonna work.
- Pip, what is your problem?

146
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,964
Remember that guy Doper Greg?
Remember that guy, man?

147
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:25,010
He used to blow bong hits in his iguana's
face and make the thing watch cartoons.

148
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,094
- So what? Will you shut up?
- Just get to the point. What?

00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,741
It's gonna get some airplay or
my man's gonna gank you here and now!

294
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,747
- Shit, yeah.
- Well, let's not go ganking anyone.

295
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:18,450
- Um, if we play the tape, will you go?
- That's all we need, d-cheese.

296
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:20,869
Play the thing, Milo. Do what he says.

297
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,454
Play it! What are you waiting for?

298
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:27,549
- Sorry about all this. Enjoy.
- I can't wait.

299
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:32,003
We can't play this tape.
We're only set up for CDs and cassettes.

300
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,972
We should've brought a cassette.

301
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,223
A cassette makes my background vocal
sound like someone's stepping on my nuts.

302
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:43,228
- God. Mr. Perfectionist.
- Quit necking. All we got was a quarter-inch.

303
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,651
There's gotta be a reel-to-reel.
Find it. It's a radio station.

304
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah. That's it there.

305
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:57,158
Milo, didn't I tell you
to knock when you come in?

306
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:00,913
Just keep quiet and get that
reel-to-reel deck down to the booth.

307
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:06,755
Telling me to shut up now? A brother can't
talk without the white man slap him down.

308
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,916
Just do it, Marcus!

309
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:11,716
Damn.

310
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:26,560
White man with a gun. Same shit been
happenin' to my people for 425-odd years.

311
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:29,770
Hey, you like working here, man?

312
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,984
We're down, man. Hendrix was God.

313
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:37,574
You wanna take a step back?
You're standing on my dick, man!

314
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:41,576
Yeah, I seen that. Anthrax and Public
Enemy, that was outta control, man.

315
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:44,951
Together, you know. You catch that one, G?

316
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,917
Don't call me G.

317
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:49,577
- What do you want me to call you?
- Hey, come on.

318
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,417
All right, that's it.

319
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:55,553
I can't wait for you to put that gun down,
cos when you do we're gonna throw down.

320
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:58,555
<i>That's right. We're gonna get serious.
Mano a swine.</i>

321
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,676
Hey, look, just shut
your pie hole and keep working.

322
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:04,555
Pie hole? That supposed
to be some Cracker slang?

323
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:11,560
<i>(Rex) Come on, let's go.</i>

324
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:14,984
Agh!

325
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,336
Ooh! Ooh!

326
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,838
You can't smoke here, babe.

327
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:38,670
Yeah? What am I doin' now?

328
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,046
You should put it out.
The smoke could damage the equipment.

329
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:48,729
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

330
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:51,102
OK, give us a real nice intro.

331
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:55,235
And don't say anything about us
having a gun to your head.

332
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,811
- OK, who are you guys?
- My name's Pip.

333
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:02,446
<i>- The band. The band name.
- Sorry about that.</i>

334
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:06,449
- He doesn't wear a helmet, does he?
- It's right there on the box. Read it.

335
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,702
"The Lone Rangers." That's original.

336
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,910
- How can you pluralize "The Lone Ranger"?
- What's wrong with that?

337
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:18,339
Well, there's three of you.
You're not exactly lone.

338
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:21,461
<i>Shouldn't you be The Three Rangers?</i>

339
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:26,764
I've no idea what you're saying right now.

340
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,685
- You lost me.
- Forget it, Ian. Just play the thing!

341
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,260
Yeah, forget it. Come on, just play it.

342
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,727
Listen up, guppies, Ian the Shark is back
and have I got a surprise for you.

343
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,488
I've got goose bumps, frankly.

344
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,276
For the first time ever, I'm willing to bet...

345
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:48,989
...here's that hit single by The Lone Rangers.

346
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:51,781
<i>(# rock drumbeat)</i>

347
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:01,832
<i>(music speeds up)</i>

348
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,344
- Turn it off! Come on, man.
- What did you do? What you doing?

349
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:13,805
- Tonto must have loaded the tape in wrong.
- Hey, your machine dilapitatled it, man.

350
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:15,555
Hey!

351
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,182
Oh, what?! Hey! Oh!

352
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,146
- Hey, that's my jacket!
- Put it out!

353
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:23,896
Please!

354
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,858
- Oh, man. The demo's wasted.
- What are we gonna do now?

355
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,367
Run!

356
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,865
It's the inbreeding.

357
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,285
Go! Go! Go!

358
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,803
- Man.
- How'd they know we were here?

359
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:56,309
I don't know. I don't know.
OK. Look, maybe they're just on patrol.

360
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,932
All right, we didn't do nothing, right?

361
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,265
- What?
- You go.

362
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,232
You guys suck.

363
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:07,774
Everything's all right. It's cool.

364
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,257
Let me in! Let me in!

365
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,722
I don't wanna go to jail. I'm fragile.

366
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,981
Go!

367
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,187
Argh!

368
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,865
Shit! We're surrounded.

369
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:02,537
Why don't we give ourselves up?
We could say we were joking around.

370
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,661
They'll cart us off
before you can say "Rudolph Redpecker".

371
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:09,964
- Well, you didn't have to break out the gun.
- They wouldn't play the tape.

372
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,922
- You didn't have to do that!
- Shut up.

373
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:14,132
- You shut up!
- Both of you shut up!

374
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:17,386
If we go outside, we get roped.
We stay and figure it out.

375
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,341
Excuse me?

376
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,883
- Oh, jeez.
- More people. OK.

377
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:26,389
We round everyone up, put 'em in the station
and nobody leaves until we figure this out.

378
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,014
What was she on the Clydesdale scale?

379
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:34,977
Yeah, that's where you gotta figure how many
Clydesdales it'd take to tear her off your face.

380
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:37,279
Later. Let's go.

381
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:42,995
I knew from looking at him
that he was a bomb about to go off.

382
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,488
A big fat media bomb!

383
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,039
They're gonna be all over the news now.

384
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:51,661
<i>Time magazine, Larry King Live.</i>

385
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:54,080
If the song's in English, it's a gold record.

386
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,250
Come on, come on, let's go.

387
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,426
Hi again.

388
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:00,592
Hi.

389
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,014
Hey, hey, you guys think
you're gonna waste anybody?

390
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,635
Cos if you are, pop Milo first.
That guy's a bozo de luxe.

391
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,721
Uh-huh? Go.

<i>(clattering)</i>

Perhaps it won't be long
until this thing blows over.

394
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,664
Argh!

395
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,293
Argh!

396
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:42,088
All right, everybody on the floor right now.

397
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:47,590
Do you mind if I sit in a chair?
I don't wanna get all cruddy.

398
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:51,638
- Uh, yeah.
- Thank you.

399
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,980
If she doesn't sit on the floor,
I don't know why I have to.

400
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,391
You heard the man.
Hit the deck or I smoke you.

401
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:02,526
Sit down on the floor now! Everybody else
gets to sit in a chair except for you.

402
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,326
Are we... are we still on the air?

403
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,386
- Have you made contact?
- No. One guy came out, but he went back in.

404
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,308
Have Dispatch give us their number.
Let's call them.

405
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:35,931
- You getting this, Wilson?
- Establish contact, ensure it's no false alarm.

406
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:38,228
I know the procedure.

407
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:45,312
- Could I get something to eat, man?
- You hungry, buddy?

408
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,027
Hey, Chazz. Chazz.

409
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:50,074
What?

410
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:01,245
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- That guy says he's hungry.

411
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:04,173
Who gives a shit?!
I'm trying to think here, OK?

417
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,315
The leader? Hold on.

418
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,697
It's the police.

419
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:35,862
They wanna talk to you.

420
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,247
He doesn't wanna talk.

421
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:45,712
What am I supposed to do, beg him?
What are you doing to get us out of here?

422
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,874
OK, fine.

423
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,627
He wants you to go out and talk to him.

424
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,047
Bag that. What for?

425
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:58,099
He wants to know your demands
for releasing the hostages.

426
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:02,312
- Oh, my God!
- Demands? What's he mean by "hostages"?

427
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:07,393
I've got a reality check for you, curly.
What you're doing is a felony, maybe worse.

428
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:11,898
- What are your demands?
- Nothing. I just don't wanna go outside.

429
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,150
OK. Come here, come here.

430

- A hockey stick up the backside of his head.

Thank you, Rex.

All right. Now, what do we want?

00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:13,708
All right, but can we move this along?
Now, why did you come here?

444
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,259
I came here for a lousy three minutes
and 31 seconds of airplay. That's it.

445
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:23,766
Fine. Now there's cops outside with guns,
and you're holding people hostage, right?

446
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,301
- Uh, yeah.
- On top of that, your tape is destroyed.

447
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:32,020
So, there's only one thing that you can do.

448
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:37,690
Get the other copy of the demo.

449
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,440
Yeah!

450
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,484
Rex!

451
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:44,068
<i>(rock music)</i>

452
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,948
Bastard!

453
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:57,622
<i>(Chazz and Kayla) You called on the phone,
but we're not at home.</i>

454
00:33:57,716 --> 00:34:02,010
<i>(Chazz) Leave a message for Chazz. We'll
call you back soon, so don't have a spaz!</i>

455
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,301
<i>(answering machine beeps)</i>

456
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,268
Come on, come on.
Stay back now! Back there!

457
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:10,308
Hold it! Hold it!

458
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,429
I want you to control this crowd.

459
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:16,104
If they give you any trouble,
cuff 'em and throw 'em in the squad car.

460
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,608
Technically I can't do that, Sergeant.
The Civilian Review...

461
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:24,488
I know what the Civilian Review Committee
says, but they're not doing crowd control.

462
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:29,237
Listen, when you're in the line of fire
you do what's necessary to get the job done.

463
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,406
You don't break the law but occasionally you
bend it. When that time comes, improvise.

464
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,035
Yes, sir.

465
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:40,081
Cover me.

466
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,382
<i>(crowd whistles and cheers)</i>

467
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:46,381
Get your hands up over your head.
Get down on the pavement! Get down!

468
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:47,965
- What the f...
- Sergeant.

469
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:50,132
What?

470
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:53,759
You men, back off. Get back,
goddammit! Put those guns down!

471
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:57,721
It's OK. You can get up when...
Goddammit, get back!

472
00:34:57,815 --> 00:35:00,437
What the hell is this?
You invited me to come out!

473
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:04,227
You surprised us. I'm Sergeant O'Malley.
I'm here to work with you.

474
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:07,192
- What's your name?
- My rhythm section's watching me!

475
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,571
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Everybody OK?

476
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,871
- They're all fine. My name's Chazz.
- Great. It's good to meet you, Chazz.

477
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,411
Tell me what I can do to get you to end this.

478
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:20,201
- You gotta find my tape.
- Sure. OK. What kind of tape is it?

479
00:35:20,295 --> 00:35:22,833
It's a demo tape. We wanna play it on the air.

480
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:26,339
You wanna play this tape on the radio,
then you'll come out?

481
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:31,088
Right. The machine inside ate the original.
My girlfriend's got the only other copy.

482
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:35,593
- Give me her number. I'll call her.
- I already tried that. She's off for the night.

483
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,141
- You're gonna have to find her.
- Where is she?

484
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:41,313
I don't know. Try the Strip somewhere.
Maybe The Whisky.

485
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:43,934
She's...

486
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:47,146
She's totally pissed at me, but...

487
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:51,197
Is that her? She's a... real looker.

488
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:52,948
Yeah.

489
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,824
Why don't black people like me?

490
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,831
- Excuse me?
- It's just that I listen to a lot of rap music...

491
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,076
...and I know how angry black people are.

492
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,455
And I feel bad for all you guys
gotta put up with.

493
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:08,671
Well, that's very nice of you.

494
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:13,171
How about when you go into a store
and all the clerks start starin' at you...

495
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:17,723
...like you're gonna rob the place and
you're like "I just wanna buy something"?

496
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,300
That's never happened.
Does that happen to you?

497
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:25,306
Ah, no, but I'm just saying
that would be bad if it did.

498
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,357
Look at Chazz doing his thing.

499
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:30,017
Listen, Chazz...

500
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:32,485
...this is gonna take some time, OK?

501
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:36,902
You have to send out one of the hostages
just as a sign of good faith. That's my rules.

502
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,074
All right, fine. You have
your orders, Chief. Now get cracking.

503

<i>- (screams)
- (cheering)</i>

504
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:52,044
It's more like power slop but with an edge.

505
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:56,089
OK. The cops are going to get Kayla.

506
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,630
I cut a deal with them.
We've gotta send one person out.

507
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:02,098
Please.

508
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,059
I'll go.

509
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:05,805
- A hostage, doof.
- Sorry.

510
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:09,479
But not me, man. It's just too cool.

511
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:12,105
Why don't we let Yvonne go, man?
She's very nice.

512
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:16,275
Wait a minute. I don't see why you
automatically have to choose a woman.

513
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,570
Well, it's kind of sexist, don't you think?

514
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,902
I mean, we could draw straws.

515
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:24,369
- We could...
- OK.

516

in time for The Simpsons.</i>

I'm sending out a sweep of Sunset Strip for
the girlfriend. I want you there to supervise.

522

Whoa.

00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:01,028

- I'm gonna miss Yvonne.
- Let me tell you something.

531
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:49,069
Don't chitchat with them.
They're not buddies. They're hostages.

532
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,443
I was trying to be nice.

533
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:54,783
I know, but then every time you tell
somebody to get on the floor...

534
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:58,826
...they're gonna be like "Even me, Pip?
I thought we had something going."

535
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,793
You gotta scare these people.
Practice. Just try it.

536
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:05,928
I just feel a little goofy trying
to be a badass with a water pistol.

537
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:10,923
They don't know that. They think it's real.
Now show me what you got. Come on.

538
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,679
OK. Get over there, please. Thank you.

539

What are you, a crack baby?
Give me that. I'll show you.

...or I'll stab your eyeballs out
and piss all over your brain!

It's gonna be a slaughterhouse, with bodies
flying through the air like dolls on fire!

- With my dick!
- Yeah!

...and there's nothing you can do
about it cos I'm a madman!

- That's good.
- It kinda hurt my throat.

Come on, come on, move, move.

00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:21,408
So she boots me out of my own house
and now I'm at the motor lodge.

556

12 years of marriage and devotion
down the tubes.

Good, cos I'm taking over the interior
perimeter. You and your boys can fall back.

Like hell you are. Didn't you hear?
We don't have a situation.

- Yeah, I copy that.

Nah, you won't be held accountable.

This is what I want you to do, Beech.
I want you to check in with me periodically.

585
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:02,845
I want you to talk to me directly

Check it out. Come on in.

- Sweet.

588
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:16,976
We've got these guys by the short curlies.

probably cool stuff here. Play track two.

them. Why don't you ever play these guys?

- To tell you the truth, I stick to the classics.

648

Rock 'n' roll's been all downhill
since Lennon died.

this classic-rock crap down my throat.

00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,474
No offense, but today's music
doesn't have a whole lot to say.

let's get some record executive here pronto.

- That's what we want.
- You don't demand one from the cops.

It's gotta come unsolicited.

- Forget it. Just forget it.

Affirmative. These cowboys

You know, I can understand "Mom"
or "I Heart Wanda", but why the Reaper?

Well, it's like death is stalking me...

off my ass and get this band rolling.

No, I was being a bitch.

Why don't you give it up, Chester?
You can talk it over later.

It's Chester.

We're going live!

It fell off the nightstand.

What did you do to my tape?
Can we even play this?

Maybe if I clean it up and re-spool it. Christ!

This thing smells like piss, man.

927

Kayla, I don't have time for this noise. Did
you come to bitch at Rex or to help us out?

- Get outta here! Get lost, all right?

937

I got a million things to think about,
I don't need you, too.

938

I'm a part of this. You wrote
that song for me. That's my song!

939

I wrote that song before I even met you.

940

You'd better go about your business.

And you keep kicking me out!
It's making me insane!

make it up to you. I'm doing this for you!

01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:10,203
- That surfer guy wants to come back inside.
- What? Will you tell that guy to piss off?

01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:13,291
Guys! Guys!

1031
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:18,879
- Hey, no dice, man. Get outta here.
- Oh, come on, Rex.

1032
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:22,086
- I won't try anything.
- You shouldn't have escaped then.

1033
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:25,091
Come on, bro. I was havin' a blast!

1034
01:17:25,181 --> 01:17:27,506
Come on, Rex. Rex!

1035
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:30,216
I wanna get a drum set
that goes underwater...

1036
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:34,011
...so in the middle of our show they can
dunk me in a tank and I can do my solo.

1037
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:35,979
Cool!

1038
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:39,734
I'm gonna get a leather jumpsuit
with the crotch cut out.

1039
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:43,438
Rex, can you set up the sound system
so Jimmie Wing can hear the tape?

1040
01:17:43,532 --> 01:17:46,153
- I'm just... I gotta...
- Yeah, go ahead.

Hey, Rex, man. We're gonna go to jail, huh?

1042
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:57,659
Small price to pay to be a legend.
Remember when Ozzy pissed on the Alamo...

1043
01:17:57,754 --> 01:18:00,327
...and was banned
from San Antonio for a decade?

1044
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:03,542
Did his time, went back, rocked the place.

1045
01:18:03,634 --> 01:18:09,008
Section G, the force majeure, where it says
"riots, disturbance, war, acts of God", etc.

1046
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:12,383
- What about it?
- Amend that to exclude this hostage crisis.

1047
01:18:12,476 --> 01:18:15,097
That can be construed as
an act of public enemy.

1048
01:18:15,187 --> 01:18:17,179
- Done.
- Where's the tape deck?

1049
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:19,348
Oh, why? We need that, too?

1050
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:21,685
- Let me see your arm.
- Why?

1051
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:24,149
- Ow!

We got a record contract!

Hey, bro, we got signed.

No. We didn't hook this thing up yet.

1068

- So you two haven't heard the demo?
- I heard it on the radio earlier.

1069

You heard it for about five seconds
and then it got ate.

Well, Chazz, my man...

1071
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:15,961
...it's not just the music, it's the way
you talk about it. You have such passion.

1072
01:20:16,053 --> 01:20:19,718
- Whoa, whoa. What am I hearing?
- What's wrong, man?

1073
01:20:22,101 --> 01:20:24,223
No deal. No.

What are you talking about?

1075
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,849
No deal! Yesterday he kicks me
out of Palatine Records...

1076
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:34,734
...and today he has a record contract for me to
sign. He hasn't even heard my tape. No deal!

1077
01:20:34,821 --> 01:20:39,150
- But this is what you wanted!
- Wanna know what I think of your contract?

1078
01:20:39,242 --> 01:20:41,318
Allow me to demonstrate.

1079
01:20:46,332 --> 01:20:49,167
He wipes his ass with his record contract.

1080
01:20:49,252 --> 01:20:52,667
- I love this guy.
- But we still have a deal, right?

1081
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:55,756
I wanna be a rock star someday
but on my own terms.

1082
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:59,709
Well, I got some news for you, big guy.
You already are a star.

You can't buy this kind of media exposure.

1084

We are sitting on a gold mine here.

1085
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:12,643
I am offering a long-term contract to get your
music out to millions, plus a whole lot more.

1086
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:15,692
Like what "a whole lot more"?

1087
01:21:15,777 --> 01:21:20,854
Ever since you signed this contract you've
been under the umbrella of Palatine Records.

We have an army of attorneys

...rock stars don't go to jail. Christ.

Vince Neil only got 30 days

Hey, buddy, you swear you can get us off?

I swear, if you guys play ball.
That's what I'm here for.

OK. Super-duper.

We're making records.

- Ah.

Yes. Yes.

a live performance by The Lone Rangers.

Wait a minute. That can't be right.
You can't pluralize "Lone Ranger".

1109

Get the guy who did the Guns N' Roses video.

- How is this? I feel kinda goofy.
- You look like an idiot.
