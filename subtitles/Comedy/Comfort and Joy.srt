00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:08,234
Hello, sweetie.
Merry, merry to you, too.

328
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,730
How's my little sugarplum?

329
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,810
Oh, just peachy keen.

330
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,972
I wanted to know what time we
Should come over tomorrow.

331
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,051
We?
So Adam is coming.

332
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:20,300
Of course, darling.

333
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:23,629
I'm not gonna leave him alone
On Christmas.

334
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,126
Well, don't forget
His high chair.

335
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,374
I'm going to pretend

336
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,703
I didn't hear that very,
Very snide remark.

337
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,367
Look, I知 sorry, okay?

338
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,112
But you do realize that daddy's
Gonna be there, right?

339
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:36,944
Fine. Fine.

340
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,441
I'll just have to rise
To the occasion.

341
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:41,521
Look, no scenes,
Please, okay?

342
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:44,017
I do not want a repeat
Of last year.

343
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,682
My conduct last year
Was unimpeachable.

344
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,178
I was not the one
Who threw the wine goblet.

345
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,259
You were threatening him
With a carving knife.

346
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:54,004
I may have been gesturing
With a knife for emphasis,

347
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:55,252
But I would never...

348
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:56,916
Fine, whatever, okay?

349
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,830
I just want everybody to behave
Like grown-ups for once,

350
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,661
All right?

351
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,742
Then you should be lecturing
Your father, not me.

352
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,823
Ugh. Fine, mother.
Just stop it, okay?

353
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,903
Look, we're gonna eat
At 4:00, all right?

354
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,151
4:00-ish is perfect.

355
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:10,648
No, not 4:00-ish,
4:00, okay?

356
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,561
I am not gonna hold dinner again
This year.

357
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,225
When have I ever been late?

358
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,722
Punctuality
Is my middle name.

359
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:20,218
Great. Whatever you say.

360
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:22,299
Will Richard be joining us?

361
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,963
[ sighs ]
Of course.

362
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,044
Do I hear wedding bells?

363
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:30,205
No, it must be the feedback
From your hearing aid.

364
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,534
I don't know why you must be
So unpleasant.

365
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:34,782
Is it wrong for a mother

366
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,862
To want to see her daughter
Happily married?

367
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,527
Uh, look,
You know what, mom?

368
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,607
Renee just put a note down
In front of me.

369
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,855
I have an emergency.

370
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,520
I've gotta run down
The hall, okay?

371
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,184
So I値l see you tomorrow,
All right?

372
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,265
Bye-bye.

373
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,762
[ sighs deeply ]

374
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:58,915
[ knock on door ]

375
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,245
I'm gonna get out of here now
If that's all right.

376
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,741
Sure. Go ahead.
Leave me in the lurch.

377
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:07,654
Go off to your exciting,
Wonderful life.

378
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,566
Getting smashed on eggnog
With four lonely gay guys

379
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,647
Is not exactly my definition

380
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,728
Of a wonderful,
Exciting life.

381
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,392
Well, it sounds good to me.

382
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,056
You okay?

383
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,552
Oh, yeah, I知 fine.

384
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,881
I guess I知 just not feeling
Very Christmassy this year.

385
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,378
You know what I recommend
For that?

386
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,626
Heavy drinking.

387
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,875
Sound advice.

388
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,956
You know you're welcome to swing
By my place later,

389
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,868
And there'll definitely be some
Heavy drinking going on there.

390
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,949
Well, you know what?
I would love to,

391
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,029
But I知 gonna wade
Through some of this

392
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,109
Before I head out
To Mr. Jorkin's party.

393
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,190
God, I wish
I didn't have to go.

394
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,854
The price of success.

395
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:44,687
[ chuckles ]

396
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:48,847
Anyway, I want you to have
The merriest of Christmases.

397
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,512
Aw. You too.

398
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,344
Thanks.

399
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,592

That's gonna leave a mark.

I heard the crash,
And my heart stopped.

Could you just give me
A hand?

Just calm down.

Let's get in the house,
And we'll call a doctor.

I just need to leave.

Okay, just come right
Over here and sit down.

For your head.

That's right.

I'm fine, really.

That's a nasty bruise.
I'm gonna call dr. Atkinson

And see if she can come
Take a look at you.

Truly, that's very considerate
Of you,

But I gotta be going.

No, you are not going
Anywhere.

What's going on?

There's been a little
Accident -- car accident.

00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:25,553
Oh, no.

487
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,633
You have kids.
That's nice.

488
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,881
We have kids.

489
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:30,547
No, no, no.

490
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:33,043
What's with mommy?

491
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,123
Mommy? M--

492
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:36,788
Oh, okay, look,
You know what?

493
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,285
This is just really
Too weird, okay?

494
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:40,116
All right?

495
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,364
Let me state this

496
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:43,861
Once uncategorically
And for the record,

497
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:45,942
This is not funny,
All right?

498
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,606
Joke is over.

499
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,519
I am not married to you, and
I certainly don't have kids,

500
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,599
So I知 just gonna be going.

501
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,847
Mommy, you're scaring me.

502
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,928
You're freaking them out.
Will you just calm down?

503
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:59,257
I'm freaking them out?
How do you think I feel?

504
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:00,506
You're in shock.

505
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,337
I'm not in shock!

506
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,666
I'm completely in control
Of all of my senses.

507
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,915
I'm just leaving.

508
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,579
Leaving on Christmas eve?

509
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,244
Are you two getting divorced?

510
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,740
No, no, no one's
Getting divorced.

511
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,237
Your mom's just upset.
She's not herself.

512
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:17,149
Troy, go in the kitchen.
Call dr. Atkinson.

513
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,230
Tell her mom's
Had an accident.

514
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:21,310
Okay.

515
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:22,975
Don't leave!
It's Christmas!

516
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,223
You can't leave!

517
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:26,303
Okay, okay, this is --
All right. All right.

518
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,384
I don't know what's going
On here, okay?

519
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:30,881
And I certainly don't want
To ruin anyone's Christmas,

520
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,962
But I just --
I don't know you people.

521
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,210
Honey.

522
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,458
I just -- really, I think

523
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,538
We should wish each other
A nice merry Christmas

524
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,203
And be going
Our separate ways.

525
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,283
You're not okay
To go anywhere.

526
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:45,028
Now, just let the doctor
Take a look at you,

527
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:46,693
And then we'll regroup.

528
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,357
[ sighs ]
Good.

529
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,021
Did you get her?

530
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,686
She's on her way.

531
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:52,518
Good.

532
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:55,431
Just let the doctor
Take a look at you.

533
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,759
Look to the left.

534
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,007
Now look up.

535
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,169
It's fine.
I can't see anything.

536
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:05,833
There's clearly
No nerve damage

537
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,330
Because your pupils
Aren't even dilated.

538
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,242
And there's no indication that
You've even had a concussion.

539
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,490
Hmm.

540
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,155
Well, then how --

541
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,235
Sam, let me talk to you.

542
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:19,564
You rest easy now.

543
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:26,637
Mom, are you going nuts?

544
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:27,886
Maybe.

545
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,967
Probably.

546
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,215
I am not your mother.

547
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:33,711
Yes, you are!
I know my own mother.

548
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:35,792
What's it like to go nuts?

549
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,537
Do you hear voices?

550
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:40,785
Sure.

551
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,698
That's so cool.

552
00:23:43,698 --> 00:23:46,610
And she didn't recognize
Anything, not even the kids?

553
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,107
No. It's like she dropped
In from outer space.

554
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,188
So, if you go really crazy,

555
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:54,100
Maybe you'll start
To see people!

556
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,933
Cool!

557
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,597
Who aren't even there!

558
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,510
It's already happening.

559
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,167
Oh, my god.

560
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,248
Uh, you know what?

561
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:14,490
I, um, um, mommy has
To make a phone call.

562
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,738
To an imaginary person.

563
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:19,066
No, no, to a very real person,
But it's kind of private,

564
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,563
So could you leave me alone
For a minute?

565
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:22,395
Okay.

566
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,643
Okay.

567
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:26,973
Do you want me
To shut the door?

568
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:29,885
That would be great.
Thank you.

569
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,717
Bye, mommy.

570
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:47,777
Hello, Mr. Jorkins.

571
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,858
Hi. It's Jane Berry.

572
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,106
Merry Christmas.

573
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:54,851
I'm so sorry
I'm late to your party.

574
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,348
I had a little accident.

575
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,428
No, uh, no, I知 fine.

576
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,757
I should be there soon,
Actually.

577
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,501
Jane.

578
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,079
Jane Berry, vice president
Of advertising.

579
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:16,488
You have a vague recollection
Of me?

580
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:19,401
That's nice.

581
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:24,394
Well, no, no, of course I
Realize it's a private party.

582
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:25,642
Hello? Mr. J--?

583
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,138
[ dial tone ]

584
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:30,219
[ sighs ]

585
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:36,876
Would you like
Some more coffee?

586
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,125
No, thank you, Sam.

587
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,038
So, what's your explanation
For all of this?

588
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,118
I've heard of things
Like this before,

589
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:44,783
But I致e never seen it.

590
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:46,863
It's sort of
A situational amnesia

591
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:48,944
Brought on by trauma
Or shock.

592
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:50,192
It's usually short-lived

593
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:52,689
And disappears as quickly
As it came on.

594
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:53,521
Any idea when?

595
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:55,601
Oh, there's no way
Of knowing --

596
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,097
Maybe tonight or it could be
A couple of weeks.

597
00:25:58,097 --> 00:25:59,346
I wish I could tell you.

598
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:01,842
Now, I can admit her
To the hospital tonight

599
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:03,923
If it'll make you feel
Better.

600
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:05,172
On Christmas eve?

601
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,420
Oh, I know. I know.

602
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,916
It's not the best time
Imaginable,

603
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,413
And I honestly don't think
It'll help.

604
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:14,742
Well, it might disorient her
Even more.

605
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:18,903
Chances are what she really
Needs is a good night's sleep.

606
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:20,151
Great.

607
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,896
[ groans ]

608
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:24,729
What was that?

609
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,057
Mommy!

610
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:28,889
Jane!

611
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:33,050

Jane!

613
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,546
Jane!

614
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:38,460
Mommy, don't go!
Mommy, don't go!

615
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,788
Mommy, don't go!

616
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:45,117
Heather and troy.
Come here, kids.

617
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,110
Jane! Jane!

00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:10,916
Who is it?

620
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,164
It's Jane.

Oh, what a nice surprise!

624
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,720
Come in. Come in.
I can't believe you came by.

625
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,801
Everybody, this is Jane.

626
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:36,713
Jane's the great boss
I told you about.

627
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:39,626
Jane, this is Wally, Donnie,
Bill, and Albert --

628
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,955
Also known as the four horsemen
Of the apocalypse.

629
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,203
I'm pestilence.

630
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:45,451
Merry Christmas.

631
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,284
Oh, thank you.

632
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:48,364
Gosh, I hope
I'm not intruding.

633
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,693
Oh, are you kidding?
I'm delighted.

634
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:53,357
Wow, I love your hair.

635
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,270
Did you get that done
This afternoon?

636
00:27:56,686 --> 00:28:00,431
No, no, no, I致e had it
Like this for a while now.

637
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:02,927
Huh?
Oh, no, well, it's great.

638
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:05,008
So, what are you watching?

639
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,088
Oh, well, I wanted to watch
"white Christmas,"

640
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:09,169
But the boys wanted to watch
"Easter parade."

641
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:10,833
Judy is a woman
For all seasons.

642
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,914
Can't go wrong with Judy.

643
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:14,995
So we compromised
On "sunset boulevard."

644
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,243
Oh.

645
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,323
Quiet.
This is the best part.

646
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,819
Oh, as if you haven't seen
This 100 times.

647
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:23,316
Wait a minute,
Haven't I seen you before?

648
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:24,149
I know your face.

649
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:26,645
Get out or shall I call
My servant?

650
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:27,893
You're Norma Desmond.

651
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,558
You used to be
In silent pictures.

652
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:30,806
You used to be big.

653
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:34,135
I am big.

654
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:37,047
It's the pictures
That got small.

655
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,712
[ laughter ]

656
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:39,961
Encore?

657
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:40,792
Encore.

658
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,041
[ sighs ]

659
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,537
So come, sit.
Tell me how you've been.

660
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:46,202
How are Sam and the kids?

661
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,282
W-what did you say?

662
00:28:48,282 --> 00:28:50,779
How are Sam and the kids?

663
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,189
How did you know
About them?

664
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:59,101
Well, it's not exactly
A secret.

665
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:01,598
It's the pic--

666
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,758
Oh, come on.

667
00:29:05,758 --> 00:29:08,672
Renee, look, you --
I mean, you know me.

668
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:10,751
You know
I don't have a family.

669
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,417
Are you getting divorced?

670
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,248
What?

671
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:14,913
No, I知 not getting
A divorce!

672
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:16,577
I'm not even --
I'm not married!

673
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:17,825
Okay, Jane.

674
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:20,322
Jane, you're freakin' me out
A little here.

675
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:21,986
All right.
Okay.

676
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:26,148
Okay, you know, it's just --
It's been a long day.

677
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,228
I'm a little confused.

678
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:30,308
I need to work things out.

679
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,973
Okay.

680
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,885
So, how long have
You not had a family?

681
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,798
Could we just ignore --
I have no family!

682
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:40,295
Can we just stop talking
About the family

683
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,543
That I do not have?

684
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:44,871
Okay, fine. Whatever.
No family. Got it.

685
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,120
Okay, honey.
Sure.

686
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,200
[ wind whistling ]

687
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:55,690
[ doorbell rings ]

688
00:30:02,764 --> 00:30:04,013
Hi.

689
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:04,844
Jane.

690
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,509
Can I come in?

691
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:10,670
Wow, this is a --
This is a surprise.

692
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,334
Can I come in?

693
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:15,247
It's not really
A good time, you know?

694
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,327
I mean,
Christmas eve and all.

695
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:18,992
Honey, who is it?

696
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:22,320
Oh...I see.

697
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,817
It's not a good time, huh?
Yeah.

698
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:27,314
All right, well, I get it.
I get it.

699
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,643
Otherwise engaged, are you?
Uh-huh.

700
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:36,468
Oh, my god.

701
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:38,132
Jessica, this is Jane.

702
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:41,877
I think the two of you may
Have met in the past.

703
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:43,126
The past?

704
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,622
Yeah, how about this afternoon
At sushi noku?

705
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:46,871
Wow!

706
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,119
You don't waste any time,
Do you?

707
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:49,783
Excuse me?

708
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,528
Listen, Jane, it's -- it's --
It's really nice to see you,

709
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,193
But this is kind of awkward.

710
00:30:55,193 --> 00:30:57,273
I'd love to get
Together sometime.

711
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,769
It's just that now it's,
You know,

712
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:01,434
It's not really a good time.

713
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:03,931
So, that's it?
We spend two years together,

714
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,011
And you just dump me
On Christmas eve?

715
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,092
[ laughs ] what are you
Talking about?

716
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:11,837
I haven't seen you, Jane,
In almost...10 years.

717
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:15,997
10 years?

718
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,326
Yeah, ever since you left me
For that guy.

719
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,990
What was his name?

720
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,239
Sam.

721
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:25,152
Yeah, yeah, that was it.
Sam.

722
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:32,642
Uh...so he's real.
He exists.

723
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,722
For your sake,
I certainly hope so

724
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:37,635
'Cause I壇 hate to think
That you left me

725
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:40,131
For some figment
Of your imagination.

726
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:45,956
No, no, Sam is real.
I...

727
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:50,534
My kids are real, too,
I guess.

728
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,614
It's all real.

729
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,110
It's great to see you,
Jane.

730
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,191
We'll do lunch sometime,
Huh?

731
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:58,439
Oh, yeah.

732
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,688
Soon.

733
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:00,936
[ sighs ]

734
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:28,399
Can I help you?

735
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,895
You live here, right?

736
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:35,056
Yeah.
I hope so.

737
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:38,801
Just checking.

738
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,297
Merry Christmas.

739
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,498
[ sighs ]

740
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,471
Jane.

741
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:38,719
Hey.

742
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,384
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

743
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:42,881
Let's just hang on a sec
Here.

744
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:47,042
Uh, hey, look, I don't know
What's going on here.

745
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:50,786
I started out this evening a
Single woman driving a jaguar,

746
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:54,115
And somehow I turned into
This wife and mother

747
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,028
Driving a terminally ill
Station wagon.

748
00:33:57,028 --> 00:33:59,525
None of this makes
Any sense to me.

749
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:02,021
You know, I知 willing
To concede

750
00:34:02,437 --> 00:34:04,101
That I have lost my mind,

751
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:07,430
But you have to believe me
When I tell you

752
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,094
That I don't know you.

753
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:12,008
I've never seen you before
In my life.

754
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:19,913
I-I believe you.

755
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,242
You seem like
A really nice guy,

756
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:24,906
Which is good

757
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:29,067
Because, you know,
Apparently, we're married.

758
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,564
Apparently. [ chuckles ]

759
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:33,644
I wouldn't even be here,
You know,

760
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,557
Except that I don't know
Where else to go.

761
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:39,053
Even my driver's license
Says I live here.

762
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:46,960
So no matter what I may think,
This seems to be my life.

763
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,457
It's a wonderful life.

764
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,536
Is that a joke?

765
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,201
A little seasonal humor.

766
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,281
It's very good.

767
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:56,946
Thank you.

768
00:34:56,946 --> 00:35:00,691
So, what do you think
We should do?

769
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:05,684
You could start
By coming in.

770
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:07,348
You think?

771
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:10,261
Absolutely.

772
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:15,671
No funny stuff.

773
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:18,167
Mnh-mnh.
I grow on people.

774
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:38,556
Troy: hi, dad.

775
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,220
Did Santa come yet?

776
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,549
Not yet, troy.
Go back to sleep.

777
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:44,797
[ sighs ]

778
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:48,127
Mom, are you still nuts?

779
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:49,375
Completely.

780
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,287
That's okay.
I don't care.

781
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,784
I'm just glad you're home.

782
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,448
I was worried.

783
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,186
Time for bed, champ.

784
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:07,683
I know.
Merry Christmas.

785
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:09,347
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

786
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:14,340
So, what do you want
To do?

787
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,837
Uh, I don't know.
This is kind of awkward.

788
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:19,333
I think if it's
All the same to you,

789
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,830
I'll just sleep down here
On the couch.

790
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,911
Don't be silly.
I'll sleep out here.

791
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:24,743
You sure?

792
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:25,991
No big deal.

793
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,320
I have to put together
Heather's new dollhouse anyhow.

794
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:30,985
Oh, I could help you.

795
00:36:30,985 --> 00:36:33,064
No, it's okay.
I'll get it.

796
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:34,729
No, really, I壇 love to.

797
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:38,058
When I was heather's age,
I used to love Barbies.

798
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:38,890
Where is it?

799
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:40,971
It's right where we hid it.

800
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:48,461
Oh, wow.

801
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:49,292
[ laughing ]

802
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,541
That's great.

803
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,775
Oh, man, this is gonna be
A major operation.

804
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,601
Where's the glue?

805
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,098
[ laughs ] glue.
You don't need glue.

806
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:13,010
It all just fits together.

807
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,258
Perfectly.

808
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,923
Like you and me.

809
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,668
You have to stop saying
Things like that.

810
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:22,165
Well, I told ya,
I grow on people.

811
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:23,413
[ laughs ]

812
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,326
All right, I don't know what
Any of this stuff is for.

813
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:28,406
Okay, I want the china.
This is the chinaware.

814
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:30,486
Oh, well, like I know.
It's a Barbie house.

815
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:31,735
You can make the bed.

816
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,358
[ sighs ]

817
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,607
Need anything?

818
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,103
Uh...a toothbrush
Would be nice.

819
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,848
Toothbrushes are in the holder
Above the sink.

820
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:13,344
Mine's green,
Yours is purple.

821
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:15,425
Did you say purple?

822
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,506
It's just -- I mean,

823
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:20,834
'Cause I always get
A purple toothbrush,

824
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,499
I mean, from before.

825
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:25,827
I know.
Purple's your lucky color.

826
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:29,572
Well, I guess some things
Never change.

827
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:30,820
I guess not.

828
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,310
Uh...sleep well.

829
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:40,391
Good night.

830
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:50,712
Time to wake up!

831
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,377
Wake up!
It's Christmas!

832
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,456
Mommy, wake up.
It's Christmas!

833
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,122
Mommy, wake up!

834
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,201
Aaaaaaaahhh!

835
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,946
[ breathlessly ]
Okay, okay.

836
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:02,779
Mom, cool it.

837
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,860
I guess she's still crazy.

838
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,691
What's wrong?

839
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,356
Mom's still spazzed out.

840
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:08,604
Oh, this is my life?

841
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:09,852
Jane, just calm down.

842
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:11,517
This makes no sense.

843
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,181
This makes no sense.
This is my life.

844
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:14,429
Is she gonna be like this
All day?

845
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,678
I can't breathe.

846
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:16,926
Are you gonna slap her?

847
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:17,758
No, of course not.

848
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:19,007
That's what they do
In the movies.

849
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:20,671
Well, this isn't a movie.

850
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,335
I have completely
Lost my mind.

851
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:23,583
It's okay.

852
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,248
Troy, get your mother
A glass of water.

853
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:27,745
All right.
Just breathe, Jane.

854
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:30,241
Breathe.
That -- that's right.

855
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:31,490
Calm down.

856

[ water running ]

857
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:33,986
I'm good. Okay.

858
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,235
I'm calming.

859
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:36,483
Ohh.

860
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,388
Thanks.

861
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,885
I needed that.

00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,871
Okay.

864
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,449
This is the best Christmas.
A dollhouse and skates!

865
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:03,113
Can we go skating later?

866
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:04,777
If we have time, honey.

867
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:13,932
Cool!

868
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,429
A world war ii guy
On a motorcycle.

869
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,093
It's Steve McQueen.

870
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:19,341
Who's Steve McQueen?

871
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:20,589
Well, he's the...

872
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,502
Never mind.

873
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:24,750
Do you like it?

874
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,415
It's awesome!

875
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:27,663
Thanks, dad!

Thanks, mom.

It's time to go sleep
Now, Lisa.

878
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:44,723
Wow.

Oh, wow.

This is incredible.

881
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,548
That's great.
Who gave you that?

882
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:54,709
You did.

883
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:58,038
Oh...well.
I always did have good taste.

Strange.

Well, don't be silly.
They're yours.

889
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,440
Maybe they'll jog
Your memory.

890
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:12,185
Won't hold my breath.

Oh, I love Ella Fitzgerald.

So everyone keeps telling me.

00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,887
Well, I can see why
You're so freaked out.

958
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,968
Look, none of this makes
Sense, you know?

959
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:54,464
I'm sure that Sam and the kids
Are lovely,

960
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,792
But, you know, I just -- I
Really -- I want my life back.

961
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,041
Well, that's the problem

962
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:01,954
Because there's no way to get
There from here.

963
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:04,866
[ sighs ] you think I致e lost
My mind, don't you?

00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,115
Mmm...no.

965
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:08,611
I think you've been through
A very traumatic experience,

966
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:11,940
And everything's gonna come back
To you really soon.

967
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,020
What are you doing
To that stuffing?

968
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,853
Adding ketchup.

969
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:16,101
Of course.

970
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:18,598
So you really -- you really
Think that all of this

971
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:20,679
Is just gonna come
Flooding back?

972
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:21,510
This new life.

973
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,758
Of course.

974
00:45:22,758 --> 00:45:24,423
Although there
Are worse things

975
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:27,336
Than waking up and discovering
You're married to Sam Keller.

976
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:28,584
If that happened to me,

977
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,081
I'd think I would have died
And gone to heaven.

978
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,410
So...you think I致e done okay
In this new life

979
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:37,322
That I completely
Don't recognize?

980
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:40,235
[ chuckles ] honey,
You won the lottery.

981
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:45,645
You two okay in here?

982
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,141
We're fine.
A little confused but fine.

983
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:50,638
So you know
About our little dilemma?

984
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:51,886
What do you think?

985
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:54,383
Well, I try to look
On the bright side.

986
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:57,295
At least this breaks up
Your normal routine.

987
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:58,543
[ scoffs ] no kidding.

988
00:45:58,543 --> 00:45:59,792
Makes everything new again.

989
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,704
Well, I guess you could look
At it that way.

990
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:03,952
It's sort of complicated.

991
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:07,281
Yeah, but you guys get to fall
In love all over again.

992
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:16,020
Well, uh...
We need to get ready.

993
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,268
For what?

994
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:18,100
Church.

995
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,349
[ chuckles ] church?

996
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,261
Oh, man, I haven't been
To church in years.

997
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:23,509
Well, you have to go.

998
00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:26,006
You're president
Of the altar guild.

999
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:27,254
I'm what?

1000
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,918
You're the pillar
Of the community.

1001
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:29,751
You're kidding me.

1002
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,831
Come on, I致e never been
The pillar of anything.

1003
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,496
Well, you are now.

1004
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:35,576
And the altar guild is serving
Christmas lunch to the homeless,

1005
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:36,408
And you're in charge.

1006
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:37,656
No way.

1007
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:38,905
Yes way.

1008
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:41,401
Can't you just call them
And tell them I知 sick

1009
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:43,898
Or -- or that
I've lost my mind?

1010
00:46:44,314 --> 00:46:47,227
Look, I知 freaked out enough
As it is here.

1011
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:49,307
The last thing I want to do
Is spend Christmas

1012
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,388
With a bunch
Of homeless people.

1013
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:57,629
That's what I do.

1014
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:58,877
What?

1015
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:02,207
[ sighs ] I work
With homeless people.

1016
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:07,616
Sam is director of a drug and
Alcohol center on skid row.

1017
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,112
[ sighs ]

1018
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:14,690
I'm sorry, Sam.
I just -- I didn't know.

1019
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,769
It's all right.

1020
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:20,099
How could you know?
I guess.

1021
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,179
If it makes you too
Uncomfortable,

1022
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:23,428
You should stay here.

1023
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:25,092
I don't want to drag you.

1024
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,004
I just thought it would be nice
For Christmas

1025
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:29,252
To give something back.

1026
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,333
Yeah, sure, you know.
Of course...

1027
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:32,582
Of course I値l go.

1028
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:36,326
I mean, you know,
Especially if I知 in charge.

1029
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:37,575
Great.

1030
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:40,904
Look, you're gonna have to
Help me through this.

1031
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,152
Don't I always?

1032
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,232
I don't know.
Do you?

1033
00:47:44,649 --> 00:47:46,729
I know.
Silly question.

1034
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:47,561
[ chuckles ]

1035
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:50,058
[ sighs ]

1036
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,218
Church? Homeless?

1037
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:56,715
I haven't done charity work
My whole life!

1038
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:58,380
Listen, my darling girl,

1039
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,877
When you come out of this fog
That you're in,

1040
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,541
You are going to be so pleased

1041
00:48:02,957 --> 00:48:05,037
With the person
That you have become.

1042
00:48:24,594 --> 00:48:25,843
Race you.

1043
00:48:25,843 --> 00:48:26,674
Okay.

1044
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:28,755
Come on, mom!

1045
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:29,588
Hi.

1046
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,983
I'm gonna need
Some extra hands, okay?

1047
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:47,895
Oh, no, no.
No, I can't do this.

1048
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:49,144
Yes, you can.

1049
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:52,056
Oh, Sam, I don't know.
What do I do?

1050
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:53,304
It's real simple.

1051
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:54,969
You just take the food
From the bowls,

1052
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:57,882
You put it on plates,
And you hand it to people.

1053
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,130
Think you can handle that?

1054
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,794
Yes, I guess
I can do that.

1055
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:03,707
Where did all this food
Come from anyway?

1056
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,372
What is this, deli?

1057
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,620
No, you cooked it.

1058
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,452
I don't cook.

1059
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:09,532
You're a great cook,
Mommy,

1060
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:12,446
Especially your macaroni
And cheese.

1061
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:14,525
It's from a package,
Mutant.

1062
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:15,774
It's still great.

1063
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:16,606
Come on.

1064
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,687
I don't know any
Of the other volunteers.

1065
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:21,599
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to say.

1066
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,264
"merry Christmas"
Would be nice.

1067
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:25,344
Oh, Sam.
I'm a fraud, okay?

1068
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:27,425
I am not who these people
Think I am.

1069
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:29,922
They don't know that you dropped
In from another planet.

1070
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:32,002
So if you don't tell them,
I won't.

1071
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,667
It will be
Our little secret.

1072
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,163
? God rest ye, merry gentlemen ?

1073
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:39,076
? Let nothing you dismay ?

1074
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,156
? Remember Christ our savior ?

1075
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:43,653
? Was born on Christmas day ?

1076
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:46,150
? To save us all
From satan's power ?

1077
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:48,646
? When we were gone astray ?

1078
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:52,391
? Oh, tidings of comfort
And joy ?

1079
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,639
? Comfort and joy ?

1080
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:59,048
? Oh, tidings of comfort
And joy ?

1081
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:01,545
? From god our heavenly father ?

1082
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,042
? A blessed angel came ?

1083
00:50:04,457 --> 00:50:06,954
? And unto certain shepherds ?

1084
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:08,619
? Brought tidings of the same ?

1085
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:09,867
Merry Christmas.

1086
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:11,947
? How that in Bethlehem
Was born ?

1087
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:14,028
? The son of god by name ?

1088
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:17,773
? Oh, tidings of comfort
And joy ?

1089
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,021
? Comfort and joy ?

1090
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:22,766
? Oh, tidings of comfort
And joy ?

1091
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,430
Where do you want
These turnips?

1092
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,095
Oh, down there by the yams.
Thanks.

1093
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:27,344
I'll see you later.

1094
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:29,840
You know, we could use
Some more plates.

1095
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,088
We've got more coming.

1096
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:37,330
Who's the guy
That's washing the plates?

1097
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:38,578
Joe.

1098
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:39,827
Thanks, Joe.

1099
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:40,658
No problem.

1100
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:43,571
Now, this isn't so bad,
Is it?

1101
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:44,820
No.

1102
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,900
You've got a knack
For this sort of thing.

1103
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:48,980
[ laughing ]
Ooh...fresh.

1104
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,383
There's a guy out there
Who's not eating.

1105
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:00,215
That's Nate.

1106
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:01,879
Well, is he hungry?

1107
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:05,208
I don't think he's strong enough
To serve himself.

1108
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,288
Poor guy's dying
Of emphysema.

1109
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:10,202
I see him down
At the center a lot.

1110
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:11,450
I'll take him a plate.

1111
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:13,530
It's okay, dad.
I'll do it.

1112
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,611
Hey, be my guest.

1113
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,509
Thanks.

1114
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:29,342
Sure.

1115
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:34,751
Want some lunch,
Mr. Nelson?

1116
00:51:35,168 --> 00:51:37,664
[ raspy voice ]
I'd love some.

1117
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,241
Here you go.

1118
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:49,315
M-maybe I should cut it
For you.

1119
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,455
Mmm, thank you.

1120
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:14,281
Did you see that?

1121
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:17,610
Yep.

1122
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,106
What an amazing kid.

1123
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:25,931
He's your son.

1124
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:38,831
Oh, damn this thing.

1125
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:40,911
I think it needs
New spark plugs.

1126
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,992
You know, really, you should
Just get a new car

1127
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:44,240
'Cause this one is --

1128
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,321
[ chuckles ]
We can't afford it.

1129
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,394
Don't be silly, please.

1130
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:55,058
I have a lot of money
Saved up.

1131
00:52:55,058 --> 00:52:57,139
Well, maybe you had a fortune
In parallel universe land,

1132
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:58,803
But here on earth,
You're broke.

1133
00:52:58,803 --> 00:53:01,716
No wonder I have
Such a dumpy wardrobe.

1134
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:04,213
You don't have
A dumpy wardrobe.

1135
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,877

01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,808
Okay.

1296
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,889
George: huh?
How about that?

1297
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:09,882
How are ya?

1298
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:10,713
Great.

1299
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:12,794
Merry Christmas, old-timer.

1300
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:15,291
That's right.
Mock your elders.

1301
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,955
So, uh, honey, uh...

1302
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:18,203
Hey, what is that --

1303
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,117
What have you done
With your head?

1304
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,029
Oh, well, you know,
It's a long story.

1305
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:25,277
I got all night.

1306
01:00:25,277 --> 01:00:27,358
She crashed her car
And went nuts.

1307
01:00:27,774 --> 01:00:30,270
You crashed your car?
I'd go nuts, too.

1308
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,103
Are you okay?

1309
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,351
No, like, "crazy" nuts.

1310
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:34,848
She doesn't even know
Who we are.

1311
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:36,096
What are they talking about?

1312
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:38,176
[ chuckles ]
They're just being funny.

1313
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,673
You know, a little
Christmas mischief.

1314
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:41,505
I'm not trying to be funny.

1315
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:42,753
Neither am I.

1316
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:45,666
Okay. Why don't we, uh,
Go check on the turkey?

1317
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:48,162
And we'll get grandpa
A drink. Scotch?

1318
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:49,828
You got my number, Sam.

1319
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:51,076
Coming right up.

1320
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:52,324
Why don't you kids...

1321
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:53,988
What was all that about?

1322
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:56,069
Oh, the kids?
Oh, who knows?

1323
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,149
They're just joking around,
I guess.

1324
01:00:58,149 --> 01:00:59,397
Come on.

1325
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:01,062
All right, if you say so.

1326
01:01:01,062 --> 01:01:03,142
What time's dinner?
I could eat a horse.

1327
01:01:03,142 --> 01:01:04,390
Soon, dad.

1328
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,639
I've been fasting all day,

1329
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,719
Saving up for
Your special turkey.

1330
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:11,049
[ laughs ] yeah,
Well, I didn't make...

1331
01:01:11,464 --> 01:01:14,794
Uh, my special turkey,
Of course.

1332
01:01:14,794 --> 01:01:16,458
Yum.

1333
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:18,538
How do you season it,
By the way?

1334
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:19,787
I've always meant to ask.

1335
01:01:19,787 --> 01:01:21,035
It's a secret.

1336
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:21,867
From your father?

1337
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:22,699
Yep.

1338
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:24,780
[ chuckles ]
Whatever you do,

1339
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,108
It's a vast improvement
Over how you used to cook.

1340
01:01:28,108 --> 01:01:29,772
What does that mean?

1341
01:01:29,772 --> 01:01:33,517
Don't be mad, but...you're
A wonderful cook now.

1342
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:38,094
But, uh, the Christmas dinners
You used to make -- pre-Sam...

1343
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:41,007
Well, they were a challenge,
To put it kindly.

1344
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:43,503
Well, that's a terrible thing
To say.

1345
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:44,752
Terrible but true.

1346
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:47,248
Your cooking
And everything about you

1347
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:50,162
Changed for the better
About the time you met Sam.

1348
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:52,242
So, why didn't you
Ever tell me

1349
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,907
That my cooking
Was so horrible?

1350
01:01:54,322 --> 01:01:56,403
Honey, you're my daughter,
And I love you.

1351
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,316
I would have eaten dog food
If you'd given it to me.

1352
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:00,564
[ scoffs ]

1353
01:02:00,564 --> 01:02:02,645
Sometimes dog food would have
Been preferable.

1354
01:02:02,645 --> 01:02:03,893
Well, great.

1355
01:02:03,893 --> 01:02:08,469
Okay, so, this is just the "new
And improved" Jane.

1356
01:02:08,886 --> 01:02:10,550
Remember the duck
You cooked?

1357
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,631
[ laughing ] [ laughing ]

1358
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:15,543
In the exploding
Serving dish.

1359
01:02:15,543 --> 01:02:16,376
Uh-huh.

1360
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:20,121
We were picking glass shards
Out of that damn thing

1361
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:20,952
All night.

1362
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:23,866
Yeah, that was --
That was terrible.

1363
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:27,194
Oh, all this talk about food
Is making me even hungrier.

1364
01:02:27,194 --> 01:02:28,026
Let's eat.

1365
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:29,691
Well, we have to wait
For mother.

1366
01:02:29,691 --> 01:02:32,187
Oh, I知 sure she'll be sailing
In on her broomstick

1367
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:33,020
Any moment now.

1368
01:02:33,435 --> 01:02:34,268
Daddy.

1369
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:35,516
[ doorbell rings ]

1370
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:36,765
Speak of the devil.

1371
01:02:36,765 --> 01:02:39,677
Now, you promised
Your best behavior.

1372
01:02:39,677 --> 01:02:40,509
No scenes.

1373
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:43,422
I'm always
On my best behavior.

1374
01:02:43,422 --> 01:02:45,087
[ laughing ]
Yeah.

1375
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:47,999
Oh, darling,
I'm so sorry I知 late.

1376
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:49,248
Hello, mother.

1377
01:02:49,248 --> 01:02:51,744
I hope I didn't keep
Everyone waiting!

1378
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:53,408
No more than usual.

1379
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:54,657
Don't start with me.

1380
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:57,153
You wouldn't believe
The traffic.

1381
01:02:57,153 --> 01:03:00,482
I thought people were supposed
To stay home on Christmas.

1382
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:03,395
All these dreadful people
Out on the road...

1383
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:05,475
Don't worry about it,
Mother.

1384
01:03:05,475 --> 01:03:07,140
Dinner's not quite
Ready yet.

1385
01:03:07,556 --> 01:03:08,388
Oh, good.

1386
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:10,884
You know what a nut I am
About punctuality.

1387
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:13,798
I just hate to keep people
Waiting.

1388
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:16,294
It's like a religion
With me.

1389
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:19,207
It's fine, mother.
Where is, uh, where's Adam?

1390
01:03:19,623 --> 01:03:20,455
Adam?

1391
01:03:20,455 --> 01:03:22,119
What are you talking about?

1392
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:23,784
I haven't seen him in ages.

1393
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,697
She traded him in
For a better model.

1394
01:03:26,697 --> 01:03:27,945
You are so crass.

1395
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:30,441
I don't know why
I even talk to you.

1396
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:32,106
My natural charm, I guess.

1397
01:03:32,106 --> 01:03:35,018
Ahh! Some holiday cheer
And not a moment too soon.

1398
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:36,683
Merry Christmas, Frederica.

1399
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,347
And the same to you,
Sam.

1400
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:40,011
Do you want a drink?

1401
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:43,340
[ gasps ] well, you know,
I hardly ever, ever indulge,

1402
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,004
But it is Christmas.

1403
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:46,253
What do you want?

1404
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,749
A double martini,
Stirred not shaken,

1405
01:03:48,749 --> 01:03:50,830
With a lemon twist...
No olive.

1406
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:54,575
And if you're smart, Sam,
You'll make that a single.

1407
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:56,239
What's that supposed
To mean?

1408
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:58,320
That you'd be better off
If you paced yourself,

1409
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,152
For a change.

1410
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:00,401
You're a fine one to talk.

1411
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,480
You swill down scotch
Like it's water.

1412
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,729
I don't swill.

1413
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:07,058
[ laughing ] I will not have
You, of all people,

1414
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:09,970
Lecturing me
About my drinking.

1415
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,467
You know what?
Will you two just stop it?

1416
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:13,715
Please?

1417
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:17,460
You know, I swear,
Some things never change.

1418
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,541
What do you mean by that?

1419
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,789
[ sighs ] nothing.

1420
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:23,702
I just, uh...nothing.

1421
01:04:24,118 --> 01:04:25,782
Never mind.

1422
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,446
So, how did your speech

1423
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:31,191
At the mentor program
Christmas luncheon go?

1424
01:04:31,608 --> 01:04:32,856
My speech?

1425
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:35,769
Yeah, what did you say?

1426
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:39,514
Ohh.
Um, well, you know, nothing.

1427
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:42,426
It really --
It wasn't that interesting.

1428
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:44,507
Nonsense.
I'm sure it was fabulous.

1429
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,171
What did you talk about?

1430
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:50,333
Well, really, it's sort of...
Confidential.

1431
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,581
Your speech?

1432
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:54,078
Made at a public luncheon?

1433
01:04:54,078 --> 01:04:56,157
A speech that was covered
By the newspapers?

1434
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:57,406
Well, we don't really expect

1435
01:04:57,822 --> 01:04:59,487
That anyone will read
The articles.

1436
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:01,983
Well, that's very strange.
[ laughs ]

1437
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:05,312
I mean, I thought the whole
Idea of the luncheon

1438
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:08,225
Was to raise the profile
Of the organization.

1439
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:09,473
It was.
I-I-it is.

1440
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:14,050
It's just we wanted to do it
In secret.

1441
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:17,795
Jane...is the mentor program

1442
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:21,123
Some kind of...
Clandestine organization?

1443
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:23,620
No!

1444
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,117
[ laughing ]
No, of course not!

1445
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:31,942
No, we want people to know about
It, just, you know, not...now.

1446
01:05:34,439 --> 01:05:38,184
Well, guess who dropped in
To the store two days ago?

1447
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,848
Who?

1448
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,512
Laurie Adler.

1449
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:43,177
Who's Laurie Adler?

1450
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:45,674
Oh, come on, you know.
Laurie.

1451
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:49,834
And I know her how?

1452
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:51,498
Darling, are you all right?

1453
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:53,995
[ laughing ]
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1454
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:58,157
I'm just having a little trouble
Recalling who Laurie Adler is.

1455
01:05:58,157 --> 01:05:59,821
Your old friend.

1456
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:03,566
The woman that you ran
The Boston marathon with.

1457
01:06:03,566 --> 01:06:04,814
Oh!

1458
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:07,310
See, now that Laurie Adler.

1459
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:12,304
I-I was thinking of another
Laurie Adler...

1460
01:06:12,304 --> 01:06:16,049
That I ran another marathon
With.

1461
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:18,961
She knows
Two Laurie Adlers.

1462
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:21,458
I don't think I knew that.

1463
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,123
When did you run
Another marathon

1464
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:24,787
With this other Laurie Adler?

1465
01:06:24,787 --> 01:06:29,364
I really don't remem--
Recently.

1466
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:33,525
Really,
It was a long time ago.

1467
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:35,606
I don't like
To talk about it.

1468
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:36,854
It's a painful memory.

1469
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,351
Do these two women
Know each other?

1470
01:06:39,351 --> 01:06:40,182
Yes.
No.

1471
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:41,430
Not well.
They've met.

1472
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:43,927
I try to keep them
Separate.

1473
01:06:44,344 --> 01:06:45,592
Why, in god's name?

1474
01:06:45,592 --> 01:06:50,585
Well, the "other"
Laurie Adler...

1475
01:06:50,585 --> 01:06:56,827
Stole the "friend"
Laurie Adler痴 last name.

1476
01:06:56,827 --> 01:06:58,907
Her real name is smith.

1477
01:06:58,907 --> 01:07:00,155
Hmm.

1478
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:03,484
Why would she do a thing
Like that?

1479
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,148
I don't know.

1480
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:09,310
It's just a very tense
Situation, you know?

1481
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,390
We don't talk about it.

1482
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,886
It's why I keep them separate.

1483
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:15,551
Are you sure you're okay?

1484
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,215
Couldn't be better.

1485
01:07:17,215 --> 01:07:18,464
[ chuckles ]

1486
01:07:18,464 --> 01:07:20,960
Yeah.

1487
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:23,457
Your libation, madam.

1488
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:26,786
Thank you.

1489
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:33,027
Ohh!
A masterpiece.

1490
01:07:33,027 --> 01:07:38,021
I must say, you do know your way
Around a martini, Sam.

1491
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,517
And you would certainly know.

1492
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:42,597
I'm warning you --
Don't start.

1493
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,262
Did I say something?

1494
01:07:44,262 --> 01:07:46,758
You are the most
Insufferable man.

1495
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:48,839
I'm just gonna pretend
You're not even here.

1496
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,087
Is that a promise?

1497
01:07:50,087 --> 01:07:51,335
You know what?
Please, all right?

1498
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:52,999
Please, will you stop?

1499
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:55,080
God, you're worse now than
When you were married.

1500
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,825
What are you talking about?

1501
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,489
We are married.

1502
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:01,737
What did you say?

1503
01:08:02,154 --> 01:08:03,818
We are married.

1504
01:08:04,234 --> 01:08:07,979
We were remarried
Five years ago.

1505
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:09,644
Yeah.

1506
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:22,958
My parents got remarried?

1507
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,207
I'm sorry.

1508
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,288
I just keep thinking you know
Stuff like that.

1509
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,617
Well, I don't.
I I I don't know anything.

1510
01:08:29,617 --> 01:08:30,865
Is she drunk?

1511
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:33,777
I think she must have had
A concussion.

1512
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,274
Did you see that bruise
On her head?

1513
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:39,603
I saw it.
I didn't want to say anything.

1514
01:08:39,603 --> 01:08:40,851
What happened?

1515
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,931
Her car crashed yesterday.

1516
01:08:43,348 --> 01:08:45,428
Oh.
Oh, my goodness.

1517
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:47,924
Well, clearly she's in shock.

1518
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,005
I've never seen her
Like this.

1519
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:52,086
And that bruise
Does look nasty.

1520
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,750
I have a good man for that.

1521
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,663
Frederica, she doesn't need
Cosmetic surgery.

1522
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:02,072
Why would you assume I知
Referring to cosmetic surgery?

1523
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:05,817
I know nothing
About cosmetic surgery.

1524
01:09:05,817 --> 01:09:07,066
Troy: hi, grandma.

1525
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:09,146
Just please calm down.
It'll be okay.

1526
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:10,394
It'll all come back.

1527
01:09:10,394 --> 01:09:12,475
I don't know if I want it
To come back.

1528
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,387
You know, what kind of life
Is this anyway?

1529
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:17,884
I have no job, no money,
No past, nothing.

1530
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,380
You have a family
That loves you.

1531
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:25,373
And you're strangers to me.

1532
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:26,622
I don't even know you.

1533
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:29,118
What kind of life
Is that for you?

1534
01:09:29,118 --> 01:09:31,199
Better than life
Without you.

1535
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:36,608
Um, grandma wants another
Martini...a double.

1536
01:09:36,608 --> 01:09:38,273
Both: tell her dinner's ready.

1537
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:39,521
Okay.

1538
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:42,434
Grandma, dinner's ready.

1539
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,098
[ sighs ]

1540
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:47,011
Some Christmas, huh?

1541
01:09:47,011 --> 01:09:48,260
[ chuckles ]

1542
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,172
Life with you
Is never dull.

1543
01:09:51,172 --> 01:09:54,501
[ whirring ]

1544
01:09:56,997 --> 01:09:59,910
Mommy and me
Made the beans.

1545
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,158
Some for you.

1546
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:02,407
Thank you.

1547
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,071
You're welcome.

1548
01:10:08,648 --> 01:10:10,312
Like to say grace, Jane?

1549
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:13,225
Why would I do that?

1550
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:16,138
You always say grace.

1551
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:18,635
[ sighs ]

1552
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:20,299
Of course I do.

1553
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,547
I knew that.

1554
01:10:23,211 --> 01:10:24,876
Uh, okay.

1555
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:34,446
God, uh, well, I知 not quite
Sure how to thank you

1556
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:40,687
For all the blessings that
You've given me and my family.

1557
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:43,184
Uh, it's been
An interesting Christmas.

1558
01:10:43,601 --> 01:10:45,265
[ chuckles ] full of surprises.

1559
01:10:45,265 --> 01:10:46,513
Wow...

1560
01:10:46,513 --> 01:10:48,594
Really not how I thought
I'd be spending Christmas.

1561
01:10:48,594 --> 01:10:50,674
Actually, nothing like

1562
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:54,003
How I thought I壇 be
Spending Christmas.

1563
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:59,412
It's -- um,
But you're the boss, right?

1564
01:10:59,412 --> 01:11:01,077
You're in charge.

1565
01:11:01,077 --> 01:11:07,734
I'm really grateful,
Uh, for...thy bounty,

1566
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:11,479
Uh, and thy goodness...

1567
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:14,808
For thy...bigness.

1568
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:21,465
For thy leading us not
Into our trespassers

1569
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:25,626
Who lives and reign with
The holy spirit.

1570
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:29,788
Forgive us now and in the hour
Of our need.

1571
01:11:29,788 --> 01:11:32,284
For thine is the kingdom

1572
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:36,861
And the power and the glory
Forever and ever.

1573
01:11:36,861 --> 01:11:41,438
With liberty
And justice for all.

1574
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:44,350
Amen.
Amen. Amen.

1575
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,183
Amen.

1576
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:48,095
That was an unusual prayer.

1577
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,176
I thought it was nice, mom.

1578
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:51,840
Thank you, honey.

1579
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:57,250
This stuffing
Is interesting.

1580
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,747
What did you season it
With?

1581
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:01,411
Ketchup.

1582
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:03,075
Interesting.

1583
01:12:03,075 --> 01:12:04,323
Hmm.

1584
01:12:04,323 --> 01:12:06,820
I think it's great, Jane.

1585
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,901
Thank you, Sam.

1586
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:17,639
Jane, your father told me
About your accident.

1587
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:21,799
Are you sure
You're quite yourself?

1588
01:12:21,799 --> 01:12:23,048
Hmm.
Why would you ask that?

1589
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:25,960
Well, you just seemed
A little off.

1590
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,208
Off?

1591
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,705
You know -- behaving
Erratically.

1592
01:12:29,705 --> 01:12:32,202
You know, like the old Jane.

1593
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:35,947
You know, what exactly was
Wrong with the old Jane?

1594
01:12:35,947 --> 01:12:38,443
I happen to like
The old Jane.

1595
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,691
So did I.

1596
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:42,605
It's just that everybody,
Me included,

1597
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:46,765
And you too, I hope, seem
To like the new Jane better.

1598
01:12:50,095 --> 01:12:50,926
Huh.

1599
01:12:51,343 --> 01:12:53,840
Uh, Sam, could I see you
In the kitchen for a moment?

1600
01:12:54,255 --> 01:12:55,088
What for?

1601
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:56,752
We need to discuss the...
Turkey.

1602
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,000
The turkey's on the table.

1603
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,833
It's a little dry.

1604
01:12:59,248 --> 01:13:00,497
I'm concerned about
The leftovers.

1605
01:13:00,497 --> 01:13:02,161
Can't we talk about it
Later?

1606
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:04,242
We really need to talk
About it now, Sam.

1607
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:08,819
She worries
About the leftovers.

1608
01:13:09,235 --> 01:13:10,483
It's a real thing with her.

1609
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:12,980
Sam, I really need you now.

1610
01:13:13,396 --> 01:13:14,644
Excuse me.

1611
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,134
What is going on with her?

1612
01:13:22,134 --> 01:13:24,214
I told you.
She's gone nuts.

1613
01:13:24,214 --> 01:13:26,295
How dare you call your
Mother nuts!

1614
01:13:26,711 --> 01:13:27,544
Troy's right.

1615
01:13:27,544 --> 01:13:29,623
She doesn't remember
Who we are.

1616
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:31,704
She's still funny
And nice, though.

1617
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,617
Now I知 completely lost.

1618
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,697
Hmm.

1619
01:13:36,697 --> 01:13:39,610
Ketchup?

1620
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,691
Once upon a time,
I could handle things.

1621
01:13:41,691 --> 01:13:43,772
I could remember the past --
My past.

1622
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:45,851
I knew what kind of car
I drove.

1623
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:47,100
I knew my friend's name.

1624
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,180
I could remember a speech
I'd given.

1625
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,677
Now, I can't remember
Anything.

1626
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:53,758
Do you remember yesterday?

1627
01:13:53,758 --> 01:13:54,589
Yes.

1628
01:13:55,006 --> 01:13:56,255
Good.
Well, that's a start.

1629
01:13:56,255 --> 01:13:57,503
We can build on that.

1630
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,583
Now, let's just get
Through dinner,

1631
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:02,079
And then we'll send your
Parents off into the night

1632
01:14:02,496 --> 01:14:03,744
To make each other miserable.

1633
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:04,576
Do you promise?

1634
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:07,072
I promise.

1635
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:08,737
Come on.

1636
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:14,146
Well, we have determined

1637
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:17,475
That the turkey will be just
Fine for the leftovers.

1638
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:20,388
We're all very relieved,
I'm sure.

1639
01:14:24,133 --> 01:14:25,381
Are you two fighting?

1640
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,461
No, George,
Everything's fine.

1641
01:14:27,461 --> 01:14:29,126
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.

1642
01:14:29,126 --> 01:14:29,958
Well, I do.

1643
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,206
Jane...what's all this

1644
01:14:31,206 --> 01:14:34,119
About your not remembering
Your own children?

1645
01:14:36,616 --> 01:14:39,528
[ laughs ] what are you
Talking about?

1646
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:42,441
They said you didn't know
Who they were.

1647
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:46,186
Jane...darling, are you
Suffering memory loss?

1648
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:49,515
Are you having
Some strange episode?

1649
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:51,179
[ sighs ] look, mother,

1650
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:55,340
I just really haven't been
Myself the last couple of days.

1651
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,253
Apparently not.
Your father's right.

1652
01:14:58,253 --> 01:15:00,749
You're acting
Like the old Jane.

1653
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:04,494
Just what is that supposed
To mean?

1654
01:15:04,494 --> 01:15:05,743
Emotional...erratic.

1655
01:15:05,743 --> 01:15:08,239
Oh, as if you are some model
Of emotional stability?

1656
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,152
That's exactly the kind of thing
The old Jane would say.

1657
01:15:11,152 --> 01:15:12,400
There is no new Jane!
Okay?

1658
01:15:12,817 --> 01:15:13,648
I am the old Jane.

1659
01:15:13,648 --> 01:15:15,313
And you know what?
I like her.

1660
01:15:15,313 --> 01:15:17,393
She had a-a life.
She was successful.

1661
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,058
She had a great job.

1662
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:20,722
Which you foolishly quit.

1663
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:22,386
Frederica,
You're not helping.

1664
01:15:22,386 --> 01:15:24,051
You hated that job.

1665
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:27,379
It doesn't matter!
At least I knew who I was.

1666
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:31,124
Now I wake up to find
I'm some weird combination

1667
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:34,453
Of -- of Betty Crocker
And Mother Teresa.

1668
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,118
It's just not me!

1669
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:39,447
If this is about resuming
Your career,

1670
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:41,527
I say it's high time!

1671
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:44,024
It's a shame to see you keep
Wasting your talents.

1672
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,272
Frederica...

1673
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:46,521
I've never understood

1674
01:15:46,521 --> 01:15:49,433
Why you and Sam have felt
Personally responsible

1675
01:15:49,433 --> 01:15:50,681
For saving the world.

1676
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:51,930
Well, somebody has to.

1677
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,594
That's all well and fine,

1678
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:55,675
But does it mean that you
And the children

1679
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:56,923
Have to live like paupers?

1680
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:58,171
Frederica...

1681
01:15:58,171 --> 01:16:01,500
I have no problem
With saving the whales,

1682
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,413
But to throw away everything
You had

1683
01:16:04,413 --> 01:16:06,909
For these fuzzy
Little ideals --

1684
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:08,990
Frederica, will you shut up?

1685
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:14,399
Excuse me?
What did you say to me?

1686
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:16,063
I said to shut up!

1687
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,392
Well, I never.

1688
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,472
No, you probably haven't.

1689
01:16:21,472 --> 01:16:23,553
If you'd listen to your
Daughter,

1690
01:16:23,969 --> 01:16:26,465
You'd know that
This has nothing to do

1691
01:16:26,465 --> 01:16:28,130
With her job or her career.

1692
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:31,458
You know, when she was young
And successful,

1693
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:35,203
You used to badger her to find
The right man and settle down.

1694
01:16:35,203 --> 01:16:38,117
Now, I don't know
If I知 the right man,

1695
01:16:38,117 --> 01:16:41,862
But when we married and started
A family -- a great family --

1696
01:16:41,862 --> 01:16:44,358
You told her she was
Wasting her life.

1697
01:16:44,358 --> 01:16:46,438
Don't you see?
She can't win with you.

1698
01:16:46,438 --> 01:16:47,271
That's not true!

1699
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,519
Jane has had some problems,

1700
01:16:48,519 --> 01:16:50,183
And she needs to work
Through them.

1701
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,680
But what she doesn't need
Is you passing judgment.

1702
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,760
Either old Jane or new Jane --

1703
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,673
To me, they're the same person,
And I love them both.

1704
01:16:59,754 --> 01:17:03,914
So with all due respect,
My darling mother-in-law,

1705
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:06,828
I suggest we just drop
The whole thing

1706
01:17:06,828 --> 01:17:08,907
And finish our dinner.

1707
01:17:08,907 --> 01:17:11,821
Or...I could just leave
Right now.

1708
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:14,317
That would be fine, too.

1709
01:17:14,317 --> 01:17:19,311
I have never been treated
So rudely in my entire life.

1710
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:21,807
There's a first time
For everything.

1711
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:28,465
Come on, George.
We're leaving.

1712
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:37,618
Bye, grandma.

1713
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:43,028
Nice Christmas.

1714
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:45,941
But I知 still eating.

1715
01:17:45,941 --> 01:17:48,437
Get a doggie bag!

1716
01:17:48,437 --> 01:17:49,270
[ door opens ]

1717
01:17:49,686 --> 01:17:51,350
I guess we'll be going.

1718
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,431
Merry Christmas,
Everybody.

1719
01:17:53,846 --> 01:17:54,679
Goodbye, kids.

1720
01:17:54,679 --> 01:17:55,927
Bye, grandpa.

1721
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,658
One thing you can say
About our family --

1722
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:11,739
Our Christmases
Are never dull.

1723
01:18:11,739 --> 01:18:14,652
Daddy, you don't have to leave.
Neither does mother.

1724
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:16,732
Well, I think
It's time we get going.

1725
01:18:17,148 --> 01:18:17,981
Call it a hunch.

1726
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:19,645
I hope she isn't too angry.

1727
01:18:19,645 --> 01:18:21,725
Ah, don't worry.
She'll be fine.

1728
01:18:21,725 --> 01:18:24,222
This kind of thing keeps
Her blood pumping.

1729
01:18:24,638 --> 01:18:25,470
It's good for her.

1730
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,550
Well, merry Christmas,
Sweetie.

1731
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:28,799
[ smooches ]

1732
01:18:28,799 --> 01:18:29,631
Merry Christmas.

[ door opens, closes ]

1734
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:42,946
Uh...you kids finish eating.

1735
01:18:42,946 --> 01:18:45,027
I'll be right back.

1736
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:50,852
Want to make a wish?

1737
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,101
Sure.

1738
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:12,073
Temperature's dropping.

1739
01:19:12,073 --> 01:19:14,986
Feels like
It might snow again.

1740
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:23,308
You told my mother
To shut up.

1741
01:19:23,308 --> 01:19:25,388
Yeah, I guess I did.

1742
01:19:25,388 --> 01:19:27,885
Probably not
My finest moment.

1743
01:19:27,885 --> 01:19:29,550
No, I thought it was great.

1744
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,878
I've been wanting to do
That my whole life.

1745
01:19:32,878 --> 01:19:35,374
[ chuckles ]

1746
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:41,200
No one has ever stood up
For me before like that.

1747
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,697
Well,
I was happy to oblige.

1748
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,778
It's the least I could do.

1749
01:19:46,193 --> 01:19:49,522
Did you mean
What you said in there?

1750
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:53,267
Telling your mom to shut up?
Of course I did.

1751
01:19:53,267 --> 01:20:00,340
About loving the new Jane
As well as the old Jane.

1752
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:03,669
With all my heart.

1753
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:06,582
Even the Jane that can't
Remember our life together?

1754
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:09,911
All of the above.

1755
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:12,408
Sam.

1756
01:20:31,548 --> 01:20:32,796
Hmm.

1757
01:20:32,796 --> 01:20:34,461
Oh, I just feel
Kind of dizzy.

1758
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:36,125
Yeah, I have that effect
On women.

1759
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,374
No, I知 not kidding.

1760
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,038
There's -- there's
Something wrong.

1761
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:40,286
It's really wrong.

1762
01:20:40,286 --> 01:20:41,118
Are you okay?

1763
01:20:41,534 --> 01:20:42,783
No, I知 just kind of --

1764
01:20:42,783 --> 01:20:44,447
[ horn honks ]

1765

[ tires screech ]

1766
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:49,857
I hate Christmas.

1767
01:20:51,105 --> 01:20:54,017
Our future is great.
Everything coming up roses.

1768

[ tires screech ]

1769
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:56,514
Was it love at first sight?

1770
01:20:56,514 --> 01:20:58,178
You said
That you always loved me.

[ tires screech ]

1772
01:20:59,843 --> 01:21:00,675
