The_Party_(1968) ,BR_MKV_H264(MGM,Eng,Ita,Rus,Fre,Chi) 1280x544

2
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,940
All right. Cut it.

3
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,340
All right. Hold it.

4
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,930
What is that idiot doin'?

5
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660
What's that idiot doing?

6
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,470
- I just asked the same question.
 -What's the answer?

7
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,840
I don't know.
 I didn't tell him to--

8
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,270
Don't know?
 Look, you're the director.

9
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,040
It was your idea to bring him
 over here from India.

10
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,050
Now, you'd better start
 telling him what to do...

11
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,270
or we're gonna be
 out of business. Now, go ahead.

12
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,790
Come on.

13
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,520
-Charlie.
 -Yeah?

14
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,100
You ready? Action!

15
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,900
Cut, damn it! Cut!

16
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,110
-Mr. Bakshi.
 -Yes, sir.

17
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,610
Has it occurred to you...

18
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,550
that the period
 of our picture is 1878?

19
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,310
Yes, indeed, sir.
 I am well aware...

20
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,080
that that is the period
 of the film. 1878.

21
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,950
Mr. Bakshi,
 are you also aware...

22
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,220
that in 1878 they weren't
 wearing underwater watches?

23
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,390
Yes, sir. I know that.
 They had not even been invented.

24
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,920
You got the time?

25
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,860
Yes, it's...oh, my God.

26
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,920
All right.
 Lunch everybody.

27
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,100
That's forty-two on the crew,
 one hour for the cast.

28
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,210
OK, guys.
 The cue for the demolition...

29
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,740
is when I lower my hand
 like this, OK?

30
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,880
-Yes, sir.
 -Guys, we got one shot at this.

31
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,820
Let's get it right.

32
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,010
OK, Kenny. Let's go.

33
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,390
All right. Places everybody.

34
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,320
Marty. Look, I just talked
 to Clutterbuck on the phone.

35
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,490
He says if we don't wrap this
 location today, it's your neck.

36
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,260
No problem. All we have left
 is to blow up the fort.

37
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,700
OK. Great.

38
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,540
OK, Ken. Let's go.

39
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,970
All right. Carol. Earl.

40
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,270
All right. Stand by.

41
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,290
You.

42
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,470
Yes, you.

43
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,910
You get off of my set
 and get out of my picture.

44
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,010
Off. Out. You're through.

45
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,950
You're washed up.
 You're finished.

46
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,920
I'll see to it you never
 make another movie again!

47
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,420
Does that include
 television, sir?

48
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,520
I'll kill him !

49
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,840
Mr. Divot calling
 from location on six.

50
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,070
All right.

51
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,610
Yeah, Charlie.

52
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,250
What?

53
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,720
The whole damn thing?

54
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,660
Well, how the hell could
 a thing like that happen?

55
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,220
What's his name?

56
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,460
Spell it!

57
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,760
Hrundi V.

58
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,900
B-a-k-s-h-i.

59
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,930
I'll see to it he never
 works again in this town.

60
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,450
Your wife called about
 the guest list for the party.

61
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,880
Yeah, on the desk.
 You know where to reach me.

62
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,900
I need an address
 for Hrundi V. Bakshi.

63
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,970
B-a-k-s-h-i.

64
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,810
Hello.

65
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,320
Vodka or scotch, sir?

66
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,540
No. l...

67
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,480
I never touch it.
 Thank you.

68
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,190
Twenty-week layoff
 that you've never seen--

69
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,490
No, thank you.

70
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
Hors d'oeuvres, sir?

71
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,700
Well, I'm on a diet,
 but the hell with it.

72
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,400
-Pool.
 -Pool.

73
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,570
-Pool is water, no?
 -No, billiards.

74
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,780
Says the father,
 "Oh, my goodness.

75
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,540
"We got the wrong baby,"
 and the father says...

76
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,350
"Shh. It's a better buggy."

77
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,550
I never heard that one before.

78
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,360
Oh, yes. You...

79
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I missed the middle part,
 but I can tell from the way...

80
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,460
that you are
 enjoying yourselves...

81
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,490
it must have been
 a very humorous anecdote...

82
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,030
because the way
 you are laughing...

83
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,670
just shows how much
 you enjoyed it.

84
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,940
I love a good laugh, don't you?
 It makes the world go round.

85
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,680
It's good to have a laugh.
 Wonderful.

86
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,720
Very good.

87
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,960
I shall remember that one.

88
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,440
They were bound and gagged
 for six hours.

89
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,030
They took everything...

90
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,200
even the gold watch
 my daddy'd left me.

91
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,910
They took the gold watch
 that your father left you?

92
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm sorry.

93
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,110
It is utterly fantastic.

94
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,550
What a wonderful thing
 for anyone to do.

95
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,780
Take everything,
 including the father's watch.

96
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
It's wonderful.

97
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,990
I tell you, tonight
 is one big round of laughter.

98
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,860
All fun and laughter.

99
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,430
The congressman
 was just telling us...

100
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,030
about the time he was robbed.

101
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,700
Who's the foreigner?

102
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,340
I don't know.

103
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,650
Someone my mixed-up wife
 invited.

104
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,910
Oh, dear.

105
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,550
Hello, dog.
 What do you want?

106
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,220
What do you want, eh?
 You like my feet, do you?

107
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,730
Have your fill, and away you go.

108
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,630
Feet are considered a delicacy
 among certain animals.

109
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,600
Go on, you've had enough now.
 Off. Chow!

110
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,400
In fact, there are
 certain man-eating animals...

111
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,930
who will eat only the feet,
 leave everything else.

112
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,240
Would not touch one other thing.

113
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,770
Get away. Down, now.
 Chow, dog.

114
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,080
Get away.

115
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,610
Get away from me, dog.

116
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,910
Vodka or scotch, sir?

117
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,940
Get away.
 No, thank you.

118
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,180
Get away.

119
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,900
Oh, good evening, Mr. Divot.
 How are you?

120
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,560
How are ya?

121
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,270
Smile, baby.

122
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,570
Good evening, General.

123
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,410
I'd like to have you meet
 Miss Michele Monet.

124
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,240
Mr. Clutterbuck,
 Mrs. Clutterbuck.

125
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,550
How are ya, Alice?

126
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,080
I'll introduce my guests,
 if I may.

127
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,450
Here, Mrs. Dunphy.

128
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,150
I've heard some wonderful things
 about you.

129
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,300
Well, sir, you seem to have
 a wonderful party going here.

130
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,300
-How do you like it so far?
 -Fine.

131
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,640
Have a drink. Go ahead.

132
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,290
-Hello.
 -Oh, hello.

133
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,300
And good evening.

134
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,700
Good evening.

135
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,500
What a beautiful evening it is.

136
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,800
To be sure.

137
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,670
What's in there?

138
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,410
What, in here?

139
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,520
Oh, there is nothing in there.

140
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,910
Yes, there is.

141
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
I don't know.
 I don't think so.

142
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,220
-Let's see now. No.
 -Don't you see it?

143
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,200
No, there is definitely
 nothing in there.

144
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,170
If there were something,
 it's gone away now, anyway.

145
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,860
Well, I can see it.

146
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,470
What is it?

147
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,110
I don't know,
 but I don't like it.

148
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,130
Pardon me, sir.

149
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,650
It's quite all right, fella.

150
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,320
I'm so sorry.
 I beg your pardon.

151
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,270
Come on over here, honey.
 We'll...try it over here.

152
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,070
Right here, on the corner.
 This is an easy shot now.

153
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,330
First things first.
 Get in the saddle.

154
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,460
Just like I taught you,
 that's it.

155
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,870
No, I feel silly because--

156
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,470
Oh, no, hon,
 you can do it this way.

157
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,910
I was here the other day.

158
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,850
Now, just relax, and you--

159
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,380
Just relax. Just--

160
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,750
Pay no attention to me, sir.
 I am merely spectating.

161
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,280
Oh. Fine.

162
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,350
I can see that you are
 an experienced player.

163
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,990
One of the best, feller.

164
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,490
Sir, excuse me.

165
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,160
What is the name of a game...

166
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,690
that has a multitude
 of colored balls like that?

167
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,290
-Pool.
 -Poo?

168
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,630
-What?
 -Poo?

169
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,470
No, not poo. Pool.

170
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,990
-Pool!
 -Pool.

171
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,010
-Oh, like swimming pool.
 -You got it, honey.

172
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,770
I never heard of
 a game called poo.

173
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,040
Fine game.

174
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,480
And so,
 what is the object of it--

175
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,500
to disperse these colored balls
 strategically around the table?

176
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,180
Get the balls in the holes.
 All except for the white one.

177
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh, that is the art?

178
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,250
The art is not
 to have the white one in?

179
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,280
-Right.
 -Good.

180
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,760
And how many people can play?
 One, two, three, or what?

181
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,850
Oh, whole bunches,
 or twos and threes.

182
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,420
With a group--
 groups of people can play.

183
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,830
By yourself. Yes.

184
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,490
Thank goodness.
 How wonderful.

185
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,160
Keep your eye
 on the white ball--

186
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,270
Oh, excuse me.

187
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,010
Excuse me, sir, but...

188
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,350
you are, are you not...

189
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,050
Wyoming Bill Kelso,
 the famous film star?

190
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,750
That's me, in the flesh.

191
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,050
Oh, God,
 what a moment in my life.

192
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,350
Oh, sir, I've seen
 every one of your films.

193
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,620
Oh, well, that's wonderful!

194
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,630
What a wonderful,
 strong grip you've got.

195
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,830
Yes, I do.

196
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,270
My goodness, I would
 have been disappointed...

197
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,930
if you hadn't crushed my hand.

198
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,230
Oh, listen.
 Will you do me the honor...

199
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,500
to sign me an autograph?

200
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,200
Oh, sure. Here, hold this.
 I'll be glad to.

201
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,940
I am also in the acting
 profession, you know.

202
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,000
-Oh, you are?
 -Yes, indeed.

203
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,010
I am not in your quality,
 but I was around.

204
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,020
Well, what's your name?

205
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,680
Hrundi. H-r-u-n-d-i.

206
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,450
Wait till I tell them
 at home that I met him.

207
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,650
They'll never believe me.

208
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,660
-Where you from?
 - I am from India.

209
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,520
Got you covered, Injun!

210
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,090
How do you--
 Bang! Howdy, pardner.

211
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,720
Well, I'm pretty quick
 on the draw there, right?

212
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,160
Never I believe
 in all my whole life...

213
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,570
I would meet him, and he
 would go, "Bang, pardner!"

214
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
Listen to me.

215
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,770
"White man speak
 with, uh, forked tongue!"

216
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,570
And look, mmm-mmm...

217
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,480
You old horned toad, buddy!

218
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,910
Cute little feller, isn't he?

219
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,420
I know all your sayings.
 I know all of them.

220
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,480
Good. Hrundi, say hello--

221
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,920
The one where you walk along,
 and then you go--

222
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,010
Hrundi, say hello
 to Signorina here.

223
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,290
Hello, partner.

224
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,950
Piacere.

225
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,550
Bakshi.

226
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,690
-There you go.
 -Oh, thank you.

227
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,490
This is a wonderful thing
 you have done for me.

228
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,690
My pleasure.

229
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,830
Thank you, and I will--
 thank you.

230
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,930
I would love to say
 that it has been...

231
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,070
the greatest moment in my life.

232
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,940
Bang! Aha, got you!
 I was quick on the draw.

233
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,840
You beat me that time, pal.
 That's right.

234
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,040
-Goodness me.
 -Lots of luck to you.

235
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,740
And the same to you, sir.

236
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,860
Howdy, pardner!

237
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,160
That was so groovy.

238
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,170
-That was a short dance.
 -That's right.

239
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
And they don't go on
 for long, do they?

240
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,110
-No, they don't.
 -Yes, we just started, and--

241
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,440
Well, anyway,
 thank you very much.

242
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,630
Thank you.

243
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,040
Perhaps we can
 dance again later.

244
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,310
If your carnet du bal
 is not full up.

245
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,210
Oh, I'd love to.
 Thank you.

246
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,890
What is that ring
 on your finger, chopped liver?

247
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,030
Hello, Polly.

248
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,700
Pretty one.

249
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,570
Hello.

250
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,100
Would you like--

251
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,200
Would you like
 some food, Polly?

252
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,070
Pretty Polly.

253
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,440
Where is the--oh.

254
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,820
Birdie num num.

255
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,150
-Hello.
 -Birdie num num.

256
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,490
Have birdie num num.

257
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,020
-Go on.
 -There were four of us.

258
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,890
Four, yes.

259
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,190
I'll give you a num num.

260
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,570
He's having
 the birdie num nums.

261
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,410
Sure, look.
 He's waiting for more num num.

262
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,010
All gone.
 Num num is gone.

263
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,490
Pretty Polly.

264
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,850
Num-num.

265
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,880
Birdie num-num.

266
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,450
What in the world is that?

267
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,690
I can't imagine.

268
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,430
Howdy, partner.

269
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,930
What is that?!

270
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,600
What is that?

271
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,080
Would you mind getting--

272
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,130
This is 469-6151.

273
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,270
Please remain connected
 to the telephone.

274
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,670
There is a call for you, sir.

275
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,770
Please hold on
 to the connection.

276
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,910
Please, one second.

277
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,390
I wonder if you could--

278
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,850
Let me hold here.

279
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,910
Could you just let my hand go?

280
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,520
You've got my hand.
 Thank you.

281
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,990
Now I take this from you.

282
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,590
Hold on one moment.

283
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh. Excuse the mess up here.
 It is birdie num-nums.

284
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,800
Put them under my feet.

285
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,140
Look. Just one second.

286
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,510
If you can take this
 around you...

287
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,350
Just lift the ashtray, please.

288
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,480
You're--you--

289
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes. Thank you.

290
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,900
Oh, Benny.

291
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,930
Yeah, well,
 I'm having a few people in.

292
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,300
The picture?

293
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,870
It was going fine until
 some idiot blew up the set.

294
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,250
Vodka or scotch, sir?

295
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,450
No, nothing, thank you.

296
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,610
This picture's a very good one.

297
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,380
- Is it?
 -It's gonna be great.

298
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,410
-Caviar?
 -No, thank you.

299
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,430
-Sir?
 - I don't think so. Thanks.

300
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,910
Eat, eh?

301
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,740
Oh, eat.

302
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,010
Sure, honey, we're gonna eat...

303
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,680
but they gotta ring
 the little bell first.

304
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,080
Bell?

305
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,710
Bell. Dingy dingy.

306
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,420
Ding?

307
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,220
But first, let's have
 a little tiddly at the bar.

308
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,730
-Hello.
 -Oh, howdy, little buddy.

309
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,260
That's my old cowboy crusher.
 Injun grip.

310
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,790
Oh, you really crushed
 my old Indian hand.

311
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,400
Sorta smarts, don't it?

312
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,380
Friendliest little critter
 I ever met.

313
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,980
It's an honor to have
 had my hand crushed...

314
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,610
by Wyoming Bill Kelso.

315
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,090
Wait till I tell them back home.

316
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,300
Can't...

317
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,750
Pardon me.

318
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,050
It's OK.

319
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,260
Hello.

320
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,470
Hello.

321
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh, it was occupied.

322
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,800
-Hrundi V. Bakshi.
 -Pardon?

323
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,250
That is what my name is called.

324
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,080
Oh! Michele Monet.

325
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,950
Oh, how do you do?

326
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,420
Are you having a good time?

327
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,580
Good.

328
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,990
Are you having a good time?

329
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,120
Oh, yes.
 I am having a good time.

330
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,690
It's good to be
 having a good time.

331
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,770
You're an actress?

332
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,270
Oh, yes. I can tell.

333
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,800
Oh? How?

334
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,400
Because I am an actor.

335
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,610
Actors can tell when
 actresses are actresses.

336
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,010
It is a thing
 that we have together.

337
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,480
You are also French.
 I know that.

338
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,510
-How do you know that?
 -Well, your name...

339
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,950
and also the way you
 are speaking English.

340
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,050
Oh, that's right.
 Do you speak French?

341
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,120
Well, just enough
 to get myself into trouble.

342
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,320
I'll tell you what I can say.

343
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,990
Ou est la direction
 de la Tour Eiffel...

344
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,260
s'il vous plait?

345
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,730
-That's pretty good.
 -Thanks.

346
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,570
-You do speak French.
 -You speak Hindustani?

347
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,900
Well, you're not
 missing anything.

348
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,460
Oh, dear.

349
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,070
I am here at the moment
 taking part...

350
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,870
in Mr. General Clutterbuck's...

351
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,000
latest motion picture
 extravaganza.

352
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,450
Oh, that's wonderful.

353
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,710
It is a main featured role...

354
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,340
and I am very glad
 to have the opportunity...

355
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,650
to come here and do it.

356
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,750
-Congratulations.
 -Thank you.

357
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,450
You are doing something
 in a movie?

358
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,120
Working on a movie?

359
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,600
But next week I'm doing
 a test for Mr. Divot.

360
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh, Mr. Divot.

361
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,230
-What?
 -Oh, listen, l--

362
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,760
OK, let's get to the bar.

363
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,070
-Mr. Divot, how do you do?
 -Yeah, right, fella.

364
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,170
Good-bye.

365
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,770
Who is that guy?

366
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,970
A very nice man...

367
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,510
with a completely
 unpronounceable name.

368
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,020
I know him from someplace.
 Well, how are you, General?

369
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,420
Remember
 Miss Michele Monet here?

370
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
Have you heard her sing yet?
 We're giving her a test.

371
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,620
She sings like a bird--
 a nightingale.

372
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,750
Fine. I'll look forward to that.

373
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,990
We're going over to the bar
 to have a little nippy.

374
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,810
-Dinner is served.
 -Good.

375
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,320
Dinner is served.

376
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,280
Alice, do you know
 where Miss Monet is sitting?

377
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,650
Right around here, dear.

378
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,810
Excuse me for a minute,
 sweetheart.

379
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,340
Dear.
 I believe you're over there.

380
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,510
Right down there.

381
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,910
Here. Bakshi, right?

382
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,110
Oh, yes. Mr. Bakshi.

383
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,710
There's no chair.

384
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,880
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck,
 everybody needs to move over.

385
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Darling, would you mind
 moving up just one?

386
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,420
Hey, fella! I believe
 you've got my tiddly, there.

387
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,490
I'm sorry, darling.

388
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,090
You're gonna have to move back.
 A mistake.

389
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm awfully sorry.

390
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,500
Levinson, will you get
 the gentleman a chair?

391
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,470
No, it was a mistake.

392
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,470
He's going to bring you a chair,
 and then you'll be all right.

393
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,030
All right? Good.

394
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,190
My goodness! What happened
 to your little face?

395
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,450
Nothing, except that it is...

396
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,860
somewhat nearer
 to the table now.

397
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,660
My chair is lower
 than your chair.

398
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,710
Do you like the strawberry soup?

399
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,680
Oh, strawberry soup.
 I haven't had it lately.

400
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,270
Lovely in the summer,
 don't you think?

401
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,750
Yes, it's--oh.

402
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,250
It's lovely right now.

403
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,280
Good. I'm so glad.

404
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,300
Hey, give me some of that,
 will you, pal?

405
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,070
How's the chow?

406
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,370
It's excellent.

407
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,960
No wine, please.

408
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,660
Please, no wine.

409
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,800
I know you would
 like me to have it...

410
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,370
but I don't want it.

411
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,140
All right. I don't drink.
 I don't smoke. No wine.

412
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,310
Are you all right?

413
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,500
I'm so sorry.

414
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
Yes, I will be
 perfectly all right.

415
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,070
I won't be in anybody's way.

416
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,280
Now, you're sure
 you're comfortable?

417
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,370
Absolutely. I'm getting
 out of the way here...

418
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,080
then the door won't bang me.

419
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,550
All right. Excuse me.

420
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,950
They should be finished
 with the soup by now.

421
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,590
Get the plates.

422
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,340
Mrs. Clutterbuck...
 shall I serve the salad?

423
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,890
Excuse me, what are you doing?!

424
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,600
Get in the kitchen.

425
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,910
That is just outside Bombay.

426
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,340
And Bombay is in India?

427
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,750
Oh, that is very much
 in India, yes, indeed.

428
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,270
And that is indeed
 the gateway to India.

429
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,510
When all--

430
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,220
I think that one
 of these bearers...

431
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,060
does not like
 the other one.

432
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,190
You have a very hard time
 finding good help these days.

433
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,430
Yes, you certainly do.

434
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,310
Did you ever hear the one
 about the trapeze artist...

435
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,500
who got divorced?

436
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,870
Caught his wife in the act.

437
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,870
That's terribly funny.

438
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,940
Yeah, it's been terribly funny
 for about twenty years.

439
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,470
Please, no more drinking.

440
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,210
Gore, are you sure
 it's all right?

441
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,250
It's not all right.
 It's divine.

442
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,900
You are too kind.

443
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,500
If you want to keep
 the women's vote...

444
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,470
you've got to start
 with education.

445
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,840
That's where
 you spend the most--

446
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,470
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck.

447
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,340
Please, can I take
 this opportunity...

448
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,940
to apologize to you formally...

449
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,710
for what happened
 at the dining room table.

450
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,550
Oh, my dear, just forget it.
 It wasn't your fault.

451
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,990
Thank God.
 What embarrassment.

452
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,180
Oh, I know.

453
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,390
It was that ridiculous
 little chair they put you on.

454
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,050
It was awful,
 but at the same time...

455
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,360
I feel that it is my
 duty to say this to you.

456
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,990
I just think we should all
 forget all about it.

457
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,190
Indeed, you are right...

458
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,830
but before that I would
 also go to your husband...

459
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,270
and say to him that I'm sorry.

460
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,070
Oh, that's not necessary.
 Really.

461
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,370
It's on my conscience.

462
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,470
Well, if you want to, go ahead.

463
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,500
-Thank you.
 -All right.

464
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,080
It's a wonderful story.

465
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,930
General, excellent aroma.

466
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,870
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

467
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,100
I still have a few left over
 from the pre-Castro days.

468
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,270
General Clutterbuck.

469
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,800
Sir.

470
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,710
Please, I would like
 to formally apologize to you...

471
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,740
for any inconvenience
 that I may have caused you...

472
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,800
or your guests
 at the dining room table.

473
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,210
It's understandable.

474
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,810
I'm very sorry, and it
 will never happen again...

475
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,010
should you wish to have me
 on your list of guests...

476
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,220
on some other occasion.

477
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,420
It's all right.

478
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,080
When I saw what havoc
 that I wrought...

479
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,360
my poor old knees went to water.

480
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,920
-God, what a state I was in.
 -Yes, I can imagine.

481
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,630
But now that I have
 apologized to you--

482
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,890
It's all right.

483
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,400
Spoken to your good lady,
 and I've told her, sir...

484
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,770
that it is a terrible thing
 to have happened...

485
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,200
and I'm sorry.

486
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,570
-Deep down inside.
 -Enjoy yourself.

487
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:06,770
-Thank you.
 -Enjoy.

488
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:09,040
Thank you for listening to me.

489
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,310
It's all right.

490
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,680
General, about this Wac.

491
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,580
I asked her to go out
 with me one night.

492
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,810
A Wac?

493
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,550
She was a buck sergeant, too.

494
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,950
We were going down Manila Bay.

495
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,040
Brandy or creme de cocoa, sir?

496
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,950
Oh, beg your pardon.

497
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,120
It's all right.

498
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,360
It is occupied.

499
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,240
Speak Hindustani?

500
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,420
Oh, excuse me, please.

501
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,200
Hey, close the door, man.

502
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,790
Look, I told the General
 you were gonna sing.

503
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,990
Well, I'd rather not
 do it tonight.

504
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,660
Why not?

505
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,830
The orchestra is gone.

506
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,840
Well, there's a guitar.
 You play the guitar?

507
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,170
All right, then you play
 the guitar and you sing.

508
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,440
That's all, honey.

509
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,910
Hey, waiter, come over here.

510
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,510
Look, you're gonna be a smash.
 Don't worry about a thing.

511
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,710
Come here.

512
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,270
See that guitar?
 Go get it.

513
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,650
Get the guitar.

514
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,700
Nothing to lose

515
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,770
If we are wise

516
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:33,220
We're not expecting
 rainbow-colored skies

517
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,880
Not right away

518
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:46,890
Nothing to lose,
 it might be fun

519
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:55,170
No talk of spending
 lifetimes in the sun

520
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,160
Although we may

521
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:07,670
Both you and I have seen
 what time can do

522
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,780
We'll only hurt ourselves

523
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:18,520
If we build dreams
 that don't come true

524
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,330
What can we lose?

525
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:25,230
We know the score

526
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,500
Let's wait before we talk

527
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,770
Of evermore

528
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:38,110
One day we may

529
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,280
Nothing to lose,
 but much to gain

530
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:50,920
If love decides to stay

531
00:59:55,530 --> 01:00:03,900
Both you and I have seen
 what time can do

532
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,140
We'll only hurt ourselves

533
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:13,670
If we build dreams
 that don't come true

534
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,620
What can we lose?

535
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,880
We know the score

536
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,590
Let's wait before we talk

537
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:30,190
Of evermore

538
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:34,330
One day we may

539
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:39,170
Nothing to lose,
 but much to gain

540
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:47,240
If love decides to stay

541
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,620
Nothing to lose

542
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,920
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

543
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,490
Well, how do you like her,
 General?

544
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,530
-All right. Very good.
 -How do you like her, Bernie?

545
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,060
She's great!

546
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,540
I think she's really great.

547
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,910
Hi.

548
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,500
All right, you win, partner.

549
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,430
I'm telling you, he loved you.
 He thought you were terrific.

550
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,960
We talked about it after
 you finished the number.

551
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,270
He was very impressed.

552
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,470
He thought you were
 beautiful, you know?

553
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,410
So tomorrow will be
 just a formality, the test.

554
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,930
We want to see what you
 look like on film, that's all.

555
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,950
Trust me.
 Will you just trust me?

556
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,610
Here, we can talk.
 It's a little quieter in here.

557
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,550
Oh, Charlie,
 this is the bedroom.

558
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,640
Oh, this is the bedroom.

559
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,980
Come on,
 let's sit over there, baby.

560
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,950
- I wanna tell you something.
 -Why don't we go downstairs?

561
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,390
Too much noise downstairs.
 Let's just sit on the bed. Sit.

562
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,910
Look, why do you think
 I brought you to the party?

563
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,950
Let's sit down. That's it.
 That's a good girl.

564
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,820
It's what I brought you
 to the party for.

565
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,420
Just one little kiss.

566
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,460
Don't do that.
 Let's go. Charlie!

567
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,370
-Give me my gun.
 -Thank you, partner.

568
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,640
Where you going?

569
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,340
Attention!

570
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,810
Oh, God.

571
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,510
Just forget it.

572
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,690
Knock it off and hit the sack!

573
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,800
Cookie!

574
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,130
Wait.

575
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,460
Who's in the head?

576
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,850
Help! Somebody!

577
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,520
Help, anybody!

578
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,830
Please, come and help me.
 Somebody's in the pool.

579
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,160
Honey, what can I do for you?

580
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,600
-Hurry up, please. It's--
 -Oh, hey, little buddy!

581
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,600
American aid, partner.

582
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,770
Great night for a dip.
 You know that little fella...

583
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:43,300
just has a heap of talent
 wherever he goes.

584
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,870
He's drowning?
 Buddy, you drowning?

585
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,840
Great leapin' pollywogs,
 that little gal can swim !

586
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,050
Get him, gal!
 Grab him by the wigwam !

587
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,520
I'll wait right here for ya!

588
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,220
Come on, honey,
 bring him over here.

589
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,880
Get ahold of him.
 Get out of there.

590
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:02,390
Here we go.
 Come on, little buddy.

591
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:21,070
Bartender, we've been fishin'.

592
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,310
Caught ourselves
 a little Injun here.

593
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,540
Oh, God, he's gonna catch
 a death of cold.

594
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,980
Oh, no, I don't drink.

595
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,880
Come on. Good, just a little.

596
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,720
There we go.
 Right down the old hatch.

597
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,220
There you go, that'll
 straighten you right out.

598
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,660
You'll feel better, huh?

599
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:37,180
-But I don't drink.
 -You need a little more.

600
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,700
There you go, huh?

601
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,890
That straighten you out
 all right?

602
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,090
How 'bout a little more?

603
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:42,390
No, I'm perfectly all right now.

604
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,030
All right, good.

605
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,470
Oh, up! Got him.

606
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,100
Looks like little buddy
 went bye-bye.

607
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,900
Get ahold of him, Bill.
 You got him?

608
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,500
Hang on, here we go!

609
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,270
Poor darling, I'm so sorry.

610
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,710
You stay there and, well,
 I don't know what we can do.

611
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,940
But perhaps we can
 at least dry it out for you.

612
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:02,210
Oh, dear, honestly.

613
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,940
Come in!

614
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,420
This tie looks like
 a salamander's tongue...

615
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,050
that got stepped on.
 Oh, hiya, honey.

616
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:10,250
Is he all right?

617
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,520
Oh, he's all right.
 He's just a little wet.

618
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,120
You got some dry duds
 we can put on him?

619
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,650
Oh, surely, yes.
 I'll get something of Fred's.

620
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,960
I sure would appreciate that.

621
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,690
Here, darling, put this on him.

622
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,260
Oh, thank you
 very much, ma'am.

623
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,870
I love the wet clothes!
 Thank you for a marvelous party!

624
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,100
Let's go, buddy.

625
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,370
Fred, darling, I had
 to loan him your terry.

626
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,750
He's soaking wet.
 This is hers, not his.

627
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,450
Oh, and, darling, do hurry

628
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,480
because the Russians
 will be here any minute!

629
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,680
The Russians?

630
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,090
The dancers, darling,
 the ballet.

631
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,960
Come on, sidekick.

632
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,170
Now, what's--
 Kelso, would you mind?

633
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,570
What are you doing up there?

634
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,770
- I am not doing anything.
 -You're wetting the bed.

635
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,780
- I'm not wetting the bed.
 -Yes, you are. It's wet.

636
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,280
My clothes are wetting the bed.
 I am not wetting the bed.

637
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,610
This is the big chief here.

638
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,310
Oh, big chief speak
 with forked tongue.

639
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,410
Try to get his clothes off.

640
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,280
I'll hold him, boss.
 You get his pants down.

641
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,580
All right, come here.
 Don't do that, no.

642
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,450
Come here, lovely man.
 I love you!

643
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:18,480
I got something dry over here.

644
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,500
Listen, you take off--

645
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,690
Hey, he invited me.

646
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,730
We'll take off your clothes,
 and you take off...

647
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,840
Have you got him?

648
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,460
Loosen his belt, Kelso.

649
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,300
I'm trying, sir.

650
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,400
For crying out loud,
 let's get 'em off.

651
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,110
Get up off the floor.

652
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,510
I got him !
 Come on there!

653
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,510
Oh, you naughty boy.

654
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,220
Now, here, put this on.
 Put these on.

655
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,420
Wait!

656
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,760
Come on now.
 Can you handle it?

657
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,200
- I have to go downstairs.
 -All right. I'll handle it.

658
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,700
Partner, why do you want--

659
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,000
Little sidekick,
 put these dry clothes on.

660
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,660
All right, I will put them on.
 And then I'll--

661
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,070
Good idea.
 I gotta get downstairs...

662
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,300
before Conchita cools off.

663
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,930
You come downstairs
 with wet clothes on...

664
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,210
I'm gonna stomp you
 and the horse you ride in on.

665
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,470
You got that?

666
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,480
Tongue buddy, partner buddy.

667
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,210
I'll see ya, little buddy.

668
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,550
Oh, you got me right
 in the pantaloons, partner.

669
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,450
Adios!

670
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:25,250
Hold on, Conchita!
 I'm comin'!

671
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,280
Adios, partner.

672
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,650
I do like these Americans.

673
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,630
They really are...

674
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:14,990
Hello.

675
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,260
Hello.

676
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,360
You're having some difficulty?

677
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,210
You sure?

678
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:37,610
Well. Excuse me.

679
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,800
You know that I don't think...

680
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:54,740
you're being
 entirely honest with me?

681
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,620
We have a saying in India.

682
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,360
Well?

683
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,660
Well, what?

684
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,710
You were saying
 something about a saying.

685
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,710
What is it?

686
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,290
"Wisdom...

687
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,620
"is the province of the aged...

688
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,750
"but the heart of a child
 is pure."

689
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,500
That's very pretty.

690
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,700
I'm not sure I know
 what it means.

691
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,340
Neither do l.

692
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:14,610
What does it have
 to do with me?

693
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,640
Well, it has everything
 to do with you.

694
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,050
For one thing, you see,
 it stopped you crying.

695
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,450
It's true.
 I feel better.

696
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:23,890
Thank you very much.

697
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,950
Don't thank me.
 Thank my saying.

698
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,330
Thank you, saying.

699
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:32,160
Do you want to hear
 another one of my sayings?

700
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,500
This is
 a particularly good one...

701
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,260
because it will help you
 always to remember...

702
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,740
how many days there are
 in each month.

703
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:40,360
It goes like this:
 "Thirty days hath September...

704
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:42,370
"October, June, and February.

705
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,400
"All the rest got twenty-nine...

706
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,500
"except my brother
 who got six months."

707
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,580
Just what I thought.

708
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,380
I've been looking
 all over for ya.

709
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,220
Go get your clothes,
 we're gonna leave.

710
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,090
Oh, I don't think so.

711
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,750
Look, you came with me,
 you're gonna leave with me.

712
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,660
Now get your clothes.

713
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,860
No.

714
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,090
Don't say no to me.
 Now get your stuff.

715
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,400
-Go on!
 -Mr. Divot, please--

716
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,560
Look, will you stay
 out of this, buddy.

717
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,800
If Miss Monet wishes to remain,
 that is her right.

718
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,470
Just who do you think you are?

719
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,140
In India, we don't
 think who we are...

720
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,340
we know who we are.

721
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,540
You're meshugah!

722
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,100
I am not your sugar.

723
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:24,940
OK, look, baby, you decide.

724
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,950
You wanna come with me,
 or you wanna stay with this guy?

725
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,180
I want to stay.

726
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,750
You're gonna stay with him, huh?

727
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,660
Nobody ever does this to me!

728
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,880
You hear that?

729
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,550
And forget about
 that test tomorrow, baby.

730
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,690
You're finished in this business
 before you even start!

731
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:40,530
You're wiped out!
 You're finished!

732
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,470
That was a short career,
 wasn't it?

733
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:52,070
Oh, don't worry about that.

734
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:57,640
I better find something
 to put on and call a cab.

735
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,580
No, don't call a cab.

736
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,010
Stay at the party and after...

737
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,520
I'll take you home
 in my three-wheeler Morgan.

738
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,750
No, that would be nice,
 but I can't stay.

739
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,020
Why not?

740
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,420
I got myself into
 a funny situation.

741
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,330
What, with old Divot?

742
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,460
Is that why you were crying?

743
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,590
Yes, but it's
 not really his fault.

744
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,260
He's a terrible man.

745
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,970
Please, stay at the party.
 Let's have a wonderful time.

746
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,740
I'd love to, really,
 but I have nothing to wear.

747
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:28,570
That's no problem. They have
 millions of clothes here.

748
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,770
And anyway...I've got an idea.

749
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,950
Who goes there?

750
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,550
Mr. Bakshi
 and a damsel in distress.

751
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,350
What do you want?

752
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,690
You look like
 a man of the world.

753
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:48,790
This poor lady is urgently
 in need of some dry clothing.

754
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,860
And I perceive that you are both
 approximately the same size.

755
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,680
Marvelous! Just marvelous!

756
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,550
Everyone, let's have a toast
 for our wonderful friends.

757
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:01,010
Fred, we need to move the bar.

758
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,950
Oh, I know how to do that.
 I'll do that for you.

759
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,150
Oh, no, I'd rather do it myself.

760
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:07,120
Fred, stop him.

761
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,140
Come on, it's fine.

762
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,610
Molly, are you sure
 it's all right?

763
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:08,110
Yes, will you please come?
 It's fine!

764
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,640
But your mother's
 having a party.

765
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,080
Can you think of a better time
 to shake 'em up?

766
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,610
You've done some pretty stupid
 things in your life, but this--

767
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,280
Wow! What a house!

768
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:35,040
Hi.

769
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,780
-Hello, Mom.
 -Oh, darling!

770
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:48,380
I thought you were
 out protesting.

771
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,580
No, it's a love-in. I wanted you
 to meet some of my friends.

772
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,490
I can't now, darling.
 I've got all these wet Russians.

773
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,000
But I'll come back,
 and I'll meet your friends.

774
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:59,930
Oh, there they are over there.

775
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,800
General, your wife
 just fell in the pool.

776
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,500
Get her jewelry.

777
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,940
Molly, what was that?

778
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,310
An elephant.

779
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:22,550
An elephant?! Oh, my God!

780
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,560
Molly, how could you do this?
 This is perfectly dreadful!

781
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,350
Well, I didn't mean
 to offend you.

782
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:28,550
Now, listen here, young lady...

783
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,290
you get that elephant
 out of this house!

784
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,200
Yes. Oh, Mother!

785
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,240
-Hello.
 -Hello.

786
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,440
How are you?

787
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,640
I'm all right.
 Is this your elephant?

788
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,910
Yeah. This is Jongo.

789
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,380
You've done a proper old
 paint job on this, haven't you?

790
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,580
What's wrong with it?

791
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,850
You should be ashamed
 of yourself.

792
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,580
-Why?
 -This is a symbol of my country.

793
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,050
Don't you paint them in India?

794
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:00,450
Yes, but we don't
 paint slogans all over them.

795
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,590
Look, he has got "the world
 is flat" on his forehead...

796
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,460
"Socrates eats hemlock"
 on the side...

797
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,590
and "go naked" all over his bum.

798
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:07,860
I'm terribly sorry.

799
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,590
We didn't mean
 to be disrespectful.

800
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:11,830
I know, but it's humiliating.
 They know, you know.

801
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,530
I mean, how would you
 like it if an Indian person...

802
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:15,730
such as myself
 came along and drew...

803
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:17,210
a mustache and a beard
 on your Lady Bird.

804
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,730
It's the same thing, isn't it?

805
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,800
I'm awfully sorry.
 What do you suggest we do?

806
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,280
-Get some water and wash it off.
 -Wash it?

807
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:25,540
Wash it, scrub it, get it off.

808
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,350
Hey, gang!

809
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,980
We're gonna wash the elephant.

810
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,350
What do you mean
 wash the elephant?

811
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,210
All right! That's it! Get out!

812
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,860
Wash it off!
 Get it all off!

813
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:27,030
Bakshi!

814
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,800
I knew I knew that guy!

815
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,740
I knew it!

816
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,910
Hello?
 Buggercult--l--

817
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,780
I wanna talk to the General.
 This is C.S. Divot.

818
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,410
No! You cannot--

819
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,190
What's going on there?

820
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,050
Paint on the ear.

821
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:05,490
Do you believe that child of
 mine bringing home an elephant?

822
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,440
-Dirty.
 -Oh, really!

823
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,740
All right, that got it!

824
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:15,580
That's enough.
 We take him outside now.

825
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:18,410
And wash all the soap off.

826
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,240
Oh, what do you suppose
 that awful racket is?

827
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,270
- I'll be right back.
 -Darling, I'm not finished.

828
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:50,510
I've got to see. God only knows
 what's happening now.

829
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,980
Mom, what are you doing?

830
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,130
You and me gotta find
 someplace to be alone.

831
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,970
Wells, save the paintings!

832
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,210
Oh, Mom, are you all right?

833
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,420
Get the paintings!
 Don't stand there!

834
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:49,940
I should never, ever
 in all my life...

835
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,180
Not that one, you idiot!
 Just the good stuff.

836
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:14,690
Put it back.

837
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,750
We gotta get this
 stuff out of here.

838
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:17,350
-Turn on the air conditioner.
 - I'll never make it.

839
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,690
There's a control
 in the master bedroom.

840
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,750
-Go get it on.
 -Yes, sir.

841
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,540
Just a minute, sir.

842
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,600
Hey, look, I'm C.S. Divot,
 the producer.

843
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:23,870
I'm a friend
 of Mr. Clutterbuck's.

844
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:25,070
I gotta tell him something
 right away.

845
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,270
Divot, C.S.?

846
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,540
That's right, buddy.
 Thanks. Divot.

847
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:30,380
Hey, what's with
 the ambulance here?

848
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:37,360
Honey, let's go stroll
 in the straw, huh?

849
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:39,290
You're a little late, mac.

850
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:41,990
What the hell is
 going on around here?

851
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:46,930
Do you believe it?
 The party isn't over!

852
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,130
Hey, General!

853
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:49,760
I don't even know how
 the hell it got started.

854
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,770
We gotta put something
 in our report.

855
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,970
General, I gotta
 tell you something.

856
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,640
It was crazy. You should've--

857
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,040
Alice, baby,
 are you all right?

858
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,240
Do you feel better?

859
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,440
Oh, I'm fine! I'm going
 to be in the aquacade.

860
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,780
That's nice.
 Don't drop her.

861
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,250
Congressman, Mrs. Dunphy...

862
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,920
I don't know how to tell you--

863
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,320
It's quite all right.

864
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,520
Call me if there's
 anything I can do.

865
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:23,060
Mr. Clutterbuck...

866
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:26,800
May I apologize to you
 for the discomfort--

867
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,070
It's all right.

868
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:29,410
General, it's him !

869
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,670
-Who?
 -Bakshi!

870
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:34,040
The idiot
 who blew up the location!

871
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,550
General, you got the wrong guy!

872
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,690
Hey, little buddy,
 hold on a minute.

873
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,350
Here's one of my old Stetsons.

874
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,160
Look at that. It just fits.

875
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,260
And here's an autographed
 picture of me and my horse Fang.

876
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,020
This is where I live.

877
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:47,040
You have a beautiful home.

878
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:52,620
I would ask you to come up,
 but it's a little late.

879
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,650
Or early. I don't know.

880
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:59,430
Anyway, I have to
 get back to feed Apu.

881
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,690
-Apu?
 -Yes, my monkey.

882
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:04,700
Oh. It's a lovely name.

883
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:07,710
For a monkey, anyway.

884
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,100
-He's used to it by now, anyway.
 -Oh, good.

885
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,900
I would like to say that...

886
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,740
I enjoyed myself
 very much last night.

887
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:20,380
I did, too, very much.

888
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,550
Especially I thought that
 your song was very beautiful.

889
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:25,710
-You did?
 -Yes.

890
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,090
Thank you.

891
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,590
Good-bye.

892
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,930
Good-bye.

893
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,790
Oh, here's your hat.

894
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:39,460
Oh, look. You keep it.

895
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,600
But you may need it.

896
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,400
No, I'd like you to keep it.

897
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,670
All right.

898
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:50,740
If you think that you should
 want it or need it sometimes...

899
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,010
Well, if I need it...

900
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:56,610
I could always come,
 perhaps, and pick it up.

901
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:58,350
That would be very nice.

902
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:02,380
When would you be available
 for me to pick up my hat?

903
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:06,820
Maybe next week.

904
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:09,160
I'll come and get it then.

905
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,170
For I'd love
 to have my hat back.

906
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,430
Good-bye.

907
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,700
Bye-bye.
