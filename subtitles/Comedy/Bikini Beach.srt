1
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,577
Prepare to surface.

2
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,115
Prepare to surface.

3
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,390
- Depth: 58 feet.
- Depth: 58 feet, Sir.

4
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,643
Sonar,
any contacts topside?

5
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,896
No contact, Sir.

6
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:58,415
Tank center ready to
surface, Sir. Very well.

7
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,673
Vents shut.
Ready to surface, Sir.

8
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,926
Depth: 58 feet, Sir.
Very well.

9
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,428
Up periscope.

10
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:30,447
Point Lonsdale bearing,
mark.

11
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,449
013, Sir.

12
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:38,705
Cape Schanck bearing, mark. 125, Sir.

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,350
How's the tide, bob? High tide, Sir.

14
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,961
Controls rigged
for surfacing, Sir.

15
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,928
Surface.

16
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,467
Surface,
surface, surface.

17
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:55,472
Blow main ballast.
Main ballast blown.

18
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:58,492
Depth: 45 feet, Sir.
Secure the air.

19
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:01,478
Open main induction.

20
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,981
Main induction open, Sir.

21
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:19,426
Our scientists disagree...

22
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,644
as to when radiation
will reach Australia.

23
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,181
The atomic war has ended, but
the prime minister reports...

24
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,685
no proof of survival of human
life anywhere except here.

25
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,188
Navy department.

26
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,757
Congratulations.

27
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,764
Tea, dear.

28
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,773
I said, "tea, dear."

29
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,802
Got a bit of a burn yesterday
at the beach after all.

30
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:28,305
You'd better put some
calamine stuff on it.

31
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,309
You did give Jennifer
her bottle?

32
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,820
I laid out your white uniform.
Was that right?

33
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:44,822
I almost forgot
I have to dash.

34
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:46,824
Peter?
Mm-hmm?

35
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,827
They must be giving you
a ship of your own.

36
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,329
No, darling. They don't
give ships to lieutenants.

37
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,297
Then why would it be
Admiral Bridie himself?

38
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,835
If you were just to replace
someone who's ill or something,

39
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,803
that wouldn't mean seeing
Admiral Bridie, would it?

40
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:04,341
I don't know. You don't quite
know what to expect these days.

41
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:10,347
I'll pick up jenny's milk on
the way home from the station.

42
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,815
Why do you have to pick it up?

43
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,352
They just won't be delivering
it anymore, I understand.

44
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,856
Oh.

45
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,328
It's a beautiful day,
peter.

46
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,866
If I wheel Jennifer down
to the club after lunch,

47
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,869
could you meet me there
for a swim?

48
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,838
Peter?

49
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:38,876
They just decided that
yesterday.

50
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,394
If you're going to be in Melbourne
by 11:00, you'd better hurry.

51
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,918
So long, Charlie.

52
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:18,475
Hosgood?

53
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:22,945
Hosgood!
Yes, Sir?

54
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,233
Have you seen this from
that idiot Attenborough,

55
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:29,451
that great correlator
of statistics? Yes, Sir.

56
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,488
It's finally seeped down to him
that most of the oil in the world...

57
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:33,455
comes from the northern
hemisphere.

58
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,492
Attenborough says so.
It's now official.

59
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:40,497
We will carefully conserve the remaining
supplies of petrol in the depot.

60
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:42,499
Yes, Sir.

61
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:47,970
Hosgood!

62
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,507
Lieutenant Holmes
is here, Sir.

63
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,509
Ah, yes.
Come in, come in.

64
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:58,515
Sit down.
Sit down.

65
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,517
Thanks, Sir.

66
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,486
I have an assignment
for you.

67
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,524
Do you care for some of this
miserable muck that passes for coffee?

68
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,491
No, thank you, Sir.

69
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:13,530
It's a reasonably important
appointment, as things go these days.

70
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:17,534
That's getting to be quite a
phrase, isn't it? "These days."

71
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:21,038
You find yourself using it?
Yes, Sir. I'm afraid I do.

72
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:24,041
I'm sorry it can't be
one of our own ships.

73
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,544
It's seagoing though and better
than sitting around on your bottom.

74
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:31,048
Liaison officer aboard the
American submarine Sawfish.

75
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,016
She just docked.
Nuclear-powered, of course.

76
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:38,555
You know about her? Yes,
Sir. I read the report.

77
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,058
She's at our disposal
for a cruise:

78
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,026
Reconnaissance or whatever
you care to call it.

79
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:49,031
You'll sail soon, but just when or
where or for how long I can't tell you,

80
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,858
not until the government
and a pack of these

81
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,570
longhaired scientists
sort themselves out.

82
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:58,576
She's moored across the dock from
the carrier Melbourne in Williamstown.

83
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:01,579
You'll report
to the Captain, Towers.

84
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,084
That will be all,
Holmes.

85
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:16,093
Sir, would it be possible to discuss
the duration of this appointment?

86
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,561
No.

87
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:21,599
But I can give you
a review in four months.

88
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:26,604
Thanks very much, Sir, because I’d
like to be home if possible when...

89
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,608
is there any official estimate
as to how much longer?

90
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,611
The beaker-heads, the
finger-in-the-wind boys say,

91
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:37,114
calculating the rate of drift
or what have you...

92
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,118
about five months
before it gets here.

93
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,122
That's why I say
four for review.

94
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:54,632
There's transport leaving for
Williamstown, if you care to take that.

95
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,634
Yes, Sir.

96
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,107
Hosgood, where is this
coffee coming from?

97
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:08,145
Supply says it's the best
they can do these days, Sir.

98
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,148
Shall I query them again?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

99
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,619
You have anything important to
do, Hosgood? No, Sir. What is it?

100
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:21,158
Oh, nothing. I just thought you might
like to take yourself off till Monday.

101
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,626
A fine weekend.

102
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,663
Boyfriend or whatever.

103
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,169
No, I...
I guess not.

104
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,674
I'll be here, Sir.

105
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,568
All watches of seamen
fall in on the deck.

106
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:09,081
Rob... lieutenant Holmes
will be coming aboard...

107
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,549
Monday and off and on
until we sail.

108
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,086
Have Benson issue him what
clothing he'll need. Yes, Sir.

109
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:17,590
I'll see you Monday, lieutenant. Thanks.

110
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,853
It's funny. Somehow I get the feeling...

111
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:34,106
they're putting her in moth balls. Sir?

112
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,111
I'm afraid I’ll have to bunk
you with this scientist fellow...

113
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:43,080
who's coming aboard
from the C. S. I. R.

114
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,117
Sorry. I don't know
who he'll be just yet.

115
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,620
That's all right, Sir.
I'll manage.

116
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,624
Care for a drink
before lunch?

117
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,591
Yes, Sir,
if it's all right.

118
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,594
It's Australian country
in the flattop...

119
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,133
I’ll have to stick to coke.
You have whatever you like.

120
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,139
I'm a bit puzzled
about this cruise, Sir.

121
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,106
Our destination, I mean.

122
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,610
Admiral Bridie seems...
a bit indefinite.

123
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,648
Of course, if there's some
reason I shouldn't know...

124
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:19,151
no, there's no reason
why you shouldn't know.

125
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,154
But outside of the fact
that it's reconnaissance,

126
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,157
I don't know any more
about it than you do.

127
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,660
Of course, the crew
has it all down pat.

128
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:30,628
We're sailing the end
of next week.

129
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,165
We're going north, and
we'll be back in two months.

130
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,685
But I’ll let you know...

131
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,170
as soon as I hear
anything more official.

132
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,674
Do you live
in Melbourne?

133
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,676
Just outside, actually,
in Frankston.

134
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,679
That's three-quarters
of an hour by electric train.

135
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,684
You make out all right?
Any serious shortages yet?

136
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:55,187
Yes, a few. Petrol
mainly, but we manage.

137
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,191
Say, uh...

138
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:04,196
I’ve been sticking
pretty close here lately.

139
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,165
Think I’m due
for some shore food.

140
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,203
You know of a place where
we might get a good steak?

141
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,170
Yes, I suppose so.

142
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,708
The Admiral fixed me up
with a temporary card...

143
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,175
for something called
the pastoral club.

144
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,715
What's that like? It's a
mahogany- and-polished-brass place.

145
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,718
Some people used to claim it was the
stuffiest club in the commonwealth.

146
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,185
I suppose there's
no argument about that now.

147
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,689
Would they have any scotch
left? Yes, if anyone does.

148
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,227
My wife's uncle lives there; mostly
at the bar these days, I understand.

149
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,230
I would think they would have
some scotch, yes.

150
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,501
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try.

151
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:44,737
I'll be with you
in five minutes.

152
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,632
Sometimes I think that child
could float a battleship.

153
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,134
That's what
I told the Admiral.

154
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:14,141
Peter, how could you?

155
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:18,145
I don't know, really. I just
held the towel like this and...

156
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,648
very funny.

157
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:25,653
You're starting to get your
figure back, aren't you, Charlie?

158
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:28,155
You know,
after Jennifer and all.

159
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,659
A little here,
a little there.

160
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:39,667
By the way, I invited Captain
Towers for the weekend.

161
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,670
Oh, peter, you didn't. I had to, really.

162
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,675
We had lunch together, and he started
asking questions about how we live and all.

163
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,195
Mary, I would have looked an
awful clod not to have asked him.

164
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,680
He'll be all right, I think.
Was he married, do you know?

165
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,182
Two kids.
And they're gone?

166
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,185
Yes, they were in America.

167
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:03,691
Nappies flying in the breeze, pablum
everywhere... they're bound to remind him.

168
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:07,212
We'll just try to get them
out of sight, that's all.

169
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:10,698
He'll get sodden and weep.
I can't stand that again.

170
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,665
He doesn't look
the type to me.

171
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,203
Your R. A. F. Chum didn't
either. Now, Mary...

172
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:19,672
what are we going to do
with him for two days?

173
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:23,711
For one thing, I thought a party on
Saturday night. Ten or twelve people.

174
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:26,178
We haven't done that for a
while. Would you like that?

175
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:32,219
Well, as long as they all understand how
I feel about those morbid discussions.

176
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:36,564
We would have to get
someone for him, though.

177
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,102
What about Moira? Why not?
If she's sober this weekend.

178
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,570
Julian said
she'd given it up.

179
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:46,609
No, darling, you didn't listen. Julian
said she'd given up gin... for brandy.

180
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,611
She says she can drink
more brandy.

181
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,615
Moira's not a bad notion,
in point of fact.

182
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,582
She'd keep him occupied,
at least.

183
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:58,120
But she'd have to stop over, and
we can't just put him on a cot.

184
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:01,088
Put Moira on a cot
on the veranda.

185
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,126
She claims she's not slept in her
own bed the last three months anyway.

186
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,629
That's not entirely fair.
It's all on the surface.

187
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,131
I'll ring her up tonight
and give her the drill.

188
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:12,134
I wonder what he's like
when he gets a skinful?

189
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,136
Peter...
what?

190
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:18,641
You do understand how I feel
about people talking? Sure.

191
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:21,911
And you do love me?
Of course I do.

192
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:25,147
Then why don't you
ever say so?

193
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,154
Give her what for, mate.

194
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,913
You're looking for me.

195
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:25,916
Am I?

196
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:30,886
Mm-hmm. I'm Moira
Davidson. M-O-I-R-A.

197
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,673
It was a very fashionable
name in bad novels

198
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,425
when my mother was
young and impressionable.

199
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,928
I'm a throwback.

200
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:43,934
Where's Holmes? Oh, he's
decking the halls with holly.

201
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,938
He sent me for better or
worse. Better, I’d say.

202
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,442
I'm your date
or whatever you call it.

203
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:55,446
How'd you recognize me?

204
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:58,449
I love Americans.
They're so naive.

205
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:01,452
This way, Commander.

206
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,426
A new model.
Only one horsepower,

207
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,463
but she does a good eight
miles an hour on the flat.

208
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,430
Quite a buggy.
Over 70 years old.

209
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,432
Dad said she was made in
America. I wouldn't be surprised.

210
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:20,471
Give me your toothbrush. Take Amelia’s head
while I see if we can get us out of here.

211
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:23,474
She's still a wee bit
sticky in reverse.

212
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:28,604
All right, boy.
Here we go.

213
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,609
Is there a place we might stop
where I could get a little breakfast?

214
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:36,577
What?
"A little breakfast."

215
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,579
Do you mean that in
addition to everything else,

216
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:41,081
I have to watch you eat bacon
and eggs and all that muck?

217
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,119
I was on a party last night, and I got
up at 8:00 in the morning to meet you.

218
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,087
I, uh... oh, never mind. Hop in.

219
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,124
But you have to buy me a
couple drinks to get me started.

220
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:54,595
Oh, incidentally, they didn't
tell me what to call you.

221
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,134
What's the protocol? My name
is Towers, Dwight Lionel Towers.

222
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:01,101
Really?

223
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:04,139
Really. Hang on, Dwight Lionel.

224
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:35,671
As a matter of fact, we've only
been in port for three days.

225
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:39,675
It's called the Sawfish. My
second husband was an American.

226
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,643
We traveled
all over the world,

227
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,180
and everywhere we went
he would say to people,

228
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:49,149
"I am an American.
I am an American."

229
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:53,188
They finally shot him in one
of those eastern countries.

230
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:56,657
Oh.
Well, I’m sorry.

231
00:22:56,692 --> 00:23:01,697
I was too. He was such a
nice man while he lasted.

232
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:05,200
Is he yours, Moira?
Oh, on loan.

233
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,167
Oh.

234
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,670
Weli... toodle.

235
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:13,208
Toodle.

236
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:25,721
He just drinks and drinks
and nothing happens.

237
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,225
At least he hasn't burst into
tears. Keep up the good work.

238
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,728
amen!
That's sheer balderdash!

239
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,696
I never heard so much
nonsense in my life.

240
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:38,734
You mean to tell me,
this whole war was an accident?

241
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:43,704
No, it wasn't an accident.
I didn't say that.

242
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:48,744
It was carefully planned, down to the
tiniest mechanical and emotional detail.

243
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,248
But it was a mistake,
it was a beaut.

244
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:56,752
In the end, somehow granted
the time for examination,

245
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:01,257
we shall find that our so-called
civilization was gloriously destroyed...

246
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:04,760
by a handful
of vacuum tubes and transistors.

247
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:10,266
Probably faulty.
There you are, Julian.

248
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:13,769
Now we know
where the blame lies.

249
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:17,238
Oh, no, you don't.
No. No.

250
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,741
Maybe we were the blind
mechanics of disaster,

251
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:23,279
but you don't pin the guilt
on the scientists that easily.

252
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:26,282
You might as well
pin it on... motherhood.

253
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:28,249
It should be pinned
on somebody.

254
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,751
You scientists are the likely
ones as far as I can see.

255
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:35,791
You built the bomb. You experimented
with it, tested it and exploded it.

256
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,295
Just a moment, Morgan. Thanks to you
chaps, a moment is about all we have.

257
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,298
Every man who ever worked on this
thing told you what would happen.

258
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,301
The scientists signed petition
after petition, Julian, please.

259
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:47,768
But nobody listened.

260
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:52,273
There was a choice. It was
build the bombs and use them...

261
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:55,311
or risk the united states, the
soviet union and the rest of us...

262
00:24:55,346 --> 00:25:00,281
would find some way
to go on living.

263
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:03,068
That's wishful thinking,
if ever I heard it.

264
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:05,821
I'm not against
wishful thinking, not now.

265
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,289
They pushed us too far.

266
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:11,076
They didn't think we'd fight,
no matter what they did.

267
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,829
And they were wrong.
We fought. We expunged them!

268
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,297
We didn't do such a bad job
on ourselves.

269
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:19,835
With the interesting result that
the background level of radiation...

270
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,839
in this room is nine times
what it was a year ago.

271
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:26,342
Julian.
Don't you know that?

272
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:30,846
Nine times!
We're all doomed, you know.

273
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:34,350
The whole silly, drunken,
pathetic lot of us.

274
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,852
Doomed by the air
we're about to breathe.

275
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:39,355
We haven't got a chance! Stop it!

276
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,357
I won't have it, Julian!

277
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,359
I won't.
There is hope.

278
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:46,862
There has to be hope.

279
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,365
There's always hope.

280
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:52,868
We just can't
go on like this.

281
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:54,870
We can't.

282
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,873
We... we...

283
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,847
I shouldn't drink,
you know.

284
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,885
I inevitably say
something brilliant.

285
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,887
Sorry.

286
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:41,417
I...
I can't help it, peter.

287
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:43,919
I'm sorry.

288
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,422
I just can't.

289
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,956
Everybody's gone to bed.

290
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,934
You like that?

291
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:37,473
Settles the stomach.
I had a lot to drink.

292
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,940
I had a lot to drink.

293
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,443
Julian had
a lot to drink.

294
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,981
Julian and I
are the town drunks.

295
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:49,450
What are you trying
to forget?

296
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:53,489
It's a damn silly question
if I ever heard one.

297
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:55,991
Yeah, you're right.

298
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:57,993
It's just an expression.

299
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:03,499
You know... somebody should
have given me a copy...

300
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,467
of the local ground rules.

301
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:10,506
I might have opened
my big mouth.

302
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:13,974
Danger struck
from the wrong quarter.

303
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:18,013
The people of the city
watch the wrong mouse hole.

304
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:21,982
Come again?

305
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:26,021
But then who would know you were
so tough and drank straight milk?

306
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:30,526
Where are you from?
Which state?

307
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,529
I'm from Idaho.

308
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:35,531
Idaho?

309
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,533
I know better
than that.

310
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:40,536
There's no navy in Idaho
because it's too hilly.

311
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:43,038
Well, I was born in Idaho.

312
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,506
I live in Connecticut now.

313
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,043
Near new London,
where I’m based.

314
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:53,549
Where were you during
all the watchamacallit?

315
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,052
Oh, no. I didn't mean
to ask you that.

316
00:28:57,553 --> 00:29:02,022
Peter said not to.
You don't have to answer.

317
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:06,061
I can't decide if I’m more
objectionable drunk or sober.

318
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:08,063
It's perfectly all right.

319
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:12,533
We were at sea...

320
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:16,321
between Kiska and Midway,
when it began.

321
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:20,040
We got orders to go
to the west pacific,

322
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:24,079
and when we put our nose up
north of Iwo Jima...

323
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:28,083
the air was filled
with radioactive dust.

324
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:31,086
So we ducked.

325
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:39,059
Later on, took a look at
manila... through the periscope.

326
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:44,600
It was still too hot to surface, so
we came down the coast of Australia...

327
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:47,603
and ended up here.

328
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,608
There wasn't much
of anyplace else to go.

329
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:10,966
You look married.

330
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:15,005
Oh, I am.
My wife's name is Sharon.

331
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:19,975
I have a couple of kids:

332
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:25,516
Richard, eight;
Helen, five.

333
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:37,027
Dick is the real sailor
of the family.

334
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:39,995
He is going to Annapolis.

335
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,536
Oh, that's to be expected.

336
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:48,539
He'll probably
change his mind.

337
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:53,544
Why is it taking so long?

338
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,423
Can you
explain it to me?

339
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,892
Nobody can
explain it to me.

340
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:06,432
And don't tell me about
those damn winds again.

341
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,435
How the northern hemisphere
and the southern hemisphere...

342
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,902
get all mixed up
and overlap.

343
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,905
I don't want to hear
about that anymore.

344
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,945
All I want to know is...
if everybody was so smart,

345
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,449
why didn't they know
what would happen?

346
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,451
They did.

347
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:31,957
Well, I...
I can't take it.

348
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,959
I...

349
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,464
Oh, yes, I can take it.

350
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,931
But it's unfair.

351
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,470
It's unfair because
I didn't do anything...

352
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:47,473
and nobody I know
did anything.

353
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,441
Maybe I’m stupid.

354
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:53,979
I had to take algebra twice.

355
00:31:55,981 --> 00:32:00,486
The only thing I could
understand was geography.

356
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,988
I like geography.

357
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:10,746
You know what
I always wanted to do?

358
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:14,965
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli.

359
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,003
Have you ever been to
the Rue de Rivoli? Yes.

360
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,007
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli,

361
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:24,510
and I wanted to buy gloves.

362
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,014
I know the French word
for gloves...

363
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:58,008
No, you've got it all
backwards. What's that?

364
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:03,048
I was supposed to comfort you,
and you're comforting me.

365
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,015
I'm crying.

366
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,554
Everybody was so afraid
that you might cry.

367
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:12,057
They were?
Isn't that funny?

368
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:15,828
No.

369
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:19,565
Sometimes I do.

370
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:27,573
You better go to bed.
Mm-hmm.

371
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:29,575
But you're in my bedroom.

372
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,042
Oh.

373
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:36,582
Weli... I’ll clear out.

374
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,087
Dwight.

375
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,561
Even if you don't like me,

376
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:54,600
would you please hold onto me
just for a moment longer?

377
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,087
This fellow Julian...

378
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:21,627
I take it that he's English and
here on some kind of scientific job.

379
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,629
What's he do, exactly?

380
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,195
I think professor Jorgenson
should outline his plan...

381
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,663
before we make a decision.

382
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:38,203
Simply stated, our view,
our strong opinion, is this:

383
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,973
During the last winter
in the northern hemisphere,

384
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,674
rain and snow may have
washed the air, so to speak,

385
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,037
causing the radioactive elements to fall

386
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:48,714
to the ground more
quickly than anticipated.

387
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:52,218
But the transfer
of radioactivity to us...

388
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,220
would be progressively
decreased,

389
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,722
and human life could go on here
or, at least, in Antarctica...

390
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,225
that's clear enough,
professor Jorgenson.

391
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,192
It's a hope.

392
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:04,730
We agree and the government agrees that
it's worth trying to find out, anyhow.

393
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:07,698
How far north
could a vessel proceed?

394
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:12,238
Our recommendation is that
the submarine should go...

395
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:14,740
as far north in the pacific
as possible,

396
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,745
to point barrow, and make the
necessary radioactivity readings.

397
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,213
The prime minister's
instruction, incidentally,

398
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:25,751
is the Sawfish be exposed
to as few dangers as possible.

399
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:29,522
Commander,
how about ice that far north?

400
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:33,159
She's no icebreaker.
We can feel our way.

401
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:36,727
I make it over 13,000 miles
round trip.

402
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,764
Enough power in your reactor
for that, Commander?

403
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:42,268
I understand there's a considerable
stockpile of uranium here.

404
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,735
Enough for ten trips
like this.

405
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,772
Wish we had something
we could use it in.

406
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:50,276
You might try using it
in my car.

407
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,797
Get a load
of the Charlie wheeler.

408
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,808
May I be of assistance? Yes,
I’m looking for Captain Towers.

409
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,775
I'll try to locate him for you.

410
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,814
Paulson, show the lady to Captain
Towers' cabin on the Melbourne.

411
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,816
Thank you very much.
It's a pleasure.

412
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,818
Right this way,
please.

413
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,835
Relax.

414
00:37:57,468 --> 00:37:59,470
Captain.

415
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,975
There's, uh...
somebody to see you.

416
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:07,978
I asked her to wait
in your stateroom.

417
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,996
Oh.
Hello.

418
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:29,249
A very nice man
asked me to wait here.

419
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:32,002
I don't think
he knew what to do with me.

420
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,471
That's debatable.

421
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:39,009
Did you... did you ask me to
visit your submarine one day?

422
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:43,979
Hmm... no.
Oh, I couldn't remember.

423
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:47,017
Oh, in the meantime,
I’ve been snooping.

424
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:54,490
Regular fish,
these kids.

425
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:58,028
I'll have to get them a boat
of their own one of these days.

426
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:05,285
Sit down.
Thank you.

427
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,538
Here, have a cigarette.

428
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,041
Thank you.

429
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:16,547
I'm glad you came.

430
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,550
Oh...
I just bet you are.

431
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:22,052
No, I am.
Really.

432
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:24,555
And I’ll just bet that my crew
didn't mind too much either.

433
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:27,558
Yes, I have a sneaking suspicion
they didn't mind at all.

434
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:31,527
Come in.

435
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:35,065
I see they found you.
Oh, Mr. Chrysler.

436
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:38,068
See if you can find miss
Davidson something she can wear...

437
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:41,071
to go down in the Sawfish. Yes, Sir.

438
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:46,076
I, uh...

439
00:39:46,577 --> 00:39:49,044
I take it
you put me to bed.

440
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,082
Yes. I arrived at that by deduction.

441
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:56,086
I asked peter and Mary,
and they didn't.

442
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:59,503
I'm afraid I was
a bit of a mess.

443
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:02,850
You drank too much brandy.
You passed out.

444
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:07,389
Yes, I’ve been drinking quite a
bit recently. That's no big secret.

445
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,857
But, you know, I...

446
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:13,896
I’ve never had it happen
quite like that before.

447
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,653
My obvious job
was to seduce you.

448
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:25,407
So I suppose
my pride is hurt.

449
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:28,410
I ought to feel ashamed.

450
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:33,415
Why did you bother
about me?

451
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:48,430
There's a regulation
in here somewhere.

452
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:50,898
It's under "shore duty."

453
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:54,436
I'll read it to you.
No, tell me.

454
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,114
It says when a young
lady has had so much

455
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:02,444
to drink, she doesn't
know what she's doing,

456
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:06,949
you put her to bed...
and go back to the ship.

457
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,453
That's what it says?
That's what it says.

458
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,457
Yes?

459
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:29,471
Well, this requires quite a comprehensive
change. Are you sure about this?

460
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:32,975
You can't go down in a submarine
in that ballet costume.

461
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,477
I'll give you five minutes.

462
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:47,121
Unpack that one next, please.
That one.

463
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:51,160
Everything under control,
Mr. Osborne? Oh, I guess so.

464
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:53,930
Blasted idiots sent me
two wrong components.

465
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:56,630
I'll have to get them
replaced this afternoon.

466
00:41:56,665 --> 00:42:00,669
As long as they're right when
we sail. What is he doing here?

467
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:03,689
Mr. Osborne's been assigned
by the C. S. I. R...

468
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,675
to look after our health
on the trip. "Health"?

469
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,642
It's your submarine.

470
00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:11,680
Captain...
may I see you a minute, Sir?

471
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:13,682
Half a second.

472
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:18,152
Very becoming outfit.
You know, Julian,

473
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:21,155
they don't allow drinking
on American submarines.

474
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,159
I can't imagine what else
you'd do. Thanks very much.

475
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:29,698
What are you going to do? Oh, keep an
eye on the weather. Check on radiation.

476
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:34,703
I guess I’m sort
of a scientific cruise director.

477
00:42:34,738 --> 00:42:37,206
Then it can be
dangerous?

478
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:39,673
I wouldn't know, really.

479
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:42,711
A relative question
at best, isn't it?

480
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:45,714
It seems that everybody
I know is going.

481
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:48,217
I feel left out.

482
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,686
I can sing and dance.

483
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:57,226
You'll have to excuse me. The
Admiral is up top. Don't you go away.

484
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:14,326
It's the damnedest thing.
Started the day before yesterday.

485
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,795
Came on again
ten minutes ago, Sir.

486
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,333
Starts and stops. We've
monitored 60 hours so far.

487
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:25,337
It's weird. You're sure
it's from San Diego?

488
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,304
Within a 100-mile radius.

489
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:30,808
It's as close as we're able to
pinpoint it, without triangulation.

490
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:35,347
Could it be a kid, somebody
who doesn't know morse?

491
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:38,816
We've made two words, Sir:
"Water" and "connect."

492
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:41,854
You know the old story about
an infinite number of monkeys...

493
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,821
and an infinite number
of typewriters.

494
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:47,825
One of them has to end up
writing "King Lear."

495
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,863
I may be cracking up under the
strain, like everybody else,

496
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:52,865
but this interests me.

497
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:54,867
It's more than Jorgenson's
theory. It's a fact.

498
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,869
It's impossible,
but it's a fact.

499
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:00,873
A radio signal is coming from around
san Diego, and they shouldn't be.

500
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,876
There shouldn't even be
any power for transmission.

501
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,879
Hydroelectric?
Yes, possibly.

502
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:10,382
There has to be an explanation,
and I’d like to know what it is.

503
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,885
Not that I’ll live
any longer for knowing.

504
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:17,389
How would you like
to track it down?

505
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:20,858
I'd like it, Sir.
Very well, then.

506
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:23,360
I've been on
to our electronic wizards.

507
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:24,885
They tell us you have radio direction

508
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:26,899
equipment that can be
used from periscope depth.

509
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:30,903
Is that correct? Yes. It hasn't been
used much. We'll have to run some tests.

510
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,370
I'd like it
to be in the pink.

511
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:35,908
Perhaps you can amuse yourself
around here a little longer...

512
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,910
until you're ready
to leave.

513
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:44,977
Hey!

514
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:01,994
What did you do that for?
We could have won.

515
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,964
They've had it.

516
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:09,001
Are they all right?

517
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:13,005
They're all right,
but they're out of the race.

518
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:32,524
It's like looking
at a French movie.

519
00:46:44,036 --> 00:46:46,038
Dr. Fletcher?

520
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:50,542
What about these pills
they've got,

521
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,509
whatever they are?

522
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:55,047
They'll be available from the
chemists' shops on the free list...

523
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:57,550
when the time comes.

524
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:02,054
I understand that they
have got them already...

525
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,056
at port Moresby and Darwin.

526
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:06,058
Apparently.

527
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:12,530
What's the effect?

528
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:17,069
Lethargy, then some
euphoria, coma,

529
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:19,537
then nothing.

530
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:22,074
In fairly rapid order.

531
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:26,544
You, uh...

532
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,082
you don't suppose you could
get me a couple?

533
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:34,587
And... wh-whatever
it is for children?

534
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:39,557
Not a chance...

535
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:42,595
until
the time comes.

536
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:47,099
Sorry, peter.

537
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:52,570
I'm beginning to twitch
when I hear the word "time."

538
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:56,609
If for some reason... I’m not
talking about now, I’m just talking...

539
00:47:56,644 --> 00:48:00,112
if there's one thing
you could do...

540
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:02,079
no.
No, I know what I mean.

541
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:05,117
When the dentist is drilling your
tooth, what do you think about?

542
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:08,621
The nicest thing?
Sex? Or what?

543
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:11,589
Fishing.

544
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:15,628
Trout fishing in a clean
mountain stream. You would.

545
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,630
Why not go then,
when you come back?

546
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,635
The season doesn't open until September.
I've asked. You think I can't fix that?

547
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,602
You think I don't know
important people,

548
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:27,104
that I spend all my time
with this moldy suburban set?

549
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:29,642
You can't mean me. She never bottled
like that before. What happened?

550
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:32,610
She bottled us.
I was trying to win.

551
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:35,147
Taking the race too seriously,
not paying enough attention to her.

552
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:37,114
Truth is,
he made a pass at me.

553
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:40,152
I had to go overboard in
self-defense. Well, if that...

554
00:48:44,657 --> 00:48:48,661
I like to see the young folks
enjoying themselves.

555
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:51,128
What?

556
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:54,166
You never wrestle with me
anymore. What does that mean?

557
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:58,170
I mean exactly what I say. You
never wrestle with me anymore.

558
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:00,638
All right.
Peter, really.

559
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:05,678
You said I never wrestle.
Never mind... for now.

560
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,684
Now, tell them the truth.
But I told them the truth.

561
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:15,688
Sharon is the most
terrible liar that...

562
00:49:52,224 --> 00:49:54,727
I think it's absolutely
preposterous.

563
00:49:55,227 --> 00:49:57,730
How much of this Gould Campbell
have we got left, Stevens?

564
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,447
Better than
400 bottles, Sir.

565
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:03,951
And in its prime.
Shocking. Shocking!

566
00:50:03,986 --> 00:50:06,488
Four-hundred bottles of
vintage port in the cellars...

567
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:08,956
and barely
five months to go.

568
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:13,495
Five months, mark you! If what
these scientist chaps say is right.

569
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,265
I think it needs
another year, actually.

570
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,001
I blame the wine committee
very much.

571
00:50:19,036 --> 00:50:20,968
Very much, indeed.

572
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:22,970
Should have had
more foresight.

573
00:50:23,005 --> 00:50:27,509
How can the members be expected to
get through 400 bottles of port...

574
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:29,476
in five months' time?

575
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:32,479
Bad planning, I say.
Ridiculous.

576
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:36,018
I'll take another bottle home
with me today, Stevens. Yes, Sir.

577
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,026
Sir Douglas Froude
is expecting me.

578
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:47,029
I believe he's in the
bar, Sir. Thank you.

579
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,007
Yes, I’ve heard
about those pills.

580
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:04,046
This cruise is developing into
something bigger than I thought.

581
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:07,014
I may not be here
when it happens.

582
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:10,553
I understand, but if dr.
Fletcher can't get them for you...

583
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:13,055
I’m not certain I can.

584
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:17,309
I've tried everything else.
You're my last hope.

585
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:21,063
You're convinced you want Mary
to have them now?

586
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:26,569
I've thought about it a great
deal. Yes, Sir. Yes, I do.

587
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,574
Hmm. I'm not certain
you're right...

588
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:35,077
but considering Mary...

589
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,084
I don't know how much weight I carry
with the government in my old age.

590
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:46,589
There's a lot of bureaucracy
still, you know? Even in death.

591
00:51:49,091 --> 00:51:52,595
But take this around anyway
and see what happens.

592
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,568
Thank you.

593
00:52:00,603 --> 00:52:04,607
The wine committee is mad,
absolutely mad.

594
00:52:04,642 --> 00:52:08,110
Four hundred bottles
of vintage port.

595
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:11,078
Too late.
Too late.

596
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:14,617
Sorry, Dykers.
Good show. Carry on.

597
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:23,626
As a matter of fact, the whole
thing is due to the wine committee...

598
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:27,129
having failed to conserve
their supplies properly.

599
00:52:27,164 --> 00:52:29,632
If they'd only regulated
their...

600
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:41,644
oh, how nice.

601
00:52:43,145 --> 00:52:48,150
Have you noticed Moira isn't
drinking so much? I wonder why?

602
00:52:48,185 --> 00:52:50,420
No, I hadn't noticed.

603
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:52,620
Peter?
Mm-hmm?

604
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:55,623
Could we afford an
electric mower for the lawn?

605
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:59,161
A very little one I could
start myself while you're away?

606
00:52:59,196 --> 00:53:01,163
Doris Haymes has one.

607
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:03,631
She does?

608
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:08,170
Well, she's cut the cord three times
and nearly electrocuted herself.

609
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:11,674
Besides, darling,
I doubt there's any left.

610
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:13,676
What's that?

611
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:27,690
Sit down.
Sit down.

612
00:53:31,193 --> 00:53:35,197
This is something I want you
to know about before I go.

613
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:37,700
You're going to be serious?

614
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:40,703
I wish you wouldn't.

615
00:53:41,203 --> 00:53:43,706
I wish
I didn't have to be.

616
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,712
Now, darling, this is
a big cruise we're going on.

617
00:53:49,747 --> 00:53:51,714
There will be mines
and ice to contend with.

618
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:56,719
Peter, I knew when I married you that
you were going to be a naval officer.

619
00:53:56,754 --> 00:54:00,723
My father died at sea.
You know that.

620
00:54:01,223 --> 00:54:04,191
We just don't have to
discuss it, do we?

621
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:07,229
We have to discuss this, Mary, because
there isn't any tradition for this.

622
00:54:07,264 --> 00:54:11,233
Peter... you're going to listen
whether you like it or not.

623
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:18,741
Now, this is
a special kind of...

624
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:21,709
sleeping pill.

625
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,246
I had a devil of a time
getting them,

626
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:26,766
but I wanted you
to have them on hand...

627
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:29,251
and make sure you knew
how to use them.

628
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:38,260
What happens with the
radiation is that you get ill.

629
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:40,530
You start feeling sick,

630
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:42,666
and then you are sick...

631
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:44,767
and you go on
being sick.

632
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,236
You can't
keep anything down.

633
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:53,275
You may feel better for a
while, but it always comes back.

634
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:57,279
You get weaker.

635
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:02,785
And this cures it?

636
00:55:04,787 --> 00:55:07,289
Darling, you know
nothing cures it.

637
00:55:07,324 --> 00:55:09,291
This ends it.

638
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:16,263
But, peter...

639
00:55:16,298 --> 00:55:18,550
however ill I was,

640
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:20,768
I couldn't do that.

641
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:23,806
Who'd look after Jennifer?

642
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:28,811
Jenny will get it too.

643
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,070
You're not trying to tell me
you want me to kill Jennifer?

644
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:40,788
Mary, don't be an idiot!
Supposing you get it first?

645
00:55:40,823 --> 00:55:43,290
What are you going to do? Struggle
by yourself until you drop?

646
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:46,829
Jenny might live for days and be helpless
in her crib with you dead on the floor!

647
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:49,331
Don't you see that?
Don't you see it?

648
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:58,305
Darling...
I’m sorry.

649
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,810
I can't believe it myself half the time.

650
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:06,348
Let's not discuss it
any more right now, peter.

651
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:13,355
Anyway, Mrs. Hildreth's husband was
talking to someone the other day...

652
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:17,359
who said it isn't
coming here after all.

653
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,363
He says it's slowing... for god's
sake, Hildreth's a damn fool!

654
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:55,272
???? [continues

655
00:57:00,277 --> 00:57:02,244
let's go.

656
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:04,823
Would you like
another drink?

657
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:07,284
No, let's go
for a walk.

658
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,286
All right.

659
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,294
You know, I think I’ve
discovered why you fascinate me.

660
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,296
Shall I tell you?

661
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,840
Uh-huh.

662
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:25,302
Because you take me
for granted.

663
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:31,850
I know women aren't supposed to like
that sort of thing, but somehow I do.

664
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:33,852
I've been treated
in every other way...

665
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,278
like a child...

666
00:57:36,313 --> 00:57:38,315
and sometimes like...

667
00:57:40,317 --> 00:57:43,827
like things
I’ve probably deserved...

668
00:57:43,862 --> 00:57:48,867
but I’ve never been pushed
around in such a nice way...

669
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:52,329
and treated
something like a wife.

670
00:57:54,873 --> 00:57:59,301
I suppose what I mean is...
like an American wife.

671
00:57:59,336 --> 00:58:02,882
Moira, this isn't going to
do us any... no, hear me out.

672
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:12,349
I was hurt at first when I realized
you were mixing me up with Sharon.

673
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:19,899
And then I realized that it was one of
the nicest things that could happen to me.

674
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:27,364
I wouldn't really mind if you
could forget entirely who I am.

675
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:33,913
I don't like myself
very much anyway.

676
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,377
Wouldn't you like to try?

677
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,936
No.

678
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:08,948
It seemed
like a good idea.

679
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:12,952
I suppose it wasn't.

680
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:16,413
There's a train leaving
at 10:50.

681
00:59:16,448 --> 00:59:18,415
I think I’ll take it.

682
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:46,909
You see, in the navy,
during the war,

683
00:59:46,944 --> 00:59:50,948
I got used to the idea that something
might happen to me, I might not make it.

684
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:57,454
I also got used
to the idea...

685
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:00,457
of my wife and children...

686
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:03,425
safe at home.

687
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,462
They'd be all right,
no matter what.

688
01:00:07,965 --> 01:00:10,968
What I didn't reckon with
was that in this...

689
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:13,971
this kind of a monstrous war...

690
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:18,475
something might happen
to them...

691
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:20,978
and not to me.

692
01:00:25,482 --> 01:00:26,984
Well, it did...

693
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:31,488
and I can't...

694
01:00:34,992 --> 01:00:36,493
I can't cope with it.

695
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:38,996
My kids...

696
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:45,002
all the planning since
the day they were born.

697
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:50,007
Sharon...
Sharon and I, we...

698
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:52,509
weli...

699
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:57,514
see, we were the sort
of people who...

700
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:04,021
we would have been happy
to grow old together.

701
01:01:07,524 --> 01:01:09,526
I-I can't accept it.
I can't...

702
01:01:16,033 --> 01:01:19,036
does that make any sense?
Do you understand?

703
01:01:21,038 --> 01:01:23,040
Yes.

704
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:27,044
It makes sense.

705
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:31,048
I understand.

706
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:35,553
Good night.

707
01:02:27,855 --> 01:02:29,822
I am sorry
to see this.

708
01:02:29,857 --> 01:02:33,110
And you were doing
so much better too.

709
01:02:33,145 --> 01:02:36,363
I would like to come in,
whatever this is.

710
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:38,866
An opium den
more than likely.

711
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,883
How on earth
did you find me?

712
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:01,388
What is it?
It's a Ferrari.

713
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,357
Does it run?
"Does it run?"

714
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:07,860
She won the grand prix
last year.

715
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:10,898
Bought it from Simonelli's widow.
Gave her a hundred quid for it.

716
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:14,902
What are you going to do
with it? Race it, of course.

717
01:03:14,937 --> 01:03:19,872
You? Me. You needn't
sound so pessimistic.

718
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:22,374
I've always wanted to,
just never could afford it.

719
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:25,913
Sixth of august, if the
Commander gets me back in time.

720
01:03:25,948 --> 01:03:28,415
You're going
to kill yourself.

721
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:32,419
It's possible.

722
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:38,425
Julian?
Hmm?

723
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:41,428
When was it you were
in love with me and I...

724
01:03:41,463 --> 01:03:43,395
and you were so stupid
about it?

725
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,398
And I was so stupid
about it.

726
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:50,938
You should have grabbed me.
I'm about to be extinct.

727
01:03:52,439 --> 01:03:56,944
I came here tonight, Julian,
because I want to know...

728
01:03:56,979 --> 01:03:59,213
are you stili...

729
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:01,448
I’m serious.

730
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,965
In a normal world, I think I
would still be in love with you.

731
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,967
Yes or no, Julian?

732
01:04:21,468 --> 01:04:23,970
But lately,
with so little time left,

733
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:26,473
my sense of values
seem to have changed.

734
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:33,981
No, then?

735
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:38,986
I'm such a fake, such a lot
of meaningless talk.

736
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:42,489
Now, now, don't say
that. Yes, it's true.

737
01:04:42,524 --> 01:04:45,958
There have been men,
lots of men.

738
01:04:45,993 --> 01:04:49,496
Every time one fell out,
there was always a replacement.

739
01:04:49,997 --> 01:04:52,499
But not one of them
meant anything to me.

740
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:57,504
I can't pretend
any longer, Julian.

741
01:04:57,539 --> 01:04:59,972
I'm afraid.

742
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:04,011
I have nobody,
and I’m afraid.

743
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,522
What about Dwight?

744
01:05:17,024 --> 01:05:19,992
He's married.

745
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,995
He's married
to a girl named Sharon,

746
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:26,283
and they have two children.
Mm-hmm, I know.

747
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,536
But if things were different,

748
01:05:29,571 --> 01:05:31,556
if she were alive,

749
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:33,506
I’d do anything...

750
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:36,544
any mean trick I know
to get him.

751
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:43,551
Even if I could make him forget,

752
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:46,303
there isn't time.

753
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:48,556
No time to love...

754
01:05:51,058 --> 01:05:53,811
and nothing to remember.

755
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,564
Nothing worth remembering.

756
01:05:59,066 --> 01:06:02,069
I can't go home tonight,
Julian.

757
01:06:03,571 --> 01:06:06,073
May I stay here with you?

758
01:06:07,575 --> 01:06:11,579
It's late, and I have to pick
up some things before we leave.

759
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,584
Leave...
you're leaving?

760
01:06:18,085 --> 01:06:20,087
At 6:00 this morning.

761
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:29,597
He didn't tell you.

762
01:06:45,613 --> 01:06:48,080
Come on.

763
01:06:48,115 --> 01:06:50,117
I'll take you home.

764
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:21,023
Depth: 56 feet, Sir.

765
01:07:22,024 --> 01:07:25,277
I recommend course 045,
Captain.

766
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:28,495
Right rudder,
new course: 045.

767
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:32,534
right rudder, new course:
045, Sir. Check sonar.

768
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:34,536
Fogerty,
how's it look topside?

769
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:39,041
All clear for about a mile,
scattered icebergs.

770
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:42,294
Well, this looks
like the spot.

771
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:44,547
All stop.
All stop.

772
01:07:45,047 --> 01:07:47,049
Up periscope.

773
01:07:56,058 --> 01:07:59,812
Okay.
I got point barrow.

774
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:03,531
Bearing:
130 relative.

775
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:07,570
Distance: About seven
miles. Aye, aye, Sir.

776
01:08:09,572 --> 01:08:13,075
All right, Mr. Osborne. You
can take your readings now.

777
01:08:13,576 --> 01:08:16,078
Chief, raise the E. C. M. Aye, aye, Sir.

778
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:23,586
E. C. M. Fully extended, Sir.

779
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:51,579
It's hot,
isn't it?

780
01:08:51,614 --> 01:08:53,616
It's hotter than it is
in mid-pacific,

781
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:57,084
at least 30 points
in the red.

782
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,122
That takes care
of Jorgenson’s theory.
