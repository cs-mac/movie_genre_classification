00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,222
<i>In the bleak days of 1983...</i>

2
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:56,607

of a ruinous monetarist policy...</i>

3

<i>...the good, loyal men
of the Permanent Assurance Company...</i>

recently fallen on hard times...</i>

<i>...strained under the yoke of their
oppressive, new corporate management.</i>

6
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:13,252
Terrible. Really terrible.

7
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,188
Row!

8
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,379
That's it, Evans. You're fired.

9
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,722
You heard me. Out.

10
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:09,551
Did you hear that? He's been sacked.

11
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,473
Sacked?

12
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:17,984
Sacked? Come on, boys. Let's get at 'em.

13
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,983
Come on!

14
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,213
Let me out of here!

15
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:27,553
I demand to see my lawyer!

16
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,855
Tooley! Come on.

17
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,588
Quiet! Silence!

18
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:09,174
Now, lads, let's move.

19
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:13,175
You, you and you, break open the weapons.

20
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,225
You, you and you, into the rigging.

21
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:21,219
-And you, put the kettle on.
-Aye, sir.

22
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,534
There, there, Charles.

23
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,186
Sorry!

24
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,987
Come on, Tooley. This way!

25
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,676
Weigh the anchor!

26
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:42,887
Weigh the anchor!

27
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,849
Weigh the anchor.

28
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:54,047
<i>And so,
the Crimson Permanent Assurance...</i>

29
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:58,425
<i>...was launched upon the high seas
of international finance.</i>

30
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,363
Come on, boy. Watch it. Route. Route!

31
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,778
-Cup of tea, dear?
-Hey, captain!

32
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,825
Look! To starboard!

33
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,918
<i>There it lay: the prize they sought.</i>

34
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:37,123
Hard to starboard!

35
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,920
<i>A financial district swollen
with multinationals, conglomerates...</i>

36
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,839
<i>...and fat, bloated merchant banks.</i>

37
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:52,018
All right, lads, battle stations!

38
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,557
Come on! Move it!

39
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,671
-All right, then. That's enough.
-Take cover.

40
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,364
Down, down!

41
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,730
Hard to starboard!

42
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,096
Fire!

43
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,954

Ross! Get the readouts!

45
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,962
-Stop him!
-Eric!

46
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,015
-Thanks!
-Charge!

47
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,688
-No, no! Let me! Let me!
-Okay, Kane.

48
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,481
Captured!

49
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,621
Gotcha!

50
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,702
Take this.

51
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,544
Here. File this.

52
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:29,388

53

You see?
That means your baby is still alive.

And that's the most expensive machine
in the whole hospital.

Yes, it cost over three quarters

Morning, Mr. Pycroft.

163
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,336
Very impressive.

164
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:15,460
-And what are you doing this morning?
-It's a birth.

165
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,837
And what sort of thing is that?

166
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,507
That's when we take a new baby
out of a lady's tummy.

167
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,342
Wonderful what we can do nowadays.

168
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:28,266
I see you have the machine
that goes "Ping!"

169
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:29,892
This is my favorite.

170
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:32,555
We lease this back
from the company we sold it to.

171
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:37,148
That way, it comes under the monthly
current budget and not the capital account.

172
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,908
Thank you, thank you.
We try to do our best. Well, do carry on.

173
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:48,910
-The vulva's dilating, doctor.
-Yes, there's the head.

174
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:51,871
Yes, four centimetres, five, six centimetres.

175
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:54,003
-Lights!
-Amplify the ping machine.

176
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:56,046
-Masks up!
-Suction!

177
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:57,924
Eyes down for a full house!

178
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,671
Here it comes.

179
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,798
And frighten it.

180
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:05,422
Thank you.

181
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,683
And the rough towels!

182
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:10,936
Show it to the mother.

183
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,354
-That's enough.
-Right. Sedate her.

184
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:17,308
-Number the child.
-Measure it, blood-type it and isolate it.

185
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,280
Okay, show's over.

186
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:22,610
Is it a boy or a girl?

187
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,568
I think it's a little early
to start imposing roles on it, don't you?

188
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:27,944
A word of advice.

189
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,084
You may find you suffer for some time
a totally irrational feeling of depression...

190
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,995
...P.N.D., as we doctors call it.

191
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,163
So, it's lots of happy pills for you...

192
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:39,043
...and you can find out about the birth
when you get home.

193
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:42,798
It's available on Betamax,
VHS and Super 8.

194
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:07,235
Bloody hell.

195
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,087
-Get it, would you, Deidre?
-All right, Mum.

196
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,888
-Now whose teatime is it?
-Mine!

197
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,889
Come on. Out you go.

198
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:38,059
Now, Vincent, Tessa, Valerie, Janine,
Martha, Andrew, Thomas...

199
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:42,278
...Walter, Pat, Linda, Michael,
Evadne, Alice, Dominique and Sasha...

200
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:43,940
...it's your bedtime.

201
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:46,190
Now don't argue!

202
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:49,445
Laura, Alfred, Nigel, Annie, Simon and--

203
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:53,623
Wait.
I've got something to tell the whole family.

204
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:57,249
Quick. Go and get the others in, Gordon.

205
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:01,666
The mill's closed. There's no more work.

206
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:03,417
We're destitute.

207
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,713
Come in, my little loves.

208
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:10,551
I've got no option but to sell you all
for scientific experiments.

209
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:15,223
No, no, that's the way it is, my loves.

210
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:19,095
Blame the Catholic Church for
not letting me wear a little rubber thing.

211
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,811
They've done some
wonderful things in their time.

212
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:26,279
They've preserved the might and majesty,
even mystery of the Church of Rome...

213
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:30,741
...and the sanctity of the Sacrament,
the indivisible oneness of the Trinity...

214
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:34,527
...but if they'd let me wear a little
rubber thing on the end of my cock...

215
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:37,077
...we wouldn't be in the mess we are now.

216
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,870
Couldn't Mummy have worn
some sort of pessary?

217
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:45,298
Not if we're going to remain members of
the fastest-growing religion in the world.

218
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:46,544
He's right.

219
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,042
You see, we believe....

220
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,587
Let me put it like this.

221
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,005
"There are Jews in the world

222
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,140
"There are Buddhists

223

229

230
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:29,257

"You don't have to have a great brain

232

"You don't have to have any clothes on

233

I can't keep you all here any longer.

282

Speak up!

283
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:16,846
I can't keep you all here any longer!

284
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:21,398
God has blessed us so much
I can't afford to feed you anymore.

285
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:24,187
Couldn't you have your balls cut off?

286
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:27,907
It's not as simple as that, Nigel.
God knows all.

287
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:33,197
He'd see through such a cheap trick.
What we do to ourselves, we do to him.

288
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:36,582
You could have had them
pulled off in an accident.

289
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,498
No. Children, I know you're trying to help,
but believe me, my mind's made up.

290
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,211
I've given this long and careful thought...

291
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:49,296
...and it has to be medical experiments
for the lot of you.

292
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:54,806
"Every sperm is sacred

293
00:31:56,229 --> 00:32:00,854
"Every sperm is great"

294
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:04,227
Look at them. Bloody Catholics.

295
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,816
Filling the bloody world up with people
they can't afford to bloody feed.

296
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,610
What are we, dear?

297
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,108
Protestant, and fiercely proud of it.

298
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:16,576
Why do they have so many children?

299
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:20,330
Every time they have sexual intercourse
they have to have a baby.

300
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:23,878
-But it's the same with us, Harry.
-What do you mean?

301
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:28,584
I mean we've got two children,
and we've had sexual intercourse twice.

302
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:32,213
That's not the point.
We could have it any time we wanted.

303
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,136
Really?

304
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:35,761
Yes. And what's more,
because we don't believe...

305
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:38,888
...in all that papist claptrap,
we can take precautions.

306
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:40,806
What you mean, lock the door?

307
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:44,764
No. I mean because we're members
of the Protestant Reformed Church...

308
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:48,394
...which successfully challenged
the autocratic power of the Papacy...

309
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:52,402
...in the mid-16th century, we can wear
little rubber devices to prevent issue.

310
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,655
What do you mean?

311
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,529
I could, if I wanted,
have sexual intercourse with you.

312
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,902
Oh, yes, Harry.

313
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:00,785
And, by wearing a rubber sheath
over my old fellow...

314
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:04,790
...I could ensure that when I came off,
you would not be impregnated.

315
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,544
That's what being a Protestant's all about.
That's why it's the church for me.

316
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,967
That's why it's the church
for anyone who respects the individual...

317
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:16,219
...and the individual's right
to decide for him or herself.

318
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,678
When Martin Luther nailed his protest
up to the church door in 1517...

319
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:24,388
...he may not have realized
the full significance of what he was doing...

320
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:27,232
...but 400 years later, thanks to him...

321
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:30,153
...I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

322
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:33,280
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom.

323
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:36,200
Oh, no!
I can wear French Ticklers if I want.

324
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:36,943
What?

325
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:40,155
French Ticklers, black mambos,
crocodile ribs.

326
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:43,034
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect...

327
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:46,541
...but also to enhance
the stimulation of sexual congress.

328
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:47,742
Have you got one?

329
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:51,455
Have I got one? No, but I can go down
the road anytime I want...

330
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:55,838
...and walk into Harry's, and hold my head
up high and say, in a loud, steady voice:

331
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:58,502
"Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.

332
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:02,596
"In fact, today I think I'll have
a French Tickler, for I am a Protestant."

333
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:03,599
Why don't you?

334
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:05,062
But they cannot.

335
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:08,558
Because their church never made
the leap out of the Middle Ages...

336
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:11,650
...and the domination of
alien Episcopal supremacy.

337
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:16,488
But despite the attempts of Protestants
to promote the idea of sex for pleasure...

338
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:19,660
...children continue to multiply everywhere.

339
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:30,704
"And spotteth twice
they the camels before the third hour.

340
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:35,666
"And so the Midianites
went forth to Ram Gilead...

341
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:38,008
"...in Kadesh Bilgemeth...

342
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,088
"...by Shor Ethra Regalion...

343
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:44,344
"...to the house of Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda.

344
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:47,479
"He who brought the butter dish
to Belshazzar...

345
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,646
"...and the tent peg
to the house of Rashomon.

346
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:53,813
"And there, slew they the goats...

347
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:59,106
"...yea, and placed they the bits
in little pots."

348
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,575
Here endeth the lesson.

349
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,029
Let us praise God.

350
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,038
Oh, Lord.

351
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:13,040
Oh, Lord.

352
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,504
You are so big.

353
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:19,542
You are so big.

354
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,763
So absolutely huge.

355
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:26,383
So absolutely huge.

356
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:31,681
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

357
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:36,857
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

358
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:41,524
Forgive us, Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

359
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,988
And barefaced flattery.

360
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:50,328
But you're so strong,
and, well, just so super.

361
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,042
Fantastic.

362
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,828
-Amen, Reverend.
-Amen.

363
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,207
Now two boys have been found...

364
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:01,299
...rubbing linseed oil
into the school cormorant.

365
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,470
Some of you may feel
that the cormorant does not play...

366
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:09,388
...an important part in the life
of the school, but I would remind you...

367
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:13,474
...that it was presented to us by
the corporation of the town of Sudbury...

368
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:16,351
...to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember...

369
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:19,359
...the names of all those from
the Sudbury area...

370
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,853
...who so gallantly gave their lives...

371
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:24,399
...to keep China British.

372
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:29,328
So from now on,
the cormorant is strictly out of bounds!

373
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:36,244
And Jenkins,
apparently your mother died this morning.

374
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:37,909
Chaplain.

375
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,967
"O Lord, please don't burn us

376
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:49,554
"Don't grill or toast your flock

377
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:54,388
"Don't put us on the barbecue

378
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:58,347
"Or simmer us in stock

379
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:02,809
"Don't braise or bake or boil us

380
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:06,814
"Or stir-fry us in a wok

381
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,204
"Oh, please don't lightly poach us

382
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:15,989
"Or baste us with hot fat

383
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:21,460
"Don't fricassee or roast us

384
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:24,834
"Or boil us in a vat

385
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:30,420
"And please don't stick thy servants, Lord

386
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:34,423
"In a rotissomat"

387
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:41,519
He's coming!

388
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:51,529
All right, settle down, settle down.

389
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:55,695
Before I begin the lesson,
will those of you...

390
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,955
...playing in the match this afternoon
move your clothes down...

391
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,532
...onto the lower peg
immediately after lunch...

392
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:04,582
...before you write home,
if you're not getting a haircut...

393
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:08,801
...unless you have a brother going out
this weekend as the guest of another boy...

394
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,835
...then collect his note before lunch,
put it in your letter after your haircut.

395
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:16,217
Make sure he moves your clothes
onto the lower peg for you.

396
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,226
-Sir?
-Yes, Wymer?

397
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:20,849
My brother's going out
with Dibble this weekend...

398
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,394
...but I'm not having my hair cut,
so do I move--

399
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,733
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

400
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:31,114
If you're not getting your hair cut, you
don't have to move your brother's clothes.

401
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,742
You simply collect his note before lunch,
after you've done your scripture prep...

402
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,621
...when you've written your letter home
before rest...

403
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:41,957
...move your clothes onto the lower peg,
greet the visitors...

404
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:45,292
...and report to Mr. Viney
that you've had your chit signed.

405
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:47,667
Now, sex.

406
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,802
Sex, sex, sex. Where were we?

407
00:38:58,224 --> 00:39:02,602
Well, had I got as far as
the penis entering the vagina?

408
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:09,434
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

409
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:12,319
Well, had I done foreplay?

410
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,487
Yes, sir.

411
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,289
As we all know all about foreplay,
no doubt you can tell me...

412
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,988
...what the purpose of foreplay is.

413
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:26,325
Biggs.

414
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,507
Don't know. Sorry, sir.

415
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:34,166
Carter?

416
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,297
Was it taking your clothes off, sir?

417
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,968
And after that?

418
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,345
Putting them on a lower peg, sir.

419
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:51,563
The purpose of foreplay is
to cause the vagina to lubricate...

420
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:55,401
...so that the penis can penetrate
more easily.

421
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:57,568
Could we open a window, sir?

422
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,282
Yes. Harris, will you?

423
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:04,196
And, of course, to cause the man's penis
to erect and harden.

424
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:11,085
Now, did I do vaginal juices last week?

425
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,460
Pay attention, Wadsworth!
I know it's Friday.

426
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:14,830
Watching the football?

427
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,630
Boy, move over there. I'm warning you.

428
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:21,264
I may decide to set an exam this term.

429
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,474
-Oh, sir!
-Sir!

430
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,592
So just listen.

431
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:33,061
Now did I or did I not do vaginal juices?

432
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:36,059
Yes, sir.

433
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:39,274
Name two ways
of getting them flowing, Watson.

434
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:42,910
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

435
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:48,950
What's wrong with a kiss, boy?

436
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:52,747
Why not start her off with a nice kiss?

437
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:57,081
You don't have to leap
straight for the clitoris like a bull at a gate.

438
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:59,048
Give her a kiss, boy.

439
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:03,881
-Suck the nipple, sir?
-Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

440
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:07,223
-Stroking the thighs, sir?
-Yes, yes. I suppose so.

441
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:09,599
-Biting the neck.
-Yes, good.

442
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:13,229
Nibbling the ear lobe, kneading
the buttocks, and so on and so forth.

443
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:16,684
So we have all these
possibilities before we...

444
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:19,898
...stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.

445
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:22,066
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

446
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:27,781
Now, all these forms of stimulation
can now take place.

447
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:39,544
Of course,
tonguing will give you the best idea...

448
00:41:39,634 --> 00:41:42,717
...of how the juices are coming along.

449
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:44,384
Helen?

450
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:47,929
Now, penetration and coitus,
that is to say, intercourse...

451
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:51,017
...up to and including orgasm.

452
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,433
Hello, dear.

453
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:57,150
Do stand up when my wife
enters the room, Carter.

454
00:41:57,235 --> 00:41:58,432
Sorry, sir.

455
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:03,238
Humphrey, I hope you don't mind. I told
the Garfields we'd dine with them tonight.

456
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,739
-Yes, well, I suppose we must.
-I said we'd be there by 8:00.

457
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:09,745
It'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

458
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,032
I know you don't like them,
but couldn't make another excuse.

459
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:14,868
It's just that I felt....

460
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:16,575
Wymer!

461
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,671
This is for your benefit.
Would you kindly wake up?

462
00:42:21,257 --> 00:42:24,175
I've no intention
of going through this all again.

463
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:37,975
We'll take the foreplay as read,
if you don't mind, dear.

464
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:39,180
No, of course not.

465
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:44,233
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife...

466
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,071
...in the standard way.

467
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:50,284
The penis is now, as you will observe,
more or less fully erect.

468
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:53,368
There we are. That's better.

469
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:54,820
Now, Carter.

470
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:57,791
-Yes, sir?
-What is it?

471
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,370
-It's an ocarina, sir.
-Bring it up here.

472
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:07,880
The man now starts making
thrusting movements with his pelvic area...

473
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,054
...moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina.

474
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,851
Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.

475
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:17,686
While the wife maximizes
her clitoral stimulation...

476
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:20,607
...by the shaft of the penis
by pushing forward.

477
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:22,096
Thank you, dear.

478
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,730
Now, as the sexual excitement mounts....

479
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:26,362
What's funny, Biggs?

480
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:28,485
Nothing, sir.

481
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:31,326
Do, please,
share your little joke with the rest of us.

482
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,948
Obviously something
frightfully funny is going on.

483
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:35,235
No, honestly, sir.

484
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,079
Well, as it's so funny,
I think you'd better be selected to play...

485
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:43,497
...for the boys' team in the rugby match
against the masters this afternoon.

486
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,130
Oh, no, sir!

487
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,518
Well played, well played.

488
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:44,703
Blackitt, Sturridge and Walters,
you take the buggers on the left flank.

489
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,997
Hordern, Spadger and I'll go
for the gun post.

490
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,326
Hang on. You'll never make it.
Let us come.

491
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,535
Do as you're told.

492
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,871
Right, Skipper. Oh, sir?

493
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:56,293
If we don't meet again, sir...

494
00:45:56,634 --> 00:46:00,964
...I'd just like to say it's been
a real privilege fighting alongside you, sir.

495
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:04,639
Yes, well, this is hardly the time
or place for a good-bye speech.

496
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:09,187
Me and the lads realize that, sir,
but, well, we may never meet again, so--

497
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,272
All right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot.

498
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,066
No, just a moment, sir.

499
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,642
Me and the lads,
we've had a little whip around.

500
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:18,904
We've bought you something.
We bought you this.

501
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,693
I don't know what to say.

502
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:27,704
It's a lovely thought. Thank you.
Thank you all.

503
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,413
But I think we'd better get to cover--

504
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:35,082
We've got something else
for you as well, sir.

505
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,210
Sorry it's another clock,
only there was a bit of a mix-up.

506
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,342
Walters thought he was buyin' a present...

507
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,430
...and Spadger and I
had already got the other one.

508
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:47,684
Well, it's beautiful. They're both beautiful.

509
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,936
We'd better get to cover now.
I'll thank you properly later on.

510
00:46:53,024 --> 00:46:54,934
Corporal Sturridge got this for you.

511
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:57,730
He didn't know about the others.
It's Swiss.

512
00:46:58,028 --> 00:47:01,149
Now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge.
Good man.

513
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:05,445
There's a card, sir, from all of us.
Sorry about the blood, sir.

514
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:08,158
Thank you all.

515
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:10,916
Squad! Three cheers for Captain Biggs.

516
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:18,912
I'll be all right.

517
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:22,590
There's just one other thing, sir.
Spadger, give him the check.

518
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,010
This is really going too far.

519
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:29,007
I don't seem to be able to find it, sir.
It'll be in No. 4 trench.

520
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:31,259
For Christ's sake, forget it, man.

521
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:34,763
You shouldn't have said that, sir.

522
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:37,266
You've hurt his feelings now.

523
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,024
Don't mind me, Spadge.
Toffs are all the same.

524
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:46,647
One minute, it's all please and thank you.
The next, they'll kick you in the teeth.

525
00:47:46,952 --> 00:47:50,036
-Let's not give him the cake.
-I don't want any cake.

526
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:53,158
Look. Blackitt cooked it
especially for you, you bastard.

527
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:55,372
He saved his rations for six weeks, sir.

528
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,461
-I don't mean to be ungrateful.
-I'll be all right--

529
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:01,290
Blackie! Blackie!

530
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:05,340
Look at him! He worked on that cake
like no one else I've ever known.

531
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:07,754
Some nights it was so cold
we could hardly move...

532
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:11,892
...but Blackitt'd be slicing the lemons,
mixing the sugar and the almonds.

533
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:15,724
I mean, you try getting butter to melt
at 15 degrees below zero.

534
00:48:16,022 --> 00:48:21,181
There's love in that cake.
This man's love and this man's care--

535
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,648
-Oh, my Christ!
-You bastard.

536
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:30,191
All right, we will eat the cake.

537
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:33,870
They're right.
It's too good a cake not to eat.

538
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,331
-Get the plates and knives, Walters.
-Yes, sir. How many?

539
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:38,450
Six.

540
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,713
Better make it five.

541
00:48:41,798 --> 00:48:44,668
-Tablecloth, sir?
-Yes, get the tablecloth.

542
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,718
No, no, I'll get the tablecloth.

543
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:51,426
You better get the gate-leg table, Hordern.

544
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:53,717
-And the little lamp, sir?
-Yes.

545
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,468
While you're at it, you'd better get a doily.

546
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,767
I'll bring two in case one gets crumpled.

547
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,018
Okay!

548
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,064
But, of course, warfare isn't all fun.
Right. Stop that.

549
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:10,820
It's all very well to laugh at the military,
but when one considers...

550
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,954
...the meaning of life, it's a struggle
between alternative viewpoints of life.

551
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,790
Without the ability to defend
one's own viewpoint...

552
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:20,412
...against other
more aggressive ideologies...

553
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:24,202
...then reasonableness and
moderation could quite simply disappear.

554
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,544
That is why we'll always need an army.

555
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:30,676
May God strike me down
were it to be otherwise.

556
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,888
Don't stand there gawping...

557
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,646
...like you've never seen
the hand of God before!

558
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,857
Now, today we're going to do
marching up and down the square.

559
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:47,816
That is, unless any of you've got
anything better to do.

560
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,067
Well?

561
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,945
Anyone got anything
they'd rather be doing...

562
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:57,285
...than marchin' up and down the square?

563
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:01,699
Yes! Atkinson.

564
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,629
What would you rather be doing, Atkinson?

565
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,005
To be quite honest, Sarge,
I'd rather be home with the wife and kids.

566
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:16,180
Would you now?

567
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,095
Yes, Sarge.

568
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:20,261
Right. Off you go.

569
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,591
Now.

570
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,976
Everybody else happy with my little plan...

571
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:28,026
...of marching up and down
the square a bit?

572
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,439
-Sarge?
-Yes?

573
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:33,650
-I've got a book I'd quite like to read.
-Go read your book then. Now!

574
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:38,782
Everybody else quite content to join in...

575
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:44,959
...with my little scheme
of marchin' up and down the square?

576
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,789
Sarge?

577
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,419
Yes, Wyclif, what is it?

578
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,748
Well, I'm learning the piano.

579
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,294
Learning the piano?

580
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:56,841
Yes, Sarge.

581
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:00,387
And I suppose you want to go practice?

582
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,308
Marchin' up and down the square
not good enough for you?

583
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,103
-Well--
-Right! Off you go!

584
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,482
Now, what about the rest of you?

585
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,029
Rather be at the pictures, I suppose.

586
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,194
All right! Off you go!

587
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,370
Bloody army.
I don't know what it's coming to.

588
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,625
Right. Sergeant Major
marching up and down the square.

589
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,914
Democracy and humanitarianism
are trademarks of the British Army.

590
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,087
Rubbish!

591
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,720
And have stamped its triumph
in the furthest-flung corners of the Empire.

592
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,073
But no matter where or when
there was fighting to be done...

593
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:05,074
...it has always been
the calm leadership of the officer class...

594
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,247
...that has made the British Army
what it is.

595
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,367
Excuse me.

596
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,709
-Morning, Ainsworth.
-Morning, Pakenham. Sleep well?

597
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:57,327
Not bad. Bitten to shreds, though.

598
00:52:57,422 --> 00:52:59,711
Must be that hole
in the bloody mosquito net.

599
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:02,374
Yes, savage little blighters, aren't they?

600
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:04,796
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes, Chadwick?

601
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:07,807
I'm afraid Perkins got badly bitten
during the night.

602
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:09,054
So did we.

603
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:11,847
Yes, but I do think Doctor
ought to see him.

604
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:14,979
-Well, go and fetch him then.
-Right you are, sir.

605
00:53:15,232 --> 00:53:17,557
Suppose I'd better go along.
Coming, Pakenham?

606
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:19,109
Yes, I suppose so.

607
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:23,697
Come on, boy.

608
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,078
-Morning, Perkins.
-Morning, sir.

609
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,409
What's all the trouble, then?

610
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,829
Bitten, sir. During the night.

611
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,956
-Whole leg gone?
-Yes.

612
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:47,175
-How's it feel?
-Stings a bit.

613
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,839
Well, it would, wouldn't it?

614
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,641
That's quite a bite you've got there.

615
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:57,305
-Yes. A real beauty, isn't it?
-Any idea how it happened?

616
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,063
None whatsoever.
Complete mystery to me.

617
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:02,855
Woke up just now, one sock too many.

618
00:54:03,362 --> 00:54:06,814
-Must have a hell of a hole in your net.
-We've sent for the doctor.

619
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:09,824
-Hardly worth it, is it?
-Yes. Better safe than sorry.

620
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,819
Yes. Good Lord, look at this.

621
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:13,988
By Jove! That's enormous.

622
00:54:14,122 --> 00:54:16,530
You don't think it'll come back, do you?

623
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:18,001
-For more, you mean?
-Yes.

624
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:20,078
-We'd better get it stitched.
-Right.

625
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:21,415
Hello, doc!

626
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:25,455
Morning. I came as fast as I could.
Is something up?

627
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:30,386
Yes. During the night,
old Perkins got his leg bitten, sort of, off.

628
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:33,766
Yeah. Been in the wars, have we?

629
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:35,388
Yes.

630
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:37,679
Any headache? Bowels all right?

631
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:42,105
Well, let's have a look at
this one leg of yours, then.

632
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:45,352
Yes. Yes.

633
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,563
Yes, well, this is nothing to worry about.

634
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,566
Good.

635
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,574
There's a lot of it about. Probably a virus.
Keep warm, plenty of rest...

636
00:54:55,664 --> 00:54:59,448
...and if you're playing football or anything,
try and favour the other leg.

637
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:00,491
Right.

638
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:02,910
As right as rain in a couple of days.

639
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:06,503
-Thanks for the reassurance.
-Not at all. That's what I'm here for.

640
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,046
Any other problems
I can reassure you about?

641
00:55:09,135 --> 00:55:10,464
No, I'm fine.

642
00:55:10,554 --> 00:55:12,629
Jolly good. Well, must be off.

643
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,967
So it'll just grow back again, then, will it?

644
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:22,813
I think I'd better come clean with you
about this.

645
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:26,231
It's not a virus, I'm afraid.

646
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:30,770
You see, a virus is what we doctors call
very, very small.

647
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:34,400
So small it could not possibly
have made off with a whole leg.

648
00:55:34,577 --> 00:55:37,862
What we're looking for,
this is no more than an educated guess...

649
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:41,241
...I'd like to make that clear,
is some multi-cellular life form...

650
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:45,663
...with stripes, huge, razor-sharp teeth,
about 11-foot long...

651
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:48,043
...and of the genus felis horribilis.

652
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:51,132
What we doctors, in fact, call a tiger.

653
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,630
A tiger?

654
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:55,554
A tiger?

655
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,553
A tiger in Africa?

656
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:03,721
A tiger in Africa?

657
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:09,731
-It's probably escaped from a zoo.
-Doesn't sound very likely to me.

658
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,940
Sir! Sir!

659
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,942
The attack's over, sir.
The Zulus are retreating.

660
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:16,231
Jolly good.

661
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:19,777
Quite a lot of casualties, sir.
C-division wiped out. Signal's gone.

662
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:22,029
-Thirty men killed in F-section.
-I see.

663
00:56:22,123 --> 00:56:24,615
I should think
about 150 men altogether, sir.

664
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,788
Jolly good.

665
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:29,460
I haven't got the final figures,
but there's a lot of seriously wounded--

666
00:56:29,546 --> 00:56:33,082
Yes, the thing is, Sergeant,
I've got a bit of a problem here.

667
00:56:35,094 --> 00:56:37,301
One of the officers has lost a leg.

668
00:56:38,181 --> 00:56:41,929
-Oh, no, sir!
-I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger.

669
00:56:42,476 --> 00:56:43,722
In Africa?

670
00:56:44,354 --> 00:56:48,018
The M.O. says we can stitch it back on
if we can find it immediately.

671
00:56:48,107 --> 00:56:52,520
-Right, sir. I'll organize a party.
-It's hardly the time for that, Sergeant.

672
00:56:53,653 --> 00:56:56,821
-A search party.
-Much better idea.

673
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,074
Sorry about the mess.

674
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:05,701
We'll try to clear it up
by the time you get back.

675
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,033
-We showed 'em, didn't we, sir?
-Yes.

676
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:10,166
We got a search party. Leave that alone.

677
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:13,373
All this killing, bloodshed,
bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?

678
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:14,415
Yes, very good.

679
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:17,213
-Morning, sir.
-Nasty wound you've got there, fella.

680
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,046
Thank you very much, sir.

681
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:22,920
Come on, Private.
Making up a search party.

682
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:26,432
Better than staying home, isn't it?

683
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,803
At home if you kill someone,
they arrest you.

684
00:57:28,897 --> 00:57:31,388
Here, they give you a gun
and show you what to do.

685
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:35,730
I mean, I killed 15 of those buggers, sir.
At home, they'd hang me.

686
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:38,942
Here, they'll give me a fucking medal, sir.

687
00:57:55,882 --> 00:57:57,292
Sorry, sir.

688
00:57:57,883 --> 00:57:59,260
Thank you.

689
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,024
Look!

690
00:58:20,323 --> 00:58:22,315
My God! It's huge!

691
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:35,295
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
We're not a tiger.

692
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:37,706
We were just....

693
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:41,088
Why are you dressed as a tiger?

694
00:58:43,762 --> 00:58:47,012
-Oh, why, why, why?
-lsn't it a lovely day today?

695
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:49,050
Answer the question.

696
00:58:49,644 --> 00:58:54,434
-We were just--
-Well, we're dressed like this because....

697
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:56,941
No, that's not it.

698
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:59,897
We did it for a laugh.
Part of a spree. High spirits.

699
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:02,229
-Simple as that.
-Nothing more to it.

700
00:59:03,198 --> 00:59:06,317
Actually, we're on a mission
for British intelligence.

701
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:10,568
-There's a pro-tsarist Ashanti Chief--
-No, no, no.

702
00:59:10,705 --> 00:59:13,576
-No, no, no.
-No. We're doing it for an advertisement.

703
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,992
That's it. Forget about the Russians.

704
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,457
We're doing an advert
for Tiger Brand Coffee.

705
00:59:18,546 --> 00:59:22,626
"Tiger brand coffee is a real treat.
Even tigers prefer a cup of it to real meat."

706
00:59:22,717 --> 00:59:25,042
-Now, look--
-All right, all right.

707
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:28,755
We are dressed as a tiger because
he has an auntie who did it in 1839.

708
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:31,718
-This is the 50th anniversary.
-We're doing it for a bet.

709
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:35,475
-God told us to do it.
-To tell the truth, we are completely mad.

710
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:38,267
We're inmates
of a Bengali psychiatric institution...

711
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:42,568
...and we escaped by making this skin
out of old used cereal packets.

712
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:45,478
-lt doesn't matter!
-What?

713
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:48,402
lt doesn't matter
why they're dressed as a tiger.

714
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:50,366
Have they got my leg?

715
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:53,368
Good thinking. Well, have you?

716
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,498
-Actually--
-Yes?

717
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,241
We were thinking
of training as taxidermists.

718
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,826
We wanted the feel
from the animal's point of view.

719
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:06,129
Quiet! Now look, we're just asking you
if you've got this man's leg.

720
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:09,214
-A wooden leg?
-No, no, a proper leg.

721
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:13,681
He was fast asleep, and someone
or something came in and removed it.

722
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:16,559
Without waking him up?

723
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:20,895
-Yes.
-I don't believe you.

724
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:23,771
We found the tiger skin
in a bicycle shop in Cairo.

725
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,103
The owner wanted it
taken to Dar es Salaam.

726
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:30,276
Shut up! Now look,
have you or have you not got his leg?

727
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,701
-Yes. No.
-No, no.

728
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,453
-Why did you say yes?
-I didn't.

729
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,332
I'm not talking to you.

730
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:49,670
Right. Search the thicket.

731
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:54,216
Come on. Do we look like the sort of
chaps who'd creep into a camp at night...

732
01:00:54,307 --> 01:00:57,676
...steal into someone's tent,
anesthetize them, tissue-type 'em...

733
01:00:57,769 --> 01:01:00,176
...amputate a leg and run away with it?

734
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:01,764
Search the thicket.

735
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:04,480
Leg! You're looking for a leg!

736
01:01:04,776 --> 01:01:07,480
Actually, I think there is one
in there somewhere.

737
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,736
Someone must've abandoned it here,
knowing you'd come after it.

738
01:01:10,823 --> 01:01:14,274
We stumbled across it, actually.
They'll be miles away by now.

739
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,369
I expect we'll have to take
all the blame as usual.

740
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:22,035
Hello, good evening and welcome to
The Middle of the Film.

741
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:31,581
Hello, and welcome to
The Middle of the Film...

742
01:01:31,677 --> 01:01:34,346
...the moment where we take a break
to invite you...

743
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:38,297
...to join us, the filmmakers,
in Find the Fish.

744
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:41,847
We're going to show you
a scene from another film...

745
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:44,344
...and ask you to guess where the fish is.

746
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:47,226
But if you think you know,
don't keep it to yourselves.

747
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:49,689
Yell out so that all the cinema
can hear you.

748
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:52,862
So here we are with Find the Fish.

749
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:05,666
I wonder where that fish has gone.

750
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:08,294
You did love it so.

751
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:10,917
You looked after it like a son.

752
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:15,795
And it went wherever I did go.

753
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:19,257
-Is it in the cupboard?
-Yes!

754
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:23,768
Wouldn't you like to know?
lt was a lovely little fish.

755
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:28,848
And it went wherever I did go.

756
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:33,024
-It's behind the sofa!
-Where can that fish be?

757
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:36,151
Have you thought of the drawers
in the bureau?

758
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:38,992
lt is a most elusive fish.

759
01:02:39,118 --> 01:02:43,032
And it went wherever I did go.

760
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:47,239
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

761
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:52,005
Fish, fish, fish....

762
01:02:54,257 --> 01:02:57,093
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish!

763
01:02:57,385 --> 01:03:01,633
That went wherever I did go.

764
01:03:01,722 --> 01:03:04,760
-Look up his trunk!
-Yeah! It's in his trousers!

765
01:03:05,143 --> 01:03:07,266
-That was terrific!
-Great! Yeah!

766
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:10,102
-Best bit so far.
-Fantastic!

767
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:13,391
Really risky, yeah.

768
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:20,696
They haven't said much about
the meaning of life so far, have they?

769
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:23,156
-Well, it's been building up to it.
-Has it?

770
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:25,617
Yeah, I expect they'll get onto it now.

771
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:30,992
Personally, I doubt they're going to say
anything about the meaning of life at all.

772
01:03:31,127 --> 01:03:33,878
-They've gotta say something.
-They're bound to.

773
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:35,126
Yeah.

774
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:42,254
-What do you think the next bit will be?
-Caption, I expect.

775
01:03:42,347 --> 01:03:44,884
About the next stage of life, you mean?
Here we go.

776
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:48,518
Could've guessed it.

777
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:56,933
That's much better. Thank you, honey.

778
01:03:57,027 --> 01:03:58,308
You're welcome.

779
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:03,322
lt was all sort of misty before. That's fine.

780
01:04:03,784 --> 01:04:07,284
-Hey! How are you?
-We're just fine.

781
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:09,695
What kind of food
would you like this evening?

782
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:11,947
We sort of like pineapple.

783
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:13,999
Yeah, we love pineapple.

784
01:04:14,169 --> 01:04:17,086
Yeah, anything with pineapple
in it is great for us.

785
01:04:17,214 --> 01:04:19,539
How about the Dungeon Room?

786
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:23,295
-That sounds fine.
-Sure is. It's real Hawaiian food...

787
01:04:23,386 --> 01:04:27,680
...served in an authentic
medieval-English-dungeon atmosphere.

788
01:04:43,197 --> 01:04:44,574
lsn't this nice?

789
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:46,938
How are ya?

790
01:04:48,203 --> 01:04:49,744
Take a little Kodak.

791
01:04:49,954 --> 01:04:52,030
Thank you. Thank you very much.

792
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:08,673
Good evening. Would you care for
something to talk about?

793
01:05:08,763 --> 01:05:13,059
-That would be wonderful.
-Our special tonight is minorities.

794
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,431
That sounds real interesting.

795
01:05:15,813 --> 01:05:17,971
What's this conversation here?

796
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:21,600
That's football. You can talk about
the Steelers-Bears game Saturday...

797
01:05:21,694 --> 01:05:24,647
...or you could reminisce
about really great World Series.

798
01:05:24,738 --> 01:05:25,734
No, no.

799
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:29,239
-What is this one here?
-That's philosophy.

800
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,285
Is that a sport?

801
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,911
No, it's more of an attempt
to construct a viable hypothesis...

802
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,998
...to explain the meaning of life.

803
01:05:38,377 --> 01:05:40,535
-What was that?
-What's he saying?

804
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,582
That sounds wonderful.

805
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:46,339
Would you like to talk about
the meaning of life, darling?

806
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:47,927
Sure. Why not?

807
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:49,969
-Philosophy for two?
-Right.

808
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:52,096
-Room?
-259.

809
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,890
259.

810
01:05:55,936 --> 01:05:57,180
How do we...?

811
01:05:57,437 --> 01:05:59,678
You folks want me to start you off?

812
01:05:59,897 --> 01:06:01,144
We'd appreciate that.

813
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:02,264
Okay!

814
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:07,563
Look. Have you ever wondered
just why you're here?

815
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,818
We went to Miami last year
and California the year before--

816
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:16,529
No, no, no. I mean,
why we're here, on this planet.

817
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:21,038
No.

818
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:25,339
Right. You ever wanted to know
what it's all about?

819
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:26,878
Nope.

820
01:06:27,425 --> 01:06:28,539
Righty-ho!

821
01:06:28,843 --> 01:06:33,137
See, throughout history,
there have been certain men and women...

822
01:06:33,264 --> 01:06:37,308
...who've tried to find
the solution to the mysteries of existence.

823
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,143
-Great!
-And we call these guys philosophers.

824
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:43,720
-And that's what we're talking about.
-Right!

825
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:45,097
That's neat.

826
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:49,687
You look you're getting the idea,
so I'll give you these conversation cards.

827
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:54,323
They'll tell you a little about philosophical
method, names of famous philosophers.

828
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:55,608
There you are.

829
01:06:55,703 --> 01:06:58,869
-Have a nice conversation.
-Thank you very much.

830
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,082
-He's cute.
-Yeah, real understanding.

831
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,419
I never knew Schopenhauer was
a philosopher.

832
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:11,505
Yeah. He's the one that begins
with an "S."

833
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:20,011
Like Nietzsche.

834
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:24,310
Does "Nietzsche" begin with an "S"?

835
01:07:25,899 --> 01:07:28,224
There's an "S" in "Nietzsche."

836
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:32,276
Yes, there is.

837
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:35,939
Do all philosophers have an "S" in them?

838
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:38,489
Yeah. I think most of them do.

839
01:07:40,746 --> 01:07:43,831
Does that mean Selina Jones
is a philosopher?

840
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:45,281
Yeah! Right!

841
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:48,911
She could be.
She sings about the meaning of life.

842
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:50,921
Yeah. That's right.

843
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:53,963
But I don't think she writes
her own material.

844
01:07:54,052 --> 01:07:55,131
No.

845
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:58,180
Maybe Schopenhauer writes her material.

846
01:07:58,597 --> 01:08:01,303
No. Burt Bacharach writes it.

847
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:04,557
There's no "S" in "Burt Bacharach."

848
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:06,722
Or in "Hal David."

849
01:08:07,774 --> 01:08:09,232
Who's Hal David?

850
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,686
He writes the lyrics.
Burt just writes the tunes.

851
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:16,403
Only now,
he's married to Carol Beyer Seger.

852
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:22,536
Waiter? This conversation isn't very good.

853
01:08:22,621 --> 01:08:24,198
I'm sorry, sir.

854
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:27,865
We do have one today
that's not on the menu.

855
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,088
It's sort of a specialty of the house,
you know? Live organ transplants.

856
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:35,128
Live organ transplants? What's that?

857
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:47,641
Don't worry, dear. I'll get it.

858
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:57,357
-Yes?
-Hello. Can we have your liver?

859
01:08:58,282 --> 01:09:00,321
-What?
-Your liver.

860
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:04,611
It's a large glandular organ
in your abdomen.

861
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:08,826
You know, it's reddish-brown, sort of--

862
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:12,866
Yeah, yeah, I know what it is,
but I'm using it.

863
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:18,376
Come on, sir. Don't muck us about.

864
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:21,167
Hello!

865
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:25,676
-What's this, then?
-A liver donor's card.

866
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:28,138
-Need we say more?
-No.

867
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:31,927
Listen, I can't give it you now.
lt says, "in the event of death."

868
01:09:32,022 --> 01:09:33,018
My God!

869
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,855
No one has ever had their liver taken out
by us and survived.

870
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,649
Just lie there, sir. lt won't take a minute.

871
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:55,414
Here. What's going on?

872
01:09:55,504 --> 01:09:57,876
He's donating his liver, madam.

873
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,757
Is this because he took out
one of those silly cards?

874
01:10:01,886 --> 01:10:04,506
-That's right, madam.
-Typical of him.

875
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:08,424
He goes down to the public library,
sees a few signs up...

876
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:11,470
...comes home all full of good intentions.

877
01:10:11,894 --> 01:10:15,726
He gives blood, does cold research,
all that sort of thing.

878
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:22,357
What do you do with them all, anyway?

879
01:10:22,613 --> 01:10:24,689
They all go to saving lives, madam.

880
01:10:24,782 --> 01:10:26,277
That's what he used to say.

881
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:29,534
"It's all for the good of the country,"
he used to say.

882
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:33,414
Do you think it's all
for the good of the country?

883
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:36,454
Do you think it's all
for the good of the country?

884
01:10:36,544 --> 01:10:40,542
I wouldn't know about that, madam.
We're just doing our jobs, you know?

885
01:10:41,882 --> 01:10:44,207
You're not doctors, then?

886
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,750
Blimey, no.

887
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:51,883
Mum, Dad, I'm off out now.
I'll see you about 7:00?

888
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:54,977
Right, son. Look after yourself.

889
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:02,687
You fancy a cup of tea?

890
01:11:04,113 --> 01:11:06,485
That'd be very nice. Thank you.

891
01:11:07,157 --> 01:11:09,826
Thank you very much, madam.

892
01:11:11,662 --> 01:11:13,571
I thought she'd never ask.

893
01:11:17,876 --> 01:11:20,663
You do realize he has to be...

894
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:24,714
...dead by the terms of the card...

895
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:27,174
...before he donates his liver.

896
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,210
I told him that, but he never listens to me,
silly man.

897
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:33,139
I mean, I was wonderin'...

898
01:11:34,267 --> 01:11:36,936
...what you was thinkin' of doin' after that.

899
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:39,731
I mean will you stay on your own?

900
01:11:40,106 --> 01:11:44,151
Or is there, well, someone else, sort of...

901
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,897
...on the horizon?

902
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:51,405
I'm too old for that sort of thing.
I'm past my prime.

903
01:11:51,493 --> 01:11:54,612
Not at all. Very attractive woman.

904
01:11:55,455 --> 01:11:59,404
Well, I'm certainly not thinking
of getting hitched up again.

905
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,417
-Sure?
-Sure.

906
01:12:10,678 --> 01:12:12,551
Can we have your liver then?

907
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:14,382
I would be scared.

908
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:15,672
All right.

909
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:18,845
I'll tell you what.

910
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:21,264
Listen to this.

911
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:25,316
"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown

912
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,522
"And things seem hard or tough

keeps on expanding and expanding

932
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:35,234
"In all of the directions it can whizz

933
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:40,188
"As fast as it can go
The speed of light you know

934
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:43,782
"Twelve million miles a minute
and that's the fastest speed there is

935
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:47,950
"So remember when you're feeling
very small and insecure

936
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:51,533
"How amazingly unlikely is your birth

937
01:14:52,378 --> 01:14:55,995
"And pray that there's intelligent life
somewhere up in space

938
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:59,091
"'Cause there's bugger all
down here on earth"

939
01:15:04,348 --> 01:15:06,921
Makes you feel so insignificant, doesn't it?

940
01:15:07,017 --> 01:15:08,761
Yeah.

941
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:13,229
Can we have your liver, then?

942
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:16,521
-Yeah, all right. You talked me into it.
-Eric!

943
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:28,829
Which brings us, once again,
to the urgent realization...

944
01:15:28,913 --> 01:15:32,081
...of just how much there is
still left to own.

945
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:37,960
Item 6 on the agenda:
"The Meaning of Life."

946
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:42,791
Now, Harry,
you've had some thoughts on this.

947
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:46,301
I've had a team working on this
over the past few weeks.

948
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:50,766
What we've come up with can be reduced
to two fundamental concepts.

949
01:15:51,478 --> 01:15:54,229
One: people are not wearing enough hats.

950
01:15:55,022 --> 01:15:57,348
Two: matter is energy.

951
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:02,397
In the universe, there are many energy
fields which we cannot normally perceive.

952
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:07,860
Some energies have a spiritual source
which act upon a person's soul.

953
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:12,404
However,
this soul does not exist ab initio...

954
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:14,954
...as orthodox Christianity teaches.

955
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:20,411
lt has to be brought into existence
by a process of guided self-observation.

956
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:25,125
However, this is rarely achieved
owing to man's unique ability...

957
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:29,632
...to be distracted from spiritual matters
by everyday trivia.

958
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:35,933
What was that about hats again?

959
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,478
People aren't wearing enough.

960
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:40,942
Is this true?

961
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:44,900
Certainly. Hat sales have increased,
but not pari passu as our research--

962
01:16:44,988 --> 01:16:47,445
When you say "enough",
enough for what purpose?

963
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:50,201
Can I just ask,
with reference to your second point...

964
01:16:50,285 --> 01:16:54,413
...when you say souls don't develop
because people become distracted....

965
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,705
Has anyone noticed
that building there before?

966
01:17:02,255 --> 01:17:03,286
What?

967
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:04,579
Good Lord!

968
01:17:24,986 --> 01:17:26,149
Good Lord!

969
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:29,781
The Crimson Permanent Assurance!

970
01:17:32,285 --> 01:17:35,535
We interrupt this film to apologize
for this unwarranted attack...

971
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:37,199
...by the supporting feature.

972
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,042
Luckily, we have been prepared
for this eventuality...

973
01:17:40,126 --> 01:17:42,450
...and are now taking steps to remedy it.

974
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:44,827
Thank you.

975
01:17:51,095 --> 01:17:55,424
Good evening. Here's a little number
I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.

976
01:17:55,516 --> 01:17:58,220
"lsn't it awfully nice to have a penis

977
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,431
"lsn't it frightfully good to have a dong

978
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:04,766
"It's swell to have a stiffy
It's divine to own a dick

979
01:18:04,858 --> 01:18:08,310
"From the tiniest little tadger
to the world's biggest prick

980
01:18:08,404 --> 01:18:11,487
"So three cheers for your Willy
or John Thomas

981
01:18:11,948 --> 01:18:14,701
"Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake

982
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:18,534
"Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend
your Percy or your cock

983
01:18:18,622 --> 01:18:22,204
"You can wrap it up in ribbons
You can slip it in your sock

984
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:25,578
"But don't take it out in public
or they will stick you in the dock

985
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:29,170
"And you won't come back"
Thank you very much.

986
01:18:31,718 --> 01:18:35,217
-What a frightfully witty song.
-Terribly clever.

987
01:18:38,725 --> 01:18:40,634
-Jolly good.
-Marvellous.

988
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:50,600
Oh, shit! It's Mr. Creosote!

989
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,039
Good afternoon, sir,
and how are we today?

990
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,128
Better.

991
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:16,134
-Better?
-Better get a bucket. I'm gonna throw up.

992
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,297
Gaston? A bucket for monsieur.

993
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,053
There we are, monsieur.

994
01:19:39,993 --> 01:19:42,282
-Merci, Gaston.
-I haven't finished.

995
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:46,324
Pardon! Gaston?
A thousand pardons, monsieur.

996
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:50,794
Now, this afternoon, we have
monsieur's favorite: the jugged hare.

997
01:19:50,879 --> 01:19:55,505
The hare is very high,
and the sauce is very rich...

998
01:19:55,717 --> 01:20:00,674
...with truffles, anchovies,
Grand Marnier, bacon and cream.

999
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:02,175
Thank you, Gaston.

1000
01:20:02,349 --> 01:20:04,009
There's still more.

1001
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,428
Allow me.

1002
01:20:07,394 --> 01:20:09,222
A new bucket for monsieur.

1003
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:14,566
And the cleaning woman.

1004
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:20,654
Et maintenant,
would monsieur care for an aperitif...

1005
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:23,453
...or would he prefer
to order straight away?

1006
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:28,202
Today, we have for appetizers....
Excuse me.

1007
01:20:30,251 --> 01:20:35,412
Moules marinieres, pate de foie gras,
beluga caviar, eggs Benedictine...

1008
01:20:35,506 --> 01:20:37,712
...tarte de poireaux, that's leek tart...

1009
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:41,501
...frogs' legs amandine
or oeufs de caille Richard Shepherd.

1010
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:45,634
C'est a dire, little quails' eggs
on a bed of pureed mushrooms.

1011
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:47,717
It's very delicate, very succulent.

1012
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,268
I'll have the lot.

1013
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:52,264
A wise choice, monsieur.

1014
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:56,895
And now, how would you like it served?
All mixed up together in a bucket?

1015
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,108
Yeah. With the eggs on top.

1016
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:03,152
-But of course. Avec les oeufs frits.
-Don't skimp on the pate.

1017
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:06,693
I assure you. Just because it's mixed up
with all the other things...

1018
01:21:06,787 --> 01:21:09,408
...we wouldn't give you
less than the full amount.

1019
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,412
In fact, I will personally make sure
you have a double helping.

1020
01:21:13,961 --> 01:21:16,831
Maintenant, quelque chose a boire.
Something to drink?

1021
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:20,255
Yeah, I'll have six bottles
of Chateau-Latour '45.

1022
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,334
And a double jeroboam of champagne.

1023
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,801
Bon. And the usual brown ales?

1024
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:30,184
Yeah. No, wait a minute. I think
I could only manage six crates today.

1025
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:33,810
I hope monsieur was not
overdoing it last night.

1026
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:36,769
-Shut up!
-D'accord.

1027
01:21:37,442 --> 01:21:40,193
The new bucket and the cleaning woman.

1028
01:21:46,826 --> 01:21:50,491
-Is there something wrong with the food?
-No, the food was excellent.

1029
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,949
-You're not happy with the service?
-No, no complaints.

1030
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:57,875
It's just that we have to go.
I'm having rather a heavy period.

1031
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,869
And we have a train to catch.

1032
01:22:02,007 --> 01:22:05,211
Yes, of course. We have a train to catch.

1033
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:08,588
And I don't want to start bleeding
all over the seats.

1034
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:11,761
-Madam?
-Perhaps we should be going?

1035
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:17,897
Very well, monsieur. Thank you so much.
So nice to see you.

1036
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:21,436
I hope very much
we will see you again very soon.

1037
01:22:21,527 --> 01:22:23,068
Au revoir, messieurs.

1038
01:22:23,862 --> 01:22:27,029
Oh, dear. I have trodden
in monsieur's bucket.

1039
01:22:30,994 --> 01:22:33,236
Another bucket for monsieur!

1040
01:22:35,249 --> 01:22:37,241
And perhaps a hose.

1041
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:43,624
Oh, Max. Really!

1042
01:22:59,397 --> 01:23:02,516
Finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin mint.

1043
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:06,276
Sir, it's only a tiny, little thin one.

1044
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:09,738
-No, fuck off. I'm full.
-Sir.

1045
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:13,908
It's only wafer thin.

1046
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:18,870
I couldn't eat another thing.
I'm absolutely stuffed.

1047
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:20,453
Bug off.

1048
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:23,289
Sir, just one. Just one.

1049
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:30,426
-All right. Just one.
-Just the one, monsieur.

1050
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:32,882
Voila.

1051
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,186
Bon appetit.

1052
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:25,021
Thank you, monsieur,
and now, here's your check.

1053
01:24:57,972 --> 01:25:01,387
You know, Maria,
I sometimes wonder if we'll...

1054
01:25:02,393 --> 01:25:05,061
...ever discover the meaning of it all...

1055
01:25:05,353 --> 01:25:07,761
...working in a place like this.

1056
01:25:07,856 --> 01:25:11,770
Well, I've worked in worse places,
philosophically speaking.

1057
01:25:11,859 --> 01:25:13,059
Really, Maria?

1058
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:14,268
Yes.

1059
01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:17,989
I used to work in the Academie francaise.

1060
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:20,775
But it didn't do me any good at all.

1061
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,580
I once worked in the library
in the Prado in Madrid...

1062
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:29,208
...but it didn't teach me nothin', I recall.

1063
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:34,456
And the Library of Congress
you'd have thought would hold some key...

1064
01:25:34,883 --> 01:25:38,715
...but it didn't, and neither did
the Bodleian Library.

1065
01:25:39,554 --> 01:25:43,598
In the British Museum,
I hoped to find some clue.

1066
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:48,686
I worked there from 9:00 'til 6:00,
read every volume through...

1067
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,478
...but it didn't teach me nothing
about life's mystery.

1068
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:58,357
I just kept getting older,
and it got more difficult to see.

1069
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:03,068
'Til eventually, me eyes went,
and me arthritis got bad.

1070
01:26:03,578 --> 01:26:06,364
So now, I'm cleaning up in here.

1071
01:26:07,832 --> 01:26:10,074
But I can't be really sad...

1072
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:13,708
...'cause you see, I feel that life's a game.

1073
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:16,793
You sometimes win or lose...

1074
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:19,961
...and though I may be down right now...

1075
01:26:20,135 --> 01:26:23,137
...at least I don't work for Jews.

1076
01:26:28,018 --> 01:26:29,299
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:33,689
I had no idea we had a racist working here.

1078
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:37,813
I apologize most sincerely. I mean....

1079
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:42,567
Where are you going? No, I can explain.

1080
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,283
As for me...

1081
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:53,162
...if you want to know what I think,
I'll show you something.

1082
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:58,713
-Come with me.
-I was saying that....

1083
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:01,508
-Hello?
-Come on.

1084
01:27:02,302 --> 01:27:03,499
Hello?

1085
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,099
This way.

1086
01:27:13,605 --> 01:27:15,312
Come on. Don't be shy.

1087
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,807
Mind the stairs, all right?

1088
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,487
I think this will help explain.

1089
01:27:32,874 --> 01:27:34,367
Come along.

1090
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:38,868
Over here.

1091
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,050
Come on. Come on.

1092
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,100
This way.

1093
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,182
Come on.

1094
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,610
This way.

1095
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,029
Stay by me?

1096
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,957
Nearly there now.

1097
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:28,420
You see that?

1098
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,219
That's where I was born.

1099
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:37,760
You know, one day...

1100
01:28:38,312 --> 01:28:41,480
...my mother put me on her knee
and she said to me:

1101
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,691
"Gaston, my son.

1102
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,482
"The world is a beautiful place.

1103
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:53,398
"You must go into it and love everyone.

1104
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:57,362
"Try to make everyone happy...

1105
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:02,870
"...and bring peace and contentment
everywhere you go."

1106
01:29:04,379 --> 01:29:06,253
So I became a waiter.

1107
01:29:14,973 --> 01:29:18,757
It's not much of a philosophy, I know.

1108
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:26,682
Fuck you. I can live my own life
in my own way if I want to.

1109
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:29,231
Fuck off.

1110
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:33,191
Don't come followin' me!

1111
01:30:10,153 --> 01:30:12,109
This man is about to die.

1112
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:15,365
In a few moments now, he will be killed...

1113
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:18,362
...for Arthur Jarrett
is a convicted criminal...

1114
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:22,698
...who has been allowed to choose
the manner of his own execution.

1115
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:27,615
There he is!

1116
01:30:42,392 --> 01:30:46,935
Arthur Charles Herbert Runcie
Macadam Jarrett...

1117
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:51,807
...you have been convicted
by 12 good persons, and true...

1118
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:56,737
...of the crime of first degree
making of gratuitous sexist jokes...

1119
01:30:57,157 --> 01:30:58,865
...in a moving picture.

1120
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:39,364
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

1121
01:31:43,743 --> 01:31:46,781
It's no good. I just can't go on.

1122
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:49,533
I'm no good anymore.

1123
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:52,416
I want to end it all!

1124
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,246
Good-bye! Good-bye!

1125
01:32:04,306 --> 01:32:05,717
Oh, my God!

1126
01:32:06,558 --> 01:32:08,016
Oh, no!

1127
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:12,394
What'll I do? I can't live without him!

1128
01:32:18,445 --> 01:32:20,817
-Mummy!
-Mum, where are you?

1129
01:32:20,905 --> 01:32:23,776
Daddy? Mummy?

1130
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:24,982
Mummy?

1131
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:32,924
Yes?

1132
01:33:34,937 --> 01:33:36,728
Is it about the hedge?

1133
01:33:39,525 --> 01:33:43,308
-I'm awfully sorry, but--
-I am the Grim Reaper.

1134
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:44,316
Who?

1135
01:33:44,403 --> 01:33:47,073
-The Grim Reaper.
-Yes, I see.

1136
01:33:47,491 --> 01:33:49,732
I am death.

1137
01:33:50,493 --> 01:33:53,743
Well, we have some people
from America for dinner tonight--

1138
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:56,403
-Who is it, darling?
-A Mr. Death or something.

1139
01:33:56,499 --> 01:33:59,833
He's come about the reaping?
I don't think we need any now.

1140
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:03,039
Hello. Don't leave him
hanging around outside. Ask him in.

1141
01:34:03,131 --> 01:34:06,749
-I don't think it's quite the moment.
-Do come in. Come and have a drink.

1142
01:34:06,843 --> 01:34:08,336
Do. Come on.

1143
01:34:12,015 --> 01:34:14,636
It's one of the little men from the village.

1144
01:34:15,267 --> 01:34:17,094
Do come in. Please.

1145
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:21,015
This is Howard Katzenberg
from Philadelphia.

1146
01:34:21,357 --> 01:34:23,848
-And his wife, Debbie.
-Hello there.

1147
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:27,695
And these are the Portland Smythes,
Jeremy and Fiona.

1148
01:34:27,822 --> 01:34:28,770
Good evening.

1149
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,442
This is Mr. Death.

1150
01:34:38,082 --> 01:34:40,833
-Well, do get Mr. Death a drink, darling.
-Yes.

1151
01:34:41,918 --> 01:34:43,828
Mr. Death is a reaper.

1152
01:34:44,421 --> 01:34:47,375
The Grim Reaper.

1153
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:50,041
Hardly surprising in this weather.

1154
01:34:52,762 --> 01:34:55,432
So you still reap around here, do you,
Mr. Death?

1155
01:34:55,516 --> 01:34:59,595
I am the Grim Reaper.

1156
01:35:00,353 --> 01:35:03,557
That's about all he says.
There's your drink, Mr. Death.

1157
01:35:03,732 --> 01:35:04,930
Do sit down.

1158
01:35:05,025 --> 01:35:09,070
We were just talking about some
of the awful problems facing the third--

1159
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:16,775
Would you prefer white?
I'm afraid we don't have any beer.

1160
01:35:17,036 --> 01:35:18,910
The Stilton's awfully good.

1161
01:35:19,789 --> 01:35:25,031
I am not of this world.

1162
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,085
Good Lord.

1163
01:35:29,799 --> 01:35:32,550
I am death.

1164
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:38,139
lsn't that extraordinary?

1165
01:35:38,223 --> 01:35:40,596
We were talking about death
five minutes ago.

1166
01:35:40,685 --> 01:35:44,634
Yes, we were. You know,
whether death is really the end--

1167
01:35:44,729 --> 01:35:47,517
As my husband Howard here feels,
or whether there is...

1168
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:50,277
...and one hates to use
words like "soul" or "spirit"--

1169
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:53,066
-What other words can one use?
-Exactly.

1170
01:35:53,156 --> 01:35:56,820
You do not understand.

1171
01:35:58,578 --> 01:36:00,570
No. Obviously not.

1172
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:03,580
-I'll tell you something, Mr. Death.
-You don't--

1173
01:36:03,665 --> 01:36:06,157
I'd like to express
on behalf of everybody here...

1174
01:36:06,252 --> 01:36:08,577
...what a really unique experience this is.

1175
01:36:08,671 --> 01:36:11,837
-Hear, hear.
-We're so delighted that you dropped in.

1176
01:36:12,258 --> 01:36:17,383
-Can I just finish, please?
-Mr. Death. Is there an afterlife?

1177
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:21,887
-If you could wait, please--
-You sure you wouldn't like some sherry--

1178
01:36:21,974 --> 01:36:24,300
Angela, I'd like to say this, please.

1179
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:26,766
-Quiet!
-Can I just say this, please?

1180
01:36:26,855 --> 01:36:31,232
Silence! I have come for you.

1181
01:36:33,862 --> 01:36:38,405
-You mean to--
-Take you away.

1182
01:36:39,951 --> 01:36:43,118
That is my purpose.

1183
01:36:44,706 --> 01:36:48,323
I am death.

1184
01:36:50,503 --> 01:36:53,587
Well, that's cast rather a gloom
over the evening, hasn't it?

1185
01:36:53,673 --> 01:36:56,923
I don't see it that way, Geoff.
I think we're dealing with...

1186
01:36:57,009 --> 01:37:00,045
...a potentially positive
learning experience that can--

1187
01:37:00,137 --> 01:37:03,009
Shut up! Shut up, you American.

1188
01:37:03,099 --> 01:37:05,803
You always talk, you Americans.

1189
01:37:06,268 --> 01:37:08,842
You talk and you talk and you say:

1190
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:14,099
"Let me tell you something"
and "I just wanna say this."

1191
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:17,687
Well, you're dead now, so shut up!

1192
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,689
-Dead?
-Dead.

1193
01:37:22,702 --> 01:37:25,867
-All of us?
-All of you.

1194
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:31,991
Now look here. You barge in here
quite uninvited, break glasses...

1195
01:37:32,085 --> 01:37:34,707
...then announce quite casually
that we're all dead.

1196
01:37:34,797 --> 01:37:37,714
I'd remind you
that you're a guest in this house--

1197
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:39,170
Be quiet!

1198
01:37:39,509 --> 01:37:43,258
Englishmen!
You're all so fucking pompous!

1199
01:37:44,347 --> 01:37:46,720
None of you have got any balls.

1200
01:37:48,518 --> 01:37:51,188
-Can I ask you a question?
-What?

1201
01:37:51,563 --> 01:37:54,480
How can we all have died
at the same time?

1202
01:38:07,453 --> 01:38:09,944
The salmon mousse.

1203
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,911
Darling, you didn't use canned salmon,
did you?

1204
01:38:14,585 --> 01:38:17,420
I'm most dreadfully embarrassed.

1205
01:38:18,381 --> 01:38:21,832
Now the time has come.

1206
01:38:23,302 --> 01:38:24,382
Follow.

1207
01:38:26,306 --> 01:38:27,680
Follow me.

1208
01:38:41,988 --> 01:38:44,443
Just testing. Sorry.

1209
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:49,528
Follow me. Now.

1210
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,622
Come.

1211
01:39:01,548 --> 01:39:04,253
The fishmonger promised me
he'd have some fresh salmon.

1212
01:39:04,342 --> 01:39:06,418
He's normally so reliable.

1213
01:39:06,511 --> 01:39:09,429
-Can we take our glasses?
-Good idea.

1214
01:39:13,142 --> 01:39:15,599
Hey! I didn't even eat the mousse.

1215
01:39:21,026 --> 01:39:23,398
Honestly, darling, I'm so embarrassed.

1216
01:39:23,487 --> 01:39:24,945
lt really is embarrassing.

1217
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:29,324
To serve salmon with botulism
at a dinner party is social death.

1218
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,866
-Shall we take our cars?
-Why not?

1219
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:35,695
Good idea.

1220
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:16,243
Behold paradise.

1221
01:40:18,249 --> 01:40:21,997
-I love it here, darling.
-Me, too, Marvin.

1222
01:40:22,503 --> 01:40:25,040
Hello. Welcome to Heaven.

1223
01:40:34,264 --> 01:40:37,135
Excuse me.
Could you just sign here, please, sir?

1224
01:40:38,102 --> 01:40:42,015
Thank you. There's a table for you
through there, in the restaurant.

1225
01:40:42,314 --> 01:40:46,561
-For the ladies.
-Afterlife mints. Thank you.

1226
01:40:46,652 --> 01:40:49,224
-Happy Christmas.
-Is it Christmas today?

1227
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,736
Of course, madam.
It's Christmas every day in Heaven.

1228
01:40:53,824 --> 01:40:55,699
-How about that?
-Lovely.

1229
01:41:40,663 --> 01:41:42,620
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1230
01:41:42,706 --> 01:41:46,870
It's truly a real honourable experience
to be here this evening...

1231
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:49,791
...a very wonderful and warm...

1232
01:41:49,922 --> 01:41:52,294
...and emotional moment for all of us.

1233
01:41:53,217 --> 01:41:57,878
And I'd like to sing a song for all of you.

1234
01:42:02,392 --> 01:42:06,093
"It's Christmas in Heaven

1235
01:42:06,521 --> 01:42:09,807
"All the children sing

1236
01:42:10,067 --> 01:42:12,688
"It's Christmas in Heaven

1237
01:42:13,111 --> 01:42:17,024
"Hark, hark, those church bells ring

1238
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:20,365
"It's Christmas in Heaven

1239
01:42:20,535 --> 01:42:23,701
"The snow falls from the sky

1240
01:42:24,163 --> 01:42:26,286
"But it's nice and warm

1241
01:42:26,457 --> 01:42:30,834
"And everyone looks smart and wears a tie

1242
01:42:36,967 --> 01:42:40,337
"It's Christmas in Heaven

1243
01:42:40,638 --> 01:42:43,424
"There's great films on TV

1244
01:42:44,309 --> 01:42:47,723
"The Sound of Music twice an hour

1245
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,932
"And Jaws I, II and III

1246
01:42:51,566 --> 01:42:55,100
"There's gifts for all the family

1247
01:42:55,277 --> 01:42:58,314
"There's toiletries and trains

1248
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:02,156
"There's Sony Walkman headphone sets

1249
01:43:02,619 --> 01:43:05,737
"And the latest video games

"It's Christmas in Heaven

"Hip-hip-hooray

01:43:13,378 --> 01:43:18,621
"Every single day is Christmas Day

"Every single day is--"

1255
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:38,727
That's the end of the film.
Now here's the meaning of life.

1256
01:43:39,988 --> 01:43:41,815
Thank you, Brigitte.

1257
01:43:46,494 --> 01:43:49,780
It's nothing special.
"Try to be nice to people. Avoid eating fat.

1258
01:43:49,872 --> 01:43:52,446
"Read a good book now and then.
Get some walking in.

1259
01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:56,491
"Try to live together in peace and harmony
with people of all creeds and nations."

1260
01:43:56,587 --> 01:44:00,502
Finally, here are some gratuitous pictures
of penises to annoy the censors...

1261
01:44:00,592 --> 01:44:04,043
...and hopefully spark controversy,
which is the only way...

1262
01:44:04,136 --> 01:44:08,348
...to get the jaded video-sated public
off their asses and back in the cinema.

1263
01:44:08,849 --> 01:44:11,766
Family entertainment? Bollocks.
They want filth:

1264
01:44:11,977 --> 01:44:14,647
People doing things to each other
with chain saws.

1265
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:18,348
Babysitters stabbed with knitting
needles by gay presidential candidates.

1266
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:20,399
Vigilante groups strangling chickens.

1267
01:44:20,486 --> 01:44:23,356
Armed bands of theatre critics
exterminating mutant goats.

1268
01:44:23,447 --> 01:44:25,357
Where's the fun in pictures?

1269
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:27,987
Oh, well, there we are.
Here's the theme music.

1270
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:29,274
Good night.
