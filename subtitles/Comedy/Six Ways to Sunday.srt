1
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,634
For the last nine months, I

2
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,137
single-handedly saved my company

3
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:42,207
from being ravaged by Wall Street.

4
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,078
I mean, these jackals want
our pension fund.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,082
I'm talking poison pills, scorched earth,
killer bees.

6
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,853
And I'm pumping Nancy fucking Reagan

7
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,355
to anybody who'll listen.

8
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,656
Now, do they appreciate it?

9
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,124
Nancy fucking Reagan.

10
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,392
Do they?

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,097
Fuck no.

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,733
They turn it around, and
say I'm the problem.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,369
That I'm stifling progress.

14
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,670
I'm stifling progress?

15
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,338
Bullshit, you're shitting me.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,440
I mean, they're shitting me.

17
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,674
Come on.

18
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,511
A man can only take so much, you know?

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,915
Maybe you're right.

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,919
Maybe it's time for old Mikey to move on.

21
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,761
I mean, what do you do?

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,029
What do you do?

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
What do you do?

24
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,205
I don't think you can
deal what it is I do.

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,540
What?

26
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,942
Hey, look, man.

27
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,477
Whatever it is you're doing,
I can do it too, okay?

28
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,113
I mean, I'm tired of this
corporate bullshit.

29
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,315
I wanna feel free.

30
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,118
I wanna win the Super-Bowl,
you know?

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,953
At least I wanna get a stab at it.

32
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,723
I think you might just have to.

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,727
I'm just drunk enough
to talk about this shit.

34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,561
Okay...

35
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,666
Right, tell me what my new profession is.

36
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,835
When do I start, and let me at it.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,571
Contract killer.

38
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,744
Hey, where's my gun?

39
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,981
You're fucking...

40
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,016
Yeah, fucking right.

41
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,652
Oh, the people you meet.

42
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,356
You're not a contract killer, come on.

43
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,460
Not that I believe that you are,

44
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,595
but hey, between you and me?

45
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,597
It was kind of a secret fantasy of mine

46
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,865
when I was little, you know?

47
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,103
Hit man, the secret agent man, you know.

48
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,011
Two things I always wanted to do, but...

49
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,049
I ended up in that six by six-foot
fluorescent cubicle.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,353
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

51
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,454
Let's just say, hypothetically,

52
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,658
you are a contract killer.

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,792
Okay?

54
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,694
You're a contract killer.

55
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,063
You obviously have had
a little bit to drink,

56
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,398
but let's just entertain this notion,

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,899
just for a second, okay?

58
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,802
How do I get into the biz?

59
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,404
I don't know any contract killers

60
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,706
that actually want to
be contract killers.

61
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,410
There's no satisfaction in what we do.

62
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,512
Some people trade services for a living,

63
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,582
others trade commodities, we trade both.

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,985
Our services are our time,
effort, and skill.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,588
The commodity is human life.

66
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,092
That was freaking well-said, man.

67
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,894
I'm no dummy, and
that was well-said.

68
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,929
I'm gonna be a hitman.

69
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,197
I mean, a contract killer.

70
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,265
It sounds more professional.

71
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,633
Okay? I'm gonna be one.

72
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,268
Bang bang!

73
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,772
Oh, we got a new job.

74
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,177
So let me ask you this:

75
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,514
Who you gonna kill next, Frank Casper?

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,750
Who's your next mark?

77
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,929
You are.

78
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,242
Those that have witnessed execution

79
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,579
say there is no sound worse than
the weeping of a mother

80
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,948
watching her son being put to death.

81
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,117
They're wrong.

82
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,219
There is one sound that is worse.

83
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,955
There is silence.

84
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,665
I hear you have work for me.

85
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,235
I need a man killed.

86
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,038
High profile.

87
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,307
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

88
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,945
He is the number one cocaine distributor

89
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,180
in the entire North American continent.

90
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,616
He created the most efficient
and productive

91
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,519
drug pipeline since the era
of the cocaine cowboys.

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,522
His pipeline ships over a
thousand keys a week

93
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,091
of pure, uncut, Colombian cocaine,

94
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,061
by way of Belize and Mexico.

95
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,997
His U.S. distribution network

96
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,033
is the most intricate and
sophisticated network

97
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,103
ever created in the history
of the narcotics trade.

98
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,105
This all makes him the number one

99
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,108
North American resource
for the Mexican cartels.

100
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,144
So, I'm sure you can understand

101
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,213
why he's a very hard man to kill.

102
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,683
But he needs to be killed, at any cost.

103
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,219
I need the job done my way.

104
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,122
It sounds personal.

105
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,558
Yeah, it's personal..

106
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,363
My whole existence revolves
around the loss of his life.

107
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,166
I need his assassination to
be heard all over America.

108
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,202
And I want him six feet under.

109
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,905
I don't do loud.

110
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,041
It has to be my way.

111
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,877
I don't do loud.

112
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,380
Do you do two million dollars?

113
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,885
A million now, and a million
when the job's complete.

114
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,560
Before you kill him, I want you
to shake him to the core.

115
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,962
Just like he did to me.

116
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,165
Make sure that he feels
everything I felt.

117
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,269
First, he has a team of psychos

118
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,204
he hand-picked for
his protection.

119
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,674
These are the closest members
of his entourage.

120
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,376
They act on impulse and fear nothing.

121
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,580
They're exclusive imports
sent to him from Mexico

122
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,215
by top cartel leaders to ensure

123
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:49,287
safety of their primary interest,
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

124
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,590
Sundown trusts them with his life,

125
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,425
and he has no reason not to.

126
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,193
But I want to change that.

127
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,830
I need you to reduce 'em to nothing
in front of him.

128
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,899
Make him feel vulnerable.

129
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,635
Make him feel the deepest of fears,

130
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,203
knowing his turn is coming.

131
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,007
He carries a gun, at all times.

132
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,976
It's very personal to him.

133
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,243
I gave him this gun.

134
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,705
I want you to kill him with this gun.

135
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,574
It's the gun he killed me with.

136
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,510
But you're alive.

137
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,013
A man of your experience,

138
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,183
I'm sure you know there's more than
one way to kill a man.

139
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,887
There's a million dollars in the trunk.

140
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,090
Pick it up, walk away, and the job's on.

141
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,232
Hey, you need to come down really quick.

142
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,935
Charlie just got killed really good, man.

143
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,305
How much do you want?

144
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,243
I've got a lot of fucking money.

145
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,817
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll triple it.

146
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,687
Kill the man who sent you to me.

147
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,718
I did what you asked.

148
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,920
Where's my balance?

149
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,122
I have another job for you.

150
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,924
What the fuck do I look like to you, man?

151
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,492
You owe me four grand.

152
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,494
You pay me and I'm out of here.

153
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,897
It's in the glove box.

154
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,711
What other job?

155
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,047
I want you to kidnap someone for me.

156
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,549
Fucking kidnapping?

157
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,284
Are you out of your fucking mind, man?

158
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,952
That's three strikes for me.

159
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,854
That's 20 to life.

160
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,423
I fucked up the guy who was
messing with your wife,

161
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,525
well that's as far as I go.

162
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,694
I don't even have a wife.

163
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,196
Your girlfriend, then.

164
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,231
Whoever, like I give a fuck.

165
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,701
This just bought your buddy a
one-way trip to the hospital.

166
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,804
And I didn't even know the guy.

167
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,445
Well, so what...

168
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,482
You just paid me all this money
to kick some guy's ass,

169
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,384
that you don't even know?

170
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,887
Why?

171
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,989
See if you had the balls
for the next job.

172
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,724
Whatever, man.

173
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,228
Kidnap who?

174
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,164
Sonny Garcia's wife.

175
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,067
Oh, what!

176
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,138
You got some kinda deathwish, pal?

177
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,709
Payback, pure and simple.

178
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,110
Then why don't you just go after him?

179
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,312
Why, why kidnap the guy's wife?

180
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,914
Oh, I will.

181
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,750
But first of all, I want him to suffer.

182
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,519
To suffer as I did.

183
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,821
Then I will take his life.

184
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,353
That's a real cute story.

185
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,890
How much are we talking?

186
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,095
20 grand.

187
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,501
I want 40.

188
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,638
Well, I'll go outside and I'll pick
someone from the line.

189
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,939
They're queuing up for the job.

190
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:56,940
Alright, fine, fine.

191
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,208
We'll do 20.

192
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,111
I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet, so,

193
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,913
you gotta give me some time.

194
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,249
I've got it all set up for you.

195
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,520
She goes to the spa every Tuesday
at 3 p.m. sharp,

196
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,021
and she never fails.

197
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,223
Just herself, no driver.

198
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,193
It's the only time you will
find her out without him.

199
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,728
Now, things can change.

200
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,396
So I need you to keep watch

201
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,565
on the routine before you strike.

202
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,167
I tell you this because failure

203
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,069
is not an option on this job.

204
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,206
Sundown is usually not there.

205
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,309
But if one thing changes,
it could cost you dearly.

206
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,659
Don't make a move unless everything
is as it should be.

207
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,195
Sundown is no man to play with,

208
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,564
especially when it comes to his family.

209
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,242
Let me ask you a question.

210
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,446
This guy kills your girl.

211
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,916
Why are you only kidnapping his wife?

212
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,853
Why would you fuck up a 20 grand job

213
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,955
with all these questions?

214
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,592
Now, I'll be in touch.

215
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,693
Okay.

216
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,930
Alright.

217
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,608
18 seconds.

218
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,043
Hey, I need backup.

219
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:20,911
Wilshire and Graham.

220
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:21,979
I'm going in.

221
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,921
DEA, drop the gun!

222
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,922
Drop the gun!

223
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,924
Drop your gun, drop your gun,

224
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:34,691
Drop you...

225
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,637
Drop your gun!

226
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,839
Oh, fuck.

227
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,007
Put your hands where I can see them.

228
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,341
Put your goddamn hands up!

229
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,976
Fuck you!

230
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,656
Fuck!

231
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,158
Fuck me.

232
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,393
Ah, fuck.

233
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,503
Ah, fuck!

234
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,809
Señora...

235
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,821
A little hiccup.

236
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,456
Let's delay the operation.

237
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,458
You mean the operation that's currently

238
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,259
taking place in the hospital?

239
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,328
Are you a surgeon, now?

240
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,830
The fuck are you talking about?

241
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,498
You shot her.

242
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,167
I told you to kidnap her, not shoot her.

243
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,303
Now she's in intensive care.

244
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,338
I gave you specific instructions,

245
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,840
which you did not follow.

246
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,042
All I wanna know from you,

247
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,245
is when and where do I get my money?

248
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,481
Good question.

249
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,283
Now, my question to you is who's
gonna get to you first?

250
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,220
Me, or Sonny Garcia?

251
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,081
This shouldn't have happened, Steph.

252
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,588
I shouldn't have gotten you
into this life.

253
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,899
It's over, now.

254
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,567
There's no more pain.

255
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,671
It'll be over for me as soon.

256
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,976
But first I have to take care
of something.

257
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,928
I'll see you on the other side.

258
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,971
I love you.

259
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,147
How's the club business going?

260
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,551
How's the pharmaceutical business going?

261
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,454
Got five hundred coming in next week.

262
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:58,755
Can you take it?

263
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,056
No.

264
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,527
That's cool, I'll split it..

265
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,163
It's still a no.

266
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,833
Let's cut to the chase.

267
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,037
He sent me here to give you a message.

268
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,739
Boss down south?

269
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,275
Not very pleased with you.

270
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,945
Wants to know you haven't
handled that situation?

271
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,848
He also wants to know

272
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,617
why you're not taking his calls, Sonny.

273
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,519
Well, first of all,

274
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,389
tell him I'm not taking his calls

275
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,723
because I've already told him
what my decision is.

276
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,858
It's not gonna happen.

277
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,861
He wants a war,

278
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,497
he might as well bring it on,

279
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,599
'cause I'm already preparing
to bring it to him.

280
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,703
You give him my message.

281
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,973
Loud and clear,

282
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,541
because I don't think he understood me
the first time.

283
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,416
Secondly, don't you ever fucking
refer to me as Sonny again,

284
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,218
or I'll put two in your head.

285
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,824
Get the fuck out of my house.

286
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,798
He's giving you one week.

287
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,436
One week, or he handles it himself.

288
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,972
The choice is yours.

289
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,274
My decision's been made.

290
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,929
Señora.

291
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,309
That didn't seem pretty friendly.

292
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,145
And you are?

293
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

294
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,481
I'm Sénia, and you?

295
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,417
You always make it a point

296
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,218
to snoop on other peoples' business?

297
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,590
I wouldn't call it snooping.

298
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,397
Some things just naturally
draw our attention.

299
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,070
And so do some people.

300
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,347
Is that your wife?

301
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,189
Beautiful woman.

302
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,859
Who are you with?

303
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,563
Just me.

304
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,266
Then how did you get in?

305
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,038
A woman can achieve anything she desires.

306
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,208
Not everything is attainable.

307
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,643
Maybe for some.

308
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,981
This woman can get everything she wants.

309
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,755
Fucking do not even play.

310
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,191
Whoa, what the fuck?

311
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,361
Oh, I'm so sorry.

312
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:32,862
I'll clean it up.

313
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,432
I'm sorry.

314
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,367
Is this Yves Saint Laurent?

315
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,538
I love a handsome man with good taste.

316
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,642
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

317
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,979
I shouldn't speak my mind in front
of your, uh, girlfriend?

318
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,049
Some things are better left unsaid, huh?

319
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,217
Girlfriend?

320
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,821
Oh, no, no, I barely know this bitch.

321
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,824
Fucking asshole.

322
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,262
May I buy you a drink?

323
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,398
Oh, I think you may.

324
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,533
Well, what's your weapon of choice?

325
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,170
Oh, sorry, I guess that's
an American thing.

326
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,173
What kind of drink do you like?

327
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,143
I'm sorry.

328
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,980
I'm having whatever you're having.

329
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,783
Is that okay?

330
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:27,817
That's a good choice, baby.

331
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,019
Oh, baby again.

332
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,588
I love you Americans.

333
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,822
One more.

334
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,694
Um, I need to go to the restroom.

335
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,829
You're not going to leave me, are you?

336
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,065
No.

337
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,939
Nice piece of ass right there, bro.

338
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,107
You're the fucking man.

339
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,575
Damn right, I'm the fucking man.

340
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,513
That'll be 30 bucks, fellas.

341
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,453
My fucking wallet, dude.

342
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:04,654
Dude, you just had it.

343
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,956
I know I just had it, it's fucking gone.

344
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,292
Ah, fucking Russian bitch
stole your wallet, man.

345
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,860
No fucking way, dude.

346
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,130
Pretty fucking bitch took my wallet.

347
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,057
Nice job on the quick turnaround.

348
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,561
You got it, baby.

349
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,932
I've got a Asian customer
been dying for this one.

350
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,901
He's a cheap motherfucker, though.

351
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,241
Relax, I always take care of you,
don't I?

352
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,946
Somebody left this for you.

353
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,214
Who gave this to you?

354
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,849
Some kid dropped it off.

355
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:11,020
By the way, this ain't a
fucking post office.

356
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,791
I don't know you, and you don't know me.

357
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,093
Get it?

358
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,312
Hello, Olivia.

359
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,814
Get in, let's have a chat.

360
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,083
Who are you?

361
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,485
How do you know me?

362
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,987
I got a score for you.

363
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,423
Get in, and I'll give you the details.

364
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,326
How do you know I'm not wired?

365
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,428
Because a million dollar score

366
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,497
is worth more than a wire to a cop.

367
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,601
Now, you get in, or I fuck off.

368
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,786
I've never heard of a no-split deal.

369
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,522
What's your game?

370
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,726
I get what I want, you get what you want.

371
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,195
What is that you want?

372
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,631
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

373
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:02,965
You ever heard of him?

374
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,435
Nope.

375
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,971
Well, he's got something that
should've been mine.

376
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,773
I want you to get it for me.

377
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,209
What's the score?

378
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,211
A necklace.

379
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,449
The million dollar necklace?

380
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,451
Yeah.

381
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,554
How much is worth a man's freedom.

382
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,552
Vamanos.

383
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,841
It means the world to him.

384
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,243
I need you to rid him of it.

385
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:57,580
So, just to make sure,

386
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:01,184
you want me to take that necklace
and walk away?

387
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,586
No split.

388
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,289
No split.

389
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,790
Why?

390
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,892
Because he bought that chain in blood.

391
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,768
The bosses have a lot of pull in Mexico.

392
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,871
It was too easy for them to
pin her murder on me.

393
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:25,541
One phone call, and a small payoff
to some corrupt cops.

394
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,850
Call it a day.

395
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,288
For his so-called loyalty,

396
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,058
the boss ensured that I got the worst
treatment imaginable.

397
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,332
Twenty years,

398
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:51,667
twenty hard years those
motherfuckers gave me

399
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:54,003
for a crime I did not commit.

400
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,339
And worst of all, for murdering the woman

401
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,407
I would've given my life for.

402
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,811
Those are wounds that will never heal.

403
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:05,815
All for a chain and the fucking bullshit
it represents.

404
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,185
That chain is meant to
buy him his freedom

405
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,654
if the need ever arises.

406
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,422
And it cost me mine.

407
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:14,857
Before I have him killed,

408
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,560
I need you to take that chain
away from him.

409
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,797
$500,000 if I split it.

410
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,468
Consider it done.

411
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,570
I said a million.

412
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,171
Black market.

413
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:31,073
Hm, smart girl.

414
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,509
There is one more thing you should know.

415
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:34,777
Hm?

416
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,413
He's got a soft spot for pretty girls.

417
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,019
That's why you picked me.

418
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,465
Who sent you?

419
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,303
What do you mean?

420
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,549
I haven't been this lucky in a long time.

421
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,826
Oh, fuck.

422
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,830
Yeah?

423
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,935
I'll be right there.

424
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,603
I gotta go.

425
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:08,971
Gotta work.

426
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:11,173
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

427
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,009
Five more minutes.

428
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,178
I'll make it worth your while, huh?

429
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,223
I wish I could.

430
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,762
I gotta go.

431
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,539
I'll be in touch.

432
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,166
Holy crap, man.

433
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,301
You scared the shit out of me.

434
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:14,904
Did you find her?

435
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,272
Jeez, man.

436
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,741
Don't creep up on people like that.

437
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,610
Yes, I found her.

438
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,012
It's not good news.

439
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,847
What do you mean, "it's not good news"?

440
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,148
Is she dead?

441
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,452
Far from it.

442
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:33,022
This is her in Monaco outside
the Ritz-Carlton.

443
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:36,358
A few days later in Paris shopping
at the Champs-Élysées.

444
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,762
A week later in Berlin, a few days later
in Thailand.

445
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,997
Yeah, I think you get the point.

446
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,767
Looks like she's globetrotting
when you were gone.

447
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,604
Gonna be a hard one to catch.

448
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,308
And more importantly, expensive to catch.

449
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,180
I'll be in touch.

450
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,450
Hey, where's my money?

451
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,488
I asked you to find her,

452
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,690
not give me her goddamn travel itinerary.

453
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,558
When your people find her,

454
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:11,961
and bring her to me,

455
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,463
then you get your money.

456
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,672
These things cost money, Sundown.

457
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:24,740
Figure it out.

458
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,676
Where are the cars, huh?

459
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,011
I told you already, brother,

460
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,779
one more week, it's not easy.

461
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,382
One I 70 T, one 7-series, one Escalade,

462
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,351
delivered in Dubai Wednesday, huh?

463
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,885
I'm trying, brother.

464
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,220
I told the guy, already.

465
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,489
What day is today?

466
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,458
Monday.

467
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,926
Then how will you do it
one week early, now?

468
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,462
Tell me one way we can both survive?

469
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,529
No.

470
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,430
No?

471
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,932
So how will these cars will

472
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,867
get to Dubai by Wednesday, Khaled, how?

473
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,038
Hold on, hold on.

474
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,439
There's an echo.

475
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,710
Oh, it's our bounty hunter,
private investigator.

476
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:42,711
Oh, oh,

477
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,484
Hey, you need better equipment.

478
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:51,487
Ah, Mister Finley, Mister investigator,
huh?

479
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,389
I was asked to give you a message.

480
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,457
4 p.m. tomorrow at
6th Street Bridge.

481
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,725
Better be on time.

482
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,562
You hang up first.

483
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:01,897
No, no, you hang up first.

484
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:04,166
No, no, no, you hang up first.

485
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,145
How'd you find me?

486
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,480
I heard about your speciality.

487
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,349
What do you want, man?

488
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,886
Have you heard of Sonny,
"Sundown" Garcia?

489
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,257
Yeah.

490
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,225
Everybody has.

491
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,995
I need you to get some information
for me.

492
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,830
Oh, for the right price?

493
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,432
Price is not an issue.

494
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,935
Well, keep in mind tracking Sundown
is no easy task.

495
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,270
He's a smart man.

496
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:42,538
You won't be tracking down Sundown.

497
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,539
Then, who?

498
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,575
His wife.

499
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,947
He's the head of an organization.

500
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,850
Your superiors expect you to
keep your house in order.

501
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,587
His wife has been slipping through
the grass like a snake.

502
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,489
I need her exposed.

503
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,391
Safe to assume you're one
of those superiors?

504
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:04,960
No.

505
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,028
DEA?

506
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,296
Absolutely not.

507
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,365
Then why on Earth would you

508
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,767
involve yourself with a man
as dangerous as Sundown.

509
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,837
'Cause I've got a score to settle.

510
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,545
My father was in the business.

511
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,814
He was down in Mexico on a deal,

512
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,216
and the junkie he was

513
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:29,351
thought it would be a good idea
to take me along,

514
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:31,487
'cause he couldn't find a babysitter.

515
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,188
A quick pop across the border

516
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,591
to Juárez for a few pounds of weed.

517
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,159
No big deal, right?

518
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,044
What he didn't factor in was the

519
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,981
ruthlessness of some of the people
he did business with.

520
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,159
I was kidnapped for ransom.

521
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,465
They thought he had money,

522
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:18,367
but unfortunately he didn't
have anything close,

523
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,169
so they couldn't buy me back.

524
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,371
Unable to show any weakness,

525
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:24,473
the kidnappers made him believe
they killed me.

526
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:27,543
He was devastated and
returned to America.

527
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:30,379
But these kidnappers truly
meant no harm, though.

528
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:33,282
They just needed to put food
on the table.

529
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,284
Having no more need for me,

530
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,785
and no desire to kill me,

531
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:40,289
they threw me on the streets
of Juárez to fend for myself.

532
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,225
Being a stranded 10-year old gringo

533
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:45,727
on the streets of Juárez is no easy task.

534
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,408
And that's when I met her.

535
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,978
Her name was Sophia.

536
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,515
I fell in love with her at
that very moment,

537
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,150
and she with me.

538
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,395
They took care of me and
raised me like their own.

539
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,672
I made them the promise that I would

540
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,342
love and protect their daughter
for the rest of my life.

541
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,953
Years later, she was as beautiful as

542
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:47,022
the first time I laid eyes on her.

543
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,426
Innocent and pure, with a heart of gold.

544
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,473
We made plans to grow old together.

545
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,377
Have a family of our own.

546
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:15,751
Unfortunately, I met the wrong person
along the way.

547
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,592
His name was Sonny Garcia.

548
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,794
He was a boy at the time.

549
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,397
The sunrise before the Sundown.

550
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,833
A man's reputation is worth everything.

551
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,973
He took that away from me.

552
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,745
He was given a choice,

553
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,647
and made the world believe it was mine.

554
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,016
Including those who raised me,

555
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,651
and opened their hearts to me.

556
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,523
And I'm gonna give him another.

557
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,693
How is the Intel I'm gonna gather

558
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:58,961
helping your revenge?

559
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,797
Because it will go to those
who raised him.

560
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,033
I'm thinking they'll give him
a couple of choices,

561
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,702
and I think I know which one he'll take,

562
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,136
and that'll be his downfall.

563
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,738
That's it?

564
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,039
That's all you're gonna do
to get revenge.

565
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,874
The guy killed your girlfriend, dude.

566
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:14,343
He's powerful.

567
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,212
I will kill him,

568
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,214
but I want him to suffer
like I've suffered.

569
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,786
She's working with the DEA.

570
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,890
With the case exposed, Sundown
is being extra cautious.

571
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:30,559
Their only way to him, now,

572
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,927
is through his wife.

573
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,629
She knows everything.

574
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,297
And they've fooled her into thinking

575
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,967
that she can serve up to life
behind bars for complicity.

576
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,570
They're offering her immunity
for further information,

577
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:43,238
as well as her testimony.

578
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,074
This will cost the Mexican bosses
a lot of revenue.

579
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:47,909
I need to have her exposed.

580
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,911
Only then will he be

581
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,848
presented with the choice
I expect them to give him.

582
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,817
How much?

583
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,889
Name your price.

584
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,367
You're gonna get me fucking killed
with these meetings.

585
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,236
You better have some kind of

586
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,471
Witness Protection Program to put me in.

587
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:50,839
Do you even know who these people are?

588
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:52,674
What they're capable of?

589
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,042
If anybody gets wind of this, now,

590
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,911
I'm a goner.

591
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:57,145
You'll be fine.

592
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,047
It's not the first time we've done this.

593
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,384
Now, you tell us what we want,

594
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,420
and you can put this entire process
behind you.

595
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,590
Like promised, we'll take care of you.

596
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,392
Damn fucking right, you'll
take care of me.

597
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,194
Don't get too cocky, Missus Garcia,

598
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:14,062
you need us more than we need you.

599
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,098
Now, we're willing to work with you,

600
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,799
but you need to reciprocate.

601
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,406
We need him red-handed.

602
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,408
Can you facilitate that?

603
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,444
When is the next shipment?

604
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,214
How does he get the goods
into the country?

605
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:33,548
Who does he talk to?

606
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,417
Just one fucking question at a time,
okay?

607
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,186
Okay.

608
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,799
He makes about two shipments a week.

609
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:52,267
Sometimes more.

610
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,436
Never less than two.

611
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,506
It comes in through South America.

612
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,876
He facilitates it through
the Mexican border.

613
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,478
Everyone's in on it.

614
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,714
Everyone gets paid.

615
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,352
It's basically foolproof.

616
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,255
We already know all this, Missus Garcia.

617
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:14,623
We need to know how.

618
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,726
Now, I can't offer you immunity

619
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:19,628
if you don't cooperate.

620
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,130
So you tell us what we want,

621
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,165
we'll give you what you need.

622
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,700
It is as simple as that.

623
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,576
Don't get too cocky,

624
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,511
Missus Garcia, you need us
more than we need you.

625
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,413
Now, we're willing to work with you,

626
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,081
but you need to reciprocate.

627
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,583
We need him red-handed.

628
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:43,151
Can you facilitate that?

629
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,753
When is the next shipment?

630
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,499
Yeah?

631
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,433
He facilitates it

632
01:03:58,435 --> 01:03:59,267
through the Mexican border.

633
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,770
Everyone's in on it.

634
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,045
He makes about two shipments a week,

635
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:11,246
sometimes more.

636
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,849
Never less than two.

637
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,552
Everyone gets paid.

638
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,521
It's basically foolproof.

639
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,526
Who was that?

640
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,211
The fuck are you talking about?

641
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:45,780
It could be anyone.

642
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,155
Don't worry about it.

643
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,258
I'll take care of it.

644
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:47,976
Fuck you!

645
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,978
You think you made me?

646
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,281
You kill me, you lose everything.

647
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,783
Nobody makes you money like I do,

648
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,451
you fucking pop-tart.

649
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,388
This is America, not Mexico.

650
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,170
Señora.

651
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,935
I hope she's not pregnant.

652
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,704
Yeah.

653
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,106
She's very fertile.

654
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,648
I gotta go, hey!

655
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,917
You just fucking destroyed us, Steph.

656
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,119
What do you mean?

657
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,156
You're talking to the DEA.

658
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:43,024
I beat the fucking case.

659
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,659
And now you're throwing me
back to the wolves.

660
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,028
You deceitful fucking bitch.

661
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,329
I haven't been talking to anyone,

662
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,531
I don't know what you're fucking...

663
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,066
They have it on fucking video, Steph.

664
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,034
What video?

665
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:56,805
Video, audio, pictures, you,
talking to the fucking narcs.

666
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,309
Remember what you promised?

667
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,711
What were you gonna trade me in, for?

668
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,113
Immunity?

669
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,750
Do you fucking realize,

670
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:10,885
that even if I did go down

671
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,087
it wouldn't bring you down with me.

672
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,588
You already have your fucking immunity.

673
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:14,889
With me!

674
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,191
I'm sick of this shit.

675
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,693
I'm sick of this fucking life.

676
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:20,028
I mean, what fucking immunity?

677
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,429
What does that even fucking mean?

678
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:22,964
That I get to live in hiding

679
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:24,432
for the rest of my fucking life?

680
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:27,469
I mean, Sonny, I'm just looking
for some fucking normalcy.

681
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,205
Can't you fucking understand that?

682
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,941
Do you realize the position
you've put me in, now?

683
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:35,043
I don't give a fuck, Sonny.

684
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:36,377
You put yourself in this position,

685
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:37,612
you put me in this position.

686
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,915
You don't give a fucking
flying shit about us.

687
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:42,250
All this has ever been is about

688
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:44,452
is about you and your
fucking drugs, Sonny.

689
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,221
I mean, would I give you up for immunity?

690
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:47,655
For a fucking life?

691
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:50,258
You would give me up for your
fucking drugs, Sonny,

692
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,793
and you fucking know it.

693
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:04,906
You're losing it, Sonny.

694
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,707
Watch your head.

695
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,286
Would you like a glass of wine?

696
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,822
I don't even drink wine,

697
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:56,958
but they say this one's one of the best.

698
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,560
From France.

699
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,861
Chelsea?

700
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,696
Yeah, sure, why not?

701
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,633
Why do you want to buy a boat?

702
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,802
Hey, I'm a guy.

703
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,204
I like my toys.

704
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:12,140
Plus, the color matches the Bugatti,
right babe?

705
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,409
Bugatti, wow.

706
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:15,777
Impressive.

707
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,480
So, what do you want for it?

708
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,218
Um, I'm not so sure.

709
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,820
It's my grandfather's,
and he just passed.

710
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,623
I flew in from Hong Kong
to manage his estate.

711
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,825
I don't know what to do about this.

712
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,328
But, I did some research.

713
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:37,465
This boat, it's apparently
worth over half million.

714
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,667
I'll give you $200,000 for it.

715
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:41,002
Not a penny more.

716
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,172
200 K's too low.

717
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,008
Some other buyer's willing to pay more.

718
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,877
Where are they?

719
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,913
They're waiting for financing
to come through.

720
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,682
Let me save you the hassle, honey.

721
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:55,950
It's not gonna happen.

722
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:58,987
No one is lending, not in this economy.

723
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,023
I've got clients who can't meet payroll

724
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:03,591
on a 20-year mature business

725
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,193
because JPMorgan would rather

726
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,195
earn 4 points on the Malaysian Ringgit.

727
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:11,099
So, if you think anyone is lending
for a second-hand boat,

728
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,202
then I got a Borneo gold mind outside.

729
01:11:14,204 --> 01:11:15,436
Cash is king, honey.

730
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,772
He's in finance.

731
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,510
Half million.

732
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,480
Listen, I got a meeting in half an hour.

733
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,048
Let me make this simple for you.

734
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,484
Follow me to the bank, I'll pull out
a hundred thousand,

735
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:30,752
give it to you right then.

736
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,120
I'll have the other hundred

737
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:34,222
wired from a bank in Lichtenstein
in 18 hours.

738
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:35,456
Deal?

739
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:51,806
Hello?

740
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,508
I heard you have a boat for sale?

741
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,478
Are you not the one selling the boat?

742
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,914
You must got the wrong person.

743
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,416
Well that's weird,

744
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,484
because I definitely heard you was
the one selling a boat.

745
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,620
Matter of fact, I heard
you've already sold it

746
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,488
five times this week, alone.

747
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,891
When do the real owners get back?

748
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,959
How did you get my number?

749
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,695
Don't worry, I'm not a fed.

750
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:14,929
But we need to talk.

751
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,031
Talk about what?

752
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:20,001
Talk about how you can
make millions in a week.

753
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,377
Take a seat.

754
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,286
Don't you wanna close the door?

755
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,828
I've been following your cons.

756
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,063
Pretty impressive.

757
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:24,899
With the boat and everything?

758
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,235
But the one I like is the paintings.

759
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,504
That's a real good one for me.

760
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:31,005
What gets me, is,

761
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,142
how do you keep coming up with
all these different ideas?

762
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,611
You said the millions in the week.

763
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,446
What's the job?

764
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,149
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

765
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,253
He's worth a fortune, and I wanna
rid him of some of it.

766
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,623
I wanna do a money laundering job.

767
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,792
I'll bankroll it.

768
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:54,629
Start him off small, build him up
to the big take.

769
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,131
He's got a competitive edge.

770
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,766
Once you get him where you want him,

771
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,969
he's all in.

772
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,208
What if he doesn't?

773
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:10,244
If he doesn't, there's 200 grand
in that bag.

774
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:13,981
If the job don't come off, we'll
call it services rendered.

775
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:21,656
What if I take the 200 and
disappear right now?

776
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,659
Well, that's easy.

777
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,494
I found you once.

778
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:28,663
If I have to find you a second time,

779
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:31,632
it'll really fucking irritate me.

780
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,046
I'll let you know.

781
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,385
You fucking do that.

782
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,860
Rosco's here.

783
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,116
Who the fuck gave you the okay?

784
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,486
No one told me this was a private party.

785
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:00,588
Now you know.

786
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,156
Get the fuck out of my club.

787
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,959
Be careful how you move, Sundown.

788
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,762
It could mean the end of you.

789
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,466
And this?

790
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,002
Is on your tab, by the way.

791
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,505
I don't hold tabs in my own club.

792
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,974
I don't hold tabs anywhere.

793
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,943
That's your kind of thing.

794
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,580
Your mom is güey.

795
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,015
Fuck off.

796
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,857
What the fuck are you still doing here?

797
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,263
I'm a lady, please be polite.

798
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,031
I already paid for my drink.

799
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,600
I'm gonna finish it.

800
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:49,770
You finish that drink, the whole tab
is yours.

801
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,273
How's that sound?

802
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,815
Keep the change.

803
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,618
Rosco's paying you well.

804
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,622
Did you ever think that
maybe I pay him well?

805
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:10,491
You ever think that maybe I know
exactly what he makes?

806
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:11,959
I'm sure you do.

807
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,695
But do you know how much money
I clean for him?

808
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,865
Everybody has their cleaners.

809
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,337
Not like me.

810
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,042
And what makes you so special?

811
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,480
I can not tell you that.

812
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,248
I work for Rosco.

813
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,916
Not you.

814
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,998
Hundred grand, right?

815
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,670
What's the turnaround?

816
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,705
48 hours.

817
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,940
The return?

818
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,609
120 back to you.

819
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,545
And to you?

820
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,015
120 to you is all that matters.

821
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,384
You're being paid to launder
your own money.

822
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,386
What do you care what I make?

823
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,422
Fair enough.

824
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,907
120, like promised.

825
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,943
Impressive.

826
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,446
Here's 200, let's see
what you do with it.

827
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,199
Hello.

828
01:18:58,201 --> 01:18:59,700
Where've you been?

829
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:01,235
I've got more product for you.

830
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,870
I've been busy.

831
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:04,939
Busy with what?

832
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,408
Bigger transactions.

833
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,577
How big?

834
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,079
Bigger than what I've been doing for you.

835
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,181
I've got to go, I'll call you back.

836
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:15,683
Wait, wait, hold on.

837
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:17,585
How much're we talking?

838
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,987
Wasn't that the whole point of this?

839
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,123
Listen, I've got to make money.

840
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:23,257
I go where the money is.

841
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,192
Plain and simple.

842
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:26,727
And where's the money?

843
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:28,362
I think you know that.

844
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:30,264
I have a bigger client.

845
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,032
Bigger than me?

846
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,868
What're you, fucking stupid?

847
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,071
I don't really care.

848
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:38,773
How much are we talking?

849
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,377
Five million minimum.

850
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,546
What is your term, now or never?

851
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,381
Stop everything you're doing,

852
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:49,550
and I'll make it ten million dollars.

853
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,389
Okay.

854
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,988
Where you all going?

855
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,556
Sit the fuck down.

856
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,593
Get her done, partner.

857
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,237
Damn.

858
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:03,317
I heard that you guys got a lot
of money hidden here.

859
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,853
Are the rumors true?

860
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,355
No, ain't no money up in here.

861
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,025
No money?

862
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,427
Huh.

863
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,030
All the dope that y'all been
pushing up in this place,

864
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:19,133
and there is no money?

865
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,768
Nada, zip?

866
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,569
I didn't push nothing,

867
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:23,437
I don't know what you're talking about.

868
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:26,507
Hm.

869
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,407
The stove.

870
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,657
Who are you?

871
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:25,159
I just wanna make you an offer.

872
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:26,693
Nothing to worry about.

873
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:28,896
I worry about everything.

874
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,031
I asked you a question.

875
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:33,100
Who are you?

876
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:36,136
My name's John Doe.

877
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:41,241
Alright, John Doe.

878
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,278
How would you like a bullet to your face

879
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,979
before I get out of this car?

880
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:47,781
Now, I know all about you.

881
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:49,683
That's why I've asked you for this meet.

882
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,518
How'd you get in my car?

883
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,920
Come on, you're a cop.

884
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,254
You know how that works.

885
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,425
So what's your offer?

886
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,361
Put the gun down, first.

887
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:06,433
Put the gun down, now,
I know your reputation.

888
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,710
So let's hear about your offer.

889
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,047
I got a job for you.

890
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,516
You can earn a shitload of money.

891
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,586
Sounds like a two-way street.

892
01:25:25,588 --> 01:25:27,154
What's in it for you?

893
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,457
Why does everybody ask
what's in it for me?

894
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:31,825
Why is that?

895
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,561
'Cause there always is.

896
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:35,729
Something.

897
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,468
Revenge.

898
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,737
That's what's in it for me.

899
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,472
Fucking revenge.

900
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:51,745
I want to take everything away

901
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:54,148
from this man I seek revenge from,

902
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,816
including his life.

903
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,587
But before I do that, I want
to take away his freedom.

904
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,423
I did 20 years in there because of him.

905
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:05,492
The only thing that kept me alive

906
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,494
was the thirst for revenge.

907
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,864
He needs to feel everything that I felt.

908
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,937
We used to run the streets together.

909
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:19,673
We came up from nothing,
and were going places.

910
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,054
I was there for him through
thick and thin,

911
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:35,789
and so was he for me.

912
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,335
But there was always something
different about him.

913
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:50,971
I couldn't put my finger
on it at the time,

914
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:53,040
but I should've seen it coming.

915
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,812
When I truly realized, it was too late.

916
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:04,718
I guess love defeats reason.

917
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,255
And he took it all.

918
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:11,525
My love, my life, my money.

919
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,660
And ultimately my freedom.

920
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:15,796
Now his time has come.

921
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,069
Who is this mystical man you speak of?

922
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:28,508
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

923
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,179
Do you have any idea

924
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:34,081
how long they been trying
to get this guy?

925
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,116
Not likely.

926
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,252
You don't know him like I know him.

927
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,088
I can serve him up on a plate to you.

928
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,124
You'll get that promotion you've
always been after.

929
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:47,127
That's where you've got me pegged wrong.

930
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,330
I am very happy where I'm at.

931
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:54,034
So you can have Sundown to yourself.

932
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,004
Okay, cool.

933
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,440
Maybe I'll take that million dollars
that's there, as well.

934
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:05,979
Nobody knows it's there.

935
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:12,352
Walk in, pick it up, straight out
the front door.

936
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,289
No questions asked.

937
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:18,458
A million dollars?

938
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,796
Tax fucking free.

939
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:28,235
Oh, shit.

940
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:39,946
He gets shipments twice a week.

941
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:41,615
Saturday nights in particular.

942
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:44,818
The cops are too busy with everything else
to be bothered.

943
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,688
It looks like regular liquor deliveries
to a club,

944
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,623
so no one thinks anything of it.

945
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,968
The safe is right behind the painting
in his office.

946
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,804
No one knows it's even there.

947
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,839
Not even his closest men.

948
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,009
His guard is lower than it will be

949
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,044
after I really start on him,

950
01:29:11,046 --> 01:29:13,347
so now's the right time
for you to strike.

951
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,949
In a few weeks, I can assure you

952
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,085
things will be very different for him.

953
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,120
Nobody fucking move!

954
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:22,022
All of you, on your knees.

955
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,725
Now!

956
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:27,094
On your fucking knees, or the next one's
to your head.

957
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,396
On your fucking knees!

958
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,231
Not even when I proposed to my wife

959
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:33,233
did I get on my knees, cocksucker.

960
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:38,739
Don't you fucking dare, or you'll
take two to the head.

961
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,387
Well, well, well, boys.

962
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,289
Sorry to crash your party, but

963
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,593
I heard this was where the coke was.

964
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,165
Am I right?

965
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,667
I'm more of a chocolate milk kinda guy.

966
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:12,072
Good one.

967
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,075
Very good.

968
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,914
Fortunately for you,

969
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,252
I don't want your coke.

970
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,123
Or your chocolate milk.

971
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:37,597
But I do like the painting
on the wall, though.

972
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:43,170
I've always had a thing
for beautiful art.

973
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,107
Cuff them.

974
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,845
My lawyer's gonna tear you to pieces.

975
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,463
What do we have, here?

976
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,868
An emergency million-dollar stash, maybe?

977
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:28,815
Open sesame.

978
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,536
You think you're gonna walk out
with my money?

979
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:53,340
You must be fucking crazy.

980
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:03,817
Does anyone see any money, here?

981
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:06,853
'Cause I don't see a damn thing.

982
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:10,957
As a matter of fact, what safe?

983
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,361
Get the fuck out of here.

984
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:22,536
My friend that just walked out the door
was never here.

985
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,273
Camron and I after our shift
came in and had a drink.

986
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:28,575
Noticed suspicious activity.

987
01:32:28,577 --> 01:32:30,877
After further investigation,

988
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,747
we fell upon a major drug transaction.

989
01:32:33,749 --> 01:32:36,416
Oh, I can see the headlines, now.

990
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:41,788
Two Off-Duty Officers Take Down
Drug Kingpin,

991
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,392
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

992
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:49,129
Some crazy shit.

993
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,965
Call that in, Camron.

994
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:01,908
You fucking moron.

995
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,582
How dumb can you be?

996
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:11,184
He was with us.

997
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,754
He was working undercover,

998
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,658
for years, you fucking idiot!

999
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,897
You completely blew our entire case,

1000
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:27,067
not to mention you disgraced
the entire force,

1001
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:31,037
by stealing money from a drug lord.

1002
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:33,940
Here's what's gonna happen.

1003
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,379
You

1004
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:43,617
are going to jail.

1005
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:50,724
Sundown is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA,

1006
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:54,694
and he's gonna walk this afternoon
after his hearing.

1007
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,370
Agent Franco, on the other hand,

1008
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,574
is not gonna spend his entire life
in hiding

1009
01:34:07,576 --> 01:34:09,676
because you thought it was smart

1010
01:34:09,678 --> 01:34:14,481
to steal from Sunny "Sundown" Garcia.

1011
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:17,550
I mean, not only was your crime

1012
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,921
witnessed by a federal agent,

1013
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:27,894
but the entire thing was
caught on camera!

1014
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:39,873
You've officially traded places
with Sundown.

1015
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:52,952
Enjoy the next 20 years.

1016
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,030
What a sad life.

1017
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,636
The ups, the downs, the friends,
the enemies.

1018
01:35:09,638 --> 01:35:14,541
The frauds, crooks, the sneaks,
the opportunists.

1019
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:17,544
The traitors, the killers,
the thieves, villains,

1020
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:20,613
the brutes, the con-men, the merciless,
the ruthless.

1021
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:24,384
And what's sadder is that
to succeed in this life,

1022
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:26,319
you have to be the best
of all of them.

1023
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,888
Bottled into a single man.

1024
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:38,565
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

1025
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:41,735
The most notorious narcotics dealer

1026
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,103
in the northern hemisphere,

1027
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,271
and I have lived a life of crime.

1028
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,177
But no more.

1029
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:56,649
How do you get away with a perfect crime?

1030
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:58,451
There's no such thing.

1031
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:01,354
How do you get away with a
lifetime of crime?

1032
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,189
That's simple.

1033
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:04,858
Make 'em think you haven't.

1034
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:08,027
I knew the feds were minutes away
from getting their man.

1035
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:09,529
So what did I do?

1036
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,731
I gave 'em what they wanted.

1037
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:13,466
You don't know him like I know him.

1038
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:15,101
I can serve him up on a plate to you.

1039
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,070
You'll get that promotion you've
always been after.

1040
01:36:17,072 --> 01:36:18,404
A million dollars?

1041
01:36:18,406 --> 01:36:20,707
Tax fucking free.

1042
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:22,609
The corrupt cop was perfect for the job.

1043
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,744
There's no way she could resist the bait.

1044
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,212
He was with us.

1045
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:27,480
I knew all I did was

1046
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:29,249
buy myself some time,
but it was necessary.

1047
01:36:29,251 --> 01:36:32,619
Sundown is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA.

1048
01:36:32,621 --> 01:36:36,723
And he's gonna walk this afternoon,
after his hearing.

1049
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:38,825
When it came to the cartels,

1050
01:36:38,827 --> 01:36:41,127
and the boss down in Mexico,
that was a different story.

1051
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:42,829
Once in that world,

1052
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:44,564
you can't just leave by
your own free will.

1053
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:50,904
So what did I do?

1054
01:36:50,906 --> 01:36:52,472
I had them oust me.

1055
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:54,607
He sent me here to give you a message.

1056
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:56,910
Boss down south, not very pleased
with you.

1057
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:59,078
He wants to know why you haven't
handled that situation.

1058
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,914
One week, or he handles it himself.

1059
01:37:00,916 --> 01:37:02,015
The choice is yours.

1060
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:03,650
My decision's been made.

1061
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,593
Tarnished my reputation

1062
01:37:13,595 --> 01:37:15,995
and made sure they'd never wanna
do business with me again.

1063
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:17,864
Señora.

1064
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:19,432
I need you to get some information
for me.

1065
01:37:19,434 --> 01:37:20,934
For the right price?

1066
01:37:20,936 --> 01:37:22,202
Found the right guy to make it happen.

1067
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:23,970
Thought he was working for me,

1068
01:37:23,972 --> 01:37:25,104
then working against me...

1069
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:26,773
Yes, I found her.

1070
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:28,474
These things cost money, Sundown!

1071
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:29,642
Learns he was simply

1072
01:37:29,644 --> 01:37:31,744
working for me the entire time.

1073
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:34,547
In order for dismantling an empire,

1074
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,349
it must crumble entirely.

1075
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,051
Not one brick left standing.

1076
01:37:38,053 --> 01:37:39,452
Eliminate my money.

1077
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:41,120
You said millions in the week.

1078
01:37:41,122 --> 01:37:42,222
What's the job?

1079
01:37:42,224 --> 01:37:43,389
He's worth a fortune,

1080
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:44,724
and I wanna rid him of some of it.

1081
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:46,125
I'm gonna do a money laundering job.

1082
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:47,293
Start him off small,

1083
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:48,561
build him up to the big take.

1084
01:37:48,563 --> 01:37:49,729
Once you get him where you want him,

1085
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:51,130
Stop everything you're doing,

1086
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:53,066
and I'll make it 10 million dollars.

1087
01:37:54,802 --> 01:37:56,035
And he's all-in.

1088
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,403
Make him think I'm destroyed.

1089
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,539
Money means power in this world,

1090
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,074
and when it's gone you'd be surprised

1091
01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:02,709
how fast people disappear.

1092
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,978
And that's just what I wanted.

1093
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,046
He's got something that
should've been mine.

1094
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:08,348
I want you to get it for me.

1095
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:09,682
A million dollar necklace?

1096
01:38:09,684 --> 01:38:10,884
Why?

1097
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:13,086
Because he bought that chain in blood.

1098
01:38:13,088 --> 01:38:14,554
It was my right of passage

1099
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:17,023
into this world, represented everything

1100
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:18,791
I wanted to leave behind.

1101
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:20,493
There was no way I could've

1102
01:38:20,495 --> 01:38:21,928
brought it with me on my new journey.

1103
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:25,832
My love, my beautiful love...

1104
01:38:25,834 --> 01:38:27,433
I want you to kidnap someone for me.

1105
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:29,369
Sonny Garcia's wife.

1106
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,244
The saddest part of my journey,

1107
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,813
I truly never meant for that to happen.

1108
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:43,583
But he sure paid for his deeds.

1109
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,218
Now, my question to you, is,

1110
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,619
who's gonna get to you first?

1111
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:52,558
Me, or Sonny Garcia?

1112
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,027
The job was simple.

1113
01:38:54,029 --> 01:38:58,064
Kidnap. Her.

1114
01:38:58,066 --> 01:38:59,399
That woulda bought me just enough time to

1115
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:01,467
execute my plan without
her meddling in it.

1116
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:03,136
There's no way I coulda risked her

1117
01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:05,038
allowing them to build a case against me

1118
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,539
right before my disappearance.

1119
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,207
Which brings me to that point.

1120
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:09,375
My disappearance.

1121
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:11,544
How do you get away with
a lifetime of crime?

1122
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,212
Make them think you haven't.

1123
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:15,148
And in doing so, go all-in.

1124
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:17,150
I want you to kill him with this gun.

1125
01:39:17,152 --> 01:39:18,651
It's the gun he killed me with.

1126
01:39:22,724 --> 01:39:23,623
As long as it's done with my own gun,

1127
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,391
conveniently loaded with blanks,

1128
01:39:25,393 --> 01:39:30,363
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia is no more.

1129
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:34,634
I need his assassination to be heard
all over America.

1130
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:37,437
My whole existence revolves around
the loss of his life.

1131
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:38,604
The only one that's left

1132
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:40,573
is our dear friend, John Doe.

1133
01:39:40,575 --> 01:39:41,574
I'll be in touch.

1134
01:39:41,576 --> 01:39:42,976
No, I'll be in touch.

1135
01:39:44,578 --> 01:39:46,646
He didn't just come from my imagination.

1136
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:49,449
He lived within me.

1137
01:39:49,451 --> 01:39:51,250
A man nobody knew but me.

1138
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:53,086
My true self.

1139
01:39:53,088 --> 01:39:55,288
I fought Sonny down for my entire life,

1140
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:56,923
but he was a monster.

1141
01:39:56,925 --> 01:39:58,591
Undefeatable.

1142
01:39:58,593 --> 01:39:59,859
And dumb.

1143
01:39:59,861 --> 01:40:01,427
He did things that were unheard of.

1144
01:40:01,429 --> 01:40:02,929
Inhuman.

1145
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:05,631
The only one who could take down
this beast was myself,

1146
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:07,166
John Doe.

1147
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:11,371
I loved her more than
I loved life, itself.

1148
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:15,408
Sometimes life gives you
difficult choices.

1149
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:24,517
Now his time has come.

1150
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:28,121
I gave them everything they wanted.

1151
01:40:28,123 --> 01:40:32,792
My reputation, my money,
loyalty, my love,

1152
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:35,028
and ultimately my life.

1153
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:39,899
The only thing I kept was my freedom.

1154
