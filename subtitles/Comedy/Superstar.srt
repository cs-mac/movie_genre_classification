1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,901
"My life"

2
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,701
"Is ever so perfect"

3
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,436
"My life"

4
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,194
"Has been a bed of roses"

5
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,194
"And you might think I'm crazy"

6
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:49,256
"So what, if I am"

7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,632
"My head is full of good things"

8
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:56,833
"Enough for everyone"

9
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:02,508
"Beautiful"

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,913
"Is all I see when I look at me"

11
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,111
"Beautiful"

12
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,350
"Everymother's dream"

13
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,620
"Day by day"

14
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,924
" Things just keep getting prettier"

15
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,762
"Beautiful"

16
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:29,069
" What a wondeful life"

17
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:34,509
"My life"

18
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,447
"is really quite simple"

19
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,246
"My life"

20
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,447
"is just what I make it"

21
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,049
"I think you think I'm seeing"

22
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,923
"Only things I wanna see"

23
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:54,624
"The truth is that I'm being"

24
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:59,159
"Who I wanna be"

25
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,135
"Beautiful"

26
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,200
"What a wondeful life"

27
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,873
"Beautiful"

28
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:13,849
"Things keep getting prettier"

29
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:17,319
"Beautiful"

30
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,380
- "Thinks keep getting prettier"
- "So pretty"

31
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:25,157
"Beautiful"

32
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:31,600
"My life, beautiful"

33
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,365
There are 2 different ways
of getting into a swimming pool.

34
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:37,134
The first way, you take your toe...

35
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,972
and you carefully test
the water's temperature.

36
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:43,912
And if that feels okay,
slowly get into the water,

37
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:48,266
letting your body
adjust to the cold.

38
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:51,163
Then there's the second way
of getting into a pool.

39
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,170
- Aah!
- You jump.

40
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:58,505
That's me, Mary Katherine Gallagher.
It's nice to meet you.

41
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:02,637
Okay. Now, they say that God
works in mysterious ways.

42
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:05,683
And in my case, very mysterious.

43
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,684
Anyway, this is my story,

44
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,380
and you should pay attention
'cause it's starting right now.

45
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:34,100
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

46
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:37,113
Your birthmark looks like shit.

47
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,581
- So, you're okay?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,281
Lifeguard!

49
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,550
Aah!

50
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:51,851
I grew up in a little town
called Besamee Heights.

51
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,297
It's this really friendly place
where everyone likes to say "hi. "

52
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,300
Hi there.

53
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,700
I grew up in what people
called the ugliest house...

54
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,467
with the ugliest lawn
and the ugliest dog.

55
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,506
My mom and dad died in this horrible
accident when I was a baby,

56
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,515
so my grandmother took care of me.

57
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,847
And my grandmother
was in an accident too.

58
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:16,079
Actually, most of my family
had gotten hurt at some point.

59
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:19,385
We're sort of accident-prone.

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,893
I'm off.

61
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,156
Now, my grandmother used to
always say that when I grow up,

62
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,663
I should become a business woman.

63
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,360
But I didn't really
think about business,

64
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,302
mostly because I couldn't stop
thinking about the one thing...

65
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,238
that I wanted more
than anything in the world.

66
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:41,904
A kiss. A big Hollywood
fireworks type of kiss.

67
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,644
So each night before I went to bed,
I would pray for God to help me.

68
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:50,017
And please, God,
send me someone to make out with...

69
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,283
and tongue kiss like this.

70
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:59,462
Then one day
while me and my grandmother...

71
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,158
were watching some old movie,
it hit me.

72
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,259
There was only one way
I'd ever get what I wanted.

73
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:08,430
I would have to become
exactly like those people I saw...

74
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,440
getting kissed in the movies.

75
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:14,467
- I would have to become-
- A superstar.

76
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:21,483
Ooh, ah.

77
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,201
This is St. Monica's.

78
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,204
It was the first place
I really thought I had a chance...

79
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,604
of making my dream come true.

80
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,314
Superstar!

81
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,045
- Amen.
- Shh.

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,988
Sorry.

83
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:04,461
So I tried out for every star-making
activity that St. Monica's offered.

84
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,463
- Higher. Higher.
- Like ballet.

85
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,999
Ooh!

86
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,662
And my gymnastics tryout
didn't go very well either.

87
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,307
Whoa!

88
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:38,727
Evian Graham,
the most beautiful, most popular,

89
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:41,458
most bulimic girl
at St. Monica's.

90
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:44,626
Summer, Autumn,
I need your help.

91
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:46,636
- Yes, Evian?
- Yes, Evian?

92
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:49,764
We could either organize a walkathon
to fight multiple sclerosis...

93
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,275
or a bike-a-thon
to fight polio.

94
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,402
- What'll it be? Hmm?
- Hmm.

95
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,075
All the boys liked her.
I think because she had a nice body.

96
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,716
What are you looking at,
boobsweat?

97
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:11,193
- Nothing.
- It's called a bra, Mary.

98
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:13,924
But don't worry.
You'll never need one.

99
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,929
Ow! You hurt my titty.

100
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,909
I'm sorry. You had a little spot
there on your brassiere,

101
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,470
and I was just trying
to... wipe it off.

102
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,675
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,651
I got this after-schooljob
at Kip's Video Warehouse...

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,714
as the rewind girl...

105
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,812
so that I could study
as many superstars as possible.

106
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:45,411
I thought
the more movies I watched,

107
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:48,855
the more they'd rub off on me,
and people said that they did.

108
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,859
Especially movies like Carrie,

109
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:54,090
starring Academy Award-winner
Sissy Spacek.

110
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,606
What are you doing?

111
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,938
I'm using my telekinesis
to kill the girl...

112
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,308
who threw pig's blood on me
at the prom.

113
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,981
Okay.

114
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:17,213
Kip also had those made-for-
television movies which I love.

115
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,721
Father, forgive me
for I have sinned.

116
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,281
It has been two days
since my last confession.

117
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,852
Go ahead.
Tell me your sins, my child.

118
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,989
Father, my sins
would best be expressed...

119
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:32,228
in a monologue from
the made-for-TV movie Sybil,

120
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:35,794
starring Sally Field as a woman
with multiple personality disorder.

121
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:40,275
- Go ahead.
- Ah, look at you.

122
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,607
My pretty little girl,

123
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,082
sitting there with her face all
painted up and a little halter top.

124
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,311
You're nothing
but a little slut.

125
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:53,482
Don't call me that.
I'm a Puerto Rican lady, senor.

126
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,889
We all know you're a slut,
Sybil Anne Dorsett.

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,329
We know you're a little slut.
No, I'm not! I'm not a slut!

128
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,593
I'm not a slut!
I'm not a slut!

129
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,227
I'm not a slut! I'm not a slut!
I ain't no slut!

130
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:14,837
Sorry. Sorry.

131
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,388
No big deal.

132
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,924
The more I kept trying
to become a superstar,

133
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,926
the less they thought I was one.

134
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:33,929
In fact, they had
all these other names for me.

135
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,988
Hey, lesbo.

136
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,365
- Dogface.
- Panty stain.

137
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,700
- And they also called me-
- Skid mark.

138
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,466
- Nipple hair.
- Lame.

139
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,566
- Loser.
- Did I say lesbo?

140
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,669
Are you aware that I am rubber
and you are glue...

141
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:53,978
and everything that you say to me
bounces off of me and sticks to you?

142
00:09:55,785 --> 00:10:00,518
So put that in your
back pocket. Okay.

143
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,796
And then I saw the one
who I wanted to kiss.

144
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,769
Sam, what's up? Hey, Greg.

145
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:16,772
- Dig the sneaks.
- Thanks.

146
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,774
Debbie, shaved your legs.

147
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:20,810
- Hey, Tom, sorry your dad's dead.
- It was him.

148
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,311
Sky Corrigan.

149
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:27,008
The best guy dancer
in the school.

150
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,176
"Don't
Don't stop it"

151
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:34,087
- I call this one The Pepper Mill.
- "Don't stop, don't stop it"

152
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,647
Enjoy.

153
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,693
"Don't, don't, don't
Don't stop it"

154
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,697
Uh-oh. Is that the prettiest girl
in all of St. Monica's?

155
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:48,726
All signs point to "yes. "

156
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:51,205
I bet you put that
cherry lip gloss on just for me.

157
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,208
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

158
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:56,370
- No, you shut up.
- Make me shut up.

159
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,380
Okay.

160
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,215
I like sugar.

161
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,881
Sugar is sweet.

162
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:15,389
I had a really good time
on our date last night. Did you?

163
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:19,401
I wore this kiwi lime lip gloss
just for you.

164
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,903
You like it? Huh?

165
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,667
You like kiwi?

166
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,876
Shut up.

167
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:30,845
You shut up.
'Cause you're sexy.

168
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:34,350
Shh. Shh.

169
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,977
I'm gonna spank you.
You wanna be spanked?

170
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:39,851
Huh? You want me
to spank your booty?

171
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll spank it. I'll spank it.
I'll spank you.

172
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,753
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

173
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:51,725
Oh, God.

174
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,860
Oh, my body.

175
00:11:56,306 --> 00:12:00,766
Sorry. Sorry.
I was-

176
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:04,779
I was just- I was just doing
my part to save the rain forest.

177
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,611
Sorry.

178
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:11,415
Mary, you're a special girl,

179
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:17,119
so special that we're going
to put you in special ed.

180
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,525
What are you doing
with your hands?

181
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:23,862
Sometimes when I get nervous,
I stick my fingers under my arms...

182
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,867
and I smell them like that.

183
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:38,307
The universe.
How does it work?

184
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:43,045
The Earth circles
around the sun.

185
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:46,816
Mary, welcome to special ed.

186
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,450
- My name is...
- Helen Lewengrub.

187
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,494
Is that all you got?

188
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,530
She was center for
the girl's basketball team.

189
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:58,658
She was a lean,
mean fighting machine.

190
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:02,501
Do you have a best friend?
You wanna be my best friend?

191
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:06,269
Maybe. I have to be
really honest with you.

192
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:09,106
Your intense energy is making me
feel a little bit bombarded.

193
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:12,807
Sorry. Totally.

194
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:16,477
When I call your name,
just say "here, "hmm?Hmm?Hmm?

195
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:20,648
- Howard Feinstein? Hmm?
- Yo! Present.

196
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,783
Howard thinks all the girls
in school wanna sleep with him.

197
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,851
And the boys too.

198
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,862
You wanna quit
looking at me, fruity.

199
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,296
I don't play butt darts, okay?

200
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,766
I love the ladies.

201
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:36,862
- Owen Flanagan?
- Here. Here. Here. Here. Here.

202
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,032
Owen has
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

203
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,474
He says everything,
like,five times.

204
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:44,672
- Maria Ganitisis?
- Here.

205
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:49,309
But, uh, the devil
speaks for me, obviously.

206
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,645
Ah.

207
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:55,282
- Thomas Smith?
- Here.

208
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:59,692
But I don't know where here is, man,
'cause I'm so wasted, man.

209
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,026
Thomas, stop pretending
that you're high on drugs.

210
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:07,126
It is a sin to even pretend
that you're- you're- you're baked.

211
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,465
He's too scared
to actually take drugs.

212
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,637
- Drugs are bad.
- Eric Slater? Hmm?

213
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,015
Retards!

214
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,416
Would you please go back
to your own class? Please. Go!

215
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:38,256
Mr. Slater, I presume. Hmm?

216
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,834
How come he's not answering?

217
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,709
Slater just transferred here
from public school.

218
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:55,842
He's crazy.
They say he chopped up his parents.

219
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,079
And now he never talks.

220
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:02,818
Let's try it again.
Eric Slater? Hmm?

221
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:17,005
Yes, well, moving on.

222
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,701
Hey, new friend.

223
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,112
Did you see that sign
they're putting up?

224
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,549
"Catholic Teenager Magazine
presents...

225
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,884
"the Let's Fight Venereal Disease
Talent Contest.

226
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:37,152
"Winner gets a free trip
to Hollywood-

227
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,159
And a chance to be an extra...

228
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:42,890
in a movie
with positive moral values. "

229
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:44,591
Oh, God.

230
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,499
Miss Gallagher!

231
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:52,131
Miss Gallagher, so how
does it feel to be an extra...

232
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:55,267
in a movie
with positive moral values?

233
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:57,868
- It feels okay.
- Miss Gallagher.

234
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,880
How does it feel to have
everyone wanna kiss you...

235
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:02,212
that particular way
you wanna be kissed?

236
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,879
Miss Gallagher,
howdoes it feel to be a superstar?

237
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:14,328
This was my chance.

238
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:18,765
If I could win the talent contest,
Sky's lips would definitely be mine.

239
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,496
Hey, everybody. I dreamt of
this new dance move last night.

240
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,198
I call this The Fax Machine.

241
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,673
Oh!

242
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:30,438
I wish I could dance
with Sky Corrigan.

243
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:35,472
Sky's definitely the Swayziest,
but he's gonna dance with Evian.

244
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,144
Exactly! You did it perfectly.

245
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,153
You're so good.

246
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:53,033
What do you think Slater
would do in the talent show?

247
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,262
Maybe he'll murder some people...

248
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:59,068
and make a flesh coat
by sewing their skin hides together.

249
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,510
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:07,446
I was rewinding Silence of the Lambs
at the video store yesterday.

251
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:11,542
Isn't it romantic

252
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,610
"Merely to be young"

253
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:16,555
On such a night

254
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:19,218
As this

255
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:22,559
Isn't it romantic

256
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,894
Merely to be young

257
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:30,029
On such a night as this

258
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,039
Sweet

259
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,905
Singing in the moonlight

260
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,415
Introductions are important.

261
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:44,384
When introducing oneself,
first make eye contact.

262
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:47,683
With a confident smile,
say, "Hi. I'm-"

263
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,522
- Mary Katherine Gallagher.
- Not bad. Try again.

264
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:54,585
Hi. I'm Mary Katherine Gallagher.

265
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:56,892
- And where is your hand?
- Right here.

266
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,900
In a new friend's hand,
that's where.

267
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:07,533
So, I was-

268
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:10,544
I was saying that I was thinking
of entering the talent contest.

269
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,807
The talent contest?

270
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:16,840
No, no! You have
to study business.

271
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,580
- But-
- No buts!

272
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:23,385
And forgive those
who trespass against us.

273
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,393
Please, God, convince my grandmother
to let me be in the talent show...

274
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:30,420
so that I can get kissed,
maybe by Sky Corrigan.

275
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,134
Superstar!

276
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,970
The Body of Christ.

277
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,382
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.

278
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:57,580
- The Body of Christ.
- Are these nonfat?

279
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:10,504
Hey, Mary.
Why so glum?

280
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:14,770
My grandmother won't let me
audition for the talent show.

281
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:18,176
The only boy willing
to go near me is Howard.

282
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,310
Mmm.

283
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:23,816
Just, like, audition anyway
and don't tell her.

284
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:26,979
Really?
You think so?

285
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:30,218
That's it.
You're feeling sad.

286
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,816
- So you know what it's time for?
- What?

287
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:37,024
Supermodel
documentary hour.

288
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:42,260
Shall I look straight here?

289
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:44,601
I was just walking
down the street one day,

290
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,072
and a man come up to me
and he said,

291
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:49,234
"Would you like
to be a supermodel?"

292
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,441
I said, "Oui, " and the next day
I'm on the cover of Vogue.

293
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,244
Christy Turlington
and Naomi Campbell...

294
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,016
are two of my very best friends.

295
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,187
When we get together, it is, like,
total, total and utter insanity.

296
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:12,894
Insanity! It's like three of the
most gorgeous girls raising hell.

297
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,467
Problem, ladies?

298
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,838
Sorry, Father Ritley.
Sorry.

299
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,813
Sorry, everybody.
Sorry.

300
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:36,018
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Sorry.

301
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,583
- You're cool?
- You scared me.

302
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:43,358
Yeah, I'm okay.

303
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:46,867
Your boss sent me back here
to find a movie.

304
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:50,336
Hey, don't you
go to my school?

305
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:52,202
Yes, I do.

306
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:56,607
Listen, I'm looking for
a made-for-TV movie from the '70s...

307
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:00,739
starring John Travolta,
The Boy in the Plastic Bubble?

308
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:03,875
That's my 19th favorite
made-for-TV movie of all time.

309
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:06,785
- That's my 19th also.
- Wow.

310
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:10,449
Yeah.
"All around me.

311
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,459
Plastic. "

312
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:14,893
- "A bubble for me-"
- "To be-"

313
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:17,557
"Germ free. You-"

314
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:21,227
- "And me. "
- "And me. "

315
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:25,864
Sky, forget that stupid old movie.
I'm getting Flubber again.

316
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,773
Okay, Evian.
Hey, nice meeting you.

317
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:32,244
Mary Katherine Gallagher.
Mary Katherine Gallagher.

318
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:34,281
- Sky.
- Sky.

319
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,613
- Be kind. Rewind.
- Okay.

320
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:39,619
That's funny.

321
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:42,417
Evian?

322
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:53,459
- Mary, rewind this.
- Oh, sure.

323
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,468
The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.

324
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,902
I used to watch that movie
all the time. See ya.

325
00:21:57,972 --> 00:22:00,065
Bye.

326
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:05,169
Listen, I'll be back later
to help you get inside, okay?

327
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,737
Is he the one you're going with?

328
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,010
Who says I'm going with anybody?

329
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:14,919
Todd, put your face
up against the plastic.

330
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:18,152
- What for?
- I did what you wanted me to do.

331
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,992
Now do it.
Do it. Do it.

332
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,869
Hey, Mare.
What you doing?

333
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,469
Well, I was just
doing the robot.

334
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:49,346
It's something that I was thinking
about doing for the talent show.

335
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:52,978
Hi, Mary. I like to do all I can
to help the challenged.

336
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,988
So a word ofadvice.

337
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,990
I wouldn't say "Superstar"
anymore...

338
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:59,959
because some people might say
that you super-suck.

339
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,996
Go suck your
boyfriend's ding-a-ling.

340
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:06,762
- Go shave your mustache, Helen.
- Or should we say Geraldo?

341
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:09,564
Gotta go jog for glaucoma.
Bye.

342
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:12,731
Evian, you're a superass!

343
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:14,968
Evian does have a super ass.

344
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,534
Oh, I know.

345
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,521
That's okay.

346
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:40,659
Hey, Mare.

347
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:44,227
- You want half of my Sloppy Joseph?
- No, thanks.

348
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:48,503
It's time to feed the retards!

349
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:51,943
- Hey, cut it out!
- Wanna make something out of this?

350
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,642
Maybe you want some of my salad
all over your face!

351
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,651
Aah!

352
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:18,267
Helen, have you ever
kissed a boy before?

353
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:21,968
Owen kissed me five times
on the cheek once.

354
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,034
- Really?
- Hey, Owen.

355
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:27,548
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

356
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:32,109
- I don't mean on the cheek.
- Okay, who do you wanna kiss?

357
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:35,948
Todd, peanut butter and jelly.
Classic.

358
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:38,491
- Vivica, low-fat salad.
- Sky Corrigan.

359
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,551
But, Mare, Sky's taken.

360
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:45,730
- You should kiss Howard.
- Ugh.

361
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,290
He likes you.

362
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,439
Oh, yeah.

363
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:00,739
Yeah.

364
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:08,748
Mr. Feinstein, Pope-a-licious.
I love it.

365
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,417
Hey, Mary.

366
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:14,950
I saw you outside
doing that robot thing.

367
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,259
You have some nice moves.

368
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:20,858
- Thank you.
- You have some nice moves.

369
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:23,961
You have some nice moves.

370
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,270
Nice moves.

371
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:31,971
Mooooves.

372
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:34,310
May I have... this dance?

373
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:36,475
"Everybody dance now"

374
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:44,524
"Everybody dance now"

375
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:53,556
- Whoo!
- "Everybody dance now"

376
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:56,626
"Left to right"

377
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,797
" Work me all night"

378
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:01,341
" Come on, let's sweat"

379
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,070
"Baby"

380
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,977
"Let the music take control"

381
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:08,072
"Let the rhythm move you"

382
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,814
"Sweat"

383
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:14,582
Father, Son and Holy Ghost!

384
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,179
"Let the rhythm move you"

385
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,322
Yeah!

386
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,525
Fame!

387
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,434
"Everybody dance now"

388
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,508
Mary.

389
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:41,047
What are you doing?

390
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,480
Sometimes I-

391
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:46,952
I get low blood sugar and it-

392
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:49,922
it makes me a little bit shaky.

393
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:53,893
Sorry. Sorry.

394
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,295
How is the, um, talent
competition coming?

395
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:35,893
Quite well.

396
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,202
I don't want to point
the finger of blame, but...

397
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,940
who broke the good toaster?

398
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:06,622
These are my breasts.

399
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:11,229
Oh, God.
They're so big.

400
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:16,766
I just need a big bra to
strap 'em back and support them...

401
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,937
because they're so huge.

402
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:23,347
They need to be hooked
and strapped in for support.

403
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,942
They're my big boobs.

404
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,615
This one is bigger
than this one,

405
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,182
'cause this is a mommy
and that's a baby.

406
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,785
And this one is
very nice to this one,

407
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:39,492
and they hold hands
'cause they're friends.

408
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:42,033
And forgive those
who trespass against us.

409
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,538
Amen.

410
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:50,573
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

411
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,805
Good night, candle.

412
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:04,190
Good night, God.

413
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,354
Good night, Mary.

414
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,826
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my me!

415
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:19,270
- How are you?
- It's going okay.

416
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,741
- Are you the Lord?
- Well, to you I am.

417
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,244
See, technically,
you're like in this REM sleep state,

418
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:27,576
and I'm a mixture
of your mind's images of God,

419
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:31,846
some past authority figures,
Sky, and your dad.

420
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,549
Basically, your subconscious came up
with me to help you deal, dig?

421
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,683
Yeah.

422
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,626
Uh, you want a glass of water?

423
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:44,357
No, I'm good.
I'm God.

424
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:46,627
Oh, right.

425
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,258
- Is this your stereo?
- Yep.

426
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,132
- CD player, huh?
- Yep.

427
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,967
We don't have these.

428
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:02,628
Spirit in the sky, in the-
That song's about me.

429
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:07,388
Mary, I know
your soul is troubled.

430
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,400
And I'm here to guide you.

431
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,402
Okay.

432
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:16,241
My child, during this time
of great adversity,

433
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,606
I want you to do one thing:

434
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:20,838
Get jiggy with it.

435
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:24,144
- What?
- You know. Get jiggy with it.

436
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:26,275
Na, na, na, na, na, na

437
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:28,718
Na-na, na-na, na na, na, na
Ow!

438
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,017
I'm- I'm very sorry,

439
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,687
but I- I don't know exactly
what the word "jiggy" means.

440
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:40,926
The point is,
I work in mysterious ways.

441
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,025
I mean, out there.

442
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,737
Listen to your heart.
Do whatever it tells you...

443
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,240
and go with the godly flow.

444
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,571
Okay.

445
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,703
- Oh, and most important,
- Yeah?

446
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:57,408
when you wake up
in the morning, audition.

447
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:59,417
"Na, na, na-na, na, na"

448
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:02,079
Na-na, na-na, na
na, na, na, na

449
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:29,808
Good afternoon, ladies. You're all
looking quite lovely this afternoon.

450
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:31,281
What do you want?

451
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,749
She probably wants
to try out for the squad.

452
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:35,685
I was actually wondering if
any of you would be kind enough...

453
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:37,813
to show me the sign-up sheet
for the auditions.

454
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,326
Oh, right.
She's a superstar.

455
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:45,625
As president ofthe Catholic
Cheerleaders Against VD Foundation,

456
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:48,462
I can't let you sign up
for the audition.

457
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,968
But I wanna sign up
for the auditions.

458
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:54,631
Mary, fighting VD isn't a joke.
It's a very serious disease.

459
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:58,609
Besides, Sky and me
are gonna win anyway.

460
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:00,542
Hey, guys, I got a new cheer.

461
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,637
- Evian?
- John the Baptist lost his head

462
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:05,775
Evian!

463
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:11,620
I'm really sorry that I pushed you.
It was an accident.

464
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,988
I just really wanna
sign up for the auditions.

465
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,324
Well, I'm really sorry
that I pushed you.

466
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,990
But I just can't let
a hymenally-challenged dog...

467
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,054
sign up for the audition.

468
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,000
- Ooh!
- Well, you know what?

469
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:27,129
You're a very mean girl, and you're
gonna go to hell for saying that.

470
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:32,166
You're a really pushy girl, and
I might just wanna kick your ass.

471
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,338
Yeah? Well, I just might
wanna kickyour ass!

472
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,645
Well, come on, Super Sucks.

473
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:40,947
If I was Sissy Spacek
in the movie Carrie,

474
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,648
I would use my telekinesis
to kill you.

475
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,850
You know what, Mary?

476
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,894
- Not yet.
- Sorry.

477
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:53,420
Mary, you know why
your parents died?

478
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,433
Because you're
such an embarrassment,

479
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,696
they couldn't bear to live anymore.

480
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,069
You know what, Evian?
You should be really embarrassed...

481
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,576
because your parents named you
after bottled water.

482
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,117
Hey, is there a problem here?

483
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:21,057
My titties!

484
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,362
- Yaah!
- Hey!

485
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:29,231
- Yaah!
- Aah.

486
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,769
Karate kick.

487
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:42,211
- I rewound those Jackie Chan movies.
- Nevertheless.

488
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:45,114
Evian, I'm disappointed in you.

489
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:48,415
At this school,
any student, including Mary,

490
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,285
is allowed to make a fool of herself
at the auditions.

491
00:33:51,356 --> 00:33:53,984
I'm suspending you
for the rest of the day.

492
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,152
- But, Father Ritley-
- Evian.

493
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:59,163
Father Ritley, the person
you wanted to see is on her way.

494
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:02,758
Ah, well, send her in
when she gets here.

495
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,162
- You are so dead.
- Go drink a bottle of yourself.

496
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,902
Mmmmmm! Aah!

497
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:13,240
Evian, Mary, stop that.

498
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,303
Mary!
Stop it!

499
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,008
Ah!

500
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,082
Evian, you're dismissed.

501
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:24,816
I hate you.

502
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,256
"Go drink a bottle of yourself"?

503
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,799
Miss Gallagher-

504
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:40,100
Miss Gallagher, what's that horrible
thing you said to Sister Eileen?

505
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:42,231
I told her to move
her big, white butt...

506
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:44,673
or I would coldcock her honky ass.

507
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:48,770
To Sister Eileen?
Why would you say such a thing?

508
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:51,714
The video store where I work
got Spike Lee movies.

509
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:56,152
Ah, yes. You're the- You're
the rewind girl at Kip's Video.

510
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,654
Yes, I am.

511
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,283
Well, let's pretend
that your life's a movie.

512
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,453
We rewind it.
It ends.

513
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:05,827
You're dead.
How was it?

514
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,366
My feelings would best
be expressed in a monologue...

515
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:11,402
from the made-for-TV movie
Portrait of a Teenage Centerold,

516
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,563
starring Miss Lori Singer
from Footloose.

517
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,130
Ifyou must.

518
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:21,973
It excites me, Daddy.

519
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:24,311
Don't you see?

520
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,715
I like it
when the men look at me.

521
00:35:26,785 --> 00:35:30,516
You try to keep me trapped here
in this small town...

522
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,523
like a little animal.

523
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,855
But I am bustin' out, Daddy.

524
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:39,193
I'm gonna see the world,
and the world is gonna see me.

525
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,232
They're gonna see
all of me, Daddy.

526
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,165
- All of me!
- Mary-

527
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:46,068
- Mary, stop that! Stop that now!
- Look! Look!

528
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:48,368
What are you doing
with my grandchild?

529
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,671
Nothing!
We were-

530
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,911
Mrs. Gallagher,

531
00:35:55,981 --> 00:36:00,350
I called you here today to discuss
your granddaughter's problem.

532
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:05,823
Now, upon reflection, I think a
combination of prayer and Ritalin...

533
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:08,189
could eliminate her excess energy.

534
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,855
How dare you.
My Mary has no problem.

535
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,398
My granddaughter is a star.

536
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,730
- What?
- Look at that face.

537
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:19,771
She looks like a young
Elizabeth Taylor.

538
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:22,898
You may call her hyperactive.

539
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,876
But if the Good Lord
gave her excess energy,

540
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:28,378
then, by God, no one's
taking it from her.

541
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,779
If you don't appreciate that,

542
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,546
maybe the problem
is not my granddaughter.

543
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,282
Maybe the problem is this school.

544
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,420
- I'm taking her home.
- Mrs. Gallagher!

545
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,893
Good day to you, sir.
Mary!

546
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:46,760
Mrs. Gallagher,
listen to reason. Ay!

547
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,562
I couldn't believe my grandmother
told Father Ritley I was a star.

548
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,502
She'd never said that before.

549
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,971
She'd also never
run over a priest before.

550
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,940
Sorry.

551
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:01,207
I can't believe he suspended you.
It so wasn't your fault.

552
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,807
- Thank you. I know.
- Mary started the whole thing.

553
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:07,078
Thank you.
I know.

554
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:11,384
Hold on a second. I've been through
a trauma and I need a moment.

555
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:23,491
And now Father Ritley
is letting her audition.

556
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:25,502
That is the last time
I try to help someone.

557
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,095
She is so going to regret this.

558
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:33,008
I gotta go. That's probably Sky.

559
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:35,876
- Bye, Evian.
- Hi, Sky.

560
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:38,609
Do you miss me as much
as I miss you so much?

561
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,983
Evian, I saw what
you did to Mary today.

562
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,614
Not too ladylike.
I think we need to talk.

563
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,524
- Is something wrong?
- Look, I can't talk right now.

564
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:52,791
- But you just called me.
- Look, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

565
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:54,798
Meet me at the gym.
Bye.

566
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:59,437
Hmm.

567
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,367
...throughout the New England area.

568
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:04,806
They've been hit hard this winter,
but the South remains warm.

569
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:07,003
Grandma, why did you tell
Father Ritley that I was a star?

570
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,046
I was just talking.

571
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:11,673
Because that's-
that's what I wanna be.

572
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:15,344
- I really want to audition.
- You want to be a businesswoman.

573
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,116
That's what you want.
Don't you understand?

574
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:20,123
This is everything
I've ever wanted.

575
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:22,455
This is everything
I've ever hoped for.

576
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:26,486
I just want my life to begin.
Dreams can come true, you know.

577
00:38:26,564 --> 00:38:28,862
And when Johnny comes back from
the war, we can start a family...

578
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,992
and begin our life
together on the farm.

579
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:34,004
Mary!

580
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,466
Could I please, please,
please, please audition?

581
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,978
- No.
- Please?

582
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:43,809
No.

583
00:38:45,516 --> 00:38:49,350
You're horrible!
You're horrible!

584
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,882
You're horrible!

585
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:04,234
You're horrible!

586
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:10,507
Horrible!

587
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:28,784
- Mary.
- Leave me alone!

588
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:34,229
I didn't want to do this.

589
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:38,257
But it's time I told you
how your parents died.

590
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:40,896
What does that have to do
with the talent contest?

591
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:42,940
Everything.

592
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:46,841
I thought you said that Mom and
Dad were savagely ripped apart...

593
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:49,402
and eaten by a school
of hammerhead sharks.

594
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,711
I just told you that
to make you feel better.

595
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:57,983
What I'm about to tell you now
is the truth, so help me God.

596
00:39:58,055 --> 00:40:00,489
Seventeen years ago,

597
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:02,423
your parents entered...

598
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:06,054
the Besamee Heights
annual stepdancing competition.

599
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,293
You mean, stepdancing
like in Riverdance?

600
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,666
That's nothing to what
your parents could do.

601
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:16,833
My mother taught it to me.
I taught it to your mom.

602
00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:20,844
But so help me, Mary,
you will never stepdance...

603
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:26,077
as long as I walk this-
wheel around the earth.

604
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:30,343
The year you were born,

605
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:33,822
the stepdancing competition
was fierce.

606
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,792
A couple named O'Shea...

607
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:41,127
looked like they'd be the first
to beat your mom and dad.

608
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,498
But your mother was determined
to keep her title,

609
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,037
no matter what it took.

610
00:40:49,674 --> 00:40:54,441
It began well enough.
Your parents ate up that stage.

611
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:57,538
Just when it looked as though your
parents would be triumphant again,

612
00:40:57,615 --> 00:41:00,106
the unthinkable happened.

613
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:04,450
Fat Teddy McGinty's belly
struck the record player,

614
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:07,013
accidentally
turning up the speed.

615
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:11,790
The dancers began stepping quicker
and quicker, trying to keep up.

616
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:15,196
And that's when your mother fell.

617
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,734
And she took your dad
down with her.

618
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:22,330
And before the dancers
could stop themselves,

619
00:41:22,406 --> 00:41:24,806
they stomped your parents to death.

620
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:29,470
Oh, Mary, I know
you want to perorm,

621
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:32,675
but when you're a businesswoman,

622
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,743
you'll be sitting
behind a desk all day, safe.

623
00:41:42,493 --> 00:41:45,656
Rotate!

624
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,494
Oh, is that all you got?
Come on!

625
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:50,830
- Sky and Evian are breaking up.
- Oh, my God!

626
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:54,235
Sky and Evian are gonna break up.
Sky's gonna break up with Evian.

627
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,239
Come on!

628
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,909
Here he comes.

629
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,877
Hi, Sky. What did you
wanna talk to me about?

630
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:13,014
I think it would work
for me if we broke up.

631
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:21,555
I- I-I don't understand.
This is such a shock. What's wrong?

632
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:24,965
Now you're giving me attitude.

633
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:27,698
Just tell me
what I did wrong.

634
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:30,206
Listen, we talked
about this last night...

635
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:32,242
till I was blue in the face.

636
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,211
We're just growing
in different directions.

637
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:39,909
I mean, you're this way
and I'm- I'm that way.

638
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:42,179
You're here.
I'm there.

639
00:42:42,253 --> 00:42:45,051
And there's no one right in here.

640
00:42:45,122 --> 00:42:48,091
So it's over.
Just like that. It's over.

641
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,492
- You're telling me that it's over.
- I guess so.

642
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:56,228
Hey, Bartholomew, nice name.

643
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,573
Just breathe.

644
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:07,634
- Poor Evian.
- Lucky you.

645
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:10,909
Sky's a single slice
of beefcake now.

646
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:12,916
And he's on the rebound.

647
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:16,147
It's, like, so obvious that you two
are gonna hook up.

648
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,653
You really think so?

649
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:20,020
Remember,
he said you have nice moves.

650
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:22,286
That means he was
looking at your body,

651
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,328
which means
he thinks you're doable.

652
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,159
So basically,
he asked you to sleep with him.

653
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:30,098
My goodness. This relationship
is moving too fast.

654
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,727
Go talk to him before
somebody else dates him.

655
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,964
- Go. Go. Go.
- I don't know.

656
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,973
Go!

657
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,976
Excuse me.

658
00:43:41,045 --> 00:43:43,309
- Hey, Mary.
- Hey, what's up? What's up?

659
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:46,817
Um, Sky, I know...

660
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:52,379
that you haven't been s-single
for a long time...

661
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:55,721
or anything like that,
but I was wondering...

662
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:58,353
if- if-

663
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:05,130
Oh, God, you smell so good.

664
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,567
Oh, no!

665
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:15,870
- Sorry.
- It's gonna be okay.

666
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:18,380
Now you have
to audition for the show.

667
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:20,713
'Cause that way Sky
could see how talented you are,

668
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:23,219
and he will definitely kiss you.

669
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,380
Really?
You think so?

670
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:28,186
- Totally.
- Wow.

671
00:44:40,404 --> 00:44:42,338
Sky, promise me,

672
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,567
after you destroy the meteor
that's headed towards Earth,

673
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:46,576
you'll come back and kiss me.

674
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,908
I promise, babe.

675
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:52,742
All my bags are packed

676
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,842
I'm ready to go

677
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:58,013
"I'm standing here"

678
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:00,387
Outside your door

679
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:05,623
I hate to wake you up
to say good-bye

680
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:09,530
I don't know how to tell you this.

681
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,467
But I just want you to know that...

682
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,027
I'm really going-

683
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:17,074
Can you shut the hell up!

684
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:19,371
I'm trying to talk!

685
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,477
- You gotta go.
- No.

686
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:25,674
- You have to get off me.
- No!

687
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:27,774
- Mary, please get off.
- No!

688
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:30,047
- Get the hell off me!
- No! I wanna stay!

689
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:32,419
Get off!
There's a meteor coming!

690
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,424
No!

691
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,282
Mary, did you rewind the tape?
The customer's waiting.

692
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:41,618
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.
- Come on. It's two-dollar Tuesday.

693
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:04,105
Evian.

694
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:08,240
Good to see you.
Out walking for scoliosis again?

695
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:12,515
Oh, no, Mrs. Corrigan.
I just came by to give Sky this.

696
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:15,819
- Is he home?
- Yes, he's just-

697
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:18,826
Actually, can you wait a moment?

698
00:46:18,894 --> 00:46:21,886
No, definitely not.
No way.

699
00:46:21,964 --> 00:46:25,297
I'm sorry.
Sky's not home.

700
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:28,528
Oh. Okay.

701
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:32,506
Then could you tell him if he
wants to talk to give me a call?

702
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:35,338
Don't wanna talk.
Go away.

703
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:40,780
Okay, I'll tell him if I see him.
Nice knowing you.

704
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:43,409
Oh, but wait. I'm still gonna
see you around, aren't I?

705
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:46,511
Oh. Now you're
giving me attitude?

706
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:48,954
I'm not giving you attitude.
Just tell me what I did wrong.

707
00:46:49,024 --> 00:46:51,925
What are you going to do,
hit me too?

708
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,128
Hey, Evian,
I made up a new dance move.

709
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,192
It's called The Move On
With Your Life. Ha!

710
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,831
I did The Fax Machine for you!

711
00:47:12,514 --> 00:47:15,074
Mary Katherine Gallagher...

712
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,813
must die.

713
00:47:19,888 --> 00:47:23,790
No, I do like you.

714
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:26,419
But it's too soon.

715
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:29,293
You just broke up with her.
We can't.

716
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,095
Stop making me laugh.

717
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:57,921
Oh, dear God,
please make this crazy kid go away.

718
00:47:57,993 --> 00:48:00,621
Go away.
Go away. Go away.

719
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:03,631
Dear God, please make
this crazy kid go away.

720
00:48:13,008 --> 00:48:15,602
What do you want from me?

721
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:19,573
My journal.

722
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:21,582
Thanks.

723
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:27,320
A flower.

724
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,789
Thanks.

725
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:44,498
Thank you, Thomas,
for that tribute to Star Wars.

726
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:46,871
Very, uh, astounding.

727
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:50,400
Like I was there.
Well, we seem to have a lot of-

728
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:53,141
I feel really good about
our chances, don't you, Sky?

729
00:48:53,215 --> 00:48:55,149
Do you hear something, Dylan?

730
00:48:55,217 --> 00:48:57,151
'Cause it sounds like someone
I used to go out with...

731
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:59,710
acting like we're still going out,
even though we're definitely not.

732
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:01,949
- Definitely not.
- No.

733
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:04,151
Game over.

734
00:49:06,962 --> 00:49:08,327
The devil went down
to Georgia

735
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:10,092
He was looking
for a soul to steal

736
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:12,633
He was in a bind
'cause he was way behind

737
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,101
And he was willing
to make a deal

738
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,262
When he came across
this young man

739
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,135
Sawing on a fiddle
and playing it hot

740
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,538
"Andthe devil jumped up
on a hickory stump and said"

741
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,543
" "Boy, let me tell you what"

742
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:24,476
And the devil's in you
and the devil's in me

743
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,844
- The devil's got a big hard-
- Uh, Maria!

744
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:30,683
Thank you, Maria.
Thank you.

745
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,091
Next up we have, um,
Mary Katherine-

746
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,651
Gallagher!
Mary Katherine Gallagher.

747
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,197
Mary Katherine Gallagher.
Mary Katherine Gallagher.

748
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:45,756
Okay, just stand there.
Here. Stand here.

749
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:48,462
Come. Stand there.
Stand there. That's good.

750
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,603
So, what are you going
to do for us, Mary?

751
00:49:52,674 --> 00:49:56,701
I just wanna say...
that I'm multitalented,

752
00:49:56,778 --> 00:50:00,305
but today I've chosen
to express myself through song.

753
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:04,314
Okay.

754
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:09,281
You

755
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,886
You ask me
if I love you

756
00:50:13,962 --> 00:50:18,296
And I choke on my reply

757
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:24,203
"I'd rather tell you honestly"

758
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:28,868
Than mislead you with a lie

759
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:34,405
And sometimes
when we touch

760
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:37,919
The honesty's too much

761
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:42,548
"I have to close my eyes"

762
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:46,720
And hide

763
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:50,561
I wanna hold you
till I die

764
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,830
Till we both break down

765
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:57,371
And cry

766
00:50:57,439 --> 00:51:02,240
I wanna hold you

767
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,576
" Till the fear in me"

768
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:17,183
Subsides

769
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:22,688
Mary, that was- that was good.

770
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:25,756
- Good.
- Superstar!

771
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:55,761
Shut up!

772
00:51:55,831 --> 00:52:00,131
You said you liked the movie Carrie.
How do you like it now, Mary?

773
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:02,261
- Retard!
- Shut up!

774
00:52:02,337 --> 00:52:05,101
- Boobsweat!
- Shut up!

775
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:07,971
Retard!

776
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:11,843
- This is not funny. Shut up, man!
- Mary!

777
00:52:14,082 --> 00:52:16,016
Mary?

778
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:24,282
- " You're motorin '"
- Mary Katherine, please!

779
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:27,157
- " What's your price for flight"
- Mary!

780
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:34,494
"In finding Mr. Right"

781
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:39,097
" You'll be allright tonight"

782
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:45,571
"Motorin '"

783
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:50,277
" What's your price for flight"

784
00:52:50,352 --> 00:52:55,881
" You've got him in your sights"

785
00:52:55,957 --> 00:53:01,224
" You're driving through the night"

786
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:08,930
"Sister Christian
Oh, the time has come"

787
00:53:10,598 --> 00:53:16,002
"And you know that you're
the only one to say"

788
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,004
Slater, would you talk to me?

789
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:22,270
Can you please just say
something to me, please?

790
00:53:32,554 --> 00:53:34,954
Your birthmark looks like shit.

791
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:41,660
You're the little boy
that I saved at the pool?

792
00:53:41,729 --> 00:53:44,323
Yeah.

793
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:47,493
"But you're motorin "

794
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:50,834
So why does everyone
think you're crazy?

795
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:56,977
Because I n-n-n-n-n-never talk.

796
00:53:57,045 --> 00:54:00,503
So people make up stories.

797
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:04,279
And I'd rather that
they're scared of me than...

798
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:09,145
make fun of my st-st-stutter.

799
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,920
So what really happened
to your parents?

800
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:15,224
They were savagely ripped apart...

801
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:19,255
and eaten by a school
of hammerhead sharks.

802
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:23,827
- That happens a lot.
- Yeah.

803
00:54:23,905 --> 00:54:25,839
Hey, Slater,

804
00:54:25,907 --> 00:54:28,603
I know I haven't known you
that long or anything, but...

805
00:54:28,676 --> 00:54:31,167
can I ask you a question?

806
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:33,180
Yeah.

807
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:37,116
Do you think I'm pretty?

808
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:40,279
Sometimes I just-

809
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:46,683
I just hate the way I am.

810
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,055
I'm sorry I almost drowned you.

811
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:59,671
That's all right. I was probably
drowning before you got there.

812
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:04,609
- I'm a horrible swimmer.
- Really?

813
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,977
That's funny.

814
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,642
Mary?

815
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,446
I think you look... great.

816
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:19,015
I think you look beautiful.

817
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:27,066
Well, I'm gonna go wash off.
Do you wanna come with me?

818
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:43,481
- What are you doing?
- Uh, t-t-t-testing the water.

819
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:46,384
There's two ways
that you can get into the water.

820
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:50,447
That way or... this way!

821
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:25,392
Whoa,

822
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,519
I slid.

823
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:32,799
This is my house.
So, thanks.

824
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,994
Hey, Slater.

825
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:39,472
Did you really mean it when you said
that you thought I looked beautiful?

826
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,974
Yeah.

827
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:45,342
Do you think that even
without the talent show,

828
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:47,347
Sky would still wanna kiss me?

829
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,489
I think Sky would have to be
cr-cr-crazy not to wanna kiss you.

830
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,991
Really?

831
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:02,325
Oh! Thanks.

832
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:06,765
I'll, uh, see you later, Mary.

833
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:13,804
Oh, God.

834
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:18,608
Thank you so much
for making Slater my friend.

835
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:21,739
And please, God, forgive me...

836
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:26,082
for not telling Slater that I went
to the bathroom in the pool tonight.

837
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:29,746
I had a dream

838
00:57:29,824 --> 00:57:34,420
"A dream about you, baby"

839
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:38,363
- Hi, Grandma.
- "It's gonna come true, baby"

840
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:40,367
Sorry I'm late.

841
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:43,871
I stayed at school
to study business,

842
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,872
and I lost track of time.

843
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,908
Father Ritley called.

844
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,045
He told me you tried out
for the talent show.

845
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:56,311
I'm sorry. I never
should have done that.

846
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:59,876
I promise I'll never
lie toyou again, okay?

847
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:02,650
- You made it.
- Made what?

848
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:04,657
You passed the audition.

849
00:58:04,725 --> 00:58:07,694
I did? I did?

850
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:10,287
Oh, my goodness!

851
00:58:10,364 --> 00:58:12,298
Really? I did?

852
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:16,166
But they want you to lose
the end with the paint.

853
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:19,263
Really? Please let me do it.
Please let me do it.

854
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,741
I can't let you be
in any talent show, Mary.

855
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:27,239
But I can help you to star in one.

856
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:33,315
You see that there?
I danced in that show on Broadway.

857
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:35,321
And these dead stems...

858
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:37,619
used to step-ball-change...

859
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:41,423
two shows a day,
six days a week.

860
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:43,760
If you're going
on the stage, Mary,

861
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:46,425
I don't want you
stinking up the place...

862
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,594
with some paint dance.

863
00:58:48,669 --> 00:58:51,297
Grandma, you don't know
how much this means to me.

864
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:52,964
There's this boy at school-

865
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,338
No boys.

866
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,536
If you're going to do this,

867
00:58:57,612 --> 00:59:01,673
you're going to do it for yourself,
like I did.

868
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:08,019
- Higher! Kick higher!
- I can't. It's hard.

869
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:11,718
- Razzle, dazzle!
- I don't know what that means.

870
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:14,693
- Windmill, windmill!
- Windmill, windmill.

871
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:20,199
Oh, Frances!

872
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:23,328
Sweet Frances, please don't die.

873
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:25,634
Frances, Frances, please don't die.

874
00:59:25,706 --> 00:59:28,732
Frances, go back.
She needs you.

875
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:31,004
Go back.

876
00:59:31,078 --> 00:59:33,478
You wanna go fetch?
Go fetch.

877
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:38,380
Go fetch. That way,
my dog friend. Go on.

878
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:41,216
Frances.

879
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,218
She's alive!
You're all right.

880
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:48,421
Super. Now,

881
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:50,896
if we really want to knock them
on their keisters,

882
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:52,899
we're going to need
a chorus line.

883
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:58,033
One, two-

884
00:59:58,105 --> 01:00:02,405
- What's his problem?
- I got the D.T.'s, Mrs. Gallagher.

885
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:04,569
D.T.'s are from being drunk,
not high, you fruit.

886
01:00:04,645 --> 01:00:07,045
He's got his fake addictions
confused, Mrs. Gallagher.

887
01:00:07,114 --> 01:00:10,550
No, I- I'm just so high...

888
01:00:10,618 --> 01:00:14,384
I think I'm drunk.

889
01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:17,083
We've got two days
to the big show.

890
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:20,059
So when I say kick,
you want to kick.

891
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:22,118
When I say dip, you dip.

892
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:24,528
When I say tap, you tap.

893
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,464
- When I say-
- They get it, Grandma.

894
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:31,233
I've got two more. When I say
booga-booga, you booga-booga.

895
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:33,569
- What's "booga-booga" mean?
- I don't know.

896
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,542
But if I say it,
you better fuckin' figure it out.

897
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:39,171
"My life"

898
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:42,738
"Is ever so perfect"

899
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:46,013
"My life"

900
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:48,671
"Has been a bed of roses"

901
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:52,617
"And you might think I'm crazy"

902
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:55,280
"So what, if I am"

903
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:58,689
"My head is full of good things"

904
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,388
- "Enough for everyone"
- Whoa!

905
01:01:02,463 --> 01:01:05,899
- "Beautiful"
- I slipped. Everything's fine.

906
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:09,265
- "All I see when I look at me"
- Slip-a-roo.

907
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:12,134
"Beautiful"

908
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:16,040
"Every mother's dream"

909
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,374
"Day by day"

910
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:20,436
" What"

911
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:23,540
"A wonderful life"

912
01:01:23,617 --> 01:01:25,551
Yeah!

913
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,745
Superstar.

914
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,017
- Hi there!
- Howdy, neighbor.

915
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:06,526
Undeviled eggs!
Lady crucifingers!

916
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:08,788
- There's my grandmother.
- Oh, my God.

917
01:02:08,862 --> 01:02:10,853
It's all MaryMag-delicious!

918
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:13,195
There's Maria's parents.

919
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:23,374
Good evening, everyone!

920
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:27,244
Welcome to St. Monica's
Catholic High School.

921
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:30,306
So, are we all ready to fight VD?

922
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:36,852
I hope that you're as excited
as I am...

923
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:40,951
to see who will win
this free trip to Hollywood...

924
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,996
with a chance to appear
as an extra...

925
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:46,362
in a movie
with positive moral values.

926
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,532
But first, let's not forget...

927
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:55,837
we would not be here tonight
if it wasn't for VD.

928
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:58,571
VD rules!

929
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:03,378
A pus-filled,
b- b-blistering,

930
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,611
sinful malady...

931
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:07,984
that a few of you may already
have come in contact with.

932
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,890
You must resist, children.

933
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:15,418
Resist the urge
that lingers in your loins.

934
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:17,794
But as the saying goes-

935
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:19,799
"Girls have a button
and boys have a pole,

936
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:21,835
and wicked touching
takes its toll. "

937
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:24,496
So you must be strong and resist.

938
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:27,369
For those who are weak
will no doubt one day...

939
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:30,205
burn and fester in the swollen...

940
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:33,906
VD-infested, fiery pits of hell!

941
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:37,075
But let's have some fun
and meet our judges. Over here-

942
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:39,847
Hey, are you guys ready?

943
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,320
- Mare, we're, like, really nervous.
- Yeah.

944
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:45,358
What if they make fun of us?

945
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:49,522
Okay. I just wanna say
one thing to all of you.

946
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:51,791
Don't listen to the names
that people call you.

947
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:55,130
If you believe in yourself,
then nobody can hurt you.

948
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:58,638
- You are your own rainbow.
- Wow.

949
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:00,639
That's really insightful.

950
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:04,108
That's from The Initiation of Sarah
starring Miss Shelley Winters.

951
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,772
- Yeah?
- Cool.

952
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,441
Okay, from
Catholic Teen magazine,

953
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:13,714
we have teen gossip columnists
George and Moira McDaniels.

954
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:16,915
Welcome and thanks for joining us.

955
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:21,393
Well, it's show time
here at St. Monica's.

956
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:24,795
So let's get things started
with our first contestant,

957
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:28,665
Howard Feinstein!

958
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:32,034
Ladies and gentlemen!

959
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:36,838
Tonight, I'm going
for the full monty.

960
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:41,506
"Lookin' for some hot stuff
baby, this evenin"

961
01:04:41,582 --> 01:04:44,745
"I need some hot stuff
baby, tonight"

962
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:47,514
- "I want some hot stuff"
- Enough! Come on!

963
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:50,421
"Baby, this evening"

964
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:57,292
Perhaps this would be an opportune
time to thank Howard's father.

965
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:01,133
Hi, Mary.

966
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:05,069
The school therapist says
I have to apologize, so I'm sorry.

967
01:05:05,138 --> 01:05:07,868
And, Helen, I'm sorry I made fun
of your very hairy lip.

968
01:05:07,941 --> 01:05:11,502
I was going through a really
difficult time, but it's fine now...

969
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:14,775
because Sky and I are together
again, dancing in the show.

970
01:05:14,848 --> 01:05:19,512
And, um, what I'm
really trying to say is...

971
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:24,623
good luck.

972
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:28,491
Mary, I'm, like,
really sorry...

973
01:05:28,562 --> 01:05:33,158
'cause I know how hard you worked
to impress Sky tonight.

974
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:35,258
It's okay.

975
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:37,929
Tonight is for me, not for Sky.

976
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:57,887
"Entering"?

977
01:06:09,836 --> 01:06:12,430
You're not gonna
miss theshow, are you?

978
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:18,610
- Roadside thing's freaking you out?
- Who are you?

979
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:21,773
Mary Katherine Gallagher's
subconscious idea of God.

980
01:06:21,848 --> 01:06:25,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

981
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,980
Now, just my take on this,

982
01:06:28,055 --> 01:06:30,387
but you might want
to reconsider this bike ride.

983
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:31,424
Why?

984
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:35,450
Because I'm working
in a mysterious way here.

985
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:36,621
Man!

986
01:06:36,697 --> 01:06:39,564
Notice how you tried to leave town,
but it didn't work out,

987
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,624
- but you just kept on trying?
- Right.

988
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:45,934
What say you take that positive
attitude and apply it to-

989
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:49,032
I don't know.
Maybe you could help me.

990
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:51,577
Any thoughts?

991
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,405
Mary!

992
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:58,645
You think... Mary likes me?

993
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:01,586
Why'd I make everyone so insecure?
Here's a clue:

994
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:03,589
The Lord God...

995
01:07:03,657 --> 01:07:06,023
is materializing on a highway...

996
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,459
to guide you to her.

997
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:13,227
Now, look, that's the real road
out of Besamee Heights.

998
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,791
The decision is up to you.

999
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,912
Thank you, Helen.
Quite a feat of strength.

1000
01:07:34,988 --> 01:07:38,082
Thanks.
The amazing Sean!

1001
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:40,092
My brother.

1002
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,824
Next up, uh, we have
Sky Corrigan and Evian Graham.

1003
01:07:49,302 --> 01:07:51,236
I just want everyone to know...

1004
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:53,829
that even though Evian and I
are dancing together,

1005
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,875
- we're still broken up.
- Yeah!

1006
01:07:55,942 --> 01:07:57,876
Repeat: broken up.

1007
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:01,675
Thank you.

1008
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:24,236
Huh!

1009
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,345
PepperMill!

1010
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:36,044
You know you want me back.

1011
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,482
We're dancing together,
but we've grown apart.

1012
01:08:38,552 --> 01:08:40,520
Five, six, seven, eight.

1013
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:46,692
Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.

1014
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,490
It has been two days
since my last confession.

1015
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:52,361
Mary Katherine, aren't you supposed
to be in the show tonight?

1016
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:56,732
- You're not supposed to say my name.
- Oh. Okay.

1017
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,397
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1018
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,441
I feel really bad because...

1019
01:09:01,508 --> 01:09:04,238
I've committed
a sin of selfishness.

1020
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:08,577
All my life I've asked God
to make me a star, every day.

1021
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:10,980
I'm always thinking of myself.

1022
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:13,884
And tonight, I just
want Him to know that...

1023
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:16,479
it's okay if He never
does that for me.

1024
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,649
It's all right.

1025
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:22,422
I'll never ask for anything again
if he does one thing for me tonight.

1026
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,293
And what is that, my child?

1027
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:28,630
Please just get me through tonight
safely for my grandmother.

1028
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:32,866
Watch over me so that
I can watch over her.

1029
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:37,376
Mary, it's time
to go on stage. Go.

1030
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:40,538
Use the gifts God gave you.

1031
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:06,389
Allright. Um-

1032
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:09,967
Our last contestant tonight,

1033
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:12,128
Mary Katherine Gallagher.

1034
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:31,748
Sometimes I wonder

1035
01:10:31,824 --> 01:10:35,988
Where I've been

1036
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:39,394
Who I am

1037
01:10:39,465 --> 01:10:42,696
Do I fit in

1038
01:10:42,768 --> 01:10:45,703
You suck!

1039
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:48,137
Make-believing

1040
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:51,438
Is hard alone

1041
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:55,071
Out here

1042
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:58,674
On my own

1043
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:05,219
We're always provin'

1044
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:09,556
Who we are

1045
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:12,028
"Always reachin '"

1046
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:16,761
For that rising star

1047
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:19,531
To guide me far

1048
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:23,769
And shine me home

1049
01:11:23,842 --> 01:11:26,538
" Out here"

1050
01:11:26,612 --> 01:11:32,050
" On my own"

1051
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:49,259
When I'm down
and feelin' blue

1052
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,792
"I close my eyes
so I can be with you"

1053
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:55,704
"Baby, be strong for me
Baby, belong to me"

1054
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:59,175
- Help me through
- Help her through

1055
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:02,236
Help me through

1056
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,719
Pop!

1057
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,549
Bam! Pow!

1058
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:24,767
- Mary, it's too fast.
- Just keep going.

1059
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,826
Mary!

1060
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:55,166
Get up, Mary!

1061
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:04,840
Get up!
You can do it!

1062
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:13,845
- We don't know what to do.
- It's okay.

1063
01:13:22,094 --> 01:13:25,188
- What do we do?
- Just follow me.

1064
01:13:27,065 --> 01:13:29,158
Follow Mary, you guys.

1065
01:14:37,803 --> 01:14:39,395
Yeah!

1066
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:43,599
Are you ready? Good.

1067
01:14:45,177 --> 01:14:48,613
Well, I'm pleased to announce
that the winner...

1068
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,275
of the Catholic Teen magazine's
free trip to Hollywood...

1069
01:14:52,351 --> 01:14:54,876
with a chance to appear
as an extra...

1070
01:14:54,953 --> 01:14:57,922
in a movie
with positive moral values...

1071
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:01,050
is Mary Katherine Gallagher.

1072
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,364
What?

1073
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:18,209
Evian. Hey.

1074
01:15:18,277 --> 01:15:20,211
I just wanted to say
that I think...

1075
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:23,180
you did a really good job
up there tonight.

1076
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:25,739
You showed a lot of energy
and enthusiasm, and I...

1077
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:27,944
really like
your choice of costume.

1078
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:32,150
But I just feel really bad for you,
'cause I guess...

1079
01:15:32,224 --> 01:15:34,158
you didn't know that you
were competing against a...

1080
01:15:34,226 --> 01:15:36,786
superstar!

1081
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,773
Hey, Mary.

1082
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:53,436
- Hey.
- You really do have some nice moves.

1083
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:56,310
Thanks.

1084
01:16:18,837 --> 01:16:21,704
So what did you think of that?

1085
01:16:22,774 --> 01:16:25,208
It was okay.

1086
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,844
It was bad. Blech!

1087
01:16:38,123 --> 01:16:40,990
So I let Sky go,

1088
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:44,825
and I figured it was time
to let my dream go too.

1089
01:16:44,896 --> 01:16:47,558
'Cause maybe that's all
it would ever be-

1090
01:16:47,632 --> 01:16:50,123
a dream.

1091
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:52,830
Or maybe not.

1092
01:16:52,904 --> 01:16:56,465
You said to jump in.

1093
01:16:57,776 --> 01:17:01,303
"And sometimes when we touch"

1094
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,872
- " The honesty's too much"
- I'm outta here.

1095
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,919
"And I have to close my eyes"

1096
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:10,511
- What are you? Gay?
- Five times more gay than you think.

1097
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:13,080
Four more to go, peaches.

1098
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:16,821
"I wanna hold ya till I die"

1099
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:20,854
" Till we both
breakdown and cry"

1100
01:17:20,932 --> 01:17:25,062
"I wanna hold ya
till the fear in me"

1101
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:27,537
"Subsides"

1102
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:30,309
And that's my story.

1103
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,143
That's my entire story.

1104
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,342
I wanted you to know
so you would understand...

1105
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:37,477
why I can't see you anymore.

1106
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,784
