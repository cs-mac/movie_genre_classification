1
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,680
My name's Marlowe.
The general wanted to see me.

2
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,980
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

3
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,890
- I'll tell the general that you're here.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,570
Good morning.

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,710
You're not very tall, are you?

6
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,710
Well, I tried to be.

7
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,120
Not bad-looking...

8
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,420
...though you probably know it.

9
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,850
Thank you.

10
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,290
What's your name?

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,290
Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

12
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,060
That's a funny kind of name.

13
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,430
You think so?

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
What are you? A prizefighter?

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,970
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's that?

16
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,140
A private detective.

17
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,070
You're making fun of me.

18
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,450
You're cute.

19
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,150
The general will see you now, sir.

20
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,700
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood.

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,960
You ought to wean her.
She's old enough.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,940
- This is Mr. Marlowe, general.
- How do you do, sir?

23
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,950
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

24
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,710
Brandy, Norris.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,650
- How do you like your brandy, sir?
- In a glass.

26
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,290
I used to like mine with champagne.

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,460
Champagne cold as Valley Forge...

28
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,100
...with about three ponies
of brandy under it.

29
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,930
Come, come, man!
Pour a decent one.

30
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,870
I like to see people drink.

31
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,660
That'll do, Norris.

32
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,330
You may take off your coat, sir.

33
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,980
Thank you.

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,940
Too hot in here for any man
who has any blood in his veins.

35
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,640
You may smoke too.

36
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,850
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

37
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,820
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

38
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,890
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,590
Little I can eat, and
my sleep is so near waking...

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,270
...it's hardly worth the name.

42
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,670
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

43
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,600
The orchids are an excuse
for the heat.

44
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,150
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

45
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,320
Nasty things.

46
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,980
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

47
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,210
Their perfume has the rotten
sweetness of corruption.

48
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,720
Tell me about yourself.

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,160
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

50
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,860
I can still speak English,
when my business demands it.

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,060
I worked for the
district attorney's office.

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,860
Bernie Ohls, the chief inspector,
said you wanted to see me.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,840
You didn't like working
for the district attorney?

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,280
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,250
I always did, myself.

56
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,850
What do you know about my family?

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,790
Well, you're a widower,
a millionaire.

58
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,860
You have two daughters.
One unmarried...

59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,090
...and one married to a man
named Rutledge, but it didn't take.

60
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,790
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,060
Both pretty and both pretty wild.

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,630
- Why'd you want to see me?
- I'm being blackmailed again.

63
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,110
Again?

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,440
About a year ago, I paid a man
named Joe Brody $5000...

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,740
...to let my younger daughter alone.

66
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,180
What does that mean?

67
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,020
It means, "Hm!"

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,310
It didn't go through the DA
or I'd have heard.

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,820
Who handled it for you?

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,890
Shawn Regan.

71
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,920
There must be some reason why
he isn't handling it this time.

72
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,760
Shawn has left me.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,400
- I thought I hadn't seen him lately.
- A month ago, without a word.

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,100
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

75
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,500
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more.

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,440
And that at least
he'd have said good bye.

77
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,600
That's what hurt.

78
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,520
You knew him too?

79
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,740
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico...

80
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,980
...and I was on the other side.

81
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,850
We used to swap shots
between drinks...

82
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,920
...or drinks between shots.

83
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,360
My respects to you, sir.

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,060
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,730
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

86
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,770
But you knew that.

87
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,800
No, I didn't.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,410
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

89
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,710
No one was more pleased than I
when you took him on as your...

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,910
...whatever he was.

91
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,010
My friend.

92
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,280
My son, almost.

93
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Many an hour he sat with me,
sweating like a pig...

94
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,790
...drinking brandy and telling
stories of the Irish Revolution.

95
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,890
Well, enough of that.

96
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,290
Here.

97
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,070
Read the other side.

98
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,990
These her signatures?

99
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,930
- Who's Arthur Geiger?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

100
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,260
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

101
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,910
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

102
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,040
I met her in the hall
and she did that to me.

103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,280
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

104
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,740
Well?

105
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,920
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

106
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,380
They alike?

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,320
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

108
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,090
Vivian is spoiled, exacting...

109
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,990
...smart and ruthless.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,430
Carmen is still a little child who
likes to pull the wings off flies.

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,160
I assume they have
all the usual vices...

112
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,070
...besides those they've
invented for themselves.

113
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,240
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe...

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,940
...it's because my hold
on life is too slight...

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,170
...to include any
Victorian hypocrisy.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,350
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have...

117
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,110
...and who indulges, for the first
time, in parenthood at my age...

118
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
...deserves all he gets.

119
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,390
Well?

120
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,160
Pay him.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,470
Why?

122
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,070
She signed these notes, didn't she?

123
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,570
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $5000 to?

124
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,650
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

125
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,940
I think he called himself a gambler.

126
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,250
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

127
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,680
They may be.

128
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,410
Think they are?

129
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,100
You want me to take this Geiger
off your back. Is that right?

130
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,890
Want to know anything?

131
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,660
I just want to get rid of him.

132
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,660
Might cost you a little.

133
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
Thanks for the drink.

134
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,670
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

135
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,900
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

136
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,520
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave.

137
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,090
About the money, the general
has instructed me...

138
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,730
...to give you a check
for whatever you require.

139
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,460
Instructed you how?

140
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,760
I see, sir. I forget
that you're a detective.

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,240
By the way he rang his bell, sir.

142
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,500
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

143
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,010
Good for you.
I don't need any money now...

144
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,940
...but when I do, I get
$ 25 a day and expenses.

145
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,380
- How did she know I was here?
- She saw you through the window.

146
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,210
I was obliged to tell her
who you were.

147
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,720
I don't know as I like that.

148
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,450
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

149
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,890
Just having fun trying
to guess what they are.

150
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,620
This way, sir.

151
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,100
- Go right in. Say you're expected.
- Thanks.

152
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,040
You wanted to see me?

153
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,450
So you're a private detective?

154
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,780
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

155
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,180
Or else they were greasy men
snooping around hotel corridors.

156
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,790
You're a mess, aren't you?

157
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,290
I'm not very tall either.

158
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,930
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

159
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,730
I doubt if even that would help.

160
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,130
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

161
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,600
It shouldn't be too tough.

162
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,970
I'd have thought
it took a little effort.

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,430
Not too much.

164
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,840
What will your first step be?

165
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,170
- The usual one.
- There's a usual one?

166
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,370
Sure there is.
It comes with diagrams...

167
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,110
...on page 47 of How to be a
Detective in Ten Easy Lessons...

168
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
...and your father
offered me a drink.

169
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,650
You must've read one
on being a comedian.

170
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,790
- Hear what I said about the drink?
- I'm serious. My father's...

171
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,430
- I said your father...
- Help yourself!

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,130
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well.

173
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,030
I want this case handled with
the least worry to him.

174
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,370
That's the way
I was going to handle it.

175
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,300
I see. No professional secrets?

176
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,770
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

177
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,380
Then what...

178
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,820
How'd you like Dad?

179
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,120
I liked him.

180
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,020
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

181
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,690
I suppose you know who he is.

182
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,490
You don't have to play poker with me.

183
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,760
- Doesn't Dad want to find him?
- Do you?

184
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,000
Of course. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much.

186
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,100
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

187
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,900
I don't see what there is
to be cagey about.

188
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,340
I don't like your manners!

189
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,240
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

190
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,040
I don't mind if you don't
like my manners. I don't either.

191
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,720
I grieve over them evenings.

192
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,350
I don't mind your drinking
your lunch out of a bottle.

193
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,880
But don't waste your time
cross-examining me.

194
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,350
People don't talk to me like that!

195
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,130
Do you always think
you can handle people...

196
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,130
...like trained seals?

197
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,090
I usually get away with it too.

198
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,290
How nice for you!

199
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,740
Just what is it you're afraid of?

200
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,940
Dad didn't see you
about Shawn, did he?

201
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,270
Didn't he?

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,380
Could you find him
if Dad wanted you to?

203
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,050
Maybe. When did he go?

204
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,550
About a month back.

205
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,120
Drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

206
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,980
They found his car parked
in some private garage.

207
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,350
They? Who's they?

208
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,820
Dad didn't tell you.

209
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,930
He told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

210
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,120
That's what you wanted me to say.

211
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,570
I'm sure I don't care
what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

212
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm wasting your time.

213
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,340
Goodbye, Mrs. Rutledge.

214
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,980
Oh, Norris.

215
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,150
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge
didn't want to see me.

216
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm sorry, sir.
I make many mistakes.

217
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,650
- Did you find what you wanted?
- Yes, thanks.

218
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,950
You don't look like a man who'd
be interested in first editions.

219
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,090
I collect blondes in bottles too.

220
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,210
Can I be of any assistance?

221
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,850
Would you happen
to have a Ben Hur, 1860?

222
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,080
- A what?
- Do you have a Ben Hur, 1860?

223
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,410
A first edition?

224
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,820
No, no, the third, the third!

225
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,320
The one with the erratum on page 116.

226
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,820
I'm afraid not.

227
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,430
How about a Chevalier Audubon,
1840, full set?

228
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,490
Not at the moment.

229
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,200
You do sell books?

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,830
What do those look like? Grapefruit?

231
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,730
Well, they look like books.
Maybe I'd better see Mr. Geiger.

232
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,430
- He's not in just now.
- That's a pity because...

233
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,510
I said, Mr. Geiger is not in!

234
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,690
I heard you.
You needn't yell at me.

235
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,660
I'm late for my lecture on
Argentine ceramics, so I won't wait.

236
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,260
The word is "ceramics."

237
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,790
And they ain't Argentine,
they're Egyptian!

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,430
You did sell a book once, didn't you?

239
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,190
I'll run along to the library.

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Or I could go to that bookstore
across the street, couldn't I?

241
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,530
Do so.

242
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,900
Thank you.

243
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,790
Is there something I can do for you?

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,160
- Would you do me a small favor?
- It depends on the favor.

245
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,870
- You know Geiger's bookstore?
- I think I may have passed it.

246
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,840
You know Geiger by sight?

247
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,000
What's he look like?

248
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,650
Wouldn't it be easier to go
and ask to see him?

249
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,680
I've already done that.

250
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,180
I know anything about rare books?

251
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,480
You could try me.

252
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,780
Do you have a Ben Hur,
1860, third edition...

253
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,750
...with a duplicated line
on page 116?

254
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,300
Or a Chevalier Audubon, 1840?

255
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,610
Nobody would. There isn't one.

256
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,510
The girl in Geiger's bookstore
didn't know that.

257
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,280
I see.

258
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,480
You begin to interest me vaguely.

259
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,950
I'm a private dick on a case.

260
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,150
Perhaps I'm asking too much...

261
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,490
...although it doesn't seem
too much to me.

262
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,630
Geiger's in his early forties...

263
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,590
...medium height...

264
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,070
...fattish...

265
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,570
...soft all over,
Charlie Chan mustache...

266
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,010
...well-dressed...

267
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,150
...wears a black hat...

268
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,650
...affects a knowledge
of antiques and hasn't any...

269
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,950
...and I think his left eye is glass.

270
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
You'd make a good cop.

271
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,780
Thanks.

272
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,760
Going to wait for him to come out?

273
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,260
They don't close
for another hour or so.

274
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,590
And it's raining pretty hard.

275
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
I got my car and...

276
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,130
That's right, it is, isn't it?

277
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,470
It just happens I got a bottle
of pretty good rye in my pocket.

278
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,210
I'd a lot rather get wet in here.

279
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,720
Well!

280
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,860
Looks like we're closed
for the rest of the afternoon.

281
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,030
Tell me more about this business.

282
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,370
There isn't much to tell.

283
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,210
What's the matter?

284
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,070
I'm just wondering if you have to...

285
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,280
Not necessarily.

286
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,960
Little things like that make an...

287
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,330
Hello!

288
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,040
I hate to tell you, but that's
Geiger's car driving up.

289
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,110
Who's the man getting out?

290
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,840
Geiger's shadow.
His name's Carol Lundgren.

291
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,920
Thanks.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,090
- If you ever want to buy a book...
- A Ben Hur, 1860?

293
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,550
With duplications.

294
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,990
So long.

295
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,960
So long, pal.

296
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,860
You're cute.

297
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,620
And you're higher than a kite.
Come on, wake up.

298
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,130
I know you. Doghouse Reilly.

299
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,740
You're cute.

300
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,430
What do you know about this?

301
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,470
Mr. Geiger, here on the floor.

302
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,140
He's cute too.

303
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,880
You got a dead man at your feet.
How did it happen?

304
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,310
You talk a lot, Reilly.

305
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,140
Come on!

306
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,850
Lie down there and be quiet.

307
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,900
All right, Reilly.

308
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,070
Come on, we're going.

309
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,150
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Norris.

310
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,720
- I'd like to see General Sternwood.
- He's asleep.

311
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,160
What about Mrs. Rutledge?
Is she...?

312
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,220
Good evening, Mrs. Rutledge.

313
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,730
I've got your sister outside.
She's all right.

314
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,770
But she's not walking very well.
I'll need some help.

315
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,620
Are you sure...?

316
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,160
Yes, she'll be all right
in the morning.

317
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,260
Did you do this?

318
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,440
That? Oh, yes, that's
a little special service...

319
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,970
...I always provide all my clients.

320
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,230
Including being insolent.
Where did you find her?

321
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,970
- I didn't find her.
- Then how...?

322
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,170
I haven't been here, and
she hasn't been out all evening.

323
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,340
That bad?

324
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,540
Just what did happen?

325
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,980
- You're fond of your sister.
- Yes, I am.

326
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,350
- Do anything for her, wouldn't you?
- Anything.

327
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,850
Then drop this.

328
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,550
I still think I should know...

329
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
Don't even ask her.

330
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,360
She never remembers, anyway.

331
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,690
Just what did she forget
about Shawn Regan?

332
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,060
What'd she tell you?

333
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,400
Not half as much as you did.

334
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,570
Take it easy.

335
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,650
I don't slap so good around
this time of the evening.

336
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,390
You go too far, Marlowe.

337
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
Harsh words to throw at a man...

338
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,280
...when he's walking out
of your bedroom.

339
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,960
Good night, Mrs. Rutledge.

340
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,100
Thanks, Norris.

341
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,700
I've put her car away.

342
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,630
If anybody asks,
she's been in all evening.

343
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,200
- Forget about my being here.
- I understand.

344
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,600
May I call a cab?

345
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,470
It'd be better if you didn't.

346
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,940
Good night.

347
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,790
- Hello, Bernie. Come in.
- Hello, Phil.

348
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,130
Don't you go to bed?

349
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,670
What you been doing?

350
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,000
Just sitting around.

351
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,260
All evening?

352
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,810
What is it?

353
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,600
Does it have to be something?

354
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,300
You're a friend, but when
a man from Homicide...

355
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,670
...just drops in at 2 A.M.,
I kind of...

356
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,410
Working on cipher, huh?

357
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
Just fooling around.

358
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,620
You're working for
the Sternwoods, aren't you?

359
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,790
Thanks to you.

360
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,420
Done anything for them yet?

361
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
I started today.
Then the rain came.

362
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,960
All right. They seem to be
a family that things happen to.

363
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,260
There's a Packard
belonging to them...

364
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,160
...washing around in the surf
off Lido Pier.

365
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,070
And there's a guy in it.

366
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,800
- Could it be Regan?
- Who?

367
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,500
Shawn Regan.

368
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,410
That Irish ex-legger
old Sternwood hired...

369
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,550
...to do his drinking for him?

370
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,980
What would he be doing down there?

371
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,740
What would anybody
be doing down there?

372
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,120
That's what I'm going to Lido
to find out. Want to come?

373
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,720
Yeah, I do.

374
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,620
- How's the weather?
- Clearing up.

375
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,250
- What time did that call come in?
- About 15 minutes ago.

376
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,460
- What kind of car you say it was?
- Packard.

377
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,580
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hi, Ed.

378
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,150
You got him out.
Who is he?

379
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,980
Owen Taylor. Sternwood's chauffeur,
according to his license.

380
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,350
- What's the story?
- You can see it from here.

381
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,620
There's where he went
through the railing.

382
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,860
The rain stopped here about 9 P.M.

383
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,900
The broken rails are dry inside.
That would put it about 9:30.

384
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
Let's have it, doc.

385
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,610
His neck's broken and something
hit him across the temple.

386
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,780
What made the bruise?
Steering wheel?

387
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,610
Whatever it was, it was covered.

388
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,720
The wound had bled under
the skin while he was alive.

389
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,620
- Blackjack?
- Could be.

390
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,090
Bernie, funny thing.

391
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,590
The hand throttle is set
halfway down.

392
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,920
Thanks, Jim. So long, doc.

393
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,070
All right, boys. Take him away.

394
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,830
- Could be drunk or a suicide.
- Yeah, but it isn't.

395
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,070
You know anything about Owen Taylor?

396
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,270
Only that a few
Sternwood chauffeurs...

397
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,310
...lost their jobs on account
of the younger daughter, Carmen.

398
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,780
Tell me what
you're working on, Phil.

399
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,640
They told me blackmail.

400
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,680
Who were they after? Carmen?

401
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,090
This doesn't look like
the way you'd handle it.

402
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,230
You know, I got a feeling that...

403
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,090
Me? I didn't do this.

404
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,860
What were you going to say, Phil?

405
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,160
Give me another day, Bernie.
I may have something for you.

406
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,130
Okay. Let's go home.

407
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,440
Good morning.

408
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,540
You do get up.
I was thinking...

409
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,780
...you worked in bed,
like Marcel Proust.

410
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,450
- Who's he?
- A French writer.

411
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,260
Come into my boudoir.

412
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,130
You don't put on a front.

413
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,240
Not much money in this work
if you're honest.

414
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,530
Are you honest?

415
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,070
- We're going to start that again?
- I'm sorry. Also, about yesterday.

416
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,010
- Perhaps I was rude.
- We were both rude.

417
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,070
You want to see me about Taylor?

418
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,910
So you know about that?

419
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,450
Poor Owen.

420
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,150
The DA's man took me down to Lido.
He knew more about it than I did.

421
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,980
He knew Owen Taylor wanted
to marry your sister.

422
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,520
Perhaps it wouldn't
have been a bad idea.

423
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,720
You see, he was in love with her.

424
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,300
But I didn't come here about Owen.

425
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,160
You still can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

426
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,800
Not without his permission.

427
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,470
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

428
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,310
You better look at this.
A messenger brought it today.

429
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,070
"Eight thirty-five."

430
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,810
That's right.

431
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
She takes a nice picture.

432
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,050
They want 5000 for
the negative and prints.

433
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,480
The demand came how?

434
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,720
A woman telephoned me after
it was delivered.

435
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,260
- What else?
- There has to be something else?

436
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,620
This thing isn't
worth $5000 to anybody.

437
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,630
- They think it is.
- Why?

438
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,130
She said if they didn't
get the money today...

439
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,170
...I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

440
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,570
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

441
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,000
What kind of a jam?

442
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,800
I don't know.

443
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,170
You know where this picture
was taken?

444
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,250
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Or when?

445
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,350
- Talk to Carmen about it?
- She was asleep when I left.

446
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,010
Figure out a story?

447
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,310
- Norris fixed that.
- How?

448
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,390
She was in all evening.

449
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,530
Police checked when
they called about Owen.

450
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,160
Go ahead and scratch.

451
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,400
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

452
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,940
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

453
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,970
Why? You think...

454
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,040
That he knew about this picture?
I don't rule him out.

455
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,070
Outside of what the woman said...

456
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,540
...you don't know why
they want $5000 for it?

457
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,910
That's why I came to you.

458
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,750
There's five fingers on a glove.

459
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,580
Why didn't you go to the police?

460
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,280
You were afraid they'd find
something I couldn't sit on.

461
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,550
Then where would the Sternwoods be?

462
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,250
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

463
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,070
Police headquarters, please.

464
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,030
Hello, this is Mrs...

465
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,580
Hello. What do you want, please?

466
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,310
What?

467
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,850
I called you?

468
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,610
Say, who is this?

469
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,250
Sergeant Reilly?
There isn't any Sergeant Reilly here.

470
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,150
Wait a minute.
You'd better talk to my mother.

471
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,330
Hello. Who's this?

472
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,060
The police?
This isn't a police station.

473
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,560
If you know it, why did...

474
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,860
Look, this is not a police station!

475
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,430
What was that you said?

476
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,510
My father should hear this.

477
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,410
Hello. Who is this?

478
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,750
Yeah, but she just told you that...

479
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,710
You're the police!
He's the police.

480
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,550
Well, that's different.
What can I do for you?

481
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,720
I can do what?

482
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,950
Where?

483
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,460
Oh, no! I wouldn't like that,
and neither would my daughter.

484
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,530
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

485
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,530
You like to play games, don't you?

486
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,860
Why did you stop me phoning?

487
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,900
Because I'm working for your father.

488
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,240
Or because I think I'm beginning to
like another one of the Sternwoods.

489
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,810
I prefer the second reason.

490
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,680
Well, let's get back to business.
Have you got $5000 in cash?

491
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,710
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

492
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,680
- Where from, your father?
- I'd rather not.

493
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,250
Where would you get it?

494
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,480
Well, from Eddie Mars.

495
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,630
The gambler?

496
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,490
That explains why you
haven't got $5000 in cash.

497
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,290
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

498
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,090
How do you know he'll
give it to you?

499
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,560
I can get the money.

500
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,960
I've been a good customer
of Eddie Mars'.

501
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,470
Another reason:

502
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,270
There's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

503
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,240
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

504
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,440
That doesn't interest you?

505
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,950
It might make it easier
for me to find him.

506
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,610
If I were looking for him.

507
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,420
Is Regan mixed up in this?

508
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,530
No. Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

509
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,560
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

510
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,230
- Tell you what?
- What you're trying to find out.

511
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,230
You know, it's a funny thing.

512
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,670
You're trying to find out
why I was hired.

513
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,570
And I'm trying to find out why you...

514
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,870
You could go on forever,
couldn't you?

515
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,570
It'll give us something
to talk about next time.

516
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,480
Among other things.
Oh, Mrs. Rutledge.

517
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,680
You wanted me to do something
about this, didn't you?

518
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,680
That call, how'd you leave it?

519
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,980
She's to call me at 6 p.m.
With instructions.

520
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,120
Phone me when you've heard from her.

521
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,790
As long as you're going
to pay $5000 for these...

522
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,290
...you'd better take this.

523
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,390
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

524
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,460
Well, it wasn't intentional.

525
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,600
Try it sometime.

526
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,010
- I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

527
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,250
Do you remember me now?

528
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,820
Now, see here!

529
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,490
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

530
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,590
I got something to sell.
Something Geiger wants. Is he in?

531
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,390
No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

532
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,890
Drop the veil.
I'm in the business myself.

533
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,360
Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

534
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,040
No, that wouldn't do.
If you'd come back tomorrow...

535
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,140
Say, Agnes, you...

536
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,600
Come on, Carol.

537
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,000
Hurry up, will you?

538
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,150
- Perhaps...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

539
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,980
- What do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

540
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,850
You'd better come tomorrow.

541
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,950
In the morning? Early?

542
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,920
Because it looks like
you're moving today.

543
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,670
All right, driver. Let's go!

544
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,140
Around the corner, then take it easy.

545
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,540
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

546
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,940
I'm your girl, bud.

547
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,710
It wouldn't be bad.

548
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,820
That station wagon coming out
of the alley. That's the one.

549
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,760
Here you are, sugar.
Buy yourself a cigar.

550
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,870
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

551
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,060
Day and night?

552
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,240
Night's better.
I work during the day.

553
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,580
- What are you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly.

554
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,180
The man that didn't grow very tall.

555
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,680
What's the matter,
couldn't you get in the house?

556
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,520
Come on. I've got a key.

557
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,720
- Where'd you leave your car?
- Around in back.

558
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,840
Looking for something?

559
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,380
How much do you remember
about last night?

560
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,980
Remember what?

561
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,810
I was sick last night, I was home.

562
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,450
Before you went home.
In that chair there.

563
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,880
You remember, all right.

564
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,520
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb!

565
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,790
- Were you the one who was here?
- How much do you remember?

566
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,930
Are you the police?

567
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,930
No, I'm a friend of your father's.

568
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,900
Who killed Geiger?

569
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,070
Who else knows about it?

570
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,000
What, that he's dead?
I don't know.

571
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,200
Not the cops, or they'd
be camping here.

572
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,740
Was it Joe Brody?

573
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,080
Joe Brody.

574
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,740
Who's he?

575
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,370
I don't know how much trouble
you're used to...

576
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,280
...but I hope you've had plenty
of practice dodging it.

577
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,710
Did Brody kill him?

578
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,350
I kill who?

579
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,320
Yes, Joe did it.

580
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,890
He did?

581
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,090
Why?

582
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
I don't know.

583
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,460
But you're ready to tell
the police he did it?

584
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,470
That is, if we can get
the photograph.

585
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,500
You mean...?

586
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,440
It's gone. I looked for it.
Brody took it with him.

587
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,610
I've got to go home now.

588
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,670
I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

589
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,150
I wouldn't say anything
about anything.

590
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,620
That you were ever here.
Not even to your sister.

591
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,720
Just leave it to Reilly.

592
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,790
Your name isn't Reilly...

593
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,310
Excuse the casual entrance.
The bell didn't answer.

594
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,300
Mr. Geiger around?

595
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,980
We don't know where he is.

596
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,410
We found the door open
and just stepped in.

597
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,720
- Friends of his?
- Business.

598
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,880
We dropped in for a book.

599
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,710
Any message if he comes back?

600
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,050
No, I don't think so.
We won't bother you.

601
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,660
Just a minute.

602
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,760
The girl can go.

603
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,930
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Suppose I don't want to talk to you?

604
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,830
I've got two boys out in the car.

605
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,070
It's like that, eh?

606
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,160
Run along, angel.

607
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,680
Your story sounds wrong.

608
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,780
That's too bad.
Got a better one?

609
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,680
Maybe I can find one.

610
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,590
Blood.
Quite a lot of blood.

611
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,390
Is that so?

612
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,430
Do you mind?

613
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,190
No, I'm used to it.

614
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,900
I think we'll let
the police in on this.

615
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,230
- We'll have some law...
- Yeah. Why not?

616
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,330
Who are you, soldier?

617
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,480
Marlowe.
I'm a private detective.

618
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,970
- Who's the girl?
- A client.

619
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,980
Geiger tried to throw a loop on her.
We came to talk.

620
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,480
Convenient, the door being open.

621
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,240
Wasn't it?
How'd you have a key?

622
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,150
- That your business?
- Could be.

623
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,550
I could make yours mine.

624
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,280
You wouldn't like it.
The pay's too small.

625
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,320
All right, I own this house.
Geiger's my tenant.

626
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,020
- Now what do you think of it?
- You know some nice people.

627
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,000
I take them as they come.

628
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,660
Got any good ideas?

629
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,100
One or two.
Somebody gunned Geiger.

630
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,330
Or somebody got gunned
by Geiger who ran away.

631
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,480
Or he had meat for dinner
and likes to butcher in the parlor.

632
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,010
No, I don't like it either.
Maybe you'd better call downtown.

633
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,440
I don't get it.
I don't get your game.

634
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,810
Don't you, Mr. Mars?

635
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,710
Wondered why you didn't
ask me who I was.

636
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,550
You're telling me Geiger was
in a racket of some kind.

637
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,590
What racket?

638
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,720
I wouldn't know.

639
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,020
But I'll tell you
something you missed.

640
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,490
Somebody cleaned out
Geiger's store today.

641
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,400
You talk too much.

642
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,730
You really got those boys outside?

643
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,760
Open the door.

644
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,570
Open it yourself.
I already got a client.

645
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,340
It's all right.
Just proving something.

646
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,240
While you're here, look him over.

647
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,680
- Pardon me.
- Who is he?

648
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,620
Philip Marlowe, Hobart Arms,
Franklin Street.

649
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,920
Special license,
deputy badge and all.

650
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,150
All right, outside.

651
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,230
A shamus.

652
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,520
The man said, outside.

653
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,100
He said that.
That's what the man said.

654
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,930
He kills me.

655
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:37,900
Is he any good?

656
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,840
Who? Sidney?
He's company for Pete.

657
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,100
All right, talk.

658
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,540
Not to you.
I already got a client.

659
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,610
Who cleaned out Geiger's store?

660
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,580
Lots of weather we're having.
Did it rain at Las Olindas?

661
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,650
I might make it worth your while.

662
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,220
I might make it worth yours.

663
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,860
What do you care
who cleaned out Geiger's store?

664
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,060
- I could make you talk.
- It's been tried.

665
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,520
And?

666
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,760
Why don't you call the cops?

667
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,200
I think you'd better
get out of here.

668
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,640
By the way,
how's Mrs. Mars these days?

669
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,030
You take chances, Marlowe.

670
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,410
I get paid to.

671
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,030
Mrs. Rutledge. I've been
waiting to hear from you.

672
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,860
I'm sorry.
I have nothing to tell you.

673
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,130
- She didn't call?
- No, she didn't.

674
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,070
Did you get the money,
in case she does?

675
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,610
I have the money. I'll get in touch
with you as soon as she calls.

676
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,620
All right, I'll stay
right here until you call.

677
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,030
Geiger?

678
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,330
You said what?

679
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,910
Arthur Geiger.
The guy with the blackmail racket.

680
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,310
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- You're Joe Brody?

681
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,570
- So what?
- So you're Joe Brody.

682
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,010
And you don't know Geiger.
That's very funny.

683
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,670
You've got a funny sense of humor.
Take it somewhere else.

684
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,120
Joe, you got Geiger's stuff.
I got his sucker list.

685
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,050
Don't you think we ought to talk?

686
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,520
Now!

687
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,160
All right. If you think
you got something.

688
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,330
You alone, Joe?

689
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,240
Except for this.

690
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,340
My, my, such a lot of guns
around town and so few brains.

691
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,510
You're the second guy
today that thinks...

692
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,510
...a gat in the hand
means the world by the tail.

693
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,410
Put it down, Joe.

694
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,180
The other guy was Eddie Mars.
You ever hear of him?

695
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,360
If he gets wise to where you were
last night, you'll hear of him.

696
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,220
What would I be to Eddie Mars?

697
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,220
I don't know if you don't.

698
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,620
Look, don't get me wrong.

699
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,230
I'm not a tough guy.

700
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,460
Just careful.

701
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,030
You're not careful enough.

702
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,930
That play with Geiger's stuff
was terrible.

703
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:31,370
Don't kid yourself I won't
use this if I have to.

704
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,640
What's your story?

705
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,040
Why don't you ask
your friend to come out?

706
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,110
She must get tired
of holding her breath.

707
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,940
Come on out, Agnes.

708
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,120
Hello, sugar.

709
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,150
I knew you were trouble.
I told Joe...

710
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,050
Ask Mrs. Rutledge to come out too.

711
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,680
What did you come for?

712
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,120
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I don't need you.

713
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,160
I keep out of it!

714
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,260
I don't want you here.
Will you get out?

715
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,760
But he won't let me.

716
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,900
He's curious, bothered
and wondering.

717
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,970
You bet I'm wondering
and I'll find out.

718
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,600
- Sit down.
- Stop waving that gun.

719
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,600
I didn't do anything.
Can't you talk without that?

720
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,370
Don't argue with the man.

721
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,880
- You're ruining things.
- I'm not. If you'd...

722
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,380
Say, look!

723
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,950
What are you up here for?

724
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,710
To keep her from paying you off,
and to take the cops off your neck.

725
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,080
What cops?

726
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,490
The cops that want to know
where the lead in Geiger came from.

727
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,860
Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

728
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,620
- I didn't know...
- The cops don't yet.

729
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,460
But he wasn't alone
when you shot him.

730
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,970
Either you didn't notice that
or you got scared and ran away.

731
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,140
But you had nerve enough
to take the film.

732
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,970
And you had nerve enough
to come back and hide the body.

733
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,570
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

734
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,010
So you could clean out the store...

735
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,580
...before the law knew
there was a murder.

736
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,140
You take chances. It's lucky
for you I didn't shoot Geiger.

737
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,810
But you can step off for it anyway.
You're made-to-order for the rap.

738
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,080
You think you've got me?

739
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,350
- Positive.
- How come?

740
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,820
I told you, there was a witness.
Now don't go simple on me.

741
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,430
You mean Carmen.
She'd say anything.

742
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,560
So you have got that picture.

743
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,200
I guess you think I'm dumb.

744
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,430
Just average, for a grafter.

745
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,000
You see, either you were
there last night...

746
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,870
...or you got the picture
from somebody who was.

747
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,570
You knew Carmen was there...

748
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,770
...because you had your girlfriend
threaten Mrs. Rutledge.

749
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,850
The only way you could have known
was by being there...

750
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,680
...and seeing what happened.
Or having the picture.

751
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:22,850
Make sense?

752
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,210
Who are you?

753
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,720
A guy who gets paid to do
people's laundry.

754
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,360
And all I'll get out
of it is that picture.

755
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,850
How about some dough?
I'm down to nickels.

756
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,290
Not from my client.
Get the picture, Joe.

757
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,230
Stay right there.

758
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,710
Here. Watch him.

759
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,850
- Take it easy.
- I want my picture.

760
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,530
- Now...
- I want my picture.

761
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,350
You shot Geiger.

762
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,490
Hold it!

763
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,870
Get up. You look like a Pekinese.
And since I'm collecting guns...

764
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,600
Sit down, sugar.
Now where were we?

765
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,400
Oh, yes, you were just about
to get something.

766
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,220
There better not be
any more prints.

767
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,790
There won't be.

768
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,460
Can I have my picture now?

769
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,890
Can I have my gun?

770
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,930
Later.

771
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,300
You're cute. I like you.

772
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:54,000
This is nothing. I got a Balinese
dancing girl tattooed on my chest.

773
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,080
You better take her home.

774
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,610
I suppose I should thank you.

775
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,290
No, just don't lie to me next time.

776
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,510
Come on, Carmen.

777
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,190
Hold it, Joe.

778
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,500
You got off easy, Joe.
What's the matter, sugar?

779
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,830
- He gives me a pain...
- Goes for me too.

780
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,200
You got your pictures.
Get out.

781
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,960
- Where's the pain?
- In my...

782
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,040
Get out!

783
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,670
Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

784
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,970
I told you to get out.

785
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,080
What difference does it make now?

786
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,370
Why'd you put the bee
on Mrs. Rutledge?

787
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,880
I tapped the old man six months ago.
I figured it might not work twice.

788
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,310
What made you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him?

789
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,920
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

790
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,290
I figured she might have a thing
or two she wouldn't want him to know.

791
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,890
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that too.

792
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,190
Say, Joe, how'd you get that picture?

793
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,560
You got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

794
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,030
I don't know anything about it.
Do I, Agnes?

795
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,600
- But you just gave it to me.
- A half-smart guy.

796
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,330
That's what I always draw.

797
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,270
Never once a man who's smart all the way
around the course. Never once.

798
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,600
Did I hurt you much?

799
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,340
You and every other man.

800
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,850
Where'd you get that picture?

801
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,580
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

802
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,750
- Got an alibi for last night?
- I was here with Agnes.

803
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,580
That's a great witness.

804
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,620
You can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

805
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,020
A couple of murders?

806
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,290
I mean two murders. Where were you
about 7:30 last night?

807
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,690
Where were you?

808
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,870
All right, I was watching
Geiger's place.

809
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,330
Why?

810
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,530
- To get something on him.
- Look at me while you're talking.

811
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,000
It was raining hard
and I was in my car.

812
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,010
There was a car out front and another
down the hill. I was in back.

813
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,940
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

814
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,210
There was a big Packard near
where I was, so I took a look.

815
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,610
It was registered to the Sternwoods.

816
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,520
Nothing happened, so I got tired
of waiting and I went home.

817
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
IKnow where that Packard is now?

818
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,900
It's in the sheriff's garage.

819
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,460
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier this morning.

820
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,260
There was a dead man in it.

821
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:00,270
It was pointed toward the end of
the pier and the throttle pulled out.

822
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,670
- You can't pin that on me.
- I can try.

823
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,430
Sit down, Joe.

824
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,740
The dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffeur.

825
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,750
He went up to Geiger's
because he was sweet on Carmen.

826
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,480
He didn't like the games
Geiger was playing.

827
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,660
He let himself in the back
with a jimmy and he had a gun.

828
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,550
The gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

829
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,200
Owen ran with the film.
You went after him and got it.

830
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,490
All right, you're right.
I heard the shots...

831
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,670
...and saw him run out and
enter the Packard and away.

832
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,100
I followed him.

833
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,500
He turned west on Sunset.

834
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,800
And beyond Beverly...

835
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,970
...he skidded off the road
and came to a stop.

836
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,510
So I came up and played copper.

837
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,120
He had a gun. He was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

838
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,150
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

839
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,190
That's the last I saw of him.

840
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,020
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly.

841
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,700
And you want me to believe
somebody came along...

842
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,700
...ran that car to the ocean,
pushed it off the pier...

843
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,530
...then hid Geiger's body?

844
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,830
- Well, I didn't...
- Somebody did.

845
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,200
You wanted time to take over.

846
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,200
You can't prove I did it.

847
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,380
I don't particularly want to.

848
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,410
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

849
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,540
Maybe you and I can make
a little deal.

850
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,680
Go ahead.

851
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,190
Maybe she's back.

852
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,730
If she is, she hasn't got her gun.

853
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,200
You got a match, bud?

854
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,710
What will it be, kid?
Me or the cops?

855
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,250
What do you want?

856
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,220
Sit in that car,
back of the wheel. You drive.

857
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,060
As soon as this police car goes by,
we're going to Geiger's house.

858
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,770
By the way, Carol,
you shot the wrong guy.

859
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,960
Brody didn't kill Geiger.

860
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,600
All right, let's go.

861
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:51,070
- You got a key. Let's go in.
- Who said I got a key?

862
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,500
All right, come on!

863
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,600
Maybe you need this.

864
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,840
- Hello.
- Hello, Bernie?

865
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,770
Is this who I think it is?

866
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,380
It's Marlowe.
How are you fixed for red points?

867
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,020
I haven't got any.

868
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,380
Who has?

869
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,960
I got some cold meat set out,
might interest you.

870
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,220
What are you talking about?

871
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,980
You boys find a gun on Owen Taylor...

872
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,060
...when they fished him out of
the drink last night?

873
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,960
That's police business.

874
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,230
I know it's police business.

875
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,300
But if they did,
it had three empty shells in it.

876
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,970
You come up to
7244 Laverne Terrace...

877
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,340
...off Laurel Canyon Road, and
I'll show you where the slugs went.

878
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,140
- I'll be right out.
- I'll be waiting for you.

879
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,810
What did you hide Geiger's body for?

880
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,920
Do you admit shooting Brody?

881
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,950
Take a jump, Jack.

882
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,590
He doesn't have to admit it.
Here's his gun.

883
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,880
I'm late. I'm sorry.

884
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,310
How are you today?

885
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,640
Better than last night.

886
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,150
I can agree on that.

887
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,620
- Hello, Max.
- Good afternoon.

888
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,880
- Got a table for us?
- Certainly, madam. This way, please.

889
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,690
I'll have a scotch, mixed.

890
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,500
A scotch and plain water.

891
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,370
How'd you happen to
pick out this place?

892
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,400
Maybe I wanted to hold your hand.

893
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,630
That can be arranged.

894
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,900
Why'd you want to see me?

895
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:53,310
My father was very pleased when
he saw the morning papers. So was I.

896
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,320
We were lucky. I managed to keep
the Sternwoods out of it.

897
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,350
He hopes you didn't
involve yourself too deeply.

898
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,120
You tell him it was
no fault of yours?

899
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,690
No. He asked me to give you a check.

900
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,160
I don't need any money yet.

901
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,530
He considers the case closed.

902
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,600
It is, isn't it?

903
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,030
As far as Geiger is concerned, yes.

904
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,930
Then it's completely closed.

905
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,510
I hope this is satisfactory.

906
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,770
Five hundred!

907
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,970
It's a lot more than I expected,
but welcome just the same.

908
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,080
We're very grateful to you,
Mr. Marlowe, and...

909
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,620
...I'm very glad it's all over.

910
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,990
Tell me, what do you do
when you're not working?

911
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,490
Play the horses, fool around.

912
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,220
No women?

913
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:43,190
I'm generally working on
something, most of the time.

914
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,990
Could that be stretched to include me?

915
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,030
I like you.
I told you that before.

916
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,930
I liked hearing you say it.

917
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,730
But you didn't do much about it.

918
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,570
Neither did you.

919
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,810
Speaking of horses, I like to
play them myself.

920
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,340
But I like to see them work out
a little first.

921
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,610
See if they're front-runners
or come from behind.

922
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,310
Find out what their whole card is.

923
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,860
What makes them run.

924
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,050
Find out mine?

925
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,520
I think so.

926
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,920
Go ahead.

927
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,400
I'd say you don't like to be rated.

928
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,530
You like to get out in front...

929
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,000
...open up a lead...

930
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,900
...take a little breather in
the backstretch...

931
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,800
...and then come home free.

932
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,570
You don't like to be rated yourself.

933
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,500
I haven't met anyone yet
that could do it.

934
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,610
Any suggestions?

935
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,840
I can't tell till I've seen you
over a distance of ground.

936
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,280
You got a touch of class,
but I don't know how far you can go.

937
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,620
A lot depends on who's in the saddle.

938
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,020
Go ahead, Marlowe,
I like the way you work.

939
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,960
In case you don't know it,
you're doing all right.

940
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,670
There's one thing I can't figure out.

941
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,200
What makes me run?

942
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,140
I'll give you a little hint.
Sugar won't work. It's been tried.

943
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,470
What did you try it on me for?

944
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,600
Who told you to sugar me off this case?

945
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,670
Was it Eddie Mars?

946
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,240
All right, don't answer me.

947
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,850
But your father didn't tell you
to pay me off, did he?

948
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,850
No. He's not well.
I used my own judgment.

949
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,080
Are you sure?

950
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,660
I know it hasn't worked so
well up till now.

951
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,890
What's Eddie Mars got to do
with this case?

952
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,690
Nothing. He runs a gambling house.
I play horses. I play the wheel.

953
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,500
You're playing something else too.
Never mind talking. Let me do it.

954
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,830
Did you know Shawn Regan was
supposed to run off with Mars' wife?

955
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,510
Who doesn't?

956
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:37,110
Did you know he owned the house
and was mixed up in that racket too?

957
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,940
- I don't believe...
- Then why does it bother you so much?

958
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,140
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

959
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,960
Come now, angel. Stop shaking.

960
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,630
I don't want to hurt you,
I'm trying to help you.

961
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,230
You better run along.

962
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:57,260
But you made a deal and you're going to
stick to it, right or wrong.

963
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,790
We'll take up the question of
you and I when the race is over.

964
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,490
- The only trouble is, we could've...
- Pardon me?

965
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,730
The only trouble is, we could
have had a lot of fun...

966
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,930
...if you weren't a detective.

967
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,580
We still can.

968
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,640
So long, Marlowe.

969
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,610
- Waiter?
- Sir?

970
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,220
- Have you got a phone?
- Over there.

971
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,600
Deposit 55 cents, sir.

972
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,500
- How much is that?
- 55 cents.

973
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,710
Here's your party, sir.

974
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,910
Hello? Hello!

975
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,080
May I speak with Mr. Mars,
please?

976
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,410
This is Mars.

977
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,310
I didn't recognize your voice.
This is Marlowe.

978
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,680
I want to see you.

979
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,380
Sure. When?

980
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:56,720
I'd like to drive up this evening.

981
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,790
Come ahead.

982
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,040
Mr. Mars around? I'm Marlowe.
He's expecting me.

983
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,720
Wait here and I'll find out.

984
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,820
He would spend it on the ponies

985
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,790
He would spend it on the girls

986
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,260
Buy his mother lovely roses

987
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:41,070
For her dear old hennaed curls

988
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,500
But when his wife said "Sweetie...

989
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,610
... what did you get for me?"

990
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,150
He socked her in the choppers

991
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,380
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

992
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,190
And her tears flowed like wine

993
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,600
She's a real sad tomato

994
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,100
She's a busted valentine

995
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:18,440
Knows her mama done told her

996
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,110
That a man is darned unkind

997
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,740
I'm a telling you, mister

998
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,310
She was a sob, sob sister

999
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,680
Lying on a pillow

1000
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:33,950
Weeping like a willow

1001
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:37,320
My, oh my,
how that baby could cry

1002
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,360
And her tears flowed like wine

1003
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,870
Yes, her tears flowed like wine

1004
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,770
Hello, boys.

1005
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,500
Stop it!
He's waiting to see you.

1006
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,640
Thanks.

1007
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,150
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Marlowe. Glad you came.

1008
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,480
You never been here before?

1009
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,420
My first time.
I wouldn't be here now...

1010
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,150
...if you hadn't told me I could
come up here if I needed help.

1011
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,060
Drink?

1012
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:20,230
I like the way you've
handled this whole thing.

1013
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,600
It made me sore at first, but I see now
you knew what you were doing.

1014
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,700
You and I could get along.

1015
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,640
I like to pay my bills as I go.

1016
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,510
- How much do I owe you?
- For what?

1017
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,940
Still careful, huh?

1018
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,510
All right, then.
I want some information...

1019
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,550
...about Shawn Regan.

1020
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,780
You got that already from
the Bureau of Missing Persons.

1021
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,190
- You get around.
- My boys do.

1022
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,260
- Where is he?
- I haven't any idea.

1023
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,260
You didn't bump him off, did you?

1024
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,160
No. You think I did?

1025
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,390
- That's what I came here to ask you.
- You're kidding?

1026
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,430
All right, I'm kidding.

1027
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,510
You didn't do it and your boys
aren't good enough to.

1028
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,970
I used to know Regan.

1029
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,010
I thought you told me you weren't
looking for Regan.

1030
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,620
I wasn't then.
Maybe I just got curious.

1031
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,810
I finally got it through my skull
that the general was worried...

1032
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,390
...Regan might be mixed up
in this blackmail business.

1033
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,020
Sternwood can turn over now
and go back to sleep.

1034
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:20,790
It was Geiger's own racket.
I did some inquiring myself today.

1035
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,190
When Geiger and Brody got gunned,
that washed the whole thing up.

1036
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,960
- That, I'm sure of.
- It's finished then.

1037
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,270
The general thinks like you do.
He paid me off today.

1038
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,970
I'm sorry to hear that.

1039
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,150
I wish he'd hire you to keep
that daughter of his home.

1040
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,010
- She's out there now.
- I know, I heard her.

1041
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,680
She's not very popular here.

1042
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,880
When she loses, she doubles and
I wind up with a fistful of paper.

1043
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:47,020
- Lf she wins, she takes my money home.
- Don't you get it back next time?

1044
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,320
- She spends it somewhere else.
- Oh, she goes on the cuff.

1045
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,390
I'd keep her out of here then.

1046
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,560
- I took the trip for nothing.
- Sorry I can't help you.

1047
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,530
You mind if I look the place over
before I go back?

1048
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,970
Go ahead. Take that door,
it comes out behind the tables.

1049
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,430
No, thanks. I'll go out
with the other suckers.

1050
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,330
Maybe someday I can do you
a real favor.

1051
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,370
Maybe.

1052
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,570
There's one thing that puzzles me.

1053
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,470
You don't seem in a hurry
to find that wife of yours.

1054
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:15,040
I hear she's not the kind of wife
a guy wants to lose.

1055
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,690
Could it be you know where she is,
and maybe Regan too?

1056
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,220
Stop being curious. What's between
me and my wife is between us.

1057
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,220
Sorry.

1058
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,330
Oh, Eddie, you don't have
anybody watching me, do you?

1059
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,500
Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe?

1060
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,530
No. Why should I?

1061
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,430
I can't imagine, unless you're
worried about where I am all the time.

1062
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,440
I don't like you that well.

1063
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,140
So long, Eddie.

1064
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,710
- Mr. Marlowe?
- Mr. Marlowe?

1065
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,680
- Mrs. Rut...
- Mrs. Rut...

1066
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,890
You better take it.

1067
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,680
Mrs. Rutledge asked if you'd
look her up before you went.

1068
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,360
She's at the center table.

1069
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,220
Thank you both.

1070
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,760
Mr. Marlowe? Mrs. Rutle...

1071
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,760
Mrs. Rutledge wants to see me.

1072
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,800
- How did you know?
- He told me.

1073
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,940
She sure is picking them tonight.
She won eight bets in a row.

1074
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,040
- I didn't hear him tell you anything.
- He didn't.

1075
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,710
What kind of game is this?
Spin the wheel.

1076
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,810
I want another play.

1077
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,990
I'm sorry. You have
more than $ 14,000 there...

1078
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:29,680
...and the table cannot cover your bet!

1079
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,450
It's your money.
Don't you want it back?

1080
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,720
I sent for Mr. Mars.

1081
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,360
- Look, lady, you know...
- Do you want to cover it?

1082
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,230
- Hello, Marlowe.
- Hello.

1083
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,870
The lady.

1084
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,300
Something the matter,
Mrs. Rutledge?

1085
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,560
I'd like one more play.

1086
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,870
All this on the red.

1087
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,000
Cover her bet in even thousands.

1088
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,480
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone.

1089
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,340
Wish me luck, Marlowe.

1090
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,110
You wanted to see me.

1091
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,910
The people I came with want to stay...

1092
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,950
...so I thought maybe you'd
like to drive me home.

1093
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,120
- Sure.
- Are you ready, lady?

1094
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,620
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- So am I.

1095
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,070
Number five, red!

1096
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,850
You did all right.

1097
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,570
I'll get my car while you collect...

1098
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,080
...and meet you outside.

1099
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,490
Good night.

1100
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,910
This is a gun, lady.
I want that money.

1101
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,270
Yell, and I'll cut you in half!

1102
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,780
Give me that bag!

1103
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,710
Hello, pal! Easy!

1104
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,960
Somebody's always giving me guns.

1105
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,550
You can turn around now.

1106
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,300
I don't like people who play games.
Tell your boss...

1107
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,570
...when you wake up.

1108
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,200
I'm glad I asked you to take me home.

1109
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,880
So am I.

1110
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,600
Shall we go now?

1111
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,660
Why are you trembling? Don't tell me
you were scared. I won't believe it.

1112
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,120
I'm not used to being hijacked.
Give me a little time.

1113
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:51,620
Hijacked? Is that what it was?

1114
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,190
What else?

1115
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,840
You're still shaking.
What's the matter?

1116
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,770
You weren't worried about me?
Afraid I'd get hurt?

1117
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,850
When did you begin to
feel that way about me?

1118
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,710
Why are we stopping?

1119
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,750
To settle something.

1120
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,050
All right...

1121
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,990
...let's begin with what
Eddie Mars has on you.

1122
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,390
If he had anything, would it be
any of your business?

1123
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,960
You've already been paid, haven't you?

1124
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,130
Yeah, by you.

1125
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,700
- Are you after more money?
- I guess you've got a right to ask.

1126
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,970
No, I've already been well-paid.
I've got another reason.

1127
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,630
You like my father, don't you?

1128
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,010
Why don't you stop?

1129
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,780
Remember I said I was beginning
to like another Sternwood?

1130
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,110
- I wish you'd show it.
- That should be awful easy.

1131
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,050
I liked that.

1132
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,890
I'd like more.

1133
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,400
That's even better.

1134
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,870
All right.

1135
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,240
Now that's settled.
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

1136
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,740
- So that's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.

1137
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,850
I kissing you is all right.
I'd like to do more of it.

1138
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,180
But first I want to find out
what Eddie Mars has on you.

1139
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,480
- Lf you say that again...
- I'll keep saying it till I find out.

1140
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,750
I told Eddie Mars
I was coming up to see him.

1141
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,590
When I arrived, you were there.

1142
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,890
You two staged an act.
He let you win a lot of money...

1143
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,070
...and then sent a man
to take it away from you...

1144
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,700
...to prove there was
nothing between you.

1145
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,530
You're shaking again.

1146
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,940
Take me home.

1147
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,370
Sure I will.

1148
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,300
But first, open that bag.

1149
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:50,710
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

1150
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,850
Open it and make a sap out of me
or else stop playing me for one.

1151
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,810
Take me home.

1152
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,180
All right, but that's as far
as I'll carry you.

1153
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,950
From now on, you can
take care of yourself.

1154
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,340
What does the hat check girl
get for a tip?

1155
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,510
I'm trying to think of something
appropriate. How'd you get in here?

1156
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:25,700
Bet you can't guess.

1157
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,070
I'll bet I can.

1158
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,050
You came in through the keyhole,
like Peter Pan.

1159
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,310
Who's he?

1160
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,610
A guy I used to know
around a poolroom.

1161
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:34,720
You're cute.

1162
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,190
I'm getting cuter every minute.
How did you get in?

1163
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,620
I showed the manager your card.
I stole it from Vivian.

1164
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,060
I told him you said
to come up and wait.

1165
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,460
I want...

1166
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,430
See, I remembered.

1167
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,970
What do you remember about Shawn Regan?

1168
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,100
- I didn't like him.
- Yeah, why?

1169
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,540
He didn't pay any more attention
to me than you do.

1170
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,330
Treated me like a baby all the time.

1171
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,470
How's Eddie Mars treat you?

1172
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,070
I don't know him.

1173
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,540
You sure?
You know who he is, don't you?

1174
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,080
He's always calling Vivian up.
Why? Is he cute?

1175
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,650
I think you're telling the
truth, for a change.

1176
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,820
Is he as cute as you are?

1177
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,320
Nobody is.

1178
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,620
I've had a long day.
You'd better be going.

1179
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,800
- Come on, Carmen.
- I don't want to.

1180
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,970
- You can't...
- Shut up!

1181
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,740
Hello, Phil?

1182
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,610
Hello, Bernie. What's up?

1183
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,260
I want to see you down here,
right away.

1184
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,320
I just woke up.
I haven't had breakfast.

1185
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,020
It's 2:00.

1186
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:48,060
If you're not here in 30 minutes
you'll be eating on the county.

1187
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,100
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

1188
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,900
All right, I'll be there.

1189
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:05,910
Don't you know better than to wake
a man at 2 p.m.?

1190
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,950
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

1191
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,240
You're to lay off the Sternwood case.

1192
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,110
- Who says so?
- The DA

1193
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,520
The DA, huh?

1194
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,730
He must have changed his mind.

1195
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,260
Who changed it for him?

1196
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,860
- General Sternwood.
- Personally?

1197
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:27,060
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the general.

1198
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,930
He talked to the daughter,
Mrs. Rutledge.

1199
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,700
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

1200
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:37,170
There's no law says a man can't
work on a case without a client.

1201
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:38,610
You know, just to keep his hand in.

1202
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,780
I'm just supposed to
tell you to lay off.

1203
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,140
I know, you just work here.

1204
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,880
Put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

1205
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:49,150
A nice old guy has two daughters.
One of them is "wonderful."

1206
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,950
The other is not so wonderful.

1207
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,960
As a result, somebody gets
something on her.

1208
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,600
The father hires me to pay off...

1209
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,770
...but before I can,
the family chauffeur kills him.

1210
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:58,460
But that didn't stop things.

1211
01:19:58,670 --> 01:19:59,960
It just starts them.

1212
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:03,500
And two murders later, I find out
somebody's got something on "Wonderful."

1213
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,800
Who's somebody?

1214
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,980
- I think it's Eddie Mars.
- Why?

1215
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,370
For one thing, he owns the house
Geiger was killed in.

1216
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:14,070
He did. The day after the murder,
he transfers the deed to a dummy.

1217
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:17,110
What have you got that hooks
Mars up with Mrs. Rutledge?

1218
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,980
Last night, the two of them...

1219
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,490
...I don't want to bore you
with the whole story...

1220
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,250
...but they went to the moon to prove
there was nothing between them.

1221
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,050
I think there is, and it's got
something to do with Shawn Regan.

1222
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:31,030
Who's missing and supposed to have
run off with Eddie Mars' wife?

1223
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,430
What does the general
think about all this?

1224
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,930
I don't know.
"Wonderful" won't let me get to him.

1225
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,430
You still want me to lay off?

1226
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:43,840
The DA does, but you do all
right following your own hunches.

1227
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,740
Thanks, Bernie.

1228
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,450
I'm going out to get breakfast.
You want a cup of coffee?

1229
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:51,320
I can't afford to be seen with you.

1230
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,260
So long, Bernie.

1231
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,520
Sternwood residence.

1232
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,880
Hello, Norris? This is Marlowe.

1233
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,110
Yes, Mr. Marlowe. L...

1234
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,880
I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

1235
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,080
I don't think it
would be possible tonight.

1236
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:35,020
- Why not?
- I've been trying to call you.

1237
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,790
Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.

1238
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,940
If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.

1239
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:44,530
Hey, sugar, you got a match?

1240
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,110
Sure thing.

1241
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,470
Hello, Marlowe?

1242
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,070
Thanks.

1243
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,250
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

1244
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:59,650
I wanted to tell you
you can stop worrying...

1245
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,480
... and call off your bloodhounds.
We found Shawn.

1246
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,780
What's that?
You've found Shawn?

1247
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,620
Yes. He's been in Mexico.

1248
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,060
He hasn't been very well.

1249
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,290
What happened?

1250
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,160
An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.

1251
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,130
I'm leaving at once to meet him.

1252
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,460
I see.

1253
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,100
I suppose the general's quite pleased.

1254
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:20,340
We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.

1255
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,540
Thanks for telling me.

1256
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,010
Have a nice trip.

1257
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,110
I will. Goodbye.

1258
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,750
Goodbye.

1259
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,080
Say, mister...

1260
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,270
...would you please...

1261
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,630
This is just our way
of saying, "Lay off."

1262
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,600
You the guy that's been tailing me?

1263
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,400
Yeah. My name's Jones.
Harry Jones.

1264
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:59,730
I want to see you.

1265
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,340
Swell!

1266
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,180
Did you want to see those guys jump me?

1267
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,640
I didn't care one way or the other.

1268
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,740
You could've yelled for help.

1269
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:13,580
A guy's playing a hand, I let him
play it. I'm no kibitzer.

1270
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,820
You got brains.

1271
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:18,750
Get my hat, will you?

1272
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,830
Help me up to my office.

1273
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,910
That working over they gave you
was the best I've seen.

1274
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,980
And I've been around too.

1275
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,150
Used to run a little liquor.

1276
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,880
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

1277
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,150
- Tough racket.
- Terrible!

1278
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,150
Sit down. You make me nervous.

1279
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,850
Maybe you don't believe me.

1280
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:57,830
What do you want?

1281
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,230
That's better.

1282
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:00,870
I've got something to sell, cheap.

1283
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,300
For a couple of C's.

1284
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,100
Don't let me stop you.

1285
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:07,430
- Don't you want to even know who I am?
- I already know.

1286
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,940
You're not a cop.

1287
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,480
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

1288
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,080
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

1289
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,080
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

1290
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,880
How'd you know that?

1291
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,150
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

1292
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,820
She's too big for you.

1293
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:25,050
That's a dirty crack, brother.

1294
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,530
I suppose you're right.

1295
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,160
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

1296
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,430
Cut the babble.
What do you want?

1297
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,500
If you're looking for something,
will you pay for it?

1298
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,400
- Lf it does what?
- Helps you find Regan.

1299
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,800
This is getting funny.

1300
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,500
I'm supposed to pay you two C's for
telling me I'm looking for Regan.

1301
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,510
People have been
telling me that for days.

1302
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,710
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

1303
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:51,780
Do you want to know what I've got,
or don't you?

1304
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:53,280
I don't know.

1305
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:56,480
200 buys a lot of
information in my circle.

1306
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,090
Would you pay it to know
where Eddie Mars' wife is?

1307
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:01,660
Would you pay $ 200 for that, shamus?

1308
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,460
I think I might.

1309
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:05,390
- Where?
- Agnes found her.

1310
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,930
She'll tell you, when she has
the dough in her hand.

1311
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:11,100
You might tell the cops for nothing.

1312
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,930
I ain't so brittle.

1313
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,970
Agnes must have something
I didn't notice.

1314
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,070
I ain't tried to pull anything.

1315
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,040
I came here with a straight
proposition. Take it or leave it.

1316
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,840
One right guy to another.

1317
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:25,780
You start waving cops at me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1318
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,310
I am.

1319
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,820
200 it is.

1320
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,990
- Have you got the money?
- Where's Agnes?

1321
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,790
You know Puss Walgreen's office?
Fulwider Building?

1322
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,520
428 in the back?

1323
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,260
No, but I can find it.

1324
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,370
Will you be in shape to meet
me there in an hour?

1325
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:41,160
- I guess so.
- You bring the dough.

1326
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,340
I'll take you to Agnes.

1327
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,550
Who are you?
What do you want?

1328
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,750
I wanted to see you.

1329
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,490
Who are you?

1330
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,690
I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

1331
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,200
Canino?

1332
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:49,790
- Sure!
- I thought you would remember.

1333
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,870
What do you want?

1334
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,400
Why have you been following
that detective, Marlowe?

1335
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:54,700
- Who says I've been?
- I do!

1336
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:58,570
That was a mistake, your mistake.
Eddie Mars don't like it.

1337
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:02,510
Sit down and quit stalling!
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

1338
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,050
All right, there's no harm telling.
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

1339
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,250
She's got to get out of town,
that takes dough.

1340
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:09,980
She figured she could
get it through Marlowe.

1341
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,750
Why would he pay?

1342
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,220
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody?

1343
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,490
The young Sternwood girl was there.

1344
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,220
Only Marlowe didn't tell the cops that.

1345
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:22,030
Agnes figured it was railroad fare
as soon as she could get hold of him.

1346
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,930
- You get it?
- Sure I get it.

1347
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,200
- Where's this Agnes?
- What do you care?

1348
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,510
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

1349
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,800
What's the matter, Jones?

1350
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,540
Ain't you ever seen a gun before?
Where's the girl?

1351
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,620
You want me to count to three,
like a movie?

1352
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,370
Where's Agnes?

1353
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,250
You win.

1354
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:41,980
She's in an apartment...

1355
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,090
...at 28 Court Street.

1356
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,520
Apartment 301.

1357
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,590
I guess I'm yellow, all right.

1358
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,030
You just got good sense.

1359
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:55,800
I ain't going to hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

1360
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:57,590
You're nervous, ain't you?

1361
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,570
- I think maybe you need a drink.
- I don't think so...

1362
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,300
You got a glass?

1363
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,900
At the water cooler.

1364
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,160
There you are, pal.
Drink her down.

1365
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,260
Well, drink it!

1366
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,570
What do you think it is, poison?

1367
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,130
I bet that Agnes of yours
wouldn't turn it down.

1368
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,840
No, I'll bet she wouldn't.

1369
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,810
What's funny?

1370
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:46,140
Nothing's funny.

1371
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,380
So long, Jonesy.

1372
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:27,820
Information, give me the phone number
of apartment 301, 28 Court Street.

1373
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,760
Thank you. One moment, please.

1374
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,500
Courtview Apartments.

1375
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,530
Office, this is Police Identification
Bureau, Wallace speaking.

1376
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,430
You got a girl living there
named Agnes Lowzier?

1377
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,570
Nobody by that name here.

1378
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,330
Have you got a brunette with
green eyes, kind of slanted...

1379
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:47,310
...either alone or with a little guy,
weighs about 115 pounds...

1380
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,710
...wears a gray hat and gray suit?

1381
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,850
Sorry. Nothing like that.

1382
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,890
Somebody just gave out
the wrong address.

1383
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,390
Thanks.

1384
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:19,240
You did all right, Jonesy.

1385
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:22,050
But you left me high and dry.

1386
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,720
Who is this?

1387
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:40,400
- What did you say?
- I said, "Who is this?"

1388
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,760
Hello, Agnes. This is Marlowe.

1389
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,000
Marlowe, the man you want to see.

1390
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,800
Is Harry there?

1391
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,770
Yeah, he's here.

1392
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,410
- Put him on, will you?
- He can't talk to you.

1393
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,740
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

1394
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:57,550
Your little man died to keep
you out of trouble.

1395
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,150
I got your money for you.
Do you want it?

1396
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,350
- Yeah, I want it.
- Have you got a car?

1397
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,780
Where can I meet you?

1398
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:05,380
Rampart and Oakwood.

1399
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,580
I'll be there in half an hour.

1400
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:28,350
What happened to Harry?

1401
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,740
There's no use going into that.
You don't really care anyway.

1402
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:34,440
Just put it down your little man
deserved something better.

1403
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,180
Here you are. Here's your 200.

1404
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:41,590
Joe and I were riding on Foothill
Boulevard a couple of weeks ago.

1405
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,360
We passed a brown coupe and I saw
the girl who was driving.

1406
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:46,090
She was Eddie Mars' wife.

1407
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,670
- There was a fellow with her. Canino.
- I know him.

1408
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:51,930
Some people you don't forget,
even if you've only seen them once.

1409
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:55,630
We got curious and Joe tailed them.
Do you know where Realito is?

1410
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,240
About 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

1411
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,710
Off the highway, there's
a garage and paint shop...

1412
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,040
...run by a guy named Art Huck.

1413
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:05,410
Hot-car drop, likely.
And a frame house right behind it.

1414
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,050
That's where Eddie Mars' wife
is holed up.

1415
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,120
- You sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

1416
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,520
Art Huck's, 10 miles east of Realito.
Is that right?

1417
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,390
So long, copper. Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.

1418
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,900
Hey, your kind always does.

1419
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:02,560
What do you want?

1420
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:05,330
Open up. I got a flat
back here on the highway.

1421
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,200
Sorry, mister.
We're closed for the night.

1422
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,430
Better try Realito.

1423
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:22,220
All right.

1424
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,010
Come on in.

1425
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,530
You'd scare off
a lot of trade with that.

1426
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,820
You can get yourself hurt,
kicking on doors.

1427
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,060
Cut it out, Art.

1428
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:33,530
The guy's right.

1429
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,070
You run a garage, don't you?

1430
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:37,870
Go ahead. Give him a hand.

1431
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,540
Thanks, mister.

1432
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,710
I suppose you can fix flats?

1433
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:47,350
Good as you can make them, but
I'm busy working on a spray job.

1434
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:49,350
It's too damp for a
good spray job, Art.

1435
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:51,450
You got time to fix his tires.

1436
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:52,920
- But I don't...
- Get moving!

1437
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,740
Sure.

1438
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,580
Here's the key to the back.

1439
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:59,120
Put the spare on.
That'll make it easier.

1440
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,430
Yeah, I took a skid up at the corner.

1441
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:09,930
A front tire went.
Lucky to find some help.

1442
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,470
You live around here?

1443
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:15,410
Just drove in from Reno
and Carson City.

1444
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,710
Came the long way around, huh?
Business trip?

1445
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,850
Partly.

1446
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,450
Having your car painted?

1447
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,280
Just a spray job.

1448
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:28,350
Art's pretty slow.
He should've been finished by now.

1449
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,980
All right, Art.

1450
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:33,520
Take him in the house.

1451
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,060
You'd be Mrs. Eddie Mars...

1452
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,960
...the blonde Regan was
supposed to have run off with.

1453
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,560
That's right.

1454
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:13,260
Where is Shawn Regan?

1455
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:15,660
I'd like to know that myself.

1456
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,760
Hello, angel!

1457
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:22,340
I thought I'd find you here.

1458
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,240
But you don't seem to be
running in front today.

1459
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:31,050
Remove that light, will you,
or move me?

1460
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:41,250
I suppose we're in the house,
in back of the garage.

1461
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:42,790
That's right.

1462
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:47,570
The boys don't take
any chances, do they?

1463
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,500
Where are they,
out digging a grave?

1464
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,630
You had to go on with this,
didn't you?

1465
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:54,270
- Where are they?
- They've gone to telephone.

1466
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,840
To call up Eddie Mars, huh?
To find out what to do with me.

1467
01:37:58,110 --> 01:37:59,310
I could've told them that.

1468
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,150
Why did you have to go on?

1469
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,540
Too many people told me to stop.

1470
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,480
Light me a cigarette,
will you, angel?

1471
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:08,420
Why did you have to make trouble?

1472
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,660
Eddie never did you any harm.

1473
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:14,390
Besides, I was never in love with
Shawn. We were just good friends.

1474
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,390
If I hadn't hidden here
when Shawn disappeared...

1475
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,590
...the police would've been
certain he killed him.

1476
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,230
Maybe he did kill him.

1477
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,060
Eddie's not that kind.

1478
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:24,640
You mean, Eddie Mars
never kills anybody?

1479
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:27,870
- You really believe that, don't you?
- Yes, I do!

1480
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:31,880
How do you suppose
I found out you were here?

1481
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,010
How did you?

1482
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:35,740
A little man named
Harry Jones told me.

1483
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:38,540
A funny little guy, harmless.
I liked him.

1484
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,050
He sold me the information
because he found out...

1485
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:42,810
...I was working for General Sternwood.

1486
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,820
How he found out's a long story.

1487
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:49,650
Anyway, Canino, your husband's
hired man, got to him first...

1488
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,230
...while I stood around like a sap.

1489
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:55,020
I was in the next room.
Now that little man is dead.

1490
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,360
- But Eddie Mars didn't do that.
- You're lying.

1491
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:00,630
Eddie Mars never kills anybody.
He just hires it done.

1492
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,570
You think he's just a gambler,
don't you?

1493
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,040
I think he's a blackmailer,
a hot-car broker.

1494
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,080
- Stop talking!
- A killer by remote control.

1495
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,270
Anything with money pinned to it!
Anything rotten!

1496
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,320
Ask him when you see him.

1497
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,810
Well, that got rid of her.

1498
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:19,930
She's okay. I like her.

1499
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,090
You like too many people.

1500
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,730
Never mind, angel.
The water feels good.

1501
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,430
I wonder if you'd do
what she did for a man.

1502
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,740
I was wondering that myself.

1503
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,740
There's nothing to do but
wait for Canino to come back.

1504
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,970
He doesn't know
I was in the other room.

1505
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:39,440
You know what he'll do
when he finds out?

1506
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:42,950
He'll beat my teeth out and then
kick me in the stomach for mumbling.

1507
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:44,880
That's just a start.
It won't be pretty.

1508
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:46,420
Please don't talk like that!

1509
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,520
You should have gone to Mexico...

1510
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,620
Stop! Please!

1511
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:50,720
Then, you couldn't have gone,
could you?

1512
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,790
The border patrol would've
checked you through alone.

1513
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,090
Too many people would've
seen you without Regan.

1514
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,390
It was much safer to come here with her,
especially for Eddie Mars.

1515
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:02,170
Will you get out of this
and stay out if I let you go?

1516
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:06,230
Take this thing out of
my mouth, will you?

1517
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,320
That's better.

1518
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,320
Get a knife and cut these ropes.

1519
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,830
Watch your fingers.

1520
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,310
Don't cut toward your hand.

1521
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,080
Who's got a key to these handcuffs?

1522
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,550
Canino.

1523
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,920
I don't suppose there's a gun
around here?

1524
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,020
None that I know of.

1525
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,160
The boys made a fast trip.

1526
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:12,630
What can you do?

1527
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:17,040
Look, angel. I'm going to
leave you in a tough spot.

1528
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,230
That's all right with me.

1529
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:21,070
- How do I get out of here?
- That door leads onto a side porch.

1530
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,180
All right, as soon as I've gone,
you count to 20 slowly...

1531
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,850
...and then scream your head off.
- I will!

1532
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,210
All right. Start counting.

1533
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,420
Get going, Art.
You heard what I said!

1534
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,830
There! Behind the wheel!

1535
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:27,530
Over here, Canino!

1536
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,990
That looks like the key.

1537
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:55,900
We'll have to take his car.

1538
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,840
How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

1539
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,320
About eight or 10 miles to Realito.
Why?

1540
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:16,760
When Mars' wife gets my car fixed,
and he finds out what happened...

1541
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:18,150
...there'll be plenty of trouble.

1542
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,590
You'll be in it
just as much as I will.

1543
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,660
I don't mind,
as long as you're around.

1544
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,760
I didn't have a chance to thank you
for what you did back there.

1545
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,600
You looked good, awful good!

1546
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,600
I didn't know they made them
like that anymore.

1547
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:34,400
I guess I'm in love with you.

1548
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,880
Will you go to the police with me?

1549
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:41,270
I can't.

1550
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,780
Why not?

1551
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,040
What if I told you
I killed Shawn Regan?

1552
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,220
Would you tell the police that?

1553
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,090
I will if you take me there.

1554
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,780
I'm not going to.

1555
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,120
Look, angel, I'm tired.

1556
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,060
My jaw hurts, my ribs ache,
I killed a man back there...

1557
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:03,130
...and stood by while a
harmless guy was killed.

1558
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,500
I can't say all that happened...

1559
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:07,230
...because Geiger tried to throw
a loop over Carmen.

1560
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,740
They'll swarm over your house...

1561
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:11,040
...so fast that every closet
your family's been in...

1562
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:14,270
...for the last six years
will look like a police convention.

1563
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,670
They'll all ask the same question:

1564
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,250
"Where's Shawn Regan?

1565
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:21,250
Why did Mars hide his wife out to make
it look like she ran off with Regan?"

1566
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:24,480
Why did you hide out there?
You're playing with dynamite.

1567
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:26,920
Don't ask any more questions.

1568
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:29,860
I won't even ask you
how you got into this mess.

1569
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,430
I'll ask Eddie Mars
if I can get there quick enough.

1570
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,000
Why are you doing that?

1571
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,060
I guess I'm in love with you.

1572
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:22,470
Hello. Let me talk to Mr. Mars.

1573
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,980
Hello, Eddie.
This is Marlowe.

1574
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,590
Yeah, Marlowe,
or what's left of him.

1575
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:30,760
That Canino's a pretty good boy.

1576
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,450
You'll have trouble getting
another as good.

1577
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:36,250
What's the matter, Eddie?
Can't you talk?

1578
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:39,430
I'm in Realito, the same
place Canino called from.

1579
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:41,500
Only now, it's me that's calling.

1580
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,190
I want to see you.

1581
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:48,230
Why don't you go to the police?
I just killed your best boy.

1582
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,640
Do you want to see me
or don't you?

1583
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,500
All right. Where?

1584
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,540
Las Olindas is too far.
Not your apartment either.

1585
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:59,850
Your house?

1586
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:02,550
You mean the one that Geiger lived in?

1587
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:05,060
All right. When?

1588
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:08,800
How long will it take me
to get there?

1589
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:12,490
I'll be there just as quick as I can.

1590
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:16,690
- That worked.
- You're taking an awful chance.

1591
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,670
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

1592
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:22,730
Go through there, and make sure that
back door is locked...

1593
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:25,880
...and then close all these curtains.
I'll get rid of the car.

1594
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:39,460
You're the one who's shaking now.

1595
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,320
I'm scared, angel.

1596
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:44,260
I'm sore too.

1597
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,770
Mars has been ahead of me
all the way. Way ahead!

1598
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,330
If I don't get the jump on him
this time, we're cooked.

1599
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:06,180
There they are.

1600
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:11,060
Watch the back.

1601
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,990
If you see anybody coming,
yell like you did before.

1602
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,810
- What is it?
- The curtain! Stop it swinging.

1603
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:22,030
I got here first, Eddie.
Put those scissors down.

1604
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,630
Put them down!

1605
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,630
Turn around.

1606
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,280
Over there.

1607
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,840
Sit down.

1608
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,720
There's two men out in back,
behind some trees.

1609
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:56,160
- Watch them.
- Hello, Mr. Mars.

1610
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:58,730
- You double-crossing...
- I told you to sit down.

1611
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,630
And leave her out of it.
She's all right, Eddie.

1612
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:07,310
She kept her deal with you.
She didn't tell me a thing...

1613
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:10,000
...except that she killed Regan.
But I didn't believe that.

1614
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,180
Regan's dead, all right,
but she didn't do it.

1615
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,680
It was Carmen, wasn't it?

1616
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,010
How'd it happen?

1617
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:17,580
- She didn't tell...?
- I asked you how it happened.

1618
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:20,720
- Carmen liked Regan.
- But he liked your wife.

1619
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,550
And he said no to Carmen.

1620
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:26,420
She gets mad when anybody says that.
I've seen her that way. Go on.

1621
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:29,720
She was high. By the time it was over,
she couldn't remember much about it.

1622
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:31,230
I've seen her that way too.

1623
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,770
- Then you hid the body.
- You can't prove that.

1624
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:36,160
It'll be just as bad for you
if I prove it to myself.

1625
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:37,890
Then you started to blackmail
Mrs. Rutledge...

1626
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,370
...by telling her what Carmen had done.

1627
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:42,870
How did you prove to her
that Carmen had done it?

1628
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,200
Prove it to me.

1629
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:45,840
You've seen Carmen when she's that way.

1630
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:47,670
Sure I have. Have you?

1631
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,910
Why didn't you know her
when you walked in that day?

1632
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,320
You're pretty smart,
but I've been waiting for this one.

1633
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,150
What are you going to do?

1634
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,620
I said you were smart.
You walked in without a gun.

1635
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:02,390
You were going to agree to everything,
just like you're doing now.

1636
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,120
When I went out,
things would be different.

1637
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:06,890
That's what those boys
are doing out there.

1638
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:09,800
But everything's changed now,
because I got here first.

1639
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,270
Angel, get on the floor!

1640
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:13,200
Don't get excited, Marlowe.

1641
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:16,270
If anything happens,
if there's any shooting, you'll just...

1642
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,610
What do you think will happen now?
What will your boys think?

1643
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:22,340
What will they do to
the first one out that door?

1644
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,780
Who's it going to be, you or me?

1645
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,880
- Look, Marlowe...
- You look at this!

1646
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:27,640
Haven't you ever seen a gun before?

1647
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:30,090
You want me to count to three,
like they do in the movies?

1648
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:31,880
That's what Canino said
to little Jonesy.

1649
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:33,990
- Don't go crazy!
- Jonesy took it better than you.

1650
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:36,530
- That's one, Eddie!
- Don't, Marlowe!

1651
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,120
That's two, Eddie!

1652
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,800
Don't shoot, it's me! Mars!

1653
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:28,680
Bernie? This is Marlowe.

1654
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:31,180
I've got some more red points for you.

1655
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:33,850
- Who is it this time?
- Eddie Mars.

1656
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,490
His boys got him.

1657
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:38,120
There's more to it than that.
He killed Regan.

1658
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:39,660
I'll tell you about it when I see you.

1659
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,880
Where are you?

1660
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:44,660
The same place, Laverne Terrace.
Come up and get me out of here.

1661
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:47,390
And watch yourself.
They may still be outside.

1662
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,860
Right away.

1663
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:58,540
It won't take him long.

1664
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:00,410
Wait, let me do the talking.

1665
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:05,380
I don't know what I'll tell him,
but it'll be pretty close to the truth.

1666
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:08,380
You'll have to send Carmen away...

1667
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:10,250
...from a lot of things.

1668
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,320
They have places for that.

1669
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:15,190
Maybe they can cure her.
It's been done before.

1670
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:19,670
We'll have to tell your father
about Regan. I think he can take it.

1671
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:22,470
You've forgotten one thing.

1672
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,500
Me.

1673
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,600
What's wrong with you?

1674
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:32,940
Nothing you can't fix.
