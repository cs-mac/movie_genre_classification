1
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:28,776
Hurumhei Mountain Hotel.
Who? Oh, hello, madam.

2
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:32,896
No, Mrs Nilsen.
That is completely impossible.

3
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:37,655
We cannot find a room for you
until long after Easter. Hello.

4
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:42,619
But do give us a call after Easter.
Preferably close to Whitsuntide.

5
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:45,941
If the snow will stay?

6
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:51,741
I'll give your regards to the snow.
Then it will stay until you arrive.

7
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:57,462
At worst, we can deep-freeze
a small piste for you. Yes, yes.

8
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,303
- What's for lunch today?
- Goose.

9
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:03,144
No, no.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean you.

10
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:09,784
No, it was for one of the guests.
That's all right then. Goodbye.

11
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:14,058
Poppe? Could you recommend
a small and easy piste for me?

12
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,221
Not too steep.

13
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:22,102
Then I'll recommend that you swing
by the terrace and head for the bar.

14
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:26,140
Yes, I might do that.
Would you post this for me, please?

15
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,382
It'll be my pleasure.

16
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:34,018
Good morning, Mr Blom. Have
you slept with a guilty conscience?

17
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:37,616
Yes. There is a draught
where I sit in the dining hall.

18
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,215
Can't I sit at Mrs Rosenkrans' table?

19
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:45,864
Yes. Perhaps it's not just
the wind blowing. I'll see to it.

20
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,979
Poppe! We are tired of climbing
up to the plateau every day.

21
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:55,022
- Is the snowmobile coming or what?
- It's on its way. Tomorrow.

22
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,583
Really? Did you persuade
the manager to buy it?

23
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:02,985
Yes. Well, it was a bit difficult
to persuade Mr Granberg.

24
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:07,226
But I've ordered the snowmobile
at my own risk.

25
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,658
- What will the manager say?
- Tell me about it.

26
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,939
Hotellkoncernet, Ltd.
Is a huge corporation.

27
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:19,427
Hurumhei probably doesn't mean
that much to Mr Granberg.

28
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:21,584
But what will he say?

29
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:27,260
No, that does it.
He has to be out of his mind.

30
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:30,699
He forgets that I own Hurumhei.
He does not.

31
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,058
- Who, Daddy?
- This Poppe.

32
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:37,659
He requested a snowmobile to
transport the guests up the mountain.

33
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:43,148
Te guests can go on skis. But now
he's bought the snowmobile anyway.

34
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,864
He says
he knows what the guests want.

35
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,106
And I am so experienced
in the hotel trade.

36
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:52,618
You haven't been there lately.

37
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,788
I don't have time. Hurumhei is
to high up for my blood pressure, ...

38
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,460
- and I'm allergic to reindeer moss.
But I have to go there and...

39
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:04,900
There, there, Daddy.
Remember your hypertension.

40
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,228
- But what can I do?
- Nothing. It's doing so well.

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,979
- Not because of that impudent fool.
- Let's check it out.

42
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,184
- But I don't have time for it now!
- No, not you. I'll do it.

43
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,109
What are you saying? You promised
you'd get me a page boy today.

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,305
Yes, it is difficult to get staff.
But I have to get a page boy.

45
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:40,710
The hotel is packed
and everything is... Hello? Hello?

46
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:44,870
- Miss Granberg?
- Hush. Let no one know I'm here.

47
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,266
- But why?
- I'll explain it later.

48
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,544
- You need a page boy.
- You bet. I'm going mad.

49
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,390
- All right. Here he is.
- But, Miss...

50
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,383
Come to the mountains
among the clouds

51
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,549
where the sky is always blue

52
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:39,031
come to the mountain
get away from the city

53
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,303
up the mountain
among the clouds

54
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:45,631
we have sun and snow and glaciers
come to the mountains

55
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,984
grouse and reindeer hide everywhere

56
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:51,266
get away from your mother-in-law
your taxes and troubles

57
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:54,750
from sorrow and want
from calmour and din and twaddle

58
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,027
leave it all behind
and go to the snowy mountains

59
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,591
we'll follow the paths
come with me up the mountains

60
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,705
we've got light, air and me.

61
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:10,711
Welcome.
How are you?

62
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,951
How can we help you?

63
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:21,512
- We? Who are we?
- The Hurumhei Mountain Hotel.

64
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:26,789
- I see. That's who you are. Morning.
- Morning. I mean, good morning.

65
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,828
How can we help you?

66
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:11,029
- Who are you? When did you start?
- Just now. My name is Ru...

67
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:16,595
- Ru... Rudolf.
- Ru-Ru-Rudolf. Do you stutter?

68
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:22,315
- No. Do you?
- Don't be cheeky, boy.

69
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:26,750
Stop smirking.
There'll be no nonsense here.

70
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,916
I'm the only one calling
the shots around here.

71
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,474
I see. Don't you have
a manager here, then?

72
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:39,036
Oh, yes. An old fool
who's never around. A nitwit.

73
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:43,948
- Nitwit?
- Step aside. Yes...

74
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:56,235
- Is that part of the job, too?
- You have to keep in shape.

75
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,151
I've just been demonstrating the
snowmobile I bought for the hotel.

76
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:11,750
But I may go weeks without breathing
five minutes of fresh mountain air.

77
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,877
- This might do you some good, too.
- Me? But I'm in good shape. Oops.

78
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:26,839
You're a weedy fellow. I'll make
a man of you when I get the time.

79
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,160
- Well, if you can do that...
- I can do everything. Remember.

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,754
Look at your posture. Stand straight.
I can't stand looking at that.

81
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:45,116
Take that away. Keep close to me,
and keep your eyes open.

82
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:48,313
- About turn.
- March!

83
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,393
I went all the way to Gardanuten
all by myself.

84
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,879
Well, isn't it great to have
the countryside all to yourself?

85
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:06,351
It can be a bit too much.
Are there no fun people coming here?

86
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:10,760
All the people here are fun. And
today more fun people will arrive.

87
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:14,637
- Any celebrities?
- Well, let's see.

88
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:19,552
- Yes, Mona Miller, the model.
- Yes, she's so much fun.

89
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:24,711
- Do you two know each other?
- Any interesting men?

90
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:30,680
Interesting men? Let's just see.
Yes, here we go.

91
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:36,241
This is right up your street.
Classy stuff. Can you guess who?

92
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,116
- Ali Khan?
- No, not Ali Khan.

93
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:42,793
- Gary Cooper?
- No. Go higher, go higher.

94
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:45,801
Well, do you know who's coming?

95
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:50,042
Our very own popular actor,
Teddy Winter.

96
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:54,282
- Is Teddy coming? When?
- Well, he's driving in his car.

97
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:58,523
If the road is OK,
he could be here any time soon.

98
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:03,354
I have to change. Let me know when
he arrives. Don't tell him I'm here.

99
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:06,681
I'll be silent as the grave.

100
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:08,283
Yes, certainly.

101
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,593
- Can you get me a clothes-brush?
- Get me a timetable.

102
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:26,240
- Are you sure he's coming?
- Yes. Give him a warm welcome.

103
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:30,154
You know
what celebrities are like.

104
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:36,713
"I want to be alone". But God help
us, if we take that at face value.

105
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:41,396
- We'll carry him on our hands.
- He can step all over me!

106
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,914
He's here!

107
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:05,563
I've always dreamt of meeting you.

108
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,722
How long are you staying?

109
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:13,001
Now, ladies. Don't kill the charmer
before he has arrived.

110
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,437
Step back, please.

111
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:19,845
He can't just step all
over you right away, can he?

112
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,163
Welcome, sir.

113
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,042
I told them that you were coming,
as you can see.

114
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:29,364
- I'll say.
- Yes, I said you were coming.

115
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:33,037
- This way, please
- My name is...

116
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,287
Please.
Everybody knows your name.

117
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,403
Really? Would you have
a small room for me, then?

118
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:46,396
A small room? Good one.

119
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:52,524
You'll get our finest room.
You'll get the bridal suite.

120
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:59,845
- But what about the newly-weds?
- How amusing.

121
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:03,803
You'll have room number 13.
I hope you're not superstitious?

122
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,204
No, not at all.

123
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,803
Now, now!

124
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,000
Now, now!

125
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:16,646
- What were you about to do?
- I was going to lift my suitcase.

126
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:21,479
Lift your own suitcase?
Shame!

127
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,407
Pardon?

128
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,444
I will not let you do anything
at all in this hotel.

129
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:32,883
We'll take care of you
and look after you. Here you go, sir.

130
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:39,199
And I'll personally take care
of your suitcase. This way.

131
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,679
This is the staircase. Number 13,
second floor to the right. Thank you.

132
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,889
- Thank you very much.
- Much obliged. Thank you...

133
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:57,971
Rudolf!

134
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,445
- Here I am.
- Where have you been?

135
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:09,805
- I got a chunk in the kitchen.
- A chunk? Watch your language.

136
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:15,085
You shouldn't eat snacks
between meals. Take it to number 13.

137
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,123
- On the double.
- On the double.

138
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,800
- Good.
- Good.

139
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:27,486
- What do you say, Poppe?
- Very pretty, Miss Sommer.

140
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:32,368
- Superb. The charmer has arrived.
- You didn't tell him I was here?

141
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:36,247
- No, of course not. No!
- That's good.

142
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,330
- Hi! Is it anyone's birthday?
- Number 13.

143
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,764
Take this one for me, please.
Poppe is waiting.

144
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:56,091
Buboribetra. We have to
get the better of Professor Holmgren.

145
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,012
Flowers for the newly-weds.

146
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,328
But where is the bride?

147
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:15,289
I am completely unmarried.
And I intend to stay that way.

148
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:19,043
- But you do have a companion.
- Excuse me?

149
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:24,772
Do you know it?
This is a Buboribetra.

150
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:27,249
Pleased to meet you. Lalla Thorsen.

151
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:32,734
- I came up here because of it.
- It could do with some fresh air.

152
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:37,565
Professor Holmgren claims it doesn't
hatch north of the 54th latitude.

153
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:41,245
But he hasn't been able to prove it.

154
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:46,245
But I think that I, here in Hurumhei
and around this latitude, ...

155
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:52,724
- will be able to prove that both
buboribetra and bubo practicula, ...

156
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:57,691
- and, for that matter, perhaps also
bubo spiritualis...

157
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:01,172
But that is, of course,
more of a hypothesis.

158
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:04,573
Sorry?
You can leave, but quickly.

159
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,487
- Page boy?
- At your service.

160
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:23,165
- Get me a drink, please.
- What kind?

161
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:27,336
Something that fits my mood.
I'm so in love.

162
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:32,088
- But it is so sudden.
- Windbag. A gin fizz, quickly.

163
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:34,811
A quick fizz coming up.

164
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:38,887
Come up to the mountains

165
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,691
we've got sun, fresh air...

166
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:47,734
What a reception. Where is the
audience, the applause, the music?

167
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:52,932
Yet I think I can sense a beautiful
view on the horizon.

168
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:57,734
That structure seems a bit familiar.

169
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:11,296
- Always ahead with the news?
- Always.

170
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:15,697
Would the proprietress of that voice
become the mother of my children?

171
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,890
Yes. How many would you like?

172
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:23,890
Eva! Oh, divine Eva.
How did you know I was going here?

173
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:27,808
How big-headed of you.
Aren't you here because of me?

174
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,457
- I'm here to relax, and I meet you.
- Then you won't be able to relax?

175
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,969
Pardon me for intruding.

176
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,297
That's what I call service.

177
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,450
- I trust my room is ready?
- I'm sure. What's your name?

178
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,375
My name?
That's funny. My name!

179
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,014
- Don't you know who I am?
- No.

180
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,010
- Don't you see any Norwegian films?
- Yes, if there's nothing else.

181
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,419
- Whom do you prefer on the radio?
- The Birkelund sisters.

182
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:07,979
Birkelund? Poor boy. We still have
illiterate people in the country.

183
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:12,652
No, Norway's most popular star
is Teddy Winter.

184
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:17,457
- I see. Where is he then?
- Right here. That's me.

185
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,221
- I see.
- How about my room?

186
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:23,174
Let's see.
You're staying in number 13.

187
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:26,658
13? Are you mad?
All actors are superstitious.

188
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,934
Knock on wood,
black cat on the road.

189
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:33,657
I see. Then how about
number six, Mr Winter?

190
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,934
Very well.
I've always been lucky in number six.

191
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:42,933
- And I'm staying in number seven.
- Excellent. Seven means good luck.

192
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:47,294
But six and seven together
still means bad luck.

193
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,416
- Do you feel like going skiing?
- Sure.

194
00:17:56,623 --> 00:18:00,377
- Are you going to change?
- It won't take a minute.

195
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,371
- The lobby in ten minutes?
- Very well.

196
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:12,141
Has anything happened
while I was away?

197
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,299
I welcomed Winter the actor.

198
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:19,214
- Winter the act... Who?
- Winter the actor.

199
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:25,340
I see. Did you welcome him?
It's our luck to have you here.

200
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:28,342
What room is he staying in?

201
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:32,457
- Number six.
- Number six, I see.

202
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:36,134
- You are lying.
- No, it's the truth.

203
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,893
No, it's not.
Mr Winter is in number 13.

204
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:43,381
He didn't want number 13.
He was superstitious.

205
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:47,544
- Was he superstitious?
- Yes. Black cat crossing the road.

206
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:50,305
- Knock on wood.
- My word.

207
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,383
You can't do that.
I'm the head receptionist.

208
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:59,854
What have you been up to?
Let me check. Let's see...

209
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:04,574
Hello?
This is Poppe, the receptionist.

210
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:11,942
Yes. Who is this? Are you Mr Winter?
Mr Winter, the actor?

211
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:18,494
You are? Well, hi.
No, I mean Hurumhei...

212
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:24,383
I heard you didn't want number 13.
So now you're staying in number six.

213
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:30,822
That's perfectly fine.
Since it's you, it's perfectly fine.

214
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:37,023
Yes. Pardon?
Excuse me?

215
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:41,459
A hole in the muff?
Is there a hole in the muff?

216
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,262
Is there a hole in the muffler?

217
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,823
Is there a muff up there?

218
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:52,383
Pardon me, but I don't understand...

219
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:56,103
Is there a hole
in the muffler on the car?

220
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:59,061
I see, he has a muff in the car.

221
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:04,786
Muffler... Yes, on the car.
I don't know much about cars...

222
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:09,300
- and that sort of thing,
but I can notify the mechanic.

223
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,783
Yes, of course.

224
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:16,379
Would you like a mineral water?
I'll send Rudolph up to you at once.

225
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:20,298
Thank you, Mr Winter.
Thank you very much.

226
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:25,583
Thank you for staying here.
Thank you.

227
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,065
What have you done here, Rudolf?

228
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:35,185
What have you done? You've
put Mr Winter in room number six.

229
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:40,224
That's the room I reserved
for the Mona Miller, the model.

230
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:43,341
Put her in number 13,
then it's in the bag.

231
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:49,785
In the bag? It's nowhere near
the bag. You've made a mess of it.

232
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,587
You know room number 13 is both
a double room and a bridal suite.

233
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:01,422
The young lady could be a virgin.
A virgin in the bridal suite?

234
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,660
She might develop issues. She'll
feel like an Eskimo in the Sahara.

235
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,991
You have to learn that in the
hotel trade you can't make mistakes.

236
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:20,779
Observe me, listen to me and learn
from me. I never make mistakes.

237
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:23,949
Does anything seem
less than vague to you?

238
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,267
- Oh no, Poppe.
- No.

239
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:31,909
While you are looking at me,
the actor is thirsting for a drink.

240
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:35,582
- Shouldn't you bring him a soda?
- But...

241
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:40,468
- Didn't he order a mineral water?
- Did he? Well, then bring him one.

242
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:46,349
Whatever. Get up there
and do what you have to do.

243
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:53,710
- Is everything to your satisfaction?
- Yes. Lovely room, great view.

244
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:58,940
Good. Your club soda is coming,
but would you prefer it down here?

245
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,668
- Sorry?
- The soda. You were so thirsty.

246
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:07,742
- No, I am not.
- No? Well, sometimes it can pass.

247
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,582
- A cigarette, perhaps?
- I don't smoke or drink.

248
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:15,308
- I see. When you're driving...
- Driving?

249
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:21,190
Speaking of cars.
What should I do with the muffler?

250
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:25,512
- The muffler?
- Yes, didn't you say so?

251
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:28,831
- Me?
- Yes, on the phone.

252
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:34,347
- We haven't talked on the phone.
- We haven't?

253
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:38,183
Yes, just a moment ago.
Please...

254
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:39,907
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

255
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:44,107
- I beg your pardon, but...
- Don't you want to go for a walk?

256
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:49,992
Yes.
I was actually going for a walk.

257
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:54,393
- Let's do it, then.
- Yes, let's do it, then.

258
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:58,383
- I have to talk to the receptionist.
- Hurry up.

259
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:04,390
Tell me... I have the impression
that the young lady knows who I am.

260
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:08,304
- Of course she does.
- But I don't know her.

261
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:12,793
- Now you must be joking.
- Oh, I see.

262
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:17,035
She must be one of my old students.

263
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:22,185
Yes, I'm sure you have trained
lots of young ladies over the years.

264
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:27,072
It's so embarrassing, but I'd
better pretend that I know her.

265
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:32,748
Yes, perhaps. Enough of this
play-acting. You're on holiday.

266
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:38,155
Don't tell me that you don't know
the actress Eva Sommer.

267
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:43,385
She washes herself with Lux on
the back of Allers every Wednesday.

268
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:49,149
I see. On the back?
Every Wednesday?

269
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:51,393
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

270
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:56,955
- The sky is gorgeous outside.
- Typical stratocumulus clouds.

271
00:23:57,157 --> 00:24:01,150
Personally,
I prefer cirro-cumulus clouds.

272
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,271
No, no, no.
Artists are strange people.

273
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:10,472
They are all on edge. But it's not
good, when they get too overstrung.

274
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:25,151
He... he just went outside.

275
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:32,515
And then he comes down the stairs.
No, this is not possible.

276
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,473
No, it's just a load of nonsense.

277
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,990
Boo! What's the matter with you,
man? Have you seen a ghost?

278
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:47,717
I... I... Tell me,
did you just walk down those stairs?

279
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,595
- Yes, didn't you see me?
- Yes. Yes, I did...

280
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,872
You didn't go outside
just a minute ago, did you?

281
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,311
You didn't leave with Miss Sommer?

282
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,911
- Is she down yet?
- Yes, isn't she?

283
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,716
- Well, you have to tell me.
- Yes. Of course.

284
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,708
- She went out.
- With whom?

285
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,708
Yes, that's the thing.
She went out with you.

286
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:24,790
- With me?
- Yes. You see...

287
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:28,118
- No, this can't be possible.
- What?

288
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:33,441
I saw it with my own innocent eyes.
She just went outside.

289
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:36,997
You went outside
with Miss Sommerjust now.

290
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:41,479
- Do you sleep well at night?
- I haven't slept that badly.

291
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:50,033
Pardon me.

292
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:55,521
Yes, Hurum... Harum...
Hurumhei Mountain...

293
00:25:55,722 --> 00:26:00,876
Hotel Mountain. Yes.
Go ahead, it's the receptionist.

294
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:07,715
Pardon? Who are you?
You need to talk to Mr Winter? Yes.

295
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:11,359
- Are you here now?
- No.

296
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:16,876
- No... There's a call for you.
- Thanks. I'll take it in the booth.

297
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,995
Don't forget my muffler, Poppe.

298
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:26,674
I've never experienced
anything like it.

299
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:31,081
Rudolf... Rudolf! Rudolf!

300
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:37,276
- Here I am!
- Right. Don't leave me now.

301
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:42,558
- Is something the matter, Poppe?
- Yes. Something's going on.

302
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:45,881
Confide in me, Poppe.
I understand it all.

303
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:51,238
You do? No. When I don't understand,
you don't understand either.

304
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,437
Have you experienced people
who come and go?

305
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:58,636
- Come and go?
- Yes, that's quite natural.

306
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,359
But this one comes
when he has left.

307
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:06,036
And he says things he says he hasn't
said just after he's said them.

308
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:10,761
And he forgets that he's forgotten
what he's said after he's forgotten...

309
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,638
- what he should've said
when he forgot it.

310
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:18,316
Poor Poppe. An old aunt
of mine has the same affliction.

311
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:22,962
- It helped when she played piano.
- What did she play?

312
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,634
"Dance Macabre"
usually did the trick.

313
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:30,442
If it got too bad, she would
play a march. Four-handed.

314
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:35,766
Four-handed? Alone? By herself?

315
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,878
- Did that help?
- Yes. They disappeared.

316
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:42,635
- Who? The guests?
- No, the hallucinations.

317
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:47,397
But it's no good fighting.
You have to embrace them.

318
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:51,964
Of course it also helps
to have a small snifter.

319
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:57,525
I never drink when I'm at work...
Get me a snifter. 7.5 centilitres.

320
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:01,686
- Yes, sir.
- The boy is not that dumb.

321
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:11,960
- What is it?
- No, it's not a buboribetra.

322
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:15,717
- Bubo what?
- Ribetra. A horned owl.

323
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,637
- Have you seen horned owls?
- I can't tell birds apart.

324
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:23,204
Imagine if I could
tell Professor Holmgren...

325
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,480
Let's pretend you're Holmgren,
and then I'll say:

326
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:30,522
"I don't know whether you
are an impostor or an ignoramus, ...

327
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:36,360
- when you claim that the buboribetra
doesn't hatch this far up north."

328
00:28:36,568 --> 00:28:41,802
"I've seen it myself. And reliable
witnesses have also seen it."

329
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:47,845
- Wasn't that a devastating remark?
- Yes, no one can act like you.

330
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,803
- It's my whole life.
- It's always been important to you.

331
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:58,084
- But you're on holiday. Relax.
- I can never leave my work behind.

332
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,919
But it is more than just work.
It's my vocation. Vocation.

333
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:06,725
You have to identify with it,
so that you think you have wings...

334
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,446
- and you can soar over mountains
and valleys. I'm sorry.

335
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,528
Cheers. Good evening, I mean.

336
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,601
Good morning.
Join us at the table. Our table.

337
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:34,123
Here in the stable... at our table.
Cheers.

338
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,170
- Grey.
- Yes.

339
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:05,207
- Grey.
- Perhaps at your temples, yes.

340
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:10,410
- I am Grey.
- But it suits you, sir.

341
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:15,844
- I am Doctor Grey.
- Yes, but it will pass.

342
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:21,810
Oh, you are Doctor Grey?
Pardon me. You're very welcome.

343
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:25,926
- Where have I got you?
- Have you got me anywhere?

344
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:30,524
Yes, in my annals. Did you
have a pleasant journey, Doctor?

345
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,930
- Did I?
- No, did you?

346
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:38,490
- No.
- The busses aren't kid stuff.

347
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:41,969
I wouldn't know.
I'm not a paediatrician.

348
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:47,043
Turn around, please.
And then back again.

349
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:51,564
I wanted to see
if you were as tall on both sides.

350
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:53,492
- Was I?
- Yes.

351
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:55,889
- Thank you.
- Where is my room?

352
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:59,530
Well, it's on the second floor.
It's attached to the wall.

353
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,090
I'm sorry. We were going
to put you in number 19.

354
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,650
Who are "we",
who are going to "put" me?

355
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:14,091
Oh, no. We've reserved number 19
for Doctor Grey. That's what we do.

356
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:18,846
Would you please fill this one out?

357
00:31:19,055 --> 00:31:22,047
- Can I get a stamp?
- No.

358
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:28,171
Let me introduce you. This is Winter,
the actor. Doctor Grey.

359
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:32,493
- What kind of actor?
- What kind of doctor?

360
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:36,371
- Psychiatrist. Say "ah".
- Ah.

361
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:42,446
- No, "a" as in "alcohol".
- Aah!

362
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:46,490
As a doctor, I can see you need a
drink. Would you join me in the bar?

363
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,813
Brilliant!
You'll be my physician-in-ordinary.

364
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,008
Be careful, lad.
It is precious stuff.

365
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:57,892
- Your instruments, perhaps?
- No, medicine.

366
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:03,535
How clumsy of you. Can't you even
lift a suitcase? Like this.

367
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:09,126
Are you ready?

368
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,886
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

369
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:26,456
Pardon the interruption,
but is this your ball pen?

370
00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:31,778
- No. It's my fountain pen.
- Are you enjoying yourselves?

371
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:34,856
- Yes.
- How enjoyable.

372
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,618
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

373
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:44,612
- I think my theory...
- A nice walk?

374
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:51,133
Yes, thank you... about
the buboribetra is correct. But...

375
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,812
Excuse me, stay here a moment,
until I get back, please.

376
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,739
Let's see.

377
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,889
- I'll go change. So long.
- Thank you for the walk.

378
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:37,609
- You're standing here, right?
- I beg your pardon?

379
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:44,169
- You're not down in the bar?
- I've told you that I don't drink.

380
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:50,217
No, of course you don't.
No... it's all my fault.

381
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:54,573
- Aren't you feeling well?
- No, I don't think so.

382
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:59,218
- Then you should lie down.
- Not with just anyone.

383
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:06,373
For anything, I mean.
But what about the muffler?

384
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:11,371
Give it a rest with that muffler!

385
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:17,373
There's no need for that.
I do have a right to know.

386
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:19,618
Poppe!

387
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:23,173
Poppe!

388
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:28,772
Don't forget to fix my muffler.

389
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,941
Mummy!

390
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:03,536
Help! Mummy!

391
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:44,539
There you are! I knew you were
here, but I hadn't seen you.

392
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:47,696
I'm sorry, I don't understand...

393
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:52,616
No, but I do. I assume
Eva has taken up all your time.

394
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:54,896
Eva? Do you mean Miss Sommer?

395
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,415
Don't play innocent with me.

396
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:02,780
- I enjoyed your company.
- I don't recall...

397
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:05,625
No, of course not.
You were so drunk.

398
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:10,821
- Drunk, I? I don't drink.
- Pardon?

399
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:13,143
Are you on the wagon?

400
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:19,263
On the wagon? What in?
No, really! Pardon me.

401
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:23,346
- I'll see to it, Mr Sander.
- Thank you very much.

402
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:28,462
Is there not a single sane person
in this hotel?

403
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,338
Or is it me who's gone mad?

404
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:39,746
Oh, no. It's the rest of us.
Me, anyway.

405
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:45,261
Yes, I must say. Are there
any more patients in this madhouse?

406
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:48,266
Or have I met them all?

407
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:53,303
Well, you've met quite a few.
You know Miss Sommer.

408
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:56,227
Oh, yes.
That was altogether pleasant.

409
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:59,387
And you've just met
Mr Blom and Mrs Rosenkrans.

410
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,626
- Less so.
- And you know Dr Grey.

411
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,539
- I've never met any Dr Grey.
- You haven't met Dr Grey?

412
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:11,139
No! Is he the superintendent?

413
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,500
But I introduced you myself.

414
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:19,499
- Poppe! You are drunk.
- I know what I'm talking about.

415
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:23,861
But you don't. First you say
one thing, and then something else.

416
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:27,585
- This business with the muffler.
- No!

417
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,341
What kind of madhouse is this?
I need to get out of here.

418
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,745
I need some air.

419
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,466
Well, now I know
what to make of him.

420
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:51,350
I've never seen anything like this.
Rudolf. Come here.

421
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:55,942
- Closer. Don't be afraid.
- I am not afraid.

422
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:00,702
No, but I am.
Your advice hasn't helped me at all.

423
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,221
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's the matter, Poppe?

424
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:10,506
Winter is not Winter after all.
Yet Winter is Winter.

425
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:15,467
But when Winter isn't Winter,
then Winter can't be Winter, ...

426
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:20,348
- when he says he doesn't know
people who say they know him.

427
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:25,910
Of course not.
That sounds completely logical.

428
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:31,344
This Winter is killing me.
I don't think I'll be sane again.

429
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:39,546
But Poppe! You must be exhausted.
Poor you.

430
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:43,189
Yes, poor me.
What can I do?

431
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:47,545
Didn't your aunt do something else,
when she became nuts?

432
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:52,907
- If it became bad, she'd skip.
- Did she skip? Like this?

433
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:57,504
- Yes. Double Dutch.
- Did she skip with the Dutch?

434
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:01,342
Sure. She would skip with anyone.

435
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:05,752
Did she? Why didn't you tell me, lad?

436
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:12,983
There's the madman again.
Should we let him in? He is a guest.

437
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:16,345
Grab my hand, Rudolf. Tightly.

438
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,267
Don't scare me to death, lad.

439
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:32,670
- He's changed completely.
- It's not him.

440
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:36,834
- Isn't it?
- No, it's a new guest, Poppe.

441
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:40,630
Yes, it is...
Remove your hand.

442
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:49,027
Please. You're very welcome.
I'm so glad it is you.

443
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:53,585
- This is not too bad.
- No.

444
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:58,906
- Mona Miller.
- Welcome. You're so late.

445
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:01,550
Late?
I almost didn't make it at all.

446
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:07,228
I asked the conductor to wake me
before Hurumhei. But he forgot.

447
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:10,030
I got off the train
two stations too late.

448
00:40:10,236 --> 00:40:15,185
Oh, no! Rudolf.
Collect Miss Miller's luggage.

449
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,436
No, it happened so quickly
that I didn't get my suitcase.

450
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:24,108
No. Call the station and get hold
of Miss Miller's luggage.

451
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:30,313
I had to go back on a slow train.
Now I simply want to crash.

452
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:36,387
Crash away, Miss Miller. Crash.
I've also had a rough day.

453
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:40,476
- I'd like to crash with you.
- Hello!

454
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:45,957
Please send
this telegram for me, Poppe.

455
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:53,155
- Sorry? How did you get back in?
- I've been here all along.

456
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,034
- So?
- Are you here, Winter? How nice.

457
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:00,991
- Good evening.
- How pleasant to see you again.

458
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:04,668
- It's been far too long.
- Work and all that.

459
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:08,234
Especially that. You didn't forget
our little postlude at Bull's?

460
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:11,954
Of course not.
That was some night.

461
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,037
I hope we can continue
where we left off.

462
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,552
I hope so. I'd better hurry back,
or the roast will get cold.

463
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:27,631
- The drink will get warm. Pardon me.
- What a charmer.

464
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,911
- Who? Me?
- Teddy Winter.

465
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,877
The actor? Who just returned
to the dining hall? You saw him too?

466
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,038
- It's not just me?
- I don't understand...

467
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,199
No, I don't expect you to.
I don't understand a thing myself.

468
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,999
- I'd better get to bed.
- Yes, please. Oh, pardon me.

469
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,431
Let's see.
You're in room number 13.

470
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,155
- The key is in the door.
- 13, my lucky number.

471
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,671
Really?
Then go upstairs and get lucky again.

472
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:05,157
It's a double room.
It should have been a single, ...

473
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:11,038
- but it's been such a singular day.
Everything has doubled up.

474
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:17,271
Please. Upstairs and to your left.
Sleep tight, in your double bed.

475
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:22,999
- Thanks. It will be a bit lonely.
- I'm afraid I'm working.

476
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:28,481
No, no, no... Poppe, what's
the name of the sex bomb?

477
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:32,197
Mona Miller. A beautiful
work of nature, wouldn't you say?

478
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:34,199
Oh, yes. Very tasty.

479
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:39,396
- But she's a bit tired tonight.
- Poppe, you know you are my friend.

480
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:44,960
Much obliged.
I'll fix you up with her tomorrow.

481
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:57,560
Who knocks on the gates at this hour?

482
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:01,836
I'll be right... No!

483
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:05,274
Let me in. I'm cold.

484
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,475
Let me in!
Let me in, I'm cold!

485
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:11,322
No, you're having dinner
in the dining hall.

486
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:14,482
- I went for a walk.
- Did you leave when you said so?

487
00:43:14,684 --> 00:43:20,395
- Yes, you saw me.
- No. You went into the dining hall.

488
00:43:20,604 --> 00:43:23,994
- Let me in!
- No, I won't let you in.

489
00:43:24,204 --> 00:43:30,916
- I'm cold!
- Yes, yes, yes, just a minute.

490
00:43:38,404 --> 00:43:45,402
Can't you admit that you've had
a lovely dinner in the dining hall?

491
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:50,599
Can't you tell me that? Don't deny
it, the price will stay the same.

492
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:53,273
- I'm going mad.
- Me too.

493
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:56,602
- Or the both of us!
- Yes, but...

494
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:59,603
You just went into the dining hall.

495
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,593
Look. If I just came in here,
then I can't have gone out there.

496
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:08,721
No. But that's nevertheless
what you just did.

497
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:11,565
Now I've got it. Of course!

498
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:19,081
You were dining. You wanted a bit
of air and went out the back door.

499
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:22,323
- I never use the back door.
- That's the only explanation.

500
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,883
I'm right. And you are right.
We are both right, except you.

501
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:31,558
I refuse to argue with you.
You are either mad or drunk.

502
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:37,125
Probably both.
And now I am going to bed.

503
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:43,277
- But then you have had your dinner.
- No!

504
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:48,481
- Off to bed without any dinner?
- Yes. You've ruined my appetite.

505
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:56,043
And guess who was lying under
the snow. The managing director.

506
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:05,245
Rudolf's aunt, Rudolf's aunt.
She played the piano and skipped.

507
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:09,680
Skipped, skipped, skipped!
There we go!

508
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:46,450
- Oh, my God.
- Am I dreaming? Oh, darling.

509
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:48,406
- Pardon?
- Darling.

510
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:52,813
Darling? Who are you and what
are you doing here in my bed?

511
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:57,645
- Your bed? But my dear...
- I am not your dear anything.

512
00:47:57,855 --> 00:48:03,248
- No? With all that between us?
- There is nothing between us.

513
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:06,606
- Have you come here to insult me?
- No, to sleep.

514
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:10,728
- Yes, with me.
- Alone, if you don't mind.

515
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,894
- Get out!
- Am I to get out?

516
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:18,135
- Yes, at once.
- Two can play that game.

517
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:34,489
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Are they out of their minds?

518
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:41,332
- Enter!
- Enter!

519
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:54,609
Is there a fire?

520
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:58,605
Please throw this man out.

521
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:03,095
Will you please throw this woman out?

522
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:06,210
Can you decide
whom I should throw out?

523
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:09,728
In order that no
one will misunderstand this...

524
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:13,374
There's no mistaking this.

525
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,330
Come with me.

526
00:49:17,618 --> 00:49:21,088
- What does that say?
- 13.

527
00:49:21,298 --> 00:49:23,687
- And what does that mean?
- Bad luck.

528
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:29,053
- I'm staying there. On my own.
- Are you sure about that?

529
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:31,693
What kind of hotel is this?

530
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:36,017
"Comfortable, refurbished, 800 metres
above sea level," it says in the ad.

531
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:41,896
- And how far below standard?
- As far as most hotels, I'd say.

532
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:48,249
- It's locked. From the inside.
- That's settled then.

533
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:51,656
No! I've been locked out.
Are you hard of hearing?

534
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:54,579
No.
I hear better than I look.

535
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,456
I have to get back in. Or should I
sleep out here for 15 kroner a night?

536
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,778
- 15? That must be without board.
- You don't know what you're saying.

537
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,653
No. But I have to say something.

538
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,932
- Don't make me mad!
- What's going on here?

539
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,294
Don't kill the lady. Is it you,
my friend? Would you like a nightcap?

540
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,652
We're not acquainted, sir.

541
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:23,981
You're not my friend.
And I don't want any nightcap.

542
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:27,378
Especially since I have
to spend the night out here.

543
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:31,335
Don't interrupt my nocturnal
discussion with this woman.

544
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:35,659
A severe case of neuritoca idiotis.

545
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:42,255
- Right. Where were we?
- Out here.

546
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:46,899
Exactly. But we really ought to be
in there. I can't take any more.

547
00:50:47,102 --> 00:50:49,411
I need a place to sleep.

548
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:54,980
OK, but not at my place. I'll find
you a place to sleep. Come on.

549
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:15,934
Yes?

550
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,896
Have you gone to bed?

551
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:26,054
Do you have a headache tablet?
My head aches all of a sudden.

552
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:31,178
Poor you. Let's see.
I've got some here.

553
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,534
- Do you have some?
- Yes. Wasn't that what you wanted?

554
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:40,215
- Or did you want something else?
- Well, now that you mention it...

555
00:51:40,424 --> 00:51:45,259
But it's a good line when you make
late-night visits to other rooms.

556
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:47,898
- Eva!
- Not so fast.

557
00:51:55,264 --> 00:52:01,579
- You'd better go to bed.
- Then I'll go to bed.

558
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:08,094
Now I say good night

559
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:11,297
and thank you for this evening

560
00:52:12,385 --> 00:52:17,175
but I've really got this hunch

561
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:23,255
that something strange is going on

562
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:28,619
but let's call it a day tonight.

563
00:52:51,347 --> 00:52:54,657
Fool in the mountains
on the glacier

564
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:58,621
we've got light, air and me

565
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:01,580
Watch where you're going, Lalla.

566
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:06,497
Hush. The guests might not
appreciate a morning concert.

567
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:11,861
- Mind you own business.
- How dare you?

568
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:16,983
I dare not put a single man
in the same room as a single woman.

569
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:23,627
- Where he can't stay.
- Was there a man in your room?

570
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:27,707
No, I wasn't that lucky.
But in Miss Miller's room.

571
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:33,187
First I showed him the door.
Then I showed him the bathroom.

572
00:53:33,388 --> 00:53:36,186
Yes. Then I knew
where I had the madman.

573
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:39,028
Who are you talking about?

574
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:46,626
Winter? Good lord.
No, now I never...

575
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:52,062
Fool in the mountains
up in the snow...

576
00:53:53,949 --> 00:53:56,179
- Good morning.
- Morning.

577
00:53:56,389 --> 00:54:00,746
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Yes, thank you.

578
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,501
How are you after
your small adventure last night?

579
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,830
- Adventure? I'm fine and dandy.
- Just a second.

580
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:23,387
I'll say nothing, Mr Winter.
I'll be as silent as a muffler.

581
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,503
But you've started smoking
after last night's trouble.

582
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:33,468
- Started?
- Yes, you told me you didn't smoke.

583
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:38,108
Don't tell me you remember
anything from last night.

584
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:40,188
Yes, I do.

585
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:47,467
Let me refresh your memory
and say just one word: the bath.

586
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:51,061
- Pardon?
- The bath tub.

587
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:55,231
- Sorry?
- Sleeping in the bath tub.

588
00:54:55,432 --> 00:54:59,186
- Poppe, are you married?
- Is that an invitation?

589
00:54:59,392 --> 00:55:05,024
- No, I'm footloose and fancy free.
- Your wife can count her blessings.

590
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:08,304
If I didn't feel sorry for you,
I'd complain.

591
00:55:08,512 --> 00:55:11,788
- About the bath?
- No, about you.

592
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:16,702
But I am willing to turn a blind eye
to the shocking fact...

593
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:20,223
- that you forced yourself
into Miss Miller's room last night.

594
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,912
What are you talking about?

595
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:29,349
You can't run off with Miss Sommer
and spend the night with Miss Miller.

596
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:33,466
Really, Poppe?
Did you go elsewhere last night?

597
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:38,793
Dear Eva, I am blind to whatever
charms Mona Miller might possess.

598
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,507
Really?
Yes, I noticed last night.

599
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,148
Honestly, I'm not a punching ball.

600
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:51,702
I didn't do anything
that could lead to...

601
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:55,747
You fool!

602
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:00,471
Poppe is just talking nonsense.
The man is nuts.

603
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:05,350
- Why did Miss Miller hit you?
- She's always been hysterical.

604
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:10,788
- I must have been stand-offish.
- Is this the truth?

605
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:14,067
- Word of honour. Cross my heart.
- And I hit you.

606
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:29,549
- Poppe. Just look at me.
- Yes, you look a bit rough.

607
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:33,954
I also caught a cold. Do you know
where I had to sleep last night?

608
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:40,425
Yes. I just tried to talk to you.
About it. But you were so puzzled.

609
00:56:40,636 --> 00:56:45,391
- I haven't spoken to you today.
- You haven't?

610
00:56:45,596 --> 00:56:51,785
Don't start this again. I'm not one
to meddle in your personal life.

611
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:55,432
But you can't just go
from one flower to the next.

612
00:56:55,636 --> 00:56:59,676
Don't fool around with one during
the day and the other at night.

613
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:03,916
- I understand Miss Miller.
- I don't know any Miss Miller.

614
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:06,915
Pardon?
But last night she...

615
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:12,032
Stop! Don't remind me
of that troublesome creature.

616
00:57:12,237 --> 00:57:17,391
But... Poppe!
What do you make of this?

617
00:57:17,597 --> 00:57:22,113
You could almost say
that this is hard-hitting stuff.

618
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:26,106
- Idiot!
- Same to you.

619
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:41,032
Help. Help!

620
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:45,789
- Help!
- The doctor's on his way.

621
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,432
- Are you a nerve specialist?
- You should think so.

622
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:54,153
Help me.
I'm seeing double.

623
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:59,513
- Cheers.
- I think I see things I don't see.

624
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:05,351
I think I've seen them, and they are
there, and then they're not there.

625
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:08,551
- How do you manage?
- Seeing double?

626
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:12,513
- No, to say all that.
- It just had to come out.

627
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,076
You could try
one of my hormone injections.

628
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,068
No, Poppe doesn't need injections.
He needs sun and fresh air.

629
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,193
He should go skiing.
You should try some slalom.

630
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,428
Slalom? Me? You're mad, lad.
I'm no acrobat.

631
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,829
- The skis'll do the work.
- What will they do?

632
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,114
Just follow the terrain. If the hill
slopes this way, you go that way.

633
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:43,154
- I see. Like this and...
- And vice versa.

634
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:49,357
But you do remember that I'm
a receptionist, not a ballet dancer?

635
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:51,199
Just relax.

636
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:55,235
Relax your arms,
loosen your knees, right?

637
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:59,957
Relax your arms, loosen your knees,
feel courage in your chest...

638
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,277
Yes.

639
00:59:04,162 --> 00:59:09,953
Am I going that way down?
Will I get down in one piece?

640
00:59:10,162 --> 00:59:15,282
- Yes. Just go ahead.
- Just a moment.

641
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,802
- Hurrah!
- Bravo!

642
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:24,684
- What are you using today?
- Blue Swix, of course.

643
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:30,676
- You're not mad at me, are you?
- No, it's not your fault.

644
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:35,481
Because I was so angry, I mean.
Don't be mad at me.

645
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:40,679
- No, not if you ask me like that.
- More obliging than last night.

646
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:44,515
The less we talk about it,
the better...

647
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:48,560
I think you've made
quite an impression on me.

648
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:53,760
- Should we try the yellow piste?
- No, thank you. I'll go on my own.

649
01:00:55,206 --> 01:00:58,278
- So. Now we're talking.
- Have you seen the weather?

650
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:01,717
- It's lovely.
- And what a view.

651
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:04,804
- It looks like a postcard.
- How unromantic.

652
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:08,966
Postcards are nice. Especially
with X's and "we're staying here".

653
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:15,163
But you are nicer than any postcard.
You're like a weather forecast.

654
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:20,202
Fair weather, gentle breeze,
a bit of snow on exposed positions.

655
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:24,605
Please take it easy.
What was the number?

656
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:27,002
- The bath tub?
- No, the room.

657
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:30,882
- Number 13.
- But you're staying in number six.

658
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:37,357
- Why did no one tell me?
- I'm sorry. Poppe is so reliable.

659
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:41,117
- He's just so overworked.
- Get my stuff moved to number six.

660
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:45,287
I'll write some postcards.
But don't forget buboribetra.

661
01:01:45,488 --> 01:01:47,763
Bubo?

662
01:01:51,648 --> 01:01:57,245
Lalla, about Winter's luggage.
Bring it to room number six.

663
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,647
Hey!

664
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:44,879
Hey! What are this suitcase
and this animal doing here?

665
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,240
- I was told to move it here.
- Why?

666
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:53,128
Why should I know? The others
don't know what they're doing.

667
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:56,004
Well, here's your friend.

668
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:02,087
Poor little thing.
That wasn't so good.

669
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:51,645
Yes, what do you want?

670
01:03:52,773 --> 01:03:58,928
- Want? I'm staying here.
- Nonsense. I'm staying here.

671
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:01,966
- No!
- Yes!

672
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:04,130
What an unpleasant voice.

673
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:07,565
Get out,
or I'll call the receptionist.

674
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:10,971
There's no need to.
I'll talk to him myself.

675
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:14,803
Let's meet in the lounge
in a short while.

676
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:20,447
Poppe, make sure there's
champagne in my room tonight.

677
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:26,092
- Yes, sir. Entertainment expenses?
- Running expenses, Poppe.

678
01:04:26,294 --> 01:04:28,286
Running expenses, I see.

679
01:04:28,495 --> 01:04:30,963
- Receptionist.
- How may I help you?

680
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:37,011
A room. I was thrown out again.
Now I want a room of my own.

681
01:04:37,215 --> 01:04:41,003
I won't tolerate being thrown around
like a ping-pong ball.

682
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:46,164
If you don't see to it right away,
I'll complain to the management.

683
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:52,929
I'll get you a room of your own.
I'll give you my own room.

684
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:57,175
It has four walls.
And a door you enter through.

685
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:00,493
And a window over there.
And a bed with four small legs.

686
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:06,692
And an alcove where the pretty bird
can stay. I can sleep in the bath.

687
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:11,412
This Winter is to blame for Poppe
being so nervous. Those actors!

688
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:15,052
They have such a strange behaviour.
Like yesterday.

689
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:23,686
Hello? Yes. It's Oslo for you. Tell
your father that you're a page boy.

690
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:28,971
- No, he mustn't know. Hello?
- How are you, my dear?

691
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:33,568
- Why haven't you called me?
- I've been so busy.

692
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:37,770
- What is this Poppe like?
- He's so sweet and nice.

693
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:42,768
- Well, he ought to be.
- Towards the guests, I mean.

694
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:45,970
- Despite his hallucinations.
- This goes from bad to worse.

695
01:05:46,178 --> 01:05:50,808
He's right about the snowmobile.
It'll be so popular.

696
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:56,331
No, don't write to me, Daddy.
The letter may not get here.

697
01:05:56,538 --> 01:06:00,895
- What do you mean?
- I have to go. There's a long queue.

698
01:06:01,098 --> 01:06:03,612
Goodbye.

699
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:12,618
That was a strange conversation.
Get me Hurumhei.

700
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:16,009
Do as I say,
then it'll be all right.

701
01:06:18,379 --> 01:06:22,691
Hurumhei Mountain Hotel,
this is the receptionist.

702
01:06:22,899 --> 01:06:26,733
- Why, hello, sir.
- How are things?

703
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:29,976
- Very well, thank you.
- Can I talk to my daughter?

704
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:37,052
Did you say "daughter"? There's
no trace of a manager's daughter.

705
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,093
Are you mad,
or are you trying to amuse me?

706
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,498
I'm not trying to amuse,
and I don't have a mad daughter.

707
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,376
No, not your daughter.
Let me talk to my daughter.

708
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,970
- Where do you keep her?
- I killed her.

709
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:59,700
I cut her up and put her
through the mincer. Goodbye.

710
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:04,019
Why, I've never...

711
01:07:06,141 --> 01:07:10,259
Order a ticket to Hurumhei
on the first train tomorrow morning.

712
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:22,898
Has everyone gone to bed?
My word, what a day.

713
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:26,936
Don't I deserve a drink?
Will you give me one?

714
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:30,532
What can I get you?
A sidecar or a dry martini?

715
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:34,291
- A whisky.
- A whisky's coming up.

716
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:37,574
- Water or soda?
- I'll drink it neat.

717
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:41,616
You can take a coke on me.

718
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:45,258
Thanks a lot.
But I think I'll have a whisky, too.

719
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:49,661
Really?
You're an early starter, aren't you?

720
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,820
- Yes. Cheers.
- Cheers.

721
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,934
See? You should have
stuck to the coke, my lad.

722
01:08:08,423 --> 01:08:10,732
Now, will you look at that.

723
01:08:10,943 --> 01:08:15,335
"Ruth Granberg on her way to
Switzerland in her green Mercedes...

724
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:18,616
- which she got from her father
on her 21st birthday."

725
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:23,340
The famous hotel manager.
What do you know. Look at this.

726
01:08:23,544 --> 01:08:27,059
- Is that what she looks like?
- Some people have it.

727
01:08:27,264 --> 01:08:32,384
Switzerland. As if there weren't
enough hills and mountains here.

728
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:37,135
- Yes, but she's back home now.
- Is she? How do you know?

729
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:41,861
- I've read it somewhere.
- Really? A green Mercedes.

730
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:45,819
We work hard, and we can't even
afford a Volkswagen.

731
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:51,861
- But she is quite pretty.
- Yes. But she's not very tall.

732
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:55,296
We can't all be as tall as Poppe.

733
01:08:55,505 --> 01:08:59,976
She is pretty.
She is a luscious little thing.

734
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:04,620
- She reminds me of someone.
- Does she? Who?

735
01:09:04,826 --> 01:09:07,260
- The matron's cats.
- What?

736
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:12,062
- Yes, a bit soft, don't you think?
- No, I don't.

737
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:16,703
How would you know? You don't
know about girls. You're too young.

738
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:22,264
Can't you, with your experience,
teach me about girls and such?

739
01:09:22,466 --> 01:09:25,822
Yes, you would like that.

740
01:09:26,026 --> 01:09:29,258
In our trade
we see a bit of everything.

741
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:36,339
- Have you been in love, Poppe?
- Oh, yes. Have I?

742
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:41,621
No, not really. I don't think
I've met the right one yet.

743
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:46,105
- What must she be like?
- What she must be like?

744
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:50,220
She has to be fair. Well, or dark.

745
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:55,297
She has to be tall and slim.
Or well-covered.

746
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:59,387
No, I think I'd prefer one
who was petite and pretty.

747
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:05,066
But...
Well, looks don't matter that much.

748
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:08,305
But she has to like the hotel trade.

749
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:12,137
- Absolutely.
- Then we'll run a hotel together.

750
01:10:12,348 --> 01:10:17,628
A model hotel. And then
we'll have many small page boys.

751
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:21,378
- And a lot of small page girls.
- Oh, yes.

752
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:27,017
What are you drivelling about?
It's late.

753
01:10:27,229 --> 01:10:31,507
You should be dreaming
about Little Red Riding Hood.

754
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:37,261
No, no more of that.
You can't take any more. Off to bed.

755
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:40,427
Then I'll close up the bar. Cheers.

756
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,826
- Haven't you gone to bed?
- I'm on my way. Are you going out?

757
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:58,979
I just got my things.
I've let Mr Winter sleep in my room.

758
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:01,863
So now I have to sleep in number six.

759
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:04,538
- Good night.
- Good night.

760
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:13,666
Yes?

761
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:32,550
- Who is it?
- It's Poppe.

762
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:36,461
Poppe? Oh, God. Poppe.
Just a minute.

763
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:41,222
Hurry up.

764
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:47,585
What are you doing in there?

765
01:11:57,793 --> 01:12:02,742
Number six is haunted,
so I have to sleep in your room.

766
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:07,947
- No, you can't, Poppe.
- No? Sleep on the floor.

767
01:12:08,153 --> 01:12:10,144
- On the floor?
- Haven't you been a boy scout?

768
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:17,145
- No. Yes. But do you snore?
- No, not that I know of.

769
01:12:17,353 --> 01:12:23,304
- I don't know what to do, Poppe.
- Neither do I. Something is wrong.

770
01:12:23,514 --> 01:12:29,225
There's one guest too much,
and there's one daughter missing.

771
01:12:29,434 --> 01:12:31,390
Something is wrong.

772
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:36,987
I can't stand any more.
I have to sleep. Soundly and well.

773
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:42,188
Like a normal person.
Before he gets his tax calculations.

774
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:56,587
- Can I never get some peace?
- Can I sleep with you tonight?

775
01:12:56,795 --> 01:13:01,585
Give it up, lad. You're still
wet behind your ears. Good night.

776
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:30,389
Come up to the mountains
come to Poppe

777
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:33,030
he's fast asleep
but he's got nasty dreams

778
01:13:33,236 --> 01:13:35,750
come up to the mountains
come to Poppe

779
01:13:35,956 --> 01:13:38,346
we'll stick with him
through thick and thin

780
01:13:38,557 --> 01:13:40,787
come up to the mountains
come to Poppe

781
01:13:40,997 --> 01:13:43,465
we are Winter and Co.
Are we one or two?

782
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:46,066
Come up to the mountains
come to Poppe

783
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:48,427
the poor devil never gets any rest

784
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:53,153
but now we'll say good night

785
01:13:53,357 --> 01:13:56,713
and thank you for this evening

786
01:13:56,917 --> 01:14:00,432
but we're sure you already know

787
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:06,631
that we'll be back for you tomorrow

788
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:10,547
good night
and thank you for this evening.

789
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:31,669
- Morning!
- Hey. My, you're spry today.

790
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:36,509
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Yes, I slept with the matron.

791
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:40,793
- Yes, please?
- The bill, please.

792
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:46,915
Are you leaving? I wish it was me.
This actor is killing me.

793
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:50,678
Look. There he is again.

794
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,677
- Any mail for me?
- No. They called about the muffler.

795
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,830
No! Are you going to carry on
with that? I am a very peaceful man.

796
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,272
But in certain situations even I...
One, to, three, four...

797
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,198
- Five, six, seven...
- Eight, nine, ten.

798
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,836
- Jack, queen, king, ace.
- Cut it out!

799
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:23,110
- Poppe?
- Good thing you're here, Rudolf.

800
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:26,631
- Is the receptionist ill?
- Yes, he's not feeling well.

801
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:30,959
- And I'm feeling poorly myself.
- It's not your heart, is it?

802
01:15:31,161 --> 01:15:36,110
My heart? Of course not.
I think my head is frail.

803
01:15:36,321 --> 01:15:39,358
Tell me all about it.
I'll understand.

804
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:44,238
I haven't slept a wink.
I'm seeing and hearing double.

805
01:15:44,442 --> 01:15:47,991
Maybe there's something wrong
with your eyes. Follow this.

806
01:15:54,202 --> 01:15:58,514
- Do you see anything?
- Oh, yes. Your eyes are lovely.

807
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:01,634
Really?
What's that nonsense, lad?

808
01:16:01,842 --> 01:16:06,916
You're over worked. You work yourself
to death for lazybones. The manager.

809
01:16:07,122 --> 01:16:12,834
- No one notices around here.
- I appreciate your effort.

810
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:19,721
You do? You're a bright lad.
I need a drink. Get me a cognac.

811
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:24,872
- The bar doesn't open until three.
- No. This is medicinal.

812
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:30,521
Run along now.
He's not thick that lad.

813
01:16:30,723 --> 01:16:34,478
He's the only one
who has noticed...

814
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:37,721
- what I do for this hotel.

815
01:16:37,924 --> 01:16:41,439
Rudolf.
Where have I seen his face before?

816
01:16:41,644 --> 01:16:45,273
Did you hear
anything from the garage?

817
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:53,797
Poppe! Poppe! Poppe...

818
01:16:54,004 --> 01:16:57,793
Popp-Popp-Poppe...
What's the matter?

819
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:05,683
There, there. Open up.
Like that...

820
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:08,524
That's Hennessy.
Do you know what this costs?

821
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:13,435
When I say cognac,
I of course mean brandy.

822
01:17:13,645 --> 01:17:17,433
It's uncomfortable down here.
Let's go behind the counter.

823
01:17:17,645 --> 01:17:21,433
You have to help me.
He's killing me.

824
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:25,878
- It looks like a drink helped.
- A drink always helps.

825
01:17:26,086 --> 01:17:28,042
What do you think it is?

826
01:17:28,246 --> 01:17:32,239
His nerves. I recommended
a hormone injection.

827
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:36,075
- Does that help your nerves?
- Indeed!

828
01:17:36,286 --> 01:17:39,756
- Do you suffer from nerves?
- Indeed!

829
01:17:39,966 --> 01:17:45,086
Then you must have an injection.
You'll feel like a new man.

830
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:49,439
- If you really think it would help.
- I'll get my syringe right away.

831
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:54,038
How do you feel now? Go up
to your room and get some rest.

832
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:59,958
- But that damn Winter is in my room.
- I'll have a word with him.

833
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,877
Oh, what a lad.

834
01:18:05,687 --> 01:18:08,520
Excuse me, sir.
It's about the receptionist's room.

835
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:12,641
Save your breath.
I know that you want to throw me out.

836
01:18:12,848 --> 01:18:15,885
But I have already packed my things.

837
01:18:16,088 --> 01:18:21,606
I'll leave of my own accord.
I'm leaving! Get me my bill.

838
01:18:21,808 --> 01:18:25,562
- I'll work until the bus leaves.
- Yes, sir. I'll pass it on.

839
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:33,197
Here I am again. Remove yourjacket,
and it will be over in a second.

840
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:36,957
- What do you want?
- It's just this teeny syringe.

841
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:41,560
- Syringe? Are you mad?
- No, I'm not. Take it easy.

842
01:18:41,769 --> 01:18:45,000
- It won't hurt.
- No, I don't want to! No!

843
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:49,805
Sure you do. After a small pinprick,
you'll feel great.

844
01:18:50,009 --> 01:18:52,477
- No!
- Yes.

845
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:55,203
- No!
- It feels great.

846
01:18:55,409 --> 01:18:58,879
No! No! This has got to stop.

847
01:18:59,089 --> 01:19:03,925
I won't stay any longer
in this... this madhouse.

848
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:09,643
- What went into him?
- His nerves are no laughing matter.

849
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:13,399
- We have to treat him with caution.
- And I slapped him.

850
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:17,922
Did you slap him? That's probably
what started all this.

851
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:22,487
I'll go with him into town.
He can't drive in that condition.

852
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:28,766
- Yes. He'll cut the corners.
- It is no joke.

853
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:34,524
- Let's have the syringe, Doctor.
- The syringe, yes.

854
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:38,729
Sorry?

855
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:49,000
No, I think we'll wait with that
until you get into town.

856
01:19:49,211 --> 01:19:53,125
- Into town?
- Yes, as you are leaving now.

857
01:19:53,332 --> 01:19:58,281
- Am I leaving?
- Yes, you said so yourself.

858
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,801
Did I?

859
01:20:01,012 --> 01:20:06,370
- Are you feeling poorly?
- I'm starting to suffer from nerves.

860
01:20:06,572 --> 01:20:09,245
I'll go up and lie down for a while.

861
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:16,405
- Poppe!
- Seven minus nine. That's not on.

862
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:19,368
Then I'll have to borrow.
But who will lend me?

863
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:23,727
- Poppe, I've worked it all out.
- Don't disturb my distraction.

864
01:21:23,935 --> 01:21:26,972
- My subtraction.
- But now I understand it.

865
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:32,375
- One is leaving, and one is staying.
- That's what you do in a hotel.

866
01:21:32,576 --> 01:21:37,650
The Winter you think is Winter,
is not the Winter you think he is.

867
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:39,175
What was that?

868
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:43,972
The Winter you think is Winter
is not who he is.

869
01:21:44,176 --> 01:21:47,771
- And neither am I.
- What do you mean by all that?

870
01:21:47,976 --> 01:21:52,686
I am not Rudolf,
and I am not a page boy.

871
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:58,255
No. Bring this telegram
to Mrs Rosenkrans outside.

872
01:21:58,457 --> 01:22:00,971
- But...
- Hurry. It might be her husband.

873
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:05,409
- But let me explain everything.
- No! Go away!

874
01:22:05,617 --> 01:22:08,495
- Is my bill ready?
- Just a second.

875
01:22:08,697 --> 01:22:13,532
- Is my bill ready?
- Yes, just a second.

876
01:22:13,737 --> 01:22:18,970
It's sad to see you leave so soon.
Perhaps you'll return?

877
01:22:19,177 --> 01:22:25,333
- To this madhouse? Never.
- Much obliged. Here you go.

878
01:22:26,418 --> 01:22:29,649
Would you mind
driving down to town with me?

879
01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:34,090
- There's plenty of room on the bus.
- The bus? Good one.

880
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:38,450
Wait for me. I'll be right back.
I just need to change.

881
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:44,096
- Do you want me to get your car?
- Car? I don't have a car.

882
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:47,894
Of course you do.
It glitters down in the garage.

883
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:50,613
If so, you can have it.

884
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:56,132
Thank you very much. And
when the muffler is fixed, then...

885
01:22:56,339 --> 01:23:00,127
- To hell with your muffler!
- I agree completely.

886
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:09,537
Yes, please. It's the receptionist.
A glass of sherry? For whom?

887
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:15,690
For whom?
Now... you'd better watch your step.

888
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:21,530
No, you're standing down here.
Yes, right in front of me.

889
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:27,337
You're here now, aren't you? Would
you like your sherry on the bus?

890
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:31,658
Yes, I'm here. But I don't want
no bus in my sherry.

891
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:36,776
No. You are down here,
but you don't want that sherry.

892
01:23:36,981 --> 01:23:40,417
Just a minute.
You can talk to yourself.

893
01:23:40,621 --> 01:23:44,853
- No, I've had enough.
- Yes.

894
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:49,851
- Pleasant journey. Welcome back.
- I do feel sorry for you, Poppe.

895
01:23:50,061 --> 01:23:54,418
Can I give you a piece of advice?
Take it easy. Relax.

896
01:23:54,621 --> 01:24:00,810
I am relaxed. And I know
you only exist in my imagination.

897
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:06,016
You are a mirage,
a hallucination, a phantasm.

898
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:11,455
If I didn't know any better, I'd take
the bird, which I know isn't there, ...

899
01:24:11,662 --> 01:24:14,779
- and hit you over the head,
which you don't have.

900
01:24:14,982 --> 01:24:21,979
But I just have to count to three.
Then you are gone with the wind.

901
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:28,655
One... two... two and a half...

902
01:24:29,743 --> 01:24:31,654
three.

903
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:49,502
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter now, Poppe?

904
01:24:49,703 --> 01:24:54,539
I'm ill. I want to die.
I want to become a monk.

905
01:24:54,744 --> 01:24:59,215
I want to go up to my room at least.
If I have a room.

906
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:03,303
Yes, come along.
I'll take you up to your room.

907
01:25:03,504 --> 01:25:07,133
Yes, come on.
Let's go up to your room.

908
01:25:11,664 --> 01:25:14,974
- Is it better now?
- No. It'll never be any better.

909
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:19,736
Just lie down, then I'll explain
everything. Winter is not Winter.

910
01:25:19,945 --> 01:25:25,178
No!
Not another word about Winter.

911
01:25:28,265 --> 01:25:30,699
Just lie completely still.

912
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:36,343
Oh, now I feel I'm getting colder.

913
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:40,823
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of everything.

914
01:25:41,025 --> 01:25:46,976
You're the sweetest lad in the world.
What would I do without you?

915
01:25:47,186 --> 01:25:50,622
- If only you could stay for good.
- Yes, if only.

916
01:26:11,507 --> 01:26:15,739
Yes? Pardon?
No, the receptionist isn't here.

917
01:26:17,147 --> 01:26:20,184
There's no one here.
The lot of them have left.

918
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:24,699
Do I have a lot?
No, the lot of them have left.

919
01:26:24,907 --> 01:26:29,185
It's as empty as the Treasury.
You got that one, did you?

920
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:35,980
A new patient, I presume.
Who are you?

921
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:39,624
- I am the hotel manager.
- I'm so sorry.

922
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:42,979
- And who are you?
- I am a guest.

923
01:26:43,188 --> 01:26:45,338
I'm sorry.
Do you have any complaints?

924
01:26:45,548 --> 01:26:48,062
- Have you met the receptionist?
- Not yet.

925
01:26:48,268 --> 01:26:50,941
- Have you seen the chambermaid?
- No.

926
01:26:51,148 --> 01:26:54,265
- Congratulations.
- Is something wrong with the staff?

927
01:26:54,468 --> 01:27:00,465
- Yes. Aren't you in the hotel trade?
- I have been for over 40 years.

928
01:27:00,669 --> 01:27:04,298
What a waste of time and energy.
I'm so sorry.

929
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:10,902
Yes? No.

930
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:16,143
No, he isn't here.
There's no one here.

931
01:27:16,349 --> 01:27:22,425
Who I am? None of your business.
Is this Winter, you say?

932
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:25,781
Well, I didn't think it was summer.

933
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,341
I'm starting to comprehend
the profundity of lbsen's words:

934
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:33,348
"Absolute reason died today
at 11 o'clock."

935
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:42,860
- Are you the chambermaid?
- My, aren't you sharp?

936
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:46,825
- Give me a proper answer.
- Here's my business card.

937
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:50,262
- Have you seen the receptionist?
- Not for a long time.

938
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:55,261
- What room is he staying in?
- Up there yesterday, but not today.

939
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:58,861
- Have you lost your marbles?
- No, my keys.

940
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:03,826
- You are fired.
- Thank you. It's about time.

941
01:28:17,912 --> 01:28:21,700
Come in, but don't talk to me.

942
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:29,469
Here you are? Are you
sleeping during working hours?

943
01:28:29,672 --> 01:28:35,269
- Would you like to know who I am?
- Such trifles do not interest me.

944
01:28:35,472 --> 01:28:40,547
I am no trifle.
First of all, I own this hotel.

945
01:28:40,753 --> 01:28:44,302
And secondly,
where is my daughter?

946
01:28:44,513 --> 01:28:48,631
This place is haunted again.
Stay away from me!

947
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,903
You can probably see white mice.

948
01:28:51,113 --> 01:28:57,507
But answer me, before they turn
into elephants, where is my daughter?

949
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:00,591
Dear, sweet, kind sir.

950
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:05,584
I swear on my long,
thin, pointy knees...

951
01:29:05,794 --> 01:29:10,743
- that I've never seen your daughter.
I never want to see her.

952
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:16,108
- And no other daughter either.
- I only have the one daughter.

953
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:22,503
You are fired. You are a disgrace
to the Norwegian hotel trade.

954
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:26,785
A disgrace!

955
01:29:28,715 --> 01:29:30,228
That was the door.

956
01:29:30,435 --> 01:29:32,824
- You there!
- I'm too busy.

957
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,230
How dare you?
I'll teach you a lesson.

958
01:29:35,435 --> 01:29:40,304
In the hotel trade you can't
be too busy. You are fired.

959
01:29:40,515 --> 01:29:44,349
- Great. I'll get rid of the uniform.
- Is it you?

960
01:29:44,555 --> 01:29:47,672
- At your service.
- What is the meaning of this?

961
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:52,267
You've always said
that people should work their way up.

962
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:56,594
So I did. Only the matron
knows who I really am.

963
01:29:56,796 --> 01:30:01,347
- But what are you doing here?
- Can't I visit my own hotel?

964
01:30:01,556 --> 01:30:05,947
And my own daughter.
Or should I say son?

965
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:09,785
No, daughter. You've just fired
your son Rudolf.

966
01:30:09,996 --> 01:30:13,193
It'll be great
to wear proper clothes again.

967
01:30:13,396 --> 01:30:16,434
- But I wonder what he will say.
- Who is he?

968
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:22,234
Poppe. You have no idea how sweet
he is. And he is so competent.

969
01:30:22,437 --> 01:30:25,235
Yes, he is running the hotel
the best possible way.

970
01:30:25,437 --> 01:30:29,510
What an enthusiasm. I should
almost think you are in love.

971
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:33,471
Yes! And a hotel professional
must be right up your street.

972
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:37,716
- But I have just fired him.
- Daddy!

973
01:30:48,718 --> 01:30:50,674
Enter.

974
01:30:55,158 --> 01:31:01,552
Hello, my good man. Relax.
Don't worry, Poppe.

975
01:31:01,758 --> 01:31:05,228
I understand that you've had
to deal with quite a lot lately.

976
01:31:05,438 --> 01:31:10,559
I apologize for my temper.
I didn't mean anything by it.

977
01:31:10,759 --> 01:31:16,595
I've just heard flattering remarks
about the way you run the hotel.

978
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:21,315
- Really? From whom?
- My daughter.

979
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:24,352
- Your daughter?
- Yes, my daughter Rudolf.

980
01:31:24,559 --> 01:31:29,155
Your daughter Rudolf...
What? No! Mummy! Help!

981
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,794
- I can't take this!
- My word.

982
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,556
Poppe?

983
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,710
Don't leave me. Oh, no.

984
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,314
Look at me. You may recognize
the soft girl in the green Mercedes.

985
01:31:56,521 --> 01:31:59,115
But... but, Rudolf?

986
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:03,473
My name is Ruth. It's my father
who owns the hotel.

987
01:32:03,681 --> 01:32:07,959
Really? I see.
Really, Miss Granberg?

988
01:32:08,161 --> 01:32:12,598
You've made a fool out of me.
I've been ridiculed at this hotel.

989
01:32:12,801 --> 01:32:17,238
- Dear Poppe, I didn't mean...
- Yes, you did. You have no heart.

990
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:22,596
But now it comes to an end. You'll
have no more fun at my expense.

991
01:32:22,802 --> 01:32:29,241
Poppe, don't leave me.
I mean, us, the hotel and everything.

992
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:33,958
Yes. I've been fired.
So now I'll leave.

993
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:39,839
I won't miss any one. Neither
this person nor... the other.

994
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:43,921
- No, don't leave.
- Who can stop me?

995
01:32:44,122 --> 01:32:46,078
- I can.
- You?

996
01:32:46,283 --> 01:32:53,314
I mean, I thought... You were fond
of Rudolf, and then I thought...

997
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:57,721
that maybe... maybe you...

998
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:05,038
Really? I'm not a green Mercedes
that you can decide you want.

999
01:33:05,243 --> 01:33:11,797
I'm not a toy for some owner's
spoiled daughter. Goodbye.

1000
01:33:13,404 --> 01:33:15,474
- Did he leave?
- Yes.

1001
01:33:28,164 --> 01:33:30,837
- Poppe?
- Yes.

1002
01:33:31,044 --> 01:33:33,558
- Are you leaving?
- You can count on it.

1003
01:33:33,764 --> 01:33:36,233
There's no train.
There's been an avalanche.

1004
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:50,955
Good evening, Miss.

1005
01:33:53,005 --> 01:33:56,714
How about a small drink
in the bar?

1006
01:33:56,925 --> 01:33:58,916
Fine!

1007
01:34:13,686 --> 01:34:16,883
- Excuse me.
- Poppe! Are you back?

1008
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:21,477
- To stay, I hope?
- No. It's circumstantial.

1009
01:34:21,686 --> 01:34:28,081
Due to circumstances,
I have to rent a room for the night.

1010
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:32,644
If you stay, you'll have
a double room... double salary.

1011
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:37,523
- No.
- I'll make you the hotel manager.

1012
01:34:37,727 --> 01:34:41,242
But I'll never again interfere
with your transactions.

1013
01:34:41,447 --> 01:34:45,122
- No.
- 6,000 in entertainment expenses.

1014
01:34:45,327 --> 01:34:47,602
- That's not enough.
- 8,000!

1015
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,116
- And a green Mercedes.
- No.

1016
01:34:50,327 --> 01:34:52,967
But what do you want, man?

1017
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:58,401
I want a new receptionist
who is just as competent...

1018
01:34:58,608 --> 01:35:01,486
- As?
- As me.

1019
01:35:01,688 --> 01:35:07,001
- But you have got me.
- Have I?

1020
