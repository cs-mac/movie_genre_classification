1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,906
And now, back to the one man
in America who really gets it.

2
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,585
Alrighty, welcome back.

3
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:33,696
I'm here with the lovely Debra
and her beau, Joel.

4
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,742
Now, let's slap on our swim trunks...

5
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,900
...and go for a dip in Lake Joel.

6
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,864
What is going on?

7
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:46,940
The little lady says
you have no direction, no passion.

8
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:51,737
The audience wants to hear your story.
I wanna hear your story.

9
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:55,217
Right now, I work at Gutters.
It's a bowling alley.

10
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:58,936
Bowling, all right.
I bowled a 280 last week.

11
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,575
College grad like you must be what,
manager?

12
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,296
No, actually, no.

13
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:10,822
I give out shoes, and then
when they come back, I spray them.

14
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,026
And then I put them in their cubbies.

15
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,143
See, this is what I'm talking about.

16
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,743
He, he has no joie de vivre.

17
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:23,979
He got passed up for a promotion
and he didn't say a thing.

18
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,707
It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.

19
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,016
Shoe--?

20
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,507
Listen, Eddie needed the job
more than I did.

21
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,023
Come on, Joel, a young buck like you
should have the world at his toes.

22
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:38,304
Now, I want you to think back for me.

23
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,459
When you were a kid,
did you ever think...

24
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:46,621
...that you would be handling
other people's rented shoes?

25
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,058
No.

26
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,300
Not exactly, no, no.

27
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:58,385
But work isn't everything.

28
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,866
I'm happy.

29
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,221
I am.

30
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,901
I've got the best friends in the world.

31
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,299
And I've got Debra.

32
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,185
You came here for one thing,
but I'm hearing another.

33
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,383
- Am I right, audience?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:17,018
It sounds like Joel here wants to scurry
home instead of facing the truth.

35
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,698
Yeah!

36
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:24,065
I think you're the one
that's crying out for help.

37
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:34,096
Yeah. Are you willing to see
the situation for what it is?

38
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,145
Because he ain't.
He's hiding in the shady knoll...

39
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:41,738
...you know, looking for unicorns,
hoping no one finds him.

40
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:47,664
The point is, this relationship
is nothing but a bunch of hooey.

41
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,221
Whoa, wait, wait up.
We came here for career advice.

42
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:54,299
Dagnabbit, Joel, put a cork in it.

43
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,779
I know this is tough for you.

44
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:02,623
But you know what you need to do,
don't you?

45
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,380
Joel...

46
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,382
...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.

47
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,616
What?

48
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,425
I can't be with you anymore.

49
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,305
No, no.

50
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,939
I can't be with you anymore.

51
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,378
- Isn't that great?
- Yes!

52
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,980
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

53
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,342
You need to shape up,
is what's going on.

54
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:27,863
You got a long road ahead of you,
and I am happy to say...

55
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,541
...that you are not taking her
with you.

56
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,380
No, you're not.

57
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,865
Joel...

58
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,226
...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.

59
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,660
I can't be with you anymore.

60
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,616
Joel.

61
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,936
Joel.

62
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,859
- Joel.
- Joel?

63
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:50,901
Joel. Joel. Joel....

64
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:52,656
Seriously, dude...

65
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,706
...you gotta snap out of it.
This is not healthy.

66
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,186
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Joel.

67
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:01,100
- Where'd you come from?
- I came from outside.

68
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,456
Hi.

69
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,902
For crying in the night,
have you stopped bathing?

70
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,740
You look like shit
and you smell like shit.

71
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:09,135
What's the point?

72
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,184
We all die dirty.

73
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:15,465
All right. Well, look, that may be,
but I had my last final today.

74
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,095
My bar exam is in four months.

75
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,827
Right now, it's all about getting you
out of this funk.

76
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:22,136
All right, home skillet?

77
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,377
Buddy, I love you.
You're my best friend.

78
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,505
I'm really sorry that Deb broke up
with you, that really sucks.

79
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,225
But look on the bright side, huh?

80
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,504
- I mean, it's not gonna get any worse.
- I got fired last week.

81
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,341
Fantastic.

82
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:39,864
Mr. Wendell said I wasn't fit
to work in the bowling industry.

83
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,382
He called me an ass face.

84
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:46,699
Said my face looks like an ass.

85
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:50,705
Your face doesn't look like an ass.

86
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:51,856
Much.

87
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,780
From here on in,
there's nowhere to go but up.

88
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:56,346
- No.
- Yes.

89
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,101
Up, up, up, there we go.
Come on, come on.

90
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,464
On your feet. On your feet.
Good God, you stink.

91
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:06,415
Come on now, just gonna bring you
on a little trip to the window here.

92
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:08,696
Yeah, huh?

93
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,459
Come on, Nosferatu.

94
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,743
Who's got an idea?
I've got a brilliant idea.

95
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:15,421
Let's go hop in your ride.
Take the top down, huh?

96
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,305
Don't answer it.

97
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,462
Hi, honey, it's your mother.

98
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:26,176
I thought you should know that your
father took Buckets to the dog park.

99
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,382
Buckets.

100
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:31,062
Well, there was a very aggressive
pug mix there.

101
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:34,617
And your father thought they were
just humping, you know, like dogs do?

102
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:38,018
And well, he didn't make it.

103
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,145
Oh, Harold.

104
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,026
Buckets? My Buckets?

105
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,702
Okay, okay, Joel, focus, focus.

106
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,266
Look.

107
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:52,863
Look at me, okay?
I am not gonna bullshit you anymore.

108
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,901
Today is a really, really shitty day.

109
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,627
But things are gonna turn around.

110
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:00,902
I can smell it.

111
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,145
Wyatt?

112
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,539
Gentlemen.

113
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:15,257
How many times have I applied
to the Oscar Mayer Wiener internship?

114
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,497
- Eleven.
- How many times...

115
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,135
-...have I been rejected?
- Twelve.

116
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,296
That's also correct,
I did call that one time.

117
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,425
Whatever. To answer the question
that you haven't asked yet...

118
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:30,859
...but I know you want to,
"Where has Wyatt been all week?"

119
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,824
Well, I'll tell you where he's been.

120
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:36,218
He's been in the process
of creating his own Wienerwagon...

121
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,343
...with every last penny in his pocket.

122
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:39,860
That's right.

123
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,016
Wyatt's Wienerwagon.

124
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,376
- Wyatt's?
- Yes.

125
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:46,266
This is an authentic,
chrome-plated, winged wiener.

126
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,705
One of only 600,000 made.

127
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,062
Can I ask a stupid question?

128
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,695
Now, why have I spent every last penny
in my pocket...

129
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,904
...on this Wienerwagon
and 12,000 frozen hot dogs?

130
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,456
It's called taking action, bitches.
Okay?

131
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:07,098
I will distribute hot dogs
across these great Estados Unidos...

132
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,258
...and prove that I am wiener worthy.

133
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,782
You'll drive thousands of miles
on your own dime...

134
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:15,940
...to distribute wieners across these,
as you put it, great Estados Unidos...

135
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:21,101
...to advertise for a company that's
rejected you resoundingly 12 times.

136
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,700
Correctamundo.

137
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,176
It's a self-promotion blitzkrieg.

138
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:28,862
And it wouldn't be a road trip
without my two other angels.

139
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,496
Little walkie-talkie.

140
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,419
Come on, you can be Lucy Liu.

141
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,861
Me?

142
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,263
I think I'll go inside.

143
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,825
There's chips...

144
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,938
...under the La-Z-Boy.

145
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:50,819
Okay, bro, you go get suited up.
We blast off in 60.

146
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,706
Were you dropped as an infant?

147
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,062
Cameron Diaz would not say that
to Drew Barrymore.

148
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,344
I am not Cameron Diaz.
You are not Drew Barrymore.

149
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,862
Joel is not Lucy Liu.

150
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,015
At least not yet.
He's going through a lot of shit.

151
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,018
Are you completely clueless?

152
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, here's a clue.

153
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,619
I've mapped out our entire trip...

154
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,779
...and the final stop on the tour
is Los Angeles.

155
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:18,782
When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.

156
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,380
What are you talking about?

157
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:23,061
About opening up
the largest can of whoop ass...

158
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,502
-...that's ever been crizzacked.
- I got it.

159
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,464
So you wanna go kick
Dr. Dwayne's ass.

160
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:31,461
No, we're gonna hold him down while
Joel beats the bejesus out of him.

161
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:34,016
Until he cries for his mommy.

162
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:35,666
His mama.

163
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,501
You've lost it.

164
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:43,380
Drake Hanswald.

165
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,501
And the name.

166
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,180
Drake Hanswald.

167
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,656
You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche.

168
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,387
And you're about
to join the Smashed Face Club.

169
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,060
Will never pass our lips again.

170
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,819
- Dude, don't do it.
- I did it.

171
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,740
No, no, no. No, we promised.
We made a pact.

172
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:08,262
- Why would you bring that up?
- Why? I'll tell you why.

173
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,225
Because he never stood up
for himself back then.

174
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,343
Never stood up for himself at all.

175
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:17,261
With girls, his jobs, everything.

176
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:23,423
Dr. Dwayne pulled a Drake Hanswald
on Joel on national television.

177
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:29,538
But this time, he's fighting back
like his forefathers before him.

178
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,938
You know, Lex Luthor tried
to Drake Hanswald Superman.

179
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,222
And what did Superman do?

180
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,777
Did he curl up next to a piece
of kryptonite and die? No.

181
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,939
That crazy lady, Mrs. Teschmacher,
jumped into the pool...

182
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:44,543
...and took the necklace off of him
so he could fight back.

183
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:49,098
We have to be that crazy lady
that take the necklace off of Joel.

184
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,340
All right, little Timmy O'Shaemus,
that's enough.

185
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,304
Here's a dollar.
Go play somewhere else.

186
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,935
Oh, jeepers. Thanks, mister.

187
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,224
So I go back to your original question.
Clueless?

188
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,947
Perhaps you meant "brilliant."

189
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:09,147
No, I didn't mean that.
You're still an idiot.

190
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,583
- Joel is never gonna agree to do this.
- Well, you leave that up to me.

191
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,215
I can persuade Joel. He trusts me.

192
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,099
What the hell are you doing, Wyatt?

193
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:22,464
Relax, man, 87 percent of the time,
there's no permanent side effects.

194
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,026
You drugged him?

195
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,577
- Help me get his limp body into the car.
- Are you out of your--?

196
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,863
Now, what are you two boys up to?

197
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,905
- Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
- Hey.

198
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,219
Something fishy's going on here.

199
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,343
- Is that a new perfume?
- I don't smell a thing.

200
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,699
You know what, you got a little
something on your mouth right there.

201
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,460
- Wyatt!
- Now, just breathe in. Take it in.

202
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,460
Relax, you're going to sleepybye,
sleepybye.

203
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,696
All right, don't worry.

204
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,745
She won't remember a thing.
But she might lose bladder control.

205
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,137
Wyatt, you are freaking
out of your mind, man.

206
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:57,379
This is not a fun trip.
This is not starting well.

207
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,057
I mean, look at him,
look at that punim.

208
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,899
He looks so peaceful.

209
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,217
He looks like somebody famous.

210
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,664
Hey, buddy.

211
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,056
Got you some eggs there.

212
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,746
Might wanna eat up.

213
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,625
Gonna need your strength.

214
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,458
Oh, that's good.

215
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,259
- Where are we?
- West Virginia.

216
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,576
It's for lovers.

217
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:35,544
What? What?

218
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:42,818
Okay, try and follow me, Joel.

219
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,495
I can hear you fine.

220
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,184
What the hell are we doing?

221
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:51,303
What the hell is going on?

222
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,345
- We drugged you.
- Yeah.

223
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,697
We're travelling
across the country to L.A...

224
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,937
...so you can kick the crap
out of Dr. Dwayne.

225
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,779
Dr. Dwayne?

226
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,063
I went to school with Dr. Dwayne.

227
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,778
- Really?
- Yep.

228
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:07,063
Said I was special in my own way.

229
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:11,055
You know, you're special
in your own way.

230
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:12,376
Felt me up.

231
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:15,345
Now say,
"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."

232
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,136
- Say it, "I'm cuckoo...
- I'm cuckoo...

233
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:20,741
-...for Cocoa Puffs." Yeah.
-...for Cocoa Puffs?

234
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,419
And then dumped me on prom night.

235
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,905
You tell him Muriel says rot in hell,
bitch.

236
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,380
All right.

237
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,416
I'll go start the car.

238
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,817
Need to look for a new job tomorrow.

239
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:49,979
Worse comes to worst,
I can always go back...

240
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,263
...to babysitting.

241
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:01,221
Oh, boy.

242
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:03,343
Steady now.

243
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,822
Probably not a good time
to mention the moustache?

244
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,705
Yeah.

245
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,183
This gravel feels like shiatsu.

246
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,463
Look, Joel, I--

247
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:28,706
You're not a loser,
and I wasn't trying to say that.

248
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,664
Look, it's okay.

249
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,665
You're right.

250
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:37,862
I'm 24 years old, with a college degree,
I rent out bowling shoes for a living.

251
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:40,177
You used to rent out bowling shoes.

252
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,100
Who could blame Deb?
I would've dumped me too.

253
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,062
I don't even know
why you guys hang out with me.

254
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,219
I mean, when we were kids,
yeah, yeah...

255
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:52,584
...I was the one on the block
with the trampoline.

256
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,624
But I don't even have that anymore.

257
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,255
My dad put it on eBay...

258
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,746
...without even asking me.

259
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:02,582
Actually, I was kind of hanging out
with you because you had Nintendo.

260
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,226
Your dad still has that, right?

261
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:08,938
Look, this road trip
was a really cool idea. It is. I just--

262
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,227
It's not gonna make things go back
to the way they were.

263
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,343
Buddy, it's not about going back.

264
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:17,704
This is about your happiness.
This is about standing up for yourself.

265
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,095
So what? Who cares, man?

266
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:22,384
Worst case scenario, you get
a road trip with your two best friends.

267
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:25,380
Come on, buddy. Road trip?

268
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,775
Friends?

269
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,262
- Wieners.
- Wieners.

270
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,546
You know what?

271
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,379
- Yeah, okay, let's do it.
- Really?

272
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,460
Yeah, screw it. Let's go to L.A.
and let's put the smack on.

273
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,345
- Well, down.
- What?

274
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,021
You don't put the smack on,
you put the smack down.

275
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,417
It is smack down. Wyatt is right.

276
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,384
Oh, yeah, Joel.

277
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,186
We made you look like Adolf Hitler.

278
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,066
That's pretty funny.

279
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:18,658
Oh, hi. Sorry, excuse me.

280
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,462
Damn.

281
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,744
Hello, pimping.

282
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,776
Oh, okay.

283
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,744
- Think I should talk to her?
- Of course.

284
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,819
- She could be the one.
- I look like an idiot, a diabetic.

285
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:38,104
- You do look like an idiot, so what?
- You need to go.

286
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,016
Put it down. Put it in the van.
What're you talking about? Let's do it.

287
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:45,936
- Hi.
- Hey.

288
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,462
- Check out the getaway sticks on her.
- All right.

289
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,616
Did you see that gun?

290
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:56,659
I'm telling you guys, Jack La Lanne
is a modern day prophet.

291
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,859
I'm gonna help you guys out
with that round tyre--

292
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,421
Thank you, thank you.

293
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:31,939
Get that thing out of here.
Get that thing out.

294
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,298
Get that damn--

295
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:06,264
You got a little something on your face
there, boys. I don't know.

296
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,145
I don't know what it is.

297
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,264
Janet, what in the diggity wiggity
happened to you?

298
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:17,578
My idiot brother shot me
with his BB gun.

299
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,136
Why would you do that, Tommy,
why?

300
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,901
- I was cleaning the gun and it went off.
- Whatever.

301
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,944
- It was an accident.
- No, it wasn't.

302
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:28,224
Hang on, let's get our stories straight,
okay, partners?

303
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:32,505
Now, Tommy, you were just sort
of cleaning your BB gun...

304
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,261
...and all of a sudden it went off
like that?

305
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,186
Like that?

306
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,860
Like that? How about that?

307
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,506
How about that, son? Huh?

308
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,660
All right, let me ask,
how is this all gonna go down?

309
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,818
I've never been in a fight before,
guys.

310
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,181
No, hey, that's not true.

311
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,100
That slap fight you had
with Adam Heiman in the third grade?

312
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,576
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

313
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,817
I'm pretty sure I lost that one.

314
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:03,978
- Yeah.
- You put up a good fight, though.

315
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,696
His right arm was like orangutan strong
because he didn't have a left one.

316
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,381
It's true. You know, that thing
was practically bionic.

317
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,536
I did my best, though.

318
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:15,017
Seriously, sometimes I thought when
he was going to pick something up...

319
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,745
...that I could hear that:

320
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,267
Oh, good times, good times.

321
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,702
Is it sad that the only fight
I've ever been in...

322
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,619
...was with a 7-year-old
one-armed boy?

323
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,106
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

324
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,817
There's the exit. Fire up the hot pot.

325
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,265
We got our first stop on the tour:
Bilbo, Tennessee.

326
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,942
Hot dogs, get your free hot dogs here.
Anybody want a hot dog?

327
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,416
I'm giving them away free.

328
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,260
Free means no money.

329
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,262
Come and get your free hot dog now,
better than candy.

330
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,782
Wyatt, can we please
move on to the next town?

331
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,619
This one is obviously dead.

332
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:05,816
No.

333
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm not leaving Bilbo, Tennessee,
till I give out at least one free hot dog.

334
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,139
- Folks, it's time to get up--
- I can't take the stench anymore.

335
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,979
I'm going for a walk.

336
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,183
Yeah, I could move around too.

337
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,742
Hot dogs. Come on and get them.

338
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,659
Oh, boy.

339
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,057
Can you handle the mob
on your own?

340
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:32,337
Hot dogs. Somebody want
a free hot dog? Anyone?

341
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,577
Anybody, free hot dog.

342
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,385
Anyone, anybody?

343
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:40,426
Sir, do you want a free hot dog, sir?
Use a free hot dog?

344
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,378
Hello, sir, you want a free hot dog?

345
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:56,182
What did you do to them?

346
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:59,578
Nothing, sir.
It's just a free hot dog.

347
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,376
Some kind of trick?

348
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:06,386
No. It's not a trick.

349
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,535
So how old are you?

350
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,506
Twenty-four.

351
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,345
- Bring one over.
- All right.

352
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,177
Hey, did you want any mustard,
or ketchup--

353
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,615
Or relish, or anything like that?

354
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,017
Just the meat'll do.

355
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,616
All right, here.

356
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,584
Try this, see how you like--

357
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,985
Wait a second.

358
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,462
Not bad.

359
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,337
Pretty quiet out here today.

360
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:03,579
We must be the only two people
out here for miles.

361
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,419
Just me...

362
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,259
...and you.

363
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,219
My friends just went for a walk.

364
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,220
You know, they'll probably be back
any minute.

365
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:19,019
You smell like beef and sweat.

366
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,542
Probably a short walk.
They gonna-- Coming--

367
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,777
Hush, now.

368
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:27,097
Let me take you away from all this.

369
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,223
I wanna stay.

370
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:39,699
Kierkegaard, schmierkegaard.
The guy's a--

371
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,944
Get in the van!

372
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,098
- Get in the van. Get in the van!
- What?

373
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,019
- Wyatt, calm--
- Get in the van now!

374
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:48,576
I will leave you!
Get in the van right now, let's go!

375
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,499
Man, let's go.

376
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,656
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

377
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,499
- Calm down, calm down.
- Wyatt, Wyatt.

378
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,783
- Buddy, what happened?
- Nothing.

379
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,858
- Nothing happened.
- Okay, nothing happened.

380
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:07,779
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong?

381
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:11,144
What would be wrong with you if
some guy was sucking on your finger?

382
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,820
Dude, what are you talking about?

383
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:17,026
I'm talking about cowboy boots
and man-gina.

384
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:19,462
One minute, I was giving him
a free hot dog...

385
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:23,336
...and the next thing I know,
he had my finger in his mouth.

386
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,463
I don't wanna talk about it.

387
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:28,661
Buddy, that's--
You're fine, that's cool.

388
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,295
- Settle down, it's perfectly normal.
- Really?

389
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,456
Yeah.

390
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,664
Just forget about it, forget about it.
You're fine. You're fine.

391
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:38,739
- We're fine.
- He's fine. We're fine, you're fine.

392
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,977
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, right?
- Yeah.

393
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,944
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

394
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,386
Yeah.

395
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,265
- Oh, hey, Ben.
- Yes, my friend.

396
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:51,419
I was thinking, Kentucky Fried Chicken
for lunch.

397
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,861
- That's a good one.
- Yes.

398
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,346
I could go for good chicken.

399
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,463
I'm picking up
what you're laying down.

400
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,699
You know, I might even go so far
as to say...

401
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,823
-...that it's finger-licking good.
- Yeah.

402
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:03,340
You guys are assholes.

403
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,463
A guy sucked on your finger?

404
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:09,063
Yeah, like your dad used to suck
on your balls.

405
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:14,065
Masturbating in an elevator?
Ding-ding, going down.

406
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,746
How about that?

407
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:23,336
- Hey. Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, just relaxing.

408
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:27,017
- Where the hell's Wyatt?
- Washing his finger. Still.

409
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,262
Get up, get dressed. We're going out.
I scoped out this place down the street.

410
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:35,500
- I'm watching something.
- Oh, oh, TV, well, that's not bad.

411
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,976
Well, what's on, let me see?
Those are the channels--

412
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,580
Oh, I accidentally turned it off.

413
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:42,420
We're going to the bar.
It'll be good therapy for you.

414
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,055
You can get drunk
and talk about your feelings.

415
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:47,502
I don't know. I--

416
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,295
I go through ups and downs.

417
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,499
I guess...

418
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:54,539
...you know...

419
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,898
...maybe I loved her.

420
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,661
I know it sounds cliché, but I--

421
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:05,376
I feel empty on the inside.

422
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:07,861
It's like I'm hollow.

423
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,420
Oh, honey, do you wanna put
your face in my boobs again?

424
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,459
I guess.

425
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:27,105
I don't know, buddy,
is this really helping Joel?

426
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,939
You smell great.

427
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,456
Yeah, this was definitely a good call.

428
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,185
Oh, time expired already, baby?

429
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:35,786
Well...

430
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:38,415
...let's feed that meter.

431
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:50,504
You forgot one.

432
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,506
You guys, I'm cold.

433
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,339
Can't we put the comforter on?

434
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,658
No, man, haven't you seen those
20/20 episodes?

435
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:01,819
I'm not cuddling up
next to someone else's jiz.

436
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,182
Too late for that, dude.

437
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,704
You're an idiot.

438
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,256
Would you both please shut up?

439
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,459
- Good night, Ben.
- Good night, Wyatt.

440
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,187
- Good night, Joel.
- Good night, Wyatt.

441
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:33,386
Good night killers of ArKansas,
lurking outside our window.

442
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,219
Damn.

443
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:41,538
I'm sleeping in the van.

444
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,060
What the--?

445
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:11,942
Well, well, well.

446
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,781
Welcome to Tofu Town, boys.

447
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:44,022
What the hell was that?

448
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:47,224
That's frigging defamation of character
right there.

449
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:48,820
That is disgusting.

450
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:52,184
That is the sexiest loogie
ever hawked.

451
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:53,860
What?

452
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:58,066
- She was hot.
- Dude, it was like her mouth ejaculated.

453
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:02,096
- I know.
- She's gonna get out here and clean it.

454
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:03,541
Come on.

455
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,380
Let's be honest, she probably
didn't even know she did it.

456
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:09,744
She probably didn't even notice.
Maybe she was coughing, I don't know.

457
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,625
I know people have that problem.

458
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:14,665
I've been hit in the face before.
There's nothing you can do--

459
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,545
No, no, no,
that loogie had a purpose.

460
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:18,265
Dude.

461
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,021
Dude, dudes, wait a minute.
This is perfect.

462
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:23,257
The loogie cementing itself
to my windshield?

463
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:24,542
No, no, Wyatt.

464
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,779
This is a perfect practise run
for Joely.

465
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,262
- No.
- Yes.

466
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,338
Hell yes, buddy.
You're gonna get in there.

467
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:35,658
You're gonna confront those hippies
head on. Head on, baby.

468
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,818
What are they gonna do,
hug you to death?

469
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:39,978
- This is a perfect first step.
- Yes.

470
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:42,058
Come on, you go in there
and you tell them.

471
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,139
They don't clean that stuff off,
you'll go psycho on their shit.

472
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:46,820
Psycho on their shit.

473
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:49,706
No, I'm not going psycho
on anybody's shit.

474
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,539
You're so frigging lame.

475
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,301
Let me show you how it's done.
Lesson number one.

476
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:57,698
It all starts when I get up
and make eye contact.

477
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,858
I rise.

478
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,464
I shift into attack mode.

479
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,381
And now...

480
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:10,775
...we dance.

481
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:15,456
Hey, bitches.

482
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,263
Bitches, huh?
Well, this should be fun.

483
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:21,225
I think you might've left something
on my windshield.

484
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,662
Oh, yeah. It's a loogie.

485
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,816
I know what it is.

486
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:26,978
Do you also know that big hunk
of flesh...

487
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:29,058
...with your bright smiley face on it...

488
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:32,424
...promotes the violent death of
innocent animals everywhere you go?

489
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,340
What're you doing but driving around
in a big giant sponge--

490
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,419
It's tofu. It's a soy-based
meat alternative, hello.

491
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,942
Oh, well, hot dogs are meat-based
soy alternatives.

492
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:42,984
How you like me now--?

493
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:47,176
You better go back over
to your cavemen friends...

494
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:49,941
...before I hawk another one
in your face.

495
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,978
Easy chief. We can handle this.

496
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,901
Okay, so it sounds to me like,
number one, you're not apologising.

497
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,826
Two, you're not gonna
clean that thing of my windshield?

498
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,136
A for the weenie guy.

499
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,743
Sarcasm. That's how it's gonna be?
Well, let me tell you how I'm gonna be.

500
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,420
Full of meat.

501
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:09,102
You know what,
you won't be needing this.

502
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,064
Steak sauce, you don't need that.

503
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,138
What, you gonna put steak sauce
on tofu?

504
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,025
It ain't steak.

505
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,625
So how did that go, chief?

506
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,665
Well, you know, I said what I needed
to say when I said it.

507
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:27,182
To establish authority, you dig?

508
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:30,066
They'll think twice about messing
with us again, thank you.

509
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:34,106
No. One, two, three, four, five. No.
One, two, three, four, five.

510
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,576
No, oh, it's gone.

511
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,578
Oh, it's definitely gone.

512
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,022
My hood ornament, man--

513
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,536
Oh, wait a second.

514
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,625
You guys are funny guys.
You took my winged wiener.

515
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,466
Please...

516
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,504
...tell me it was you.

517
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,536
I am going to kill every bone
in those hippies' bodies.

518
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,743
Yeah, you can't really kill a bone,
dude.

519
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:03,501
Without that hood ornament,
my vehicle isn't regulation.

520
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,056
- I could get fired.
- You don't work for the company.

521
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:08,297
Not the point.
I need my hood ornament, man.

522
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,027
- Are you feeling me?
- Could be anywhere by now.

523
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:14,463
Man, I have seen it all.
A gigantic hot dog.

524
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:16,106
- What are you eating?
- Bean curd.

525
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,781
Hippies in a big sponge
giving this stuff out for free.

526
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,223
- What do I do to get a free hot dog?
- Focus. Where's the sponge?

527
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,945
Took off down that dirt road.

528
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,096
Get in, get in.

529
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,782
I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting in.
I'm getting in.

530
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,500
You mean, I don't get
my free hot dog?

531
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,018
- Oh, there they are.
- Wyatt, slow it down.

532
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,018
- This thing was built for speed.
- Really?

533
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,064
A giant hot dog built for speed?

534
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,865
Holy shit.

535
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,336
- What--? What is that?
- That's nothing.

536
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:47,576
Help me.

537
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,539
They're dragging my....

538
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:54,905
Wyatt, Wyatt.

539
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,464
Slow this thing down, man,
I'm serious.

540
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,744
I've got some major pucker factor
going on right now.

541
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,338
Take your foot
off the accelerator now.

542
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,737
- You take it--
- They're just right over--

543
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:09,343
I did not go on this trip to be spinning
around in a giant hot dog.

544
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:20,702
Oh, look at my baby.

545
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,056
Oh, look at this.

546
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:24,741
No wonder I've been rejected
11 times.

547
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,944
Hey, hey, it's totally fixable.

548
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:29,745
Glue's come a long way.

549
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,461
Joel. Joel, look at this, is it--?
Am I bleeding?

550
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:35,824
- Dude, it's just a bump.
- Oh, yeah? You are such an idiot.

551
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:37,386
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

552
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,220
- Guys, come on.
- No. No, Joel, he's a moron.

553
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:42,821
He acts like an idiot
and we have to pay the price.

554
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:46,662
That's why your nose is gushing blood,
and I've got a lump on my head.

555
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,261
- Your entire head is a lump.
- I'm done talking to you.

556
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:51,657
I'm done talking to you
for the rest of the trip.

557
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,619
I already started.

558
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,943
- Look at this.
- Stupid wiener.

559
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,616
Remember when Ian Rosenbluth...

560
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:07,700
...would wedge the chalk into the
eraser in Doc Summergrad's class?

561
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,984
And every time Summergrad would
go to the board and try to erase...

562
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:14,583
...he'd get that fatty streak of chalk?
It was amazing.

563
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:17,215
That kid was great.
Oh, my God.

564
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,298
lan Rosenbluth, he's a genius.

565
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,586
Oh, did you--? Did you see that sign?
Did you see that?

566
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:27,535
That's a sign. That's a sign,
that's what this trip is all about.

567
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:31,063
My best friends
helping me take a stand.

568
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:34,060
Hey, and look at me.
You know, look at me, it's working.

569
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,426
I'm not scared of that.
I wasn't scared of that at all.

570
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,896
Punch that poster in the face.
Turn around.

571
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,376
Turn around, I wanna punch
that poster in the face.

572
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,344
What do you guys think of that?

573
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:47,863
Come on, I wanna hear your thoughts.
I'm listening now.

574
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:30,420
Nothing? Nothing at all?

575
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,545
I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God, I mean it.

576
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:37,859
- I've always wanted to do it.
- Hey. All right, all right, dude, stop.

577
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:39,745
Close the door.

578
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:46,576
- Say something to Ben, Wyatt.
- Why I gotta go first?

579
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:49,307
- Oh, God, Wyatt.
- Oh, God, Ben.

580
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,181
Apologise, please.

581
00:33:55,787 --> 00:34:00,258
I'm sorry that I called you
a moron and an idiot.

582
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:04,340
Thank you.
I'm sorry I said your head was a lump.

583
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,259
Thank you.

584
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,779
Didn't even ask for that.
That was great, that was good.

585
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,859
What the--? Hey, what do you say...

586
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:20,178
...we go rediscover friendship?

587
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,337
Come on, let me get a lollipop.

588
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,215
Hey.

589
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,380
You're not so happy anymore,
are you?

590
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,498
Boobies!

591
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,022
What planet are you from, Cody?

592
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:11,019
Do you see what I am dealing with,
Dr. Dwayne?

593
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,462
I mean, his teachers think
he's a mental case.

594
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:16,744
Liz Anne, help is on the way,
my friend.

595
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:20,582
Just for you,
a copy of my latest and greatest:

596
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:25,025
Earth to Mom, What to do
When Your Kid Thinks He's an Alien.

597
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:29,783
And if all else fails, you can use it
to knock something loose.

598
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:34,059
"Cloozy, cleazy, clucky" that.

599
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,058
Buy my book.

600
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,587
Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody calm down, calm down.

601
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,659
All right, who needs a napkin?

602
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,626
You make me wanna scream...

603
00:37:15,787 --> 00:37:17,345
...and pull my hair out
and just go:

604
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,266
I'll take one.

605
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:43,379
I got a peanut butter dog.
Do you want one of those?

606
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:45,139
Got it right.

607
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:48,140
Don't forget. Wyatt's Wieners,
you can't beat them.

608
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,021
- We did real good today, guys.
- I'm pretty happy.

609
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:09,259
Man, this day
could not get any better.

610
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,338
Hi, boys.

611
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:13,106
Can we have a hot dog?

612
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,905
You know, I don't know if we have--

613
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,183
You know, we have three left,
actually.

614
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:20,305
- Perfect.
- Yes, you are.

615
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:24,304
Why are you guys so wet?

616
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:27,504
Well, we all got dumped yesterday
by our boyfriends.

617
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,262
What better way to get over things
than to go on the log flume.

618
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:34,180
That is such an awesome plan.

619
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,863
We also wanted to make out
with some guys...

620
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:39,495
...so we could feel better
about ourselves.

621
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,737
Would you guys be okay with that?

622
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:47,295
- One second.
- Yeah, just one minute.

623
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:51,586
We accept your offer. Begin.

624
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:24,303
You want your gum back?
Because--

625
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,537
I'll keep it.

626
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,543
Bless you.

627
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:47,782
Wet girls.

628
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,817
All right, boys, we should be
in Flaglestown by 8.

629
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:55,185
Not if you continue to drive 30
miles an hour, man. Come on.

630
00:39:57,947 --> 00:40:00,381
- Move your wiener.
- That's illegal.

631
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:02,981
Hey. Tuck your ass in, old lady.

632
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,141
Wyatt, why are old people passing us?
What is going on?

633
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:09,458
I don't know. The pedal
must be busted. I'm flooring it.

634
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:12,266
Could it be that your gas tank
is on empty?

635
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:14,580
Crap.

636
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,425
Hey, slow up there-- Jesus Christ.

637
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,942
All right, all right, all right.

638
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:23,665
Come on, witch--

639
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,818
Hey, lady.

640
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,307
Hey. Gotta stop.

641
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,016
Come on-- This is bullshit.

642
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:43,545
Calm down,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

643
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,901
Hey, we got an RV, boys.

644
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,342
What makes you think
an RV is gonna pick us up?

645
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:49,225
Come on, man, we surrender.

646
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,264
Hey, he's stopping.

647
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,224
He's stopping, come on.

648
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,700
He's stopping.

649
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:58,459
Hey, he's stopping.

650
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,140
- Oh, man.
- He's stopping.

651
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,377
He's stopping.

652
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,576
I'm Felicia Applebaum,
and that's my husband Frank.

653
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,146
- Oh, I'm Wyatt.
- I'm Ben.

654
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:08,820
I'm Joel.

655
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:13,460
Hey, this is nice.

656
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:16,699
Hey, it's just like having the kids
in the car again.

657
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,858
No, we just really appreciate
the ride.

658
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:21,939
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, nonsense. Happy we can help out.

659
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,938
So where are you guys from?

660
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,938
- From Chitown, Joel.
- Chicago.

661
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:28,177
- The Windy City.
- Cool.

662
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:31,862
But now we are just touring
God's green earth.

663
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,346
It's the life, boys.

664
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:36,579
No commitments, we go wherever
we want, whenever we want.

665
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:37,896
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

666
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:39,102
Cool.

667
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:41,986
Me and the missus, we've made
love in 34 states.

668
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:46,626
We're driving along,
we get a hankering, we pull over...

669
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:49,426
...right there in the back seat,
where you're sitting.

670
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,737
Might be some stains back there.

671
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:53,420
- I cleaned them.
- Oh, yeah.

672
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:56,226
We collected a decal
from every state we've made it in.

673
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:59,857
Yeah, we got decals from 34 states,
and the District of Columbia.

674
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:04,143
The Washington Monument,
sticking straight up in the air?

675
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,587
Hey, those tourists'll never forget it.

676
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,056
Are you guys hungry?

677
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:13,900
Oh, I've got some trail mix, okay.

678
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:18,902
And I've got some homemade
dried apricots.

679
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,581
Frank here bought me a dehydrator
for our anniversary.

680
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,736
- Just the one.
- Okay.

681
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,058
- Okay.
- Thanks.

682
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:31,945
Who wants a treat?

683
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,586
Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.

684
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:35,658
Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.

685
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:37,704
Give Daddy a kiss.

686
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:42,660
Down, girl, down. Down.
It's okay.

687
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,136
Daddy'll give you a bone later.

688
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:48,705
Oh, yeah, the kids loved that one.

689
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:50,899
How many kids do you have?

690
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,023
Three boys. Three tigers.

691
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:55,417
Yes, sir, they know their way
around the ladies.

692
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:59,182
Yeah, our oldest, Carl, he lost
his virginity when he was 16.

693
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:01,417
- Back of a Chevy.
- No, honey, that was Bob.

694
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:04,340
Carl was down in the basement
on top of the dirty clothes.

695
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:07,419
Oh, yeah. Jesus, screaming,
all that noise.

696
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:10,863
- I thought the cat was in heat.
- Oh, I know. We don't have a cat.

697
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:17,105
So have you guys
been to the festival before?

698
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:19,337
No, I've never been to Flaglestown.

699
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:21,259
Yeah, us too. Us too, us too.

700
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,540
Virgin territory for me
and my freaky-deaky.

701
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,937
Oh, my gosh.

702
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:29,737
- Yes.
- We might have to christen it?

703
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,863
- I hope so. I'm so ready.
- Ready?

704
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,346
- Right now.
- All right.

705
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:35,896
- Somebody grab the wheel.
- No! No, no, no!

706
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:38,782
Oh, I'm watching old people do it.

707
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:02,023
And again, you have our number
if you need a place to crash.

708
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,099
Hey, hey, but be prepared.

709
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,735
There might be da noise
and or da funk...

710
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,625
...being brought in tonight.

711
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,699
Look at you, you are so hip.

712
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,936
Oh, wait, hey, you got some of
my soft serve on your chin there.

713
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:21,416
You're so sweet, you're so sweet.
Bye.

714
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,343
I'm a lucky guy.

715
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,544
I mean, you know...

716
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:48,016
...at least we got a place to crash.

717
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,705
Are you nuts?

718
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:53,222
That was the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

719
00:44:53,387 --> 00:44:54,376
Really?

720
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:57,141
Even more disgusting
than that time we caught your dad...

721
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,696
-...in the tub tugging his myagi?
- He was scratching.

722
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,698
Didn't know you could
scratch like this.

723
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,095
Shut up.

724
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,065
We agreed that he was--

725
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:11,976
Dude, do you have my wallet?

726
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:15,219
What's that, a black thing?
I ain't got your wallet.

727
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,822
- You got my wallet?
- No.

728
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:20,059
Hey, barfy.

729
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,619
Do you have our wallets?

730
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:24,460
Oh, man, what--?

731
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,619
No, no. Hey.
No, don't bother, don't bother.

732
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,539
What the hell?

733
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:32,622
Wet girls.

734
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:35,018
We accept your offer. Begin.

735
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:53,140
Unbelievable.

736
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:56,897
I am gonna find those wet bitches
if it's the last thing I do.

737
00:45:57,067 --> 00:45:58,182
Oh, yeah?

738
00:45:58,347 --> 00:45:59,860
Oh, yeah?

739
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:01,745
How are you gonna go
about doing that?

740
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,296
I gotta pee.

741
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,822
I'll drive across this state
50 times if I have to.

742
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:07,784
Really? We need
to make money tonight.

743
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:10,381
Instead of giving out hot dogs,
we're selling them.

744
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,936
- No. I took an oath.
- You didn't take an oath, retard.

745
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:15,575
I did take an oath,
with myself, oka--?

746
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:17,624
You don't know everything.

747
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,745
Okay, what's your great idea?

748
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:26,175
Oh, my gosh.

749
00:46:30,547 --> 00:46:32,378
Hey, Timmy O'Shaemus?

750
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:34,583
Don't you live down the block?

751
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:36,226
I go where I'm needed, mister.

752
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:37,456
That's great.

753
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:41,222
- Can you spare some change?
- Oh, Timmy, my wallet--

754
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:43,582
- I am strapped for cash.
- You're a real douche.

755
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,738
And you have a small dick.

756
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,506
What the--?

757
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,059
Timmy?

758
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,057
- I told you what the plan is.
- No, you didn't.

759
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,785
- Yes, I did.
- No.

760
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,620
- Why are you provoking me?
- Check this out.

761
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:01,415
It's perfect.

762
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,259
You shopping for thongs
or something?

763
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:06,464
Thongs? What? No-- Oh, no.
No, no, no.

764
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:09,346
Hot bod competition.
For buff boy here.

765
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:11,657
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

766
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:13,943
You know that I don't like
competitive stuff.

767
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,496
He forgot to read the fine print,
$1 0 entry fee.

768
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,623
We don't have cash,
last time I checked.

769
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:21,255
Crap, we need $1 0?

770
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,660
Are you Wyatt Fabio Goldstein?

771
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:29,301
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you for 15 years.

772
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:30,866
Here you go.

773
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:33,587
I finally can retire now.
That was my last delivery.

774
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:35,385
I'm free.

775
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:39,381
Vacations, singles cruises,
Club Med, Hawaii.

776
00:47:39,547 --> 00:47:41,822
I've got my whole life ahead of me.

777
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:45,024
Life begins today.

778
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:51,501
What is it?

779
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,702
I don't know.

780
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:56,496
It looks like it's a card or something
from my nana.

781
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:00,224
"Happy Birthday, Wy-Wy,
you're a perfect 10.

782
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:02,503
Don't spend it all in one place."

783
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:06,019
Good old Nana.

784
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,818
I love her.

785
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,784
Candy's on me, boys. No king-size.

786
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:15,498
Wait. Did you actually count that?
Yeah, that's 10. Here you go.

787
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,659
Bingo. You're in. All right.

788
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:20,624
We'll get more.
We'll get more.

789
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:23,426
- I hate you both.
- You better win.

790
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:36,146
He's kind of hot.

791
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,060
Yeah.

792
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:40,425
But he's got that beer gut.

793
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,659
No, no, no. No competition.

794
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:48,663
Yeah, have a couple more beers,
there, cowboy.

795
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,419
Good idea.

796
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:53,259
You suck.

797
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,417
I smell booty.

798
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:03,426
Keep your fucking eye on the ball,
Benny.

799
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:07,456
Run.

800
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:09,982
Run like you got an ex-con
on your ass.

801
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,025
Take control. You're a defender,
for Christ's sake.

802
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,540
Kick him in the damn shin.

803
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:17,267
Hey, defence, you suck. Losers.

804
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:20,507
Hey, Mom,
can I have some Gatorade?

805
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,022
No. You stop fucking up
on the field out there...

806
00:49:23,187 --> 00:49:26,816
...and you can have some Gatorade.
Get out there and kill those bastards.

807
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:28,420
Come on, hustle.

808
00:49:29,627 --> 00:49:31,618
Come on. Come on.

809
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:38,778
- What are you doing, man? Get ready.
- Come on. It's time to grease up.

810
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,580
Come on, man, snap out of it.

811
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:45,706
No, Mommy, no more games.

812
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,784
I don't wanna play anymore.

813
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:52,457
- Hey!
- Ben?

814
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:54,106
What we gonna do for money?

815
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:57,145
No. No. I'm not gonna--
Get out of the way! Get out!

816
00:49:57,307 --> 00:49:59,343
No, you should know better.
Watch out.

817
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:02,540
Get out, move, watch it.

818
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:04,857
He's got a tail like--

819
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,817
Oh, where is fire?

820
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:10,547
Where is forest fire?

821
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:12,022
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

822
00:50:12,187 --> 00:50:13,700
Let me help you up.

823
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:22,544
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to--
I didn't-- Are you okay?

824
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:25,267
I am fine. But I am built like ox.

825
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:27,736
You are frail like mosquito.

826
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:30,383
What is your name?

827
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:33,619
- I'm Ben.
- Ben.

828
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:36,176
My name is Walrus Boy.
Nice to meet you.

829
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:39,225
Why you run around here
like scared banshee from hellfire?

830
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:42,981
I was gonna do
the hot bod competition.

831
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:45,786
Brilliant! I am on my way there now.

832
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:47,983
The Countess Carlotta
will be there...

833
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:50,707
...and I plan on stealing a kiss
from her tonight.

834
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,142
- Come on. Let us go.
- No. You don't understand.

835
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:55,582
- I don't wanna be in the competition.
- Why not?

836
00:50:55,747 --> 00:50:59,137
- You have hot bod.
- Well, I appreciate that.

837
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,377
- Yeah.
- But no. I can't.

838
00:51:01,547 --> 00:51:03,617
- I don't compete. My mother--
- Say no more.

839
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,857
Walrus Boy know that tune.

840
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:08,776
- Come sit on my bails.
- Okay.

841
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,986
I have story to tell you, Ben.

842
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:14,138
The story of a boy.

843
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:17,822
Born with flipper. He did not have
wiggly fingers like other boys.

844
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:20,899
He made fun of.

845
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:25,060
He pelted with rocks.
He was even urinated on, Ben.

846
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,345
Pissed on.

847
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:29,585
But now--

848
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:32,739
That boy is famous
Walrus Boy actor.

849
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:36,946
And that actor would be you?

850
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:39,706
Of course it is me, Ben.

851
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,904
It's me, Walrus Boy.
I famous actor.

852
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,295
Let me tell you something.

853
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,935
The reason I am successful.

854
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:51,259
I take negative past
and turn into positive future.

855
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,944
The point is, Ben...

856
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:59,943
...never let the evil of the past
poison the fruit of your present.

857
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:09,458
Stupid. What a waste of 10 bucks.

858
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,380
Hey, man,
I said we could have had candy.

859
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:16,982
Hand me that butter.

860
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:21,821
Wait a second. Does this mean
that I'm not gonna--?

861
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,700
Whatever.

862
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:26,940
Let's do this.

863
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:34,576
What's with the fat guy?

864
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:52,256
Yeah!

865
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,265
Yes! We won!

866
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,464
- I won!
- We won! Yes! We won!

867
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:32,625
- Yeah. Yes. We won!
- We won.

868
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:36,826
Look, I'm smoking, guys.
I don't know what to say.

869
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:38,466
Thanks, everybody.

870
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:42,905
Thank you, Flaglestown
and good night.

871
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:45,581
Man, you were awesome.

872
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,578
That hippity-hopping around
on the stage.

873
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:49,783
- I didn't know you had it in you.
- Me neither.

874
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:52,620
I owe it to Walrus Boy for showing me
to stand up for myself.

875
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:53,981
Walrus Boy?

876
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:55,546
You know him?

877
00:54:55,707 --> 00:54:57,504
I just talked to him about
an hour ago.

878
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:59,498
I didn't get a chance to thank him.

879
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,386
He died in '46.

880
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:09,343
I'm just messing with you.
We play Hold 'Em on Wednesdays.

881
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,021
I'll tell him you said thanks.

882
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:15,824
So we got the best suite
Flaglestown has to offer.

883
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:19,582
Excuse me. Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were amazing out there.

884
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:21,703
Your body is ripped-tastic.

885
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:25,223
Hey, thanks, man.

886
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,264
Will you sign my pecs?

887
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:29,584
Absolutely.

888
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:32,337
- It's Barri but with an I.
- Oh, all right.

889
00:55:32,507 --> 00:55:36,500
All right. Here. B--
That's an awesome name, man.

890
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,057
- I'll just use your nipple to dot the I.
- Nice.

891
00:55:40,867 --> 00:55:42,664
Stay firm.

892
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:45,022
Know what I'm talking about? Ben.

893
00:55:45,187 --> 00:55:48,065
- That's a nice six-pack there, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, man.

894
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:50,536
- But I'd kill for these.
- Oh, dude. Come on, man.

895
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:52,538
- Nice to meet you.
- You keep it firm.

896
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:55,062
Yeah, man, abs not flabs,
you know what I mean?

897
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,024
Stay off the sugar.
Sugar's the enemy.

898
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,257
Yeah, man. No carbs.

899
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:03,223
Man. You are like a celebrity
around here.

900
00:56:03,387 --> 00:56:06,584
That's so awesome.
You are like a gay celebrity.

901
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:08,419
- What?
- Yeah, that was pretty gay.

902
00:56:08,587 --> 00:56:10,976
You guys touching abs
and stuff like that. That was--

903
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,741
I wonder if he's the prize
at the gay booth?

904
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:16,944
- Could you sign me?
- Yeah, could you sign my abs?

905
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,541
Do something with my belly button.
Do something fun.

906
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:21,663
- You got nice abs.
- No, you have the hotness.

907
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:23,465
Are you guys-- Are you children?

908
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,016
You couple of ass clowns,
you're both pathetic.

909
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:28,701
You're pathetic slobs.

910
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,138
Mama told me she liked my belly.

911
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,377
It's prosthetic.

912
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:37,060
- That means rubber.
- Yeah.

913
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,060
And I get phantom pains, it itches.

914
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:42,138
You know,
sometimes I think it was God...

915
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:46,061
...made me drink that Jägermeister,
stick my arm in that concrete mixer.

916
00:56:46,227 --> 00:56:49,856
So stupid. I don't know what I did,
it must've been real bad.

917
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:52,416
- I don't know, it's--
- Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

918
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:55,340
Son, listen to me for just a second.

919
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,657
People get sick of hearing
about your stories.

920
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,262
Don't wanna hear them
stupid stories no more.

921
00:57:00,427 --> 00:57:02,463
Yeah, I got your arm.
Yeah, I got your arm.

922
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,777
I'm gonna keep your arm too.
I'm gonna keep it.

923
00:57:13,587 --> 00:57:15,942
What smells like corn on the cob?

924
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:24,977
You still wearing that butter?

925
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:28,061
Yeah. I like the way it feels on me.

926
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,539
What's happening to you?

927
00:57:32,707 --> 00:57:35,858
Guys, remember when I said I had
a surprise for you in New Mexico?

928
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,986
- No.
- No.

929
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:39,500
Oh, I forgot.

930
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:42,386
I have a surprise for you
in New Mexico.

931
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:44,902
I'll give you a hint: Sixth grade.

932
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,145
Miss Isaac?

933
00:57:47,307 --> 00:57:49,662
- Hottest teacher ever.
- You're kidding, right?

934
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,419
No, remember
when she used to say...

935
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:53,782
...she would quit it all
and move to New Mexico?

936
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:56,336
- Yeah.
- Well, colour me Google...

937
00:57:56,507 --> 00:58:00,500
...because I found her on the Internet.
And I told her we'll be driving through.

938
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:03,380
Miss Isaac.

939
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:17,506
Parallelogram.

940
00:58:23,827 --> 00:58:26,421
Miss Boobies.

941
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:39,825
I've dreamt about this day for years.

942
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:43,062
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?

943
00:58:52,347 --> 00:58:54,065
Look who it is.

944
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:59,096
I never thought I'd see
you little birds again.

945
00:59:00,107 --> 00:59:01,381
Bet you missed these.

946
00:59:04,547 --> 00:59:07,107
- Miss Isaac?
- Who else do you think it is, dumbass?

947
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,417
Give me a squeeze.

948
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:15,941
Well, Wyatt, I see you still got
that twisted hot dog obsession, huh?

949
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,580
Nice.

950
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:22,140
Don't stand there like a bunch
of boners, lunch is on in five.

951
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:23,660
Come on.

952
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,702
Thank you for ruining
my sixth grade fantasy.

953
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:33,576
- She's so disgusting.
- Guys, she's still a person.

954
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,106
Is she?

955
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:40,703
It's hot as crotch out here.
I'm sweating my balls off.

956
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:43,062
You know what you boys need?

957
00:59:43,227 --> 00:59:46,139
A Mexican blowjob.

958
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,736
- A what?
- Mexican blowjob.

959
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,705
Tequila, whipped cream.

960
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,423
Tequila?

961
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:55,622
It's 11:30.

962
00:59:55,787 --> 00:59:58,779
- You know, for me that's early--
- Yeah, I mean, it's--

963
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,017
That's too early for--

964
01:00:01,187 --> 01:00:03,860
- Down the hatch.
- Okay. One shot.

965
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:05,346
Yeah.

966
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:08,496
That really gets you going.

967
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:11,420
- Come on, bitches.
- Miss Isaac, I really shouldn't.

968
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:13,020
I'm driving.

969
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:15,906
We all need to be alert
because we're all navigators.

970
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:17,705
We need to keep our eyes
on the road.

971
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,619
Wise words.
But do I want to get drunk?

972
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:22,984
I wanna get drunk,
but we gotta go, so....

973
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:25,980
Fine, you pansies. Fine.

974
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:32,701
- You don't need--
- Careful with your teeth.

975
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,419
How many was that?

976
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:47,259
I think that was five.

977
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:49,702
Five.

978
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,379
Time for lunch, eses.

979
01:00:54,427 --> 01:00:58,466
Hope you like egg salad,
it's my speciality.

980
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:00,665
All right.

981
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:04,942
That's a really healthy way
to prepare that.

982
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:08,665
So you live by yourself out here?

983
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:12,103
Ever since that rat bastard left me
for the gas station slut.

984
01:01:12,267 --> 01:01:15,065
Hope she likes wearing the ball gag.

985
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:16,979
I don't miss that.

986
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,657
Well, you know what they say...

987
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:23,704
...that every cloud....

988
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:27,546
That every cloud has....

989
01:01:28,587 --> 01:01:29,861
Something.

990
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:32,700
So now it's just me and my Benny...

991
01:01:33,507 --> 01:01:36,260
...named after my favourite student.

992
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:40,257
Come to Mama, Benny.

993
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:44,906
How's life treating you boys?

994
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:49,816
Just fine, I guess.

995
01:01:50,347 --> 01:01:52,986
Well, it was nice
to visit your old teach.

996
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:54,739
You haven't changed a bit.

997
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,305
You, either?

998
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,139
Yeah, right.

999
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:17,945
How do you
like living out here by yourself?

1000
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:21,338
- Are you happy out here?
- What is not to love, you know?

1001
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:23,862
I am living
like a New Mexican queen.

1002
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,024
Enough, all right? Enough.

1003
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:32,181
Any who, guess what I made
you boys for dessert?

1004
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:34,537
Tapioca pudding.

1005
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:38,777
And I made it
with my own two hands.

1006
01:02:40,867 --> 01:02:43,779
I think I ate that sandwich
too fast. It was tasty.

1007
01:02:43,947 --> 01:02:45,778
- We gotta go. I just realised.
- Yeah.

1008
01:02:45,947 --> 01:02:48,415
- We're on the clock.
- I thought this was a booty call--

1009
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:52,385
Miss Isaac?

1010
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:54,937
- What the hell just happened?
- Is she dead?

1011
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:56,096
I don't know.

1012
01:02:56,267 --> 01:02:59,418
- And I don't wanna find out.
- I've never checked a pulse.

1013
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:03,257
- Get it, touch her wrist.
- I don't wanna--

1014
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:09,626
- She's back.
- That narcolepsy's a bitch.

1015
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,302
Sometimes I'm out for a few seconds,
sometimes a few hours.

1016
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:15,219
I better say goodbye
to you boys now.

1017
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:16,456
Once they start--

1018
01:03:18,147 --> 01:03:20,183
Dude, what the hell
is wrong with this lady?

1019
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,178
We are leaving right now.
Right.

1020
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:26,181
Well, I mean, should we, well,
I guess she said goodbye.

1021
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:28,861
Yeah, she said goodbye.
We're saying goodbye right now.

1022
01:03:29,027 --> 01:03:30,938
Thank you for lunch, Miss Isaac,
bye-bye.

1023
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,506
Thanks, Miss Isaac.
Bye-bye.

1024
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,578
You can't just leave her here
like this.

1025
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:37,466
- Just get in and shut up!
- Ben.

1026
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:41,260
Let me just-- I'll just put something
underneath so she--

1027
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:44,066
At least she doesn't hurt her head
or anything.

1028
01:03:44,227 --> 01:03:46,058
Oh, God.

1029
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:48,944
Oh, God, no.

1030
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,096
Wyatt.

1031
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:56,016
Come on, come on.

1032
01:03:56,187 --> 01:03:57,302
Hurry!

1033
01:03:58,147 --> 01:03:58,374
I still can't believe
that's the same person.

1034
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:00,224
I still can't believe
that's the same person.

1035
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:02,582
Yeah, she was pretty narsty.

1036
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,783
I don't think I can jerk off
to her anymore.

1037
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:06,778
You don't think?

1038
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:08,539
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, man.

1039
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:11,699
- Antacid?
- What, you nervous or something?

1040
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,901
No, it's just that-- Come on.

1041
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:18,776
I thought since we was a couple
days away you was getting nervous.

1042
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:20,455
What? No.

1043
01:04:20,627 --> 01:04:23,187
No, no, that's funny, though,
that's funny.

1044
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:25,224
No, it's--

1045
01:04:25,387 --> 01:04:27,503
It's a couple days away.

1046
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,139
Well, that's good.

1047
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:35,025
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go.

1048
01:05:00,427 --> 01:05:03,100
Help me, Wyatt.

1049
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,702
Don't put on too much gel, damn it.

1050
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:35,576
You need to lose
some of that extra weight.

1051
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:39,342
I don't like looking at your rolls
when I'm getting my makeup done.

1052
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:44,183
No one should have to watch
that shit jiggle.

1053
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:48,782
Who the hell is that in my studio?

1054
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:05,945
I think it's time to shut you up.

1055
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:08,618
Permanently.

1056
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:20,702
Dwayne.

1057
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:30,942
Joel, you're shaking
in your boots, son.

1058
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:34,816
And I bet right about now,
your palms are sweatier...

1059
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:39,503
...than a fat man's ass crack
on a hot Georgia day.

1060
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:45,219
Oh, Joel, even in your dreams...

1061
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:50,177
...you're a pathetic coward!

1062
01:06:50,347 --> 01:06:53,737
It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.

1063
01:06:53,907 --> 01:06:56,865
I can tell you miss the smell
in your dumb ass face.

1064
01:07:04,147 --> 01:07:06,377
You can't beat me, Joel.

1065
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:08,777
I'm a PhD doctor, son.

1066
01:07:46,787 --> 01:07:48,618
Where's Joel?

1067
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:51,502
Hey.

1068
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,225
What?

1069
01:07:53,627 --> 01:07:55,538
Where's Joel?

1070
01:07:57,547 --> 01:07:59,265
What the--?

1071
01:08:00,427 --> 01:08:02,463
There's a note on my chest.

1072
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,385
Look at this.

1073
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:14,424
"Guys, I'm really sorry to do this...."

1074
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:16,225
But I have to go home.

1075
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:19,823
I just can't take the chance
of getting humiliated again.

1076
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:22,103
This whole thing was a mistake.

1077
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:26,055
I've taken 300 bucks
and I'm gonna buy a bus ticket.

1078
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,296
I'm sorry.

1079
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,980
"Joel."

1080
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:33,579
Wyatt, we have to find him.

1081
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:36,026
All right, Wyatt, let's go.

1082
01:08:36,187 --> 01:08:38,576
- Here you go.
- Why don't you pick up your bag--?

1083
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,260
I'm sorry.

1084
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,698
Where do you think you're going?

1085
01:08:46,227 --> 01:08:48,297
Oh, I'm fine.

1086
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,106
Are you all right?

1087
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,820
Bathroom's where I say it is.

1088
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:15,615
What are you looking at?

1089
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,541
- Me?
- Joel, it's me, Timmy.

1090
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:21,175
Timmy O'Shaemus
from down the block.

1091
01:09:21,347 --> 01:09:22,336
You remember.

1092
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:25,021
Timmy, he has too many demons.

1093
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:27,985
Joel, don't give up. Fight him.

1094
01:09:28,147 --> 01:09:30,377
You've gotta fight him.

1095
01:09:47,107 --> 01:09:48,506
Grape fizz burp.

1096
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,977
I'm sure you miss the smell
of those in your dumb ass face.

1097
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:56,420
- Drake?
- Who else would it be, stupid bitch?

1098
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,460
No.

1099
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:03,425
No. Leave me alone,
leave me alone.

1100
01:10:03,587 --> 01:10:05,657
- Leave me alone.
- Where are you going, loser?

1101
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,216
Where you going, loser?

1102
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:17,936
Oh, God.

1103
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:20,066
Where are you going?

1104
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:22,422
Relax and enjoy the show,
vagina face.

1105
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,901
Hey, toolbox, why you digging
in the garbage?

1106
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,659
You looking for your filthy mother?

1107
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,580
No. I'm reducing,
reusing and recycling.

1108
01:10:33,747 --> 01:10:35,783
Mrs. Yazel lets me leave
Math-a-letes early.

1109
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:37,175
I'm in the Recycling Club.

1110
01:10:37,347 --> 01:10:40,020
You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche bag.

1111
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,143
You're about to join
the Smashed Face Club.

1112
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:45,379
No, Drake. See, I don't
wanna join the Smashed Face Club.

1113
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:47,096
It's entertaining.

1114
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:51,105
Oh, saved by the bell, huh?

1115
01:10:51,987 --> 01:10:55,297
- Oh, God.
- Or should I say burned by it.

1116
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:02,585
All right, nothing to see here.

1117
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:04,220
Oh, this is my favourite part.

1118
01:11:04,387 --> 01:11:06,457
- You remember.
- Pull your pants up.

1119
01:11:09,027 --> 01:11:11,541
Oh, what, like none of you guys
have ever farted before?

1120
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:13,857
Oh, my God, look.

1121
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:17,343
Gross, it wasn't just a fart.

1122
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:23,025
Poo pants, poo pants,
poo pants, poo pants.

1123
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:25,782
Oh, I hated that name.

1124
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:27,819
It's a good name.

1125
01:11:47,107 --> 01:11:48,984
Never again.

1126
01:11:49,747 --> 01:11:53,137
Never again!

1127
01:11:57,707 --> 01:12:00,380
Pucker up, pussycats.

1128
01:12:02,107 --> 01:12:03,699
Now who's the meat?

1129
01:12:04,547 --> 01:12:07,903
Hold it right there, you damn,
dirty hippies.

1130
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:10,137
There'll be no branding today.

1131
01:12:13,907 --> 01:12:15,579
He had to go.

1132
01:12:28,627 --> 01:12:29,980
Welcome back.

1133
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:39,099
Sorry I took so long, boys.

1134
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:20,063
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1135
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:22,505
That's right.

1136
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,817
- Good work, guys.
- Yes, sir.

1137
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:27,296
- What got into you?
- Right?

1138
01:13:27,467 --> 01:13:29,583
That was awesome, man.

1139
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:31,300
Let's go.

1140
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:35,301
If we ride through the night,
we can reach L.A. by daybreak.

1141
01:13:36,187 --> 01:13:38,781
It was a good thing we had all
that climbing rope handy.

1142
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,415
Yeah, I heard that.

1143
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,538
Guys. Guys, look.

1144
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:10,786
Hollywood, Hollywood.

1145
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,507
Ninety-one exit. Next exit.

1146
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:15,623
- Oh, my goodness.
- We made it. Hey, Joel...

1147
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:17,379
...I wanna see you kick serious ass.

1148
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:18,866
- The smack is on.
- Absolutely.

1149
01:14:19,027 --> 01:14:21,621
- Down.
- The smack is down, uptown.

1150
01:14:21,787 --> 01:14:23,698
I was wondering, is it illegal?

1151
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,301
Is that a crime?
You know what I'm saying?

1152
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:29,186
- Could I go to jail for kicking his ass?
- Absolutely not.

1153
01:14:29,347 --> 01:14:32,384
I think revenge is actually legal
in America, so....

1154
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:48,660
Good morning, ma'am.
See your driver's licence?

1155
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,575
Where we going, gentlemen?

1156
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:52,624
It's all right.
I'm here to see Dr. Dwayne.

1157
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:54,743
- I know him.
- You and the rest of America.

1158
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,499
You got any tickets?

1159
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:58,737
Not technically,
no, we don't have tickets.

1160
01:14:58,907 --> 01:15:00,863
Tough break, kid,
I wish I could help you.

1161
01:15:01,027 --> 01:15:02,426
- Now get lost.
- What?

1162
01:15:02,587 --> 01:15:03,736
- State your name.
- What?

1163
01:15:03,907 --> 01:15:06,296
State your name.
State your name and purpose.

1164
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,020
What are you--?

1165
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:12,025
Oh, my God! She--!

1166
01:15:12,187 --> 01:15:14,337
What kind of officer are you, man?

1167
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:15,496
Jesus!

1168
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:19,662
My God, that woman is still twitching.

1169
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:21,818
Jeez, what the hell do we do now?

1170
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:25,939
Hi there.

1171
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:30,022
Sorry, I wanted to actually come over
and apologise...

1172
01:15:30,187 --> 01:15:31,700
...for what had happened earlier.

1173
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:34,097
We might have got off
on the wrong foot. I'm Ben.

1174
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:35,859
- Jim.
- Nice to meet you, Jim.

1175
01:15:36,027 --> 01:15:38,587
Listen, we're not here to break in
to anywhere...

1176
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:42,820
...we're not trying to do anything
wrong. We wanna spread happiness.

1177
01:15:42,987 --> 01:15:45,945
Happiness in the form
of a good wiener.

1178
01:15:51,587 --> 01:15:55,500
Maybe you'd like a little mustard,
a little ketchup, a little meat.

1179
01:16:09,827 --> 01:16:11,704
You're reaching
for your winter parka...

1180
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,062
...and it's the Fourth of July, okay?

1181
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:18,778
You can't see the flame from
the firecracker, and you know what?

1182
01:16:18,947 --> 01:16:21,507
You are about to blow.

1183
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:23,578
Do you understand me when
I use the word--?

1184
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:24,975
You.

1185
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:35,540
I'll kill you, Dwayne.

1186
01:16:39,427 --> 01:16:41,065
Well, well, well.

1187
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:42,706
Boys.

1188
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,823
- Joel.
- Dr. Dwayne?

1189
01:16:44,987 --> 01:16:46,659
There's two of them.

1190
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:48,419
I knew it.

1191
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:53,060
Joel, meet decoy. Decoy, meet Joel.

1192
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:58,497
I'm getting paid, y'all.

1193
01:17:00,587 --> 01:17:02,179
You know, you can't be too careful.

1194
01:17:02,347 --> 01:17:04,861
I heard about you
after your incident at the gate...

1195
01:17:05,027 --> 01:17:08,019
...so I sent decoy out
to do the show, just in case.

1196
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:11,020
That thing on your face
is nasty, son.

1197
01:17:11,187 --> 01:17:13,018
Don't look at me, son,
don't look at me.

1198
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:17,180
It's okay, everyone. Okay? I'm okay.

1199
01:17:21,307 --> 01:17:23,423
We'll take care of this right away,
Dr. Dwayne.

1200
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:25,179
Get your hands off of me.

1201
01:17:25,347 --> 01:17:26,462
Wait a second, Dwayne.

1202
01:17:26,627 --> 01:17:28,822
I came here to say something
and I'm gonna say it.

1203
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:33,138
Okay, boys, keep them rolling.

1204
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:35,662
So, Joel...

1205
01:17:35,827 --> 01:17:37,055
...what's on your mind?

1206
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:39,582
My girlfriend dumped me.

1207
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:41,738
I lost my job.

1208
01:17:42,707 --> 01:17:47,861
I lived on chips for months.
My life fell to shit because of you.

1209
01:17:49,587 --> 01:17:50,576
Joel.

1210
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:53,864
You make my toes perspire,
they're so warm and toasty...

1211
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:57,303
...from the fire inside of you.
And you know what that means?

1212
01:17:57,467 --> 01:17:59,139
It means you're a man now.

1213
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,616
It means that you have
faced your fears.

1214
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:06,417
It means you overcame
Drake Hanswald.

1215
01:18:08,947 --> 01:18:11,700
Wait. What?
How did you know that?

1216
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:15,303
I'm a PhD doctor, son, you can't eat
the onion without peeling it.

1217
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:21,064
I mean, if you think about it,
getting dumped, what I did for you:

1218
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:23,616
Best thing in the world.

1219
01:18:25,107 --> 01:18:26,745
Right?

1220
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,777
Oh, my God.

1221
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:34,785
You're right.

1222
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:44,858
I think you changed my life
for the better.

1223
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,536
Yes.

1224
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:47,981
Yes.

1225
01:18:48,147 --> 01:18:52,265
Release that prisoner.
Release him to my arms.

1226
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:03,224
Now. Wyatt Fabio Goldstein.

1227
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,056
Yeah, what--?

1228
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:07,661
What's happening, Dr. Dwayne?

1229
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,897
Rejected 12 times.

1230
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:13,579
That is a whole heap of rejection.

1231
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:19,344
But now, it's surprise time
right here on the Dr. Dwayne Show.

1232
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:23,902
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

1233
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:28,185
...Cornelius Worthington III.

1234
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:36,701
How are you, Wyatt? Okay.

1235
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,495
Hey, you're that junkie
from behind the dumpster.

1236
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:41,817
Guilty as charged.

1237
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:43,825
Yeah, that was me, everyone.

1238
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:47,423
Down on my luck,
hopped up on gack...

1239
01:19:47,587 --> 01:19:51,500
...urinating on myself
just to feel my legs.

1240
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:53,420
But you saved me.

1241
01:19:53,587 --> 01:19:56,784
You saved me with a hot dog
and a smile.

1242
01:19:56,947 --> 01:20:00,337
- I thank you for it, Wyatt.
- No-- No problem, junkie man.

1243
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:01,936
Mr. Worthington.

1244
01:20:02,107 --> 01:20:04,416
Hey, cut it out, Wyatt.

1245
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:05,906
Let's cut to the chase.

1246
01:20:06,107 --> 01:20:08,416
I wanna finance Wyatt's Wieners.

1247
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:10,225
- Really? Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

1248
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:13,618
- I'm dead serious.
- Cornelius Worthington III!

1249
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:16,745
Mama, I got money.
Mama, I got money.

1250
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:19,819
You all see that? Surprises
and dreams come true...

1251
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,421
...right here
on the Dr. Dwayne Show.

1252
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:27,377
Gosh darn it, I feel like I just
peeked up the tooth fairy's skirt...

1253
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:30,141
...and poured myself
a plate of lasagna.

1254
01:20:30,307 --> 01:20:33,219
That's how I feel.

1255
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:35,981
Tin Man, I bet you got
some fire to get off...

1256
01:20:36,147 --> 01:20:38,138
...that perfectly sculpted chest.

1257
01:20:40,947 --> 01:20:42,460
You know what?

1258
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:44,703
You know what, Dr. Dwayne?
I think I do.

1259
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:47,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Ben.

1260
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:50,335
- Hi, Ben.
- Listen, I've realised a lot on this trip...

1261
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:54,819
...with my best friends, but the one
thing that I'm realising the most...

1262
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:57,421
...is that this whole rat race...

1263
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,942
...this circus that we call life...

1264
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:02,143
...it's really all about love.
I-O-V-E.

1265
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:08,824
And it doesn't matter if you love
someone that's white or black.

1266
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:11,181
Whether you love a girl...

1267
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:13,822
...or you love a man.

1268
01:21:21,467 --> 01:21:22,536
Thank you.

1269
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,504
Now, that is some insightful chatter,
Ben.

1270
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,857
Well, audience.

1271
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:34,178
There's a moonbeam full
of pleasure in the unexpected.

1272
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,383
But if you wanna make it
across that pond...

1273
01:21:36,547 --> 01:21:38,742
...don't let the fear
of hypothermia keep you...

1274
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:40,704
...from skating right on across it.

1275
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:43,665
If the thing opens up and starts
to swallow you...

1276
01:21:43,827 --> 01:21:47,342
...make sure you got a friend
out there...

1277
01:21:47,547 --> 01:21:49,777
...to throw you a rope.

1278
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:01,303
- That's a cut.
- Now get these fuckers off my set.

1279
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:03,105
Someone get me a soy latte.

1280
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:06,498
Come on, people, I'm Dr. Dwayne.

1281
01:22:07,987 --> 01:22:10,785
- Holy shit, dude.
- That was insane.

1282
01:22:10,947 --> 01:22:12,016
Unbelievable.

1283
01:22:12,787 --> 01:22:15,585
- This trip was a good thing.
- Yeah.

1284
01:22:15,747 --> 01:22:18,659
Thank you. Thanks.

1285
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:20,863
You know this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1286
01:22:21,027 --> 01:22:23,495
You're the two best friends
a guy could ever have.

1287
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:25,896
What the--?

1288
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:27,819
Eat egg, you sappy bitch.

1289
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:29,942
No, not my face.

1290
01:22:30,107 --> 01:22:34,385
Not my face.
It's my instrument, you bitch.

1291
01:22:35,307 --> 01:22:36,945
Did you see that?

1292
01:22:37,107 --> 01:22:40,702
This is an accomplishment, Joel.
You've got somebody afraid of you.

1293
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:43,343
People fear me.

1294
01:22:43,507 --> 01:22:45,384
I like this.

1295
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,022
I think we can go home now.

1296
01:22:52,027 --> 01:22:53,779
Ben, can we get serious
for a moment?

1297
01:22:53,947 --> 01:22:55,824
Absolutely, man, what's up?

1298
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:58,900
- Do you think I look like Beyoncé?
- No.

1299
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,420
- I mean, not in the eyes?
- No.

1300
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:01,656
- The mouth?
- No.

1301
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:04,057
Whatever, you don't know anything.

1302
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,544
Get me a soy latte.

1303
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:09,500
Son, you need to look at me
when I'm talking to you.

1304
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:13,296
But Dr. Dwayne, I am looking at you.

1305
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:15,862
Okay, I can't work like this.

1306
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:19,383
Who the hell hired
the cockeyed sumbitch?

1307
01:23:19,547 --> 01:23:21,981
Oh, goddamn it, y'all, come on.

1308
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:23,580
I'm Dr. Dwayne.

1309
01:24:05,227 --> 01:24:06,819
A mark.

1310
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:25,745
Oh, my gosh.

1311
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:30,425
I had a gay moment. I had
my first, my first gay moment.

1312
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,781
Gibberish.

1313
01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:46,384
- You did not take an oath, retard.
- Yes, I did take an oath, with my--

1314
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:48,981
You don't know everything.

1315
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:01,186
F*** me.

1316
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,538
I'm gonna back up one.

1317
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,618
Hold on.

1318
01:25:06,107 --> 01:25:08,496
I'm a team player, here I go.

1319
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:16,700
How many was that?

1320
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,540
Shit. Hold on.

1321
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:23,019
He was laughing.

1322
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:24,336
Help her. Help her now.

1323
01:25:24,507 --> 01:25:26,463
All right, ready.

1324
01:25:34,227 --> 01:25:36,821
- Okay, cut, we'll pick it up.
- Sorry.

1325
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,307
Grape-- F***.
That was his fault.

1326
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,504
Clueless?
Perhaps you meant...

1327
01:25:47,067 --> 01:25:50,616
-...brilliant!
- No, I didn't mean...

1328
01:25:53,907 --> 01:25:54,942
...brilliant.

1329
01:25:55,107 --> 01:25:57,667
I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God.

1330
01:25:57,827 --> 01:26:00,421
I mean it, I've always thought
about doing it.

1331
01:26:00,587 --> 01:26:03,465
Go ahead,
we're not moving anymore.

1332
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,464
Do you understand what I mean?

1333
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,822
What I'm talking about
when I say blow?

1334
01:26:07,987 --> 01:26:09,818
You-- What?

1335
01:26:13,427 --> 01:26:16,339
I wasn't supposed to last that long.

1336
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:18,579
I thought you were gonna cut me off.

1337
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,859
- Mark.
- There isn't a cloud in the sky.

1338
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:36,657
It's like a blank canvas,
full of hope and possibilities.

1339
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:40,661
You know, my nana used to say
it was like a naked virgin...

1340
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:44,263
...waiting to be ploughed
from behind...

1341
01:26:44,427 --> 01:26:46,622
...while playing with her boobies.

1342
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,698
Maybe tickling her anus.

1343
01:26:48,867 --> 01:26:50,459
Okay.

1344
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:54,265
Camera set?

1345
01:26:56,147 --> 01:27:00,459
When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.

1346
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,977
Ever heard of him?
Ruined our friend's life.

1347
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:14,777
It's dirty.

1348
01:27:15,387 --> 01:27:16,706
I don't like dirt.

1349
01:27:16,867 --> 01:27:19,984
Chitown, Joel, the Windy City.

1350
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:23,139
But now we are just touring
God greens--

1351
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,218
But now we are just touring God--

1352
01:27:25,387 --> 01:27:28,299
But now we are just touring
the earth of something.

1353
01:27:28,467 --> 01:27:33,587
- Cut.
- Well, we're okay, I guess.

1354
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,497
All right. That's enough.

1355
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:48,627
Can you pull this beast off
at the next exit?

1356
01:27:48,787 --> 01:27:51,699
That is ridiculous.

1357
01:27:52,627 --> 01:27:54,618
No problem.

1358
01:28:07,627 --> 01:28:09,299
Hold for coughs.

1359
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:12,982
I smoked so many blunts last night.
All right.

1360
01:28:16,827 --> 01:28:17,896
Pull over right now!

1361
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:19,102
A marker.
