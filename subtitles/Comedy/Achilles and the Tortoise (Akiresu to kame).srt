WOWOW and OFFICE KITANO
Production

3
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,650
Ponder this question.

4
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,419
Yes, master.

5
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,420
Fast runner Achilles races
with slow Tortoise.

6
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,259
Tortoise runs only 1 meter per second.

7
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,629
Achilles runs 1 0 m per second.

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,733
If Tortoise starts 9 m ahead of Achilles,

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,970
will Achilles ever catch up
with Tortoise?

10
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,174
Of course, he will.

11
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,277
Can he really?

12
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,647
It will take 0.9 seconds for Achilles
to reach where Tortoise started.

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,085
By then, Tortoise will have run
0.9 m further.

14
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,089
Indeed.

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
Then it would take another .09 seconds
for him to reach where Tortoise was.

16
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,497
But Tortoise will have already run
another .09 m further.

17
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,702
Indeed.

18
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,703
In order to reach the point
where Tortoise was,

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,941
Achilles would need
another .009 seconds.

20
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,144
Tortoise will have again run
another .009 m further.

21
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,285
Thus the chase goes on infinitely...

22
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,455
and Achilles
can never overtake Tortoise.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,638
ACHILLES AND THE TORTOISE

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,993
Let me hear

25
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,098
those sweet words

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,505
Tell me

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,843
your old stories

28
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,384
Say these words

29
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,721
over and over

30
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,594
"Je vous aime"

31
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,071
I'm home!

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,984
Come on in.

33
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,985
Bring me the wine!

34
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,989
We're back.

35
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,095
- How many days did it take?
- Nine days.

36
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,901
So tiring!

37
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,270
Terrible food.

38
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,738
Was it cold there?

39
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,341
Freezing.

40
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,342
I hate cold weather.

41
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,179
Maestro, you painted this 10 years ago.

42
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,284
Remember?

43
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,153
Of course, I do.

44
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,154
Frankly I didn't know
what I was doing at the time.

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,592
Didn't know if I wanted to be
Picasso or Matisse.

46
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,330
You really helped me out then,
buying my paintings.

47
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,936
I was dead broke then.

48
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,937
Mr. Kuramochi even took you to France.

49
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,109
You were so lucky.

50
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,010
I appreciate that.

51
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,011
Maestro, in the art world,

52
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,315
the talented need patrons
to support their rise to fame.

53
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,623
Behind every genius
is someone understanding.

54
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,827
Artists can't live
without people like you.

55
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,633
That's right.

56
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,634
Thank you so much, Mr. Kuramochi.

57
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,141
What's Machisu doing?

58
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,510
He's painting in his room.

59
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,745
He's painting again?

60
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,746
He must have inherited
my passion for art.

61
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,151
- What kind of paintings?
- The usual.

62
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,822
He's only a kid.

63
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,823
Could I see them?

64
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,528
- Really?
- I'd love to!

65
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,529
Might be a good experience for him.

66
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,837
They're amazing!

67
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,841
So free and powerful for a kid!

68
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,513
At this rate,

69
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,514
he'll soon be better than me.

70
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,020
Machisu, who's this?

71
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,522
Her.

72
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,591
My goodness!

73
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,592
Stop fooling around, son.

74
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,301
Machisu,

75
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,302
a flounder's eyes are vertical,
not horizontal.

76
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,472
Observe closely when painting.

77
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,880
Oh yes.

78
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,582
Machisu...

79
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,583
A gift for you.

80
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,254
It may be too big now,

81
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,255
but you can wear it when you're older.

82
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,127
Aren't you glad, Machisu?

83
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,295
A gift from the maestro!

84
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,296
Lucky you, Machisu.

85
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,604
Machisu had a dream
of becoming a painter.

86
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,306
Or rather he was made
to have one.

87
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,307
FUKUMI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

88
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,322
Have a good day.

89
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,323
Okay.

90
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,170
...and make the denominators even.

91
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,775
2 times 2 is 4.

92
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,445
1 times 2 is 2.

93
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,446
We now made denominators the same.

94
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,151
Then add up just the numerators.

95
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,855
Not the denominators,
only the numerators.

96
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,891
This is very important.

97
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,195
The denominator remains at 4.

98
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,364
The numerator adds up to 3.

99
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,369
So the answer is 3/4. Understood?

100
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,671
Yes.

101
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,473
Next.

102
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,675
1 /2 plus 1/3.

103
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,810
Teacher!

104
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,811
Kuramochi is drawing again.

105
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,152
Don't mind him.

106
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,255
His father will take him to France
and make him a painter.

107
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,165
Is this my portrait?

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,166
How courageous!

109
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,336
This kind of courage
makes a good painting.

110
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,744
Where are you going?

111
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,745
Outside to paint.

112
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,554
Class, work on that.

113
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Maestro, how should I sell this?

114
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,785
Sell to Kuramochi.
Say it's an Impressionist.

115
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,561
He wouldn't know.

116
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,562
Right.

117
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Bye.

118
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,774
Stupid ass, what are you doing?

119
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,776
That's dangerous.

120
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,512
Move!

121
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,513
That's Mr. Kuramochi's son.

122
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,621
Junior...

123
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,990
Could you paint somewhere else?

124
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,991
It's not safe there.

125
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,642
Junior, can we pass?

126
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,981
Kuramochi,

127
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,383
you have to let them pass.

128
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,384
Okay.

129
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,413
A flounder's eyes are vertical,
not horizontal.

130
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,078
Is this really Blue Mountain blend?

131
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,916
Yes.

132
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,756
It doesn't taste good at all.

133
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,693
That coffee guy must have
added something extra.

134
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,030
He doesn't understand
coffee is culture itself.

135
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,934
I hate that pathetic hick.

136
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,974
What's Machisu doing?

137
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,975
He's out painting.

138
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,529
Junior!

139
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,530
It's hard to make chickens cooperate.

140
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,634
Look at him and stay still.
Junior is trying to draw.

141
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,472
Maestro brought this from France.

142
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,509
This guy needed quick cash
so I arranged the money for him.

143
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,049
This is what I got in return.

144
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,819
What's his name?

145
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,421
I can't tell you now,

146
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,422
but he'll be famous very soon
and the price will surely rise.

147
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,762
Really?

148
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,763
Yes, sir.

149
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,552
All the silkworms are dead?

150
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,527
We have to shut down all the factories?

151
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,866
Can't a French trader
send us the silkworms?

152
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,536
We tried, but they are out of season.

153
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,209
Now what?

154
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,581
What are we going to do?

155
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,810
Bank President!

156
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,811
Mr. Chairman, what shall we do
with our bank tomorrow?

157
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,750
What about it?

158
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,119
Shall we open?

159
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,620
Why wouldn't you?

160
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,621
People will storm the bank!

161
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,826
Complete havoc!

162
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,827
We don't have any choice, do we?

163
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,278
"Cocoon Wipe Out"

164
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,383
"Kuramochi Silk Stock Drastic Drop"

165
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,384
"Kuramochi Bank
on Verge of Bankruptcy"

166
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,072
I guess it's over for us.

167
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,842
I must have put you
through some hard times.

168
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,150
We're not through yet.

169
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,762
Don't be a wimp.

170
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,666
Drink up, Manager.

171
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,091
We've identified the bodies.

172
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,092
Risuke Kuramochi, male.
Michiyakko, a geisha.

173
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,429
Double suicide.

174
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,430
Kuramochi's company just went bankrupt.

175
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,159
Good evening.

176
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,667
Excuse me.

177
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,106
My condolences.

178
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,465
Take anything that looks valuable.

179
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,466
There are four paintings
in the living room.

180
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,505
What else is there?

181
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,180
The widow's ring.

182
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,193
Show me your hands.

183
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,903
Only this for the wife of Kuramochi?

184
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,189
- What's in there?
- Kid's room.

185
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,067
Nothing valuable.

186
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,885
Kid's paintings.

187
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,187
Not worth shit.

188
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,889
Of course not.

189
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,890
Nothing of worth here but tin toys.

190
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,962
Forget it.

191
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,635
Idiot!

192
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,636
Those could bring in money.

193
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,972
Art dealers trick people
into buying them.

194
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,781
Move it, brat!

195
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,252
I forgot something.

196
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,521
That's what you went back for?

197
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,522
Yes.

198
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,602
Don't cry.

199
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,206
I'm sorry.

200
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,842
How selfish can you be?

201
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,713
I'm his brother,
yet he refused to lend me money.

202
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,718
He even ignored my calls.

203
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,719
I'm sorry.

204
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,257
And you...

205
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,027
Didn't you marry for money?

206
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,262
He's not even your own kid.

207
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,164
Now what?

208
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,600
He went bankrupt, so you want out?

209
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,601
And you want us to raise him?

210
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,073
I'm so sorry.

211
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,609
Why not give them a break?

212
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,711
They're in trouble.

213
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,712
He's still a young child.

214
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,053
Just for a couple of years.

215
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,054
That's all!

216
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,060
Listen.

217
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,061
Do what your uncle tells you.
Be a good boy.

218
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,399
I promise I'll come back for you.

219
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,071
His belongings.

220
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,108
Thank you very much.

221
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,057
Don't just stand there!

222
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,129
Clean the front yard.

223
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,130
We've got a lot of work.

224
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,334
Then feed the chickens.

225
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,335
Is that clear?

226
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,166
What an annoying brat.

227
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Who told you to draw chickens?
I told you to feed them.

228
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,838
We give you food and shelter.

229
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,541
Be grateful and do some work.

230
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,248
Useless bastard!

231
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,531
He's still unknown.

232
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,967
But he's a master.

233
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,968
He tragically died at age 1 2.

234
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,772
Now the prices are rising.

235
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,077
What's his name?

236
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,078
I can't tell you now.
It's complicated.

237
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,215
How so?

238
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,888
Sir,

239
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,889
the greater the mystery,
the more valuable the painting.

240
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,463
Matazo.

241
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,435
Let's go home.

242
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,436
It's getting cold.

243
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,973
It's time for dinner.

244
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,845
The landscape will be there tomorrow.

245
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,825
Thanks for the meal.

246
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,364
Clear the table when you finish, idiot!

247
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,385
What about his schooling?

248
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,388
He doesn't need it.
He will only be here temporarily.

249
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,027
Why should I tend to that?

250
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,028
We can't afford it.

251
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Let's go.

252
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,336
Hey you!

253
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,272
Do as you're told.

254
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,273
Clean up the kitchen.
Hear me?

255
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,797
Let's play.

256
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,407
I'm Matazo.

257
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,409
What's your name?

258
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,211
I'm Machisu.

259
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,212
Machisu?
Strange name.

260
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,649
What's this?

261
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,650
The rain will wet it.

262
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,765
What's this?
He hasn't cleaned up.

263
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,272
Didn't I say to clean the kitchen?

264
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,444
You haven't done a thing.

265
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,445
Stupid brat!

266
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,182
Honey, come and see.

267
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,561
The kid really loves to paint.

268
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,701
Why don't you let him?

269
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,702
We should let him go to school too.

270
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,507
Why should I?

271
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,726
He's weird.

272
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,495
It's freezing but he wears shorts.

273
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,496
What a weirdo.

274
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,001
A new friend to our class...
Machisu Kuramochi.

275
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,739
Nice to meet you.

276
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,241
Okay, first period is grammar.

277
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,242
Today we'll learn more
about Chinese characters.

278
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,347
Take out your notebooks.

279
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,415
Yes.

280
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,416
First, let me give you a problem.

281
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,191
- How do you read this?
- Mouth!

282
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,559
That's right.

283
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Add one line and
it makes a different character.

284
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,134
What is it?

285
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,236
Miss Aoi.

286
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,237
- Day.
- That's right, 'day.I

287
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,941
- And adding two lines makes?
- Eye!

288
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,612
That's right.

289
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,383
Adding lines to 'mouth'
creates a different character.

290
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,123
Another example is
the character for 'rice field.'

291
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,561
See if you can come up
with other examples.

292
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,632
Mr. Okada.

293
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:38,969
Figure.

294
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,970
'Figure.' That's right.

295
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,309
Anything else?

296
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,410
Miss Aoi.

297
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,280
Add another 'mouth'
and we have 'turn.'

298
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,281
That's right.
'Turn' as in turn around.

299
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,153
Anything else?

300
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,821
Mr. Ueki.

301
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,655
Four.

302
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,757
That's right, the number 'four.'

303
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,758
As in one, two, three, four.

304
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,495
You've all done your homework well.

305
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,136
What are you doing?

306
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,774
No drawing in class!

307
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,533
Not like that.

308
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,534
You're not good.

309
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,571
Look.

310
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,420
I want to draw trains and buses,
but they pass too quickly.

311
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,293
They stop if you stand
in front of them.

312
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,876
It's coming.

313
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,898
Assholes!

314
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,633
Don't stand in the way.

315
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,634
You're blocking the road!

316
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,021
Junior...

317
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,024
It's me, Aki.

318
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,737
Thank you for coming.

319
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,992
My duty because she has
no relatives?

320
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,897
Even her burial?

321
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,666
My brother was a jerk!

322
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,667
Why should I pay for her funeral?

323
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,338
Terrible.

324
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,442
How could you?
Selfish!

325
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,246
What do we do with that?

326
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,324
He should have arranged
a decent tomb.

327
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,327
Then he wouldn't be buried
in this dump.

328
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,763
He only cared about money.

329
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,834
At least his wife is beside him.

330
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,638
Let's go home before the sun sets.

331
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,576
Hurry up.

332
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,968
Come on.

333
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,444
Save electricity and go to bed.

334
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,559
Gross!

335
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,560
Honey, come up here!

336
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,799
What now?

337
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Look at that.

338
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,209
You little asshole.

339
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,545
Drawing a picture like that!

340
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,014
Get out, you ungrateful bastard!

341
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,050
Got a grudge against me?

342
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,051
Don't blame me for her death!

343
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,888
Hear me?

344
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,903
How was it?

345
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,904
They told me to bring the kid
right away.

346
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,508
It turns out that my rich jerk brother
supported orphanages.

347
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,582
So why didn't he help us?

348
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,583
All he cared about was his reputation.

349
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,621
Well, I'm relieved.

350
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,622
You wrote the letter?

351
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,562
To Sunflower Orphanage

352
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,697
Here...

353
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,532
Give them that.

354
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,533
Don't paint all the time
and do as you're told.

355
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,639
Asshole! What the hell!

356
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,942
Why jump out in the road?

357
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,513
He came out of nowhere.

358
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,882
Matazo from Watsuji Village!

359
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,883
The imbecile who painted
everywhere he went!

360
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,270
Good morning.

361
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,284
MACHISU

362
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,954
Machisu reached young manhood.

363
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,591
He held on to his dream
of being a painter.

364
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,535
We're back!

365
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,203
Eat breakfast quickly.

366
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,204
Thanks.

367
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,029
Hello.

368
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,230
What?

369
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,231
They're not delivered yet?

370
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,368
He left a while ago.

371
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,872
I'm sorry.

372
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,873
I've been telling him.

373
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,178
It happened again?

374
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,179
I'll be right there.

375
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,433
Kuramochi!

376
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,577
Kuramochi, I already told you.

377
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,781
Finish your deliveries
then you can paint all you want.

378
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,919
We got complaints again.

379
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,920
Let's go. I'll help you.

380
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,162
Our fathers worked together for years.

381
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,367
It's interesting how relationships
can be passed on.

382
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,643
No offense, but you can find
landscapes like yours anywhere.

383
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,183
They're going out of style.

384
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,987
We want something with more impact.

385
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,357
Or they just don't sell.

386
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,361
Any painter with decent skills
can paint like that.

387
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,699
Try something more unique.

388
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,038
You've studied art, haven't you?

389
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,039
No, only on my own.

390
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,510
You must go to art school
unless you're a born genius.

391
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,881
You could learn a lot.

392
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,486
Realism, Impressionism, Cubism,
Fauvism, Contemporary.

393
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,893
Art has changed throughout history.

394
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,897
Please seek proper training.

395
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,073
You can find those
in any public bathhouse.

396
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,278
Even house painters
can paint like that.

397
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,450
Learn more about modern art.

398
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,224
I'll keep that one,

399
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,294
in case someone wants it
for their shop.

400
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,845
Excuse me,

401
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,846
I'm thinking of quitting.

402
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,684
Why?

403
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,685
I want to study art properly.

404
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,189
You can work here and study.

405
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,694
I'm thinking of going to art school.

406
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,695
I need to take a day job
to pay for the tuition.

407
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,999
I see.

408
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,861
So you're an art student?

409
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,031
Yes. I want to be a painter.

410
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,336
But painting costs money.

411
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,072
Since I don't have any relatives,

412
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,073
I work to pay for tuition
and supplies.

413
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:44,378
I admire artists so much.

414
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,216
If only I had talent.

415
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,217
I'm no different.
I just love to paint.

416
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,922
That's why you always wear a beret.

417
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,561
I've always wanted to be a model.

418
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,365
Really?

419
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,534
Sure.

420
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,535
Call me anytime.

421
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,248
Is it any good?

422
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,619
He said it's Impressionism.

423
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,756
They make us pay
and teach us nothing.

424
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,927
That teacher...

425
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,830
He was famous for living in France.

426
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,831
They finally realized he had no talent
and he ended up here.

427
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,779
What's his name?

428
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Takanawa, I think.

429
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,120
If you'll excuse me.

430
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,705
It's no use learning
how to sketch anymore.

431
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,710
But it's the basics.

432
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,179
Aren't we supposed to learn the basics?

433
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,180
You can depict something as it is
by taking a photograph.

434
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,184
Sketching is for making replicas.

435
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,754
That might have been needed before,

436
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,891
but today we have cameras and copiers.

437
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,927
Skilled sketchers aren't needed anymore
for replicas.

438
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,899
Modern artists should be more creative.

439
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,574
It looks nothing like it.

440
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:28,444
Not at all!

441
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,379
You guys have no taste.

442
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Check out how the Cubists painted faces.

443
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,585
Why paint that way?

444
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,121
They painted with their souls.

445
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,256
You sketch with your soul?

446
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,591
Hell yeah.

447
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,592
Not with charcoal?

448
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,129
Shut up, Mohawk!

449
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,933
Stop laughing!

450
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,957
What are you doing?

451
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,958
Sketching with my soul.

452
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,497
Shut up, Mohawk!

453
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:42,501
Bon appetite!

454
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:46,505
Watch his nose!

455
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:56,183
We want something hot!

456
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:59,184
Dangerous Cigarette Smoking!

457
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,690
We'll light up
with this huge firecracker.

458
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:12,731
Is it lit?

459
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:18,704
Time for Ziplock Zen!

460
00:59:21,043 --> 00:59:24,043
Some plastic sheeting...

461
00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:28,215
See you in space!

462
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:31,216
Have a safe trip!

463
00:59:33,922 --> 00:59:36,922
Turn on the vacuum cleaner.

464
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:40,392
Air is coming out of the bag.

465
00:59:42,764 --> 00:59:45,764
He's done it!

466
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:56,075
Back to earth!

467
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:09,090
Leave it for tomorrow.

468
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:10,391
Okay.

469
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:13,392
Goodbye, sir.

470
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:25,539
We're off tomorrow.

471
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,808
Are you free?

472
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:30,277
I'll be painting with friends.

473
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:33,278
Artist friends, how nice.

474
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:35,082
Can I come along?

475
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:38,083
We're trying something wild.
It's too dangerous for girls.

476
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,454
How about tomorrow night?

477
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:43,455
Mie will pose for me,
so I can do some figure painting.

478
01:00:44,826 --> 01:00:46,460
What's that about?

479
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:48,829
I could pose for you.

480
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:51,766
Mie is just a model to me.

481
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:54,767
There's nothing between us.

482
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:58,137
How do you see me?

483
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:03,976
I like you.

484
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:07,146
Fine, then.

485
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:14,655
Check this out.

486
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:17,656
Put this on.

487
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,599
Itagaki, that's not art.

488
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,637
Sideways.

489
01:01:29,638 --> 01:01:30,438
Sideways?

490
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:33,439
This way.

491
01:02:13,715 --> 01:02:16,715
Photo time!

492
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:08,803
It's not intense enough.

493
01:03:08,804 --> 01:03:11,804
We need more impact
for action painting.

494
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,975
Do your parents have a car?

495
01:03:14,976 --> 01:03:16,777
Why?

496
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:19,778
We can crash it
and splash paint on the wall.

497
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:22,449
Why use our car?

498
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,051
Dumb ass!

499
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:26,253
It's for art's sake!

500
01:03:26,254 --> 01:03:29,254
You're the only one with a car.

501
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:31,926
We'll do it tomorrow.

502
01:03:31,927 --> 01:03:34,061
Kuramochi?

503
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:35,930
I got work at the factory.

504
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:37,965
Forget work, dumb ass.

505
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:40,966
Which is more important,
the factory or art?

506
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:21,173
Can I put my clothes back on?

507
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:24,776
Yes.

508
01:04:42,497 --> 01:04:45,497
You didn't really need me,
did you?

509
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:57,745
Kuramochi.

510
01:04:57,746 --> 01:05:00,746
Follow me.

511
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:11,225
This doesn't look too good.

512
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:12,393
CLOSEOUT SALE

513
01:05:12,394 --> 01:05:15,394
It's a closeout,
but you went too far.

514
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:18,532
It has more impact.

515
01:05:18,533 --> 01:05:21,402
Impact is not the issue.

516
01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:24,403
Flyers shouldn't look so sinister.

517
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:27,739
The clients were furious.

518
01:05:28,276 --> 01:05:30,778
I'm sorry.

519
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:33,213
You've been acting strange.

520
01:05:33,214 --> 01:05:36,214
Draw something normal.

521
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,920
Can I take the rest of the day off?

522
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:46,758
What's the matter?

523
01:05:47,062 --> 01:05:50,062
I'm working on a project
with my friends.

524
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,570
Art may be important,
but you're paid to do a job.

525
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:04,977
We're not doing this for charity.

526
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:15,055
Cool!

527
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,290
Try other colors.

528
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:17,558
- Yellow!
- Blue!

529
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:20,559
Try yellow and blue.

530
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,970
More!
Now which colors?

531
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:31,138
- Green.
- Orange.

532
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:34,139
Try green and orange.

533
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,818
The bicycle broke.

534
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:46,186
It broke?

535
01:06:46,187 --> 01:06:48,322
Then carry it.

536
01:06:48,323 --> 01:06:49,656
What colors?

537
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:51,825
Whatever.

538
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:54,826
Yeah, whatever!

539
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,944
Bicycle did well. You'll do better.

540
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,179
You think it's safe?

541
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,647
Car's safer.

542
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:16,517
- Don't worry.
- Go on!

543
01:07:16,518 --> 01:07:19,518
Right.

544
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:23,188
Show some guts!

545
01:07:56,558 --> 01:07:59,226
Where's Machisu today?

546
01:07:59,227 --> 01:08:02,227
His friend had an accident,
so he took the day off.

547
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:05,397
Look at that.
Is that me?

548
01:08:05,433 --> 01:08:08,168
That's what he painted.

549
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:10,270
Does that look like me?

550
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:13,040
It's amazing.

551
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:16,041
Art is so deep.

552
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:19,546
Everybody laughed when they saw it.

553
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:21,915
It's so embarrassing.

554
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:24,885
The owner wanted to hang it.

555
01:08:24,886 --> 01:08:27,387
Looks nothing like me, right?

556
01:08:27,388 --> 01:08:30,388
You have to use your imagination.

557
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:33,558
Screw imagination.

558
01:08:33,728 --> 01:08:36,630
I look like a meatball.
I hate it.

559
01:08:36,631 --> 01:08:39,399
I won't pose again.

560
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,400
Then I will.

561
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:45,537
I understand his art.

562
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:29,082
Want to try some?

563
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,417
What is it?

564
01:09:30,418 --> 01:09:33,418
It gets you high.

565
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:36,655
No thanks.

566
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:47,999
Maybe I'll go to America.

567
01:09:48,002 --> 01:09:51,002
Now that he's dead,
I'll go back to my hometown.

568
01:09:53,474 --> 01:09:56,474
The talentless pack up and go home.

569
01:09:58,046 --> 01:10:01,046
Who knows when talent is unleashed?

570
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:03,817
Maybe it just hasn't awakened!

571
01:10:03,818 --> 01:10:06,119
If it hasn't woken up by now,

572
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,120
it will never wake up.

573
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:17,862
Are you crazy?

574
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:28,707
I'm leaving.

575
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:48,994
We tried crashing the car
to splash paint.

576
01:10:49,264 --> 01:10:52,264
Art isn't produced by accident.

577
01:10:52,934 --> 01:10:55,934
Famous artists can control chance.

578
01:10:56,904 --> 01:10:59,904
Being famous has nothing
to do with talent.

579
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:06,745
All this talk about art...

580
01:11:07,415 --> 01:11:09,449
Go to Africa,

581
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:12,450
and show the starving
a Picasso and a rice ball.

582
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:18,458
Everyone would choose the rice ball.

583
01:11:18,459 --> 01:11:21,459
Art means nothing to a starving person.

584
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:26,600
You're no different.

585
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:29,601
- I'd choose the Picasso!
- Don't be so naive.

586
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:34,072
Art is just one big hoax.

587
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:29,861
Room 1 02
Machisu and Sachiko Kuramochi

588
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:15,874
Machisu married
an understanding partner.

589
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:50,410
I'm off.

590
01:13:50,411 --> 01:13:53,411
Good luck.

591
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:29,481
You're copying Mondrian.

592
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,620
That resembles Klee.

593
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:40,792
I advised you to study, not imitate.

594
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:44,064
This is imitation.

595
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:47,065
Bad ones, at that.

596
01:14:47,768 --> 01:14:48,835
Is that Miro?

597
01:14:48,836 --> 01:14:51,836
Yes, it's Miro.

598
01:14:54,308 --> 01:14:56,409
Whose next?

599
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,612
Hundertwasser.

600
01:14:58,613 --> 01:15:00,914
Doesn't look like that.

601
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:03,915
That's even worse.

602
01:15:07,622 --> 01:15:10,090
What's that?

603
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:12,092
I call it "Mr. Arakuma."

604
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:13,860
And?

605
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:16,861
I saw him in the street.
Named him Mr. Arakuma.

606
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,868
A bit weird.

607
01:15:21,869 --> 01:15:24,869
At least it's better than imitating.

608
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:41,119
I need money to buy paint.

609
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:45,189
Did the paintings sell?

610
01:15:53,868 --> 01:15:55,569
What are these?

611
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:58,570
Mr. Arakuma's whole family.

612
01:16:00,508 --> 01:16:02,242
Who's that?

613
01:16:02,243 --> 01:16:03,710
Grandfather.

614
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,345
Not grandmother?

615
01:16:05,346 --> 01:16:06,379
Who's that?

616
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,747
Father.

617
01:16:07,748 --> 01:16:09,583
Not mother?

618
01:16:09,584 --> 01:16:10,584
Who's that?

619
01:16:10,585 --> 01:16:11,885
Big brother.

620
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:12,886
And that?

621
01:16:12,887 --> 01:16:14,554
Younger brother.

622
01:16:14,555 --> 01:16:15,555
And that?

623
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:17,157
Sister.

624
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:18,158
And that?

625
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,726
Cousin.

626
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:20,560
And that?

627
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:22,062
Second cousin.

628
01:16:22,063 --> 01:16:24,931
It makes no sense at all.

629
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:27,932
They are all the same.

630
01:16:28,102 --> 01:16:31,102
I say one good thing
and this is how you react.

631
01:16:45,586 --> 01:16:47,921
Too ordinary.

632
01:16:47,922 --> 01:16:50,922
Try to be more experimental.

633
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,430
Try not using a brush.

634
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:07,271
You must think differently.

635
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,760
Machisu reached middle age.
His paintings still didn't sell.

636
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:07,333
I'm home.

637
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:08,535
You're late.

638
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:09,836
I need help.

639
01:18:09,837 --> 01:18:11,204
Okay.

640
01:18:11,205 --> 01:18:13,506
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming.

641
01:18:13,507 --> 01:18:16,507
It needs to be done quickly.

642
01:18:19,513 --> 01:18:20,346
Put this in.

643
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:23,149
Which color?

644
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,150
Put in the paint and I'll hit.

645
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:55,246
Mom, can I have some money?

646
01:18:55,249 --> 01:18:58,249
We're not exactly rich.
Can't do it.

647
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:03,387
I know.
Thanks to your stupid art!

648
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:06,824
How long do I have to put up
with this shit?

649
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:10,061
I'm the laughing stock in school.

650
01:19:10,097 --> 01:19:13,097
What horrible parents
make their daughters work?

651
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:18,772
Keep going.

652
01:19:18,773 --> 01:19:21,773
Go on.

653
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:31,451
Go!

654
01:19:31,452 --> 01:19:33,219
Slow and easy.

655
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,922
Good.

656
01:19:35,923 --> 01:19:37,090
You're outside the line.

657
01:19:37,091 --> 01:19:40,091
Get back inside.

658
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:42,428
Okay.

659
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:44,764
Come back.

660
01:19:44,765 --> 01:19:46,266
Too slow.

661
01:19:46,267 --> 01:19:47,834
A little more like this.

662
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:48,568
What?

663
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:50,904
You're moving onto the road.

664
01:19:50,905 --> 01:19:51,971
Like this?

665
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:53,439
Yes.

666
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,276
You're wobbling.
Nice and smooth.

667
01:19:56,277 --> 01:19:57,544
One more time.

668
01:19:57,545 --> 01:19:59,045
Watch out.

669
01:19:59,046 --> 01:20:01,447
Once more.

670
01:20:01,448 --> 01:20:02,982
- Over the white.
- White?

671
01:20:02,983 --> 01:20:05,983
- Where there's no color.
- No color?

672
01:20:08,155 --> 01:20:11,155
Watch for white areas.

673
01:20:14,295 --> 01:20:15,128
That's good.

674
01:20:15,129 --> 01:20:16,262
Nice and smooth.

675
01:20:16,263 --> 01:20:17,430
Don't get off the bike.

676
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:19,465
Nice and smooth.

677
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:22,466
Watch out.

678
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:25,405
Stay off the line.

679
01:20:25,406 --> 01:20:28,308
You better stay off.

680
01:20:28,309 --> 01:20:31,244
Go over the edge.

681
01:20:31,245 --> 01:20:34,245
Right there, quick turn.

682
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:35,281
Beautiful.

683
01:20:35,282 --> 01:20:37,417
On your right.

684
01:20:37,418 --> 01:20:38,618
Again!

685
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:41,619
Over the white.

686
01:21:25,633 --> 01:21:27,367
What's this?

687
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:30,368
You just splashed paint
onto canvas.

688
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:36,207
It's been done before.

689
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:39,310
Try something different.

690
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:43,381
You knew this guy, didn't you?

691
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:57,561
"New York Raves About Todd Sato,
The Japanese Basquiat!"

692
01:22:11,712 --> 01:22:14,712
It's not done with sprays, is it?

693
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:18,449
No, it's brush.

694
01:22:21,121 --> 01:22:24,121
I paint with you at night,

695
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:28,025
and work during the day.

696
01:22:28,529 --> 01:22:31,264
When will I sleep?

697
01:22:31,265 --> 01:22:34,265
Forget it.

698
01:24:01,188 --> 01:24:03,222
What the hell are you doing?

699
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:06,223
So you're the ones!

700
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:19,970
Repaint everything
or come down to the station.

701
01:24:20,674 --> 01:24:22,909
It's your choice.

702
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,044
Which is it?

703
01:24:25,045 --> 01:24:28,045
We'll paint.

704
01:25:28,876 --> 01:25:31,876
Thanks.

705
01:25:45,993 --> 01:25:48,561
You almost done?

706
01:25:48,562 --> 01:25:49,795
I'm done.

707
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:51,230
Will this do?

708
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:54,231
I guess it has to.

709
01:25:55,068 --> 01:25:58,068
We're very sorry.

710
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:40,311
We would've been famous
if we had finished.

711
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:47,184
They don't understand art.

712
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:05,569
Painting on storefronts?

713
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:08,706
The whole neighborhood is laughing.

714
01:27:09,576 --> 01:27:12,576
It's so embarrassing.

715
01:27:14,248 --> 01:27:17,248
Once more and I'm leaving.

716
01:27:29,062 --> 01:27:30,496
What's this?

717
01:27:30,497 --> 01:27:33,497
Self-portrait.

718
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:02,926
Who wants to buy
a portrait of an unknown painter?

719
01:28:08,435 --> 01:28:09,935
What's that?

720
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:12,936
I was going to paint a white rhino.

721
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,941
Why the white rhino?

722
01:28:15,942 --> 01:28:18,942
Endangered species.

723
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:20,780
Great idea.

724
01:28:20,781 --> 01:28:23,416
Making a statement with art.

725
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,417
But it's like advertising, not art.

726
01:28:28,922 --> 01:28:31,922
More like a poster
for an animal rights campaign.

727
01:28:33,427 --> 01:28:36,427
Not bad.
Art with a specific concept.

728
01:28:49,076 --> 01:28:52,076
Excuse me!

729
01:28:57,984 --> 01:29:00,984
Can you hammer over this house?

730
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,960
Sure.

731
01:29:24,544 --> 01:29:26,345
That's enough.

732
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:29,346
I said that's enough!

733
01:29:32,018 --> 01:29:34,387
Enough!

734
01:29:34,388 --> 01:29:37,388
Stop it!

735
01:29:46,366 --> 01:29:49,366
I gave you a little extra.

736
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:53,706
Enough ink?

737
01:29:53,707 --> 01:29:56,707
Start walking slowly.

738
01:30:00,046 --> 01:30:03,046
Leave your footprints clearly.
That's fine.

739
01:30:06,219 --> 01:30:07,386
Now go back.

740
01:30:07,387 --> 01:30:08,421
Wait!

741
01:30:08,422 --> 01:30:11,422
The other way around.

742
01:30:11,525 --> 01:30:14,226
Turn around.

743
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:17,227
Don't tread over the others.

744
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:24,770
Where are you going?

745
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,038
What are you doing?

746
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:29,039
No. Go back.

747
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:32,242
They go all over.
Go in one direction.

748
01:30:38,084 --> 01:30:40,419
You stepped on a footprint!

749
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:42,087
Never mind.

750
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:44,857
I call it "Black Continent."

751
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:47,858
Africa, trampled by white men.

752
01:30:49,796 --> 01:30:52,796
Sensational concept.

753
01:30:53,533 --> 01:30:56,533
But that looks like African trampling.

754
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:02,439
You should have painted Africa black
and the footprints in white.

755
01:31:03,777 --> 01:31:06,777
Looks like African footsteps.

756
01:31:09,816 --> 01:31:12,816
Africans trampling their own continent.

757
01:31:16,323 --> 01:31:19,323
And barefoot?

758
01:31:20,794 --> 01:31:23,794
White men would wear shoes.

759
01:31:32,005 --> 01:31:35,005
Excuse me.

760
01:31:35,976 --> 01:31:38,976
Can you drive over this?

761
01:31:39,646 --> 01:31:41,480
What's that?

762
01:31:41,481 --> 01:31:44,481
We want to paint your wheels
to make red tracks across it.

763
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:51,255
That's disgusting.

764
01:31:51,992 --> 01:31:54,992
It's inspired by an accident in which
a car crashed into a line of kids.

765
01:31:57,697 --> 01:32:00,697
We think this painting will
help raise awareness on safe driving.

766
01:32:02,669 --> 01:32:04,637
Don't remind me about that!

767
01:32:04,638 --> 01:32:07,638
Who would help you?

768
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:20,817
Watch out, asshole!

769
01:32:55,589 --> 01:32:56,355
Ambulance.

770
01:32:56,356 --> 01:32:59,356
Wait, wait!

771
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,200
Hold this.

772
01:33:16,576 --> 01:33:19,576
What do you think you're doing?

773
01:33:25,919 --> 01:33:28,919
"Freaky Art Couple Sketches
at Crash Site"

774
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:44,201
What's this?

775
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:48,238
I'm too embarrassed to go to school.

776
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:52,544
I'm leaving!

777
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:53,846
Mari!

778
01:33:53,847 --> 01:33:56,448
Leave her alone.

779
01:33:56,449 --> 01:33:58,250
She'll come back.

780
01:33:58,251 --> 01:34:00,886
Don't worry about it.

781
01:34:00,887 --> 01:34:03,887
See, we're almost there.

782
01:34:04,624 --> 01:34:07,624
We are.

783
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:15,632
Getting original,
but you need more madness.

784
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:20,270
Another's mortality is one thing.
Confronting your own is something else.

785
01:34:22,509 --> 01:34:25,509
Push yourself to the limit
when you think.

786
01:34:26,613 --> 01:34:29,613
Confront art in that state of mind.

787
01:34:36,656 --> 01:34:39,656
Please start.

788
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:49,668
Please hit her a bit softer.

789
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:51,537
What happened?

790
01:34:51,538 --> 01:34:53,305
Fight back.

791
01:34:53,306 --> 01:34:56,306
Go.

792
01:34:57,677 --> 01:35:00,677
You must fight back.

793
01:35:02,015 --> 01:35:04,516
Body blow, please.

794
01:35:04,517 --> 01:35:07,517
Fight, fight!

795
01:35:10,023 --> 01:35:13,023
Hit him!

796
01:35:27,307 --> 01:35:28,841
Here's your money.

797
01:35:28,842 --> 01:35:31,842
Thank you so much.

798
01:35:38,852 --> 01:35:41,220
Are you okay?

799
01:35:41,221 --> 01:35:42,721
Yes.

800
01:35:42,722 --> 01:35:45,557
My turn to push myself
to the limit.

801
01:35:45,558 --> 01:35:46,992
What will you do?

802
01:35:46,993 --> 01:35:49,993
I'll hover between life and death.

803
01:35:49,996 --> 01:35:52,397
Push real hard.

804
01:35:52,398 --> 01:35:55,398
Lack of oxygen will really inspire me.

805
01:35:56,903 --> 01:35:58,871
Then I can just paint.

806
01:35:58,872 --> 01:36:01,872
- Let's start.
- Okay.

807
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:20,590
Can you draw?

808
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:25,364
It's no good.

809
01:36:25,365 --> 01:36:28,365
I need to get a little crazier.

810
01:36:29,569 --> 01:36:32,569
You want me to push harder?

811
01:36:46,553 --> 01:36:49,553
How's that?

812
01:36:58,231 --> 01:37:00,732
It's not working.

813
01:37:00,733 --> 01:37:03,602
Hold me down harder.

814
01:37:03,603 --> 01:37:06,603
I have to be almost dead
to get some great ideas.

815
01:37:08,474 --> 01:37:09,608
Do it right.

816
01:37:09,609 --> 01:37:12,609
I'll push harder.

817
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:09,801
It's not what you think.

818
01:38:09,802 --> 01:38:12,802
I didn't...

819
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:20,010
I didn't do it.

820
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:42,899
Honey?

821
01:38:44,404 --> 01:38:46,405
We should split up.

822
01:38:46,406 --> 01:38:48,941
Huh?

823
01:38:48,942 --> 01:38:51,942
I can't take it anymore.

824
01:38:53,913 --> 01:38:56,913
Mari has left home.

825
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:59,916
We can't go on like this.

826
01:39:03,256 --> 01:39:06,256
I want to think about my future.

827
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:12,062
You won't give up your art,
will you?

828
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:18,068
No.

829
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,620
Wait there. This won't take long.

830
01:40:51,631 --> 01:40:52,697
How may I help you?

831
01:40:52,698 --> 01:40:55,698
I don't want anything.

832
01:40:56,869 --> 01:40:59,304
What is it?

833
01:40:59,305 --> 01:41:01,506
Lend me some money.

834
01:41:01,507 --> 01:41:03,542
What?

835
01:41:03,543 --> 01:41:06,543
I need money to buy paint.

836
01:41:09,148 --> 01:41:12,148
What father would borrow money
from his prostitute daughter?

837
01:41:23,529 --> 01:41:26,529
Take it.

838
01:41:28,534 --> 01:41:30,202
You're pathetic.

839
01:41:30,203 --> 01:41:33,203
Some artist!

840
01:41:35,908 --> 01:41:38,908
I can't stand it.

841
01:41:39,278 --> 01:41:42,278
Take this and lighten up.

842
01:41:43,883 --> 01:41:46,883
Thanks for waiting. Let's go.

843
01:43:02,628 --> 01:43:05,628
Want to try me?

844
01:43:12,972 --> 01:43:15,972
You've just hustled a client.

845
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:16,975
Huh?

846
01:43:16,976 --> 01:43:19,976
You've hustled a client.

847
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,014
You new here?

848
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:25,617
Give it to me.

849
01:43:25,618 --> 01:43:28,386
Give me the money.

850
01:43:28,387 --> 01:43:31,387
No business here
without my permission!

851
01:43:35,695 --> 01:43:38,695
You do have the money,
you bastard.

852
01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:36,479
You have a lipstick?

853
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:40,550
Lipstick?

854
01:46:14,253 --> 01:46:17,253
Honey, stop.

855
01:46:30,736 --> 01:46:33,736
You're insane.

856
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,240
You've lost it.

857
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:41,310
Not even human.

858
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:45,381
You're not even human!

859
01:49:18,137 --> 01:49:21,137
He's out of gas.

860
01:51:45,384 --> 01:51:48,384

861
01:52:37,569 --> 01:52:40,569
Are you up?

862
01:52:47,246 --> 01:52:50,246
Take care.

863
01:53:52,978 --> 01:53:55,580
- Lots of stuff.
- We could sell something.

864
01:53:55,581 --> 01:53:58,482
We could.

865
01:53:58,483 --> 01:54:01,483
What could we sell?

866
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:08,826
What's this?

867
01:54:08,827 --> 01:54:11,827
200,000 yen for an old can?

868
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:13,497
It looks kind of cool.

869
01:54:13,498 --> 01:54:15,900
Are you crazy?
It's just garbage.

870
01:54:15,901 --> 01:54:18,901
Is it?

871
01:54:33,852 --> 01:54:36,852
I'll buy it.

872
01:54:45,364 --> 01:54:48,364
Let's go home.

873
01:55:39,418 --> 01:55:42,418
And so Achilles did catch up with Tortoise.

874
01:55:50,462 --> 01:55:53,462
