1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Modern Farmer

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Noona.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,280
Where are you going?

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,990
Oh...

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,200
I need to rent tents for the marketplace.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,290
I see...

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,220
By yourself? You want me to go with you?

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,060
No, I'm fine.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,270
You don't have to.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,670
I'll go with you.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,080
I said I'm fine.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,850
I said I'll go.

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,520
Let's go.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,650
There aren't any grasshoppers.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,440
Just catch what you can.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Jeez, where did Hyuk go?

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
We have to catch grasshoppers 
for the marketplace.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,440
We have to get our instruments later, too.

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,160
He's not answering the phone.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,130
He must be sleeping somewhere.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,920
100% for sure.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,220
Oppas!

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,570
Oppas!

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,550
Hey.

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,690
What's all the fuss about?

26
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,060
I didn't come to see you.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,090
Please.

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,390
But...

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,150
Where's Kang Hyuk oppa?

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,730
Don't know. He must be hiding 
out sleeping somewhere.

31
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,070
Why?

32
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,220
You know what?

33
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,840
Oppas became really popular.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Popular?

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,440
What?

36
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,230
Look at this. This.

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:49,610
[Awesome fish slap]

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,830
[Who's in the back?]

39
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:41,890
[Is that a carp? 
Matilda, your dad's back! Behind you!]

40
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,720
Dad!

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,180
Why is this going around on the Internet?

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,870
Jeez, how embarrassing. What the heck?

43
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,040
There are over a million views already.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,700
Not only on every websites, but also 
on all the cafes, blogs and twitters.

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,500
Oppas...

46
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,890
You really became stars!

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,970
Star, my ass.

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,450
This is nothing to be proud of.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,790
The promotion for "Excellent Souls" 
went really well.

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,850
- Didn't it? 
- Enough!

51
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,460
Who recorded this and 
posted it on the Internet?

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,760
Forget it.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
Don't worry about it.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
We can just focus on the grasshoppers.

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,670
Ki Joon, go to Man Gu ahjusshi's house 
and get two more plastic bottles.

56
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,650
What for?

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,720
To sell grasshoppers at the marketplace,

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,300
we need to fill up at least two more bottles.

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, stop making me do this stuff anymore.

60
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,960
Hey.

61
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,830
Would Seoul people buy pea 
puffs and grasshoppers?

62
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,830
Of course. This is 100%. 
Aren't we also Seoul people?

63
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,790
Trust me.

64
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,690
So, hurry up and catch 
grasshoppers. Come on, come on.

65
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,370
There aren't any grasshoppers.

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,500
Let me help you.

67
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,920
If you look deep inside, you'll see them.

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,070
Hyung, where's Man Gu ahjusshi's house?

69
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,330
I don't know. Figure it out.

70
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,870
Hey, grasshoppers aren't... Are there?

71
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,070
Oppa, I'm scared of grasshoppers.

72
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,100
I'll go over there and find 
them. There're none here.

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,880
I got one!

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,200
Why are you here?

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,820
You'd give me more time.

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,330
I'm not here to collect your money.

77
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,270
By the way...

78
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,540
I have something to ask you.

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,860
What is it?

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,090
You want to do "Weekend Farm" here?

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,890
Yeah.

82
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,880
Well...

83
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,790
Such fresh air...

84
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,150
I like the village, too.

85
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,630
Moreover, they started 
getting atopic dermatitis.

86
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,460
Stop eating already, punk.

87
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,100
So...

88
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,960
we planted some lettuce seedlings yesterday.

89
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,650
But when we came this morning,

90
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,470
they were like this.

91
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,990
What's going on?

92
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,540
You want to farm when you don't 
even know this? Farming is no joke.

93
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,890
It's the elks.

94
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,700
Elks?

95
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,980
They eat this stuff?

96
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,610
They go crazy over this stuff.

97
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,720
We went through so much because of elks.

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,690
You know, I'm the god of farming.

99
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,620
Such a man is standing right next to you.

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,620
This is in fact...

101
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,930
There's cresol soap solution.

102
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,420
If you plant that around the field,

103
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,490
those elks go "My nose is rotting,"

104
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,740
and won't come around the field.

105
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,210
Wait a second. Write this down.

106
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,780
I said stop eating and 
write this down, punks.

107
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,650
C... what?

108
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,710
I was saying...

109
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,290
C...

110
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,350
Forget it.

111
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,130
I'll just take care of it.

112
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,210
Don't do anything.

113
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,720
The way you talk...

114
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,930
The way you talk to me is rather annoying.

115
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,490
Did you forget our relationship?

116
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,600
I can forever boss you around. 
What are you trying to do, punk?

117
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,510
Where did I see him?

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
What if Bul Ja is there?

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
I can't run into her.

121
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,770
Oh, my goodness!

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,560
Ahjumma, you scared the heck out of me.

123
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,180
You've never seen a facial mask?

124
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,460
Why are you here?

125
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,260
You're here for Bul Ja.

126
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,500
Bul Ja's not here.

127
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,510
Jeez, it's not like that.

128
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,080
I came for plastic bottles.

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,400
- Oh, bottles? 
- Yes.

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,310
Go to the storage. You can find them there.

131
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,770
Thank you.

132
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,530
Don't go around like that.

133
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,380
I can do whatever I want to do at my house.

134
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,050
You just take the bottles.

135
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,520
She always brings up Bul Ja.

136
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,880
Where are the bottles?

137
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
Where are they?

138
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm home.

139
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,580
Oh, no. What timing...

140
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,440
Where to hide?

141
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,250
Jeez.

142
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,270
Not just a pretty face 
but her figure is also...

143
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,410
Oh, my.

144
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,810
Han Ki Joon, what are you 
thinking about? Close your eyes.

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,570
Thank you.

146
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,530
Noona.

147
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,830
They're all loaded.

148
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,770
Yeah. Thank you.

149
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,640
Let's go home.

150
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,980
Noona.

151
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,230
When we go back,

152
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,170
can I drive?

153
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,400
You?

154
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,250
No way. I can't trust you. No way. Never.

155
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,980
Noona.

156
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,430
Noona.

157
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,320
You can teach me, noona.

158
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,490
I said you can't.

159
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,470
Noona.

160
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,020
Noona.

161
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,910
Noona.

162
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,970
- Noona. 
- Jeez.

163
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,710
Okay.

164
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,330
- You'll be responsible for any accidents, okay? 
- Okay.

165
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,770
Hey, why do you keep going straight?

166
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,680
Noona.

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,570
Sorry.

169
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,350
Right.

170
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,950
Stay calm.

171
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,230
This is your last chance.

172
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,050
If you can't get off this time, there's 
no other way to get to the village.

173
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,280
If you get off here, there's a way.

174
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,160
This is your last chance.

175
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,660
Turn on your signal without 
getting flustered.

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,690
Without getting flustered...

177
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,320
Signal.

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,690
There you go. Good. It's flickering.

179
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,950
Now, wait for the right moment 
and start moving to the right.

180
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,480
Just move in, okay?

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,780
- Right. 
- Wait.

182
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,240
Wait.

183
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,220
Wait.

184
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,350
Now!

185
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,500
I just can't! I can't. The car 
behind me is coming too fast.

186
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,480
We are now on the overpass, punk!

187
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,650
Jeez, dang it.

188
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,470
Why did I tell her I liked americano?

189
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,370
I've been drinking it for days.

190
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,140
Wait a second.

191
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,200
I like it.

192
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,350
My sense is so...

193
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,810
Ahjusshi.

194
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,320
Can I borrow your phone?

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,650
Phone? Why?

196
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,290
Just because. Come on.

197
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,850
Hello.

198
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,990
Daddy.

199
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,790
It's me, Eun Woo.

200
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,370
You know, the participation class 
I told you about is tomorrow.

201
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,670
You can make it, right?

202
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't worry. I didn't tell mom.

203
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,130
Okay, then I'll see you tomorrow.

204
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,100
Ahjusshi.

205
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,840
Keep it a secret from my mom.

206
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,410
Okay.

207
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,080
I got it.

208
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,540
You...

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,060
Don't even think about driving again.

210
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,910
Okay.

211
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,690
Noona.

212
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,200
Oh.

214
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,040
Noona.

215
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,910
Over there. Look.

216
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,930
What do you want me to look at now?

217
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,930
Jeez.

218
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,830
Wow, the beach!

219
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,990
Come on, noona.

220
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,080
I don't wanna go.

221
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,880
No way. You must come.

222
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,350
Really. I said I really don't wanna go in.

223
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,740
Noona, you must go into the 
water when you're at the beach.

224
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,760
I just want to take a walk.

225
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,700
Jeez.

226
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,760
You're happy to see the 
ocean thanks to me, right?

227
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,110
Jeez.

228
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,960
What nerve.

229
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,290
Do you know how much you 
shortened my lifespan?

230
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,830
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,870
Don't stay mad.

232
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,530
Jeez, it's nice to see the ocean.

233
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,170
How long has it been?

234
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,940
You smiled.

235
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,700
Right?

236
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,200
You were frowning all day like 
this and you're finally smiling.

237
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,230
Yay! It was worth coming to the ocean!

238
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,900
No one's here.

239
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey.

240
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,020
He wouldn't have destroyed 
our instruments, would he?

241
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,550
Where's Ki Joon anyway?

242
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,640
Forget it.

243
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,120
We have to take them out when 
he's not around. Let's go.

244
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Can't you go alone?

245
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,890
Sure. What?

246
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,140
Come on. Follow me.

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,860
There they are.

248
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,610
Let's hurry and take them.

249
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,930
We don't know what'll happen 
to us if we get caught.

250
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,760
You go ahead.

251
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,190
We finally got it.

252
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,410
Look...

253
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,880
Isn't that a snake?

254
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,340
Snake?

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,530
It looks like an eel.

256
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
It's getting late. Let's go.

257
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,270
Noona.

258
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,100
Shouldn't we eat sashimi 
since we're at the beach?

259
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,010
Sashimi?

260
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,570
I'm hungry.

261
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,090
Let's just have one dish.

262
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,040
Jeez.

263
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,890
Let's just go home and eat.

264
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,810
See?

265
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,320
You're hungry, too.

266
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,970
Noona.

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,750
Let's eat.

268
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,760
Noona.

269
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,490
Huh?

270
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,030
Then...

271
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,990
just one dish, okay?

272
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,740
Cool.

273
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Oh, my.

274
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,570
Sashimi tastes the best at the beach.

275
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,530
Say ah.

276
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,050
It's okay.

277
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,730
I have my own hands.

278
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,660
You're embarrassing my hands.

279
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,390
Say ah.

280
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,250
Ah.

281
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,840
Ah.

282
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,950
Ah.

283
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,210
You eat so well.

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,890
But...

285
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,370
now that we're eating sashimi,

286
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,860
don't you crave soju? 
Let's just have one glass.

287
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,090
Are you crazy? Who'd drive?

288
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,130
And I need to go to Min Ho's school tomorrow.

289
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,380
Just one glass.

290
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,280
Jeez...

291
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,290
Just one glass, okay?

292
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,450
Cheers.

293
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,210
Soju's perfect with sashimi.

294
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,340
Sashiso, Sosashi.

295
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,200
Sosashi. Sosashi.

296
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,170
By the way...

297
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,060
isn't this too little?

298
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,190
Can't we just have one more glass?

299
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,790
Jeez...

300
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,980
I hear there aren't any check points today.

301
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,680
We finished it already.

302
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,530
We still have plenty of food.

303
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,360
Noona.

304
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,160
Can't we have one more bottle?

305
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,200
No way.

306
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,690
Who'll drive?

307
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,240
We can use the driving service like before.

308
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,270
Oh, my...

309
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,980
then just one more bottle?

310
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,480
We're home.

311
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,380
Hi.

312
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,150
What happened to your faces?

313
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,680
We got slapped by eel.

314
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,820
It was fish slap yesterday.

315
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,390
And eel slap today.

316
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Hey, doesn't it hurt less when you 
get slapped by more expensive fish?

317
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,430
Fat chance, punk.

318
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,630
Min Ho, why is your mom so late?

319
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,440
Noona's not home yet?

320
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,130
What about Hyuk and Ki Joon?

321
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,630
I don't know. They're not home yet either.

322
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,230
No...

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,110
No!

324
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,020
There's no way I like Bul Ja.

325
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,710
No way.

326
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,820
But...

327
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,170
[Aunt]

328
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,170
What a relief.

329
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,170
What is?

330
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,780
You seem to feel better.

331
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,050
Because of Min Ho,

332
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,840
you've been frowning all day.

333
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,730
I was worried and bothered.

334
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,880
Aren't you proud of me?

335
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,500
Sure, I'm proud.

336
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,590
Noona, me, too.

337
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,370
What are you doing?

338
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,000
Do what you did to Min Ki earlier.

339
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
Okay.

340
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,670
Hyuk, you did such a good job.

341
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,290
So good.

342
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,040
Satisfied?

343
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,800
You said you're a med student.

344
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,450
Aren't your parents against 
what you're doing now?

345
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,800
My mom passed away and...

346
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,980
as for my dad...

347
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,390
it's like he's not around.

348
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,570
We don't get along. Me and my dad...

349
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,530
Why?

350
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,840
You're not respected...

351
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,810
unless you're a doctor in my family.

352
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,710
He's ashamed of troublemaker like me.

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,060
But...

354
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,980
when did your mom pass away?

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,180
Eight years ago.

356
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,520
She overdosed...

357
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,600
on pills because of her depression.

358
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh, my goodness.

359
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,700
But I didn't even know she was depressed.

360
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,920
My mom also...

361
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,710
pretended to be strong like you all the time.

362
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,540
In this world...

363
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,230
I was the only one who can protect her.

364
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,260
But I couldn't protect her.

365
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,460
So...

366
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,040
I won't make the same mistake again.

367
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,860
You, too...

368
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,510
Depend on me.

369
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,980
When you're tired...

370
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,850
and worn out...

371
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,770
you can depend on me.

372
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,290
I'll protect you.

373
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,120
Depend...

374
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,970
The phone is turned off.

375
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,500
Her phone is turned off.

376
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,430
What's up with Yoon Hee?

377
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,970
Hyuk didn't come home either.

378
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,950
Perhaps...

379
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,000
Aren't they together?

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,260
Jerk.

381
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,200
Wait 'til he comes home...

382
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,510
Good going. A mom sleeping outside the home.

383
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,850
Hey, Little Rockstar.

384
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,120
Going to school?

385
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,640
I'll go to school.

386
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,540
Min Ho.

387
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,880
Let me take you to school today.

388
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,430
Let's go.

389
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,330
Jeez, by the way, what'll we do 
about his participation class?

390
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,740
What the heck is this ahjumma doing?

391
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,080
Oh, my head...

392
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,470
Why am I here?

393
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,580
This is crazy.

394
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
8 o'clock?

395
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,140
Hey.

396
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,750
Hey, hey!

397
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,540
Wake up!

398
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,230
Wake up!

399
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,630
Jeez.

400
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,640
Come on.

401
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,550
Wake up!

402
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,610
What the...

403
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,440
Did we...

404
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,870
...sleep here?

405
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,330
This is nuts. That's why 
we shouldn't have drank.

406
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,240
Nothing good happens when I'm with you.

407
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,320
Right.

408
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,040
Min Ho's participation class is today.

409
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,120
This is crazy.

410
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,180
Oh, my head...

411
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,630
I'm not sure if I can drive.

412
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,320
Noona.

413
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,910
You shouldn't. I'll drive.

414
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,360
Jeez, it's okay. Who are you trying to kill?

415
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,390
Noona, don't worry. Just wear the seatbelt.

416
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,990
Jeez.

417
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,510
Forget it. I can drive.

418
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,550
Noona, trust me.

419
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,370
How can I trust you again?

420
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,100
I'll take off.

421
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:04,890
What the?

422
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,220
You taught me.

423
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,340
Now I'm better.

424
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,210
Hold on tight.

425
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,320
If you embarrass me at school today,

426
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,840
I'll stop going to school, okay?

427
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,630
Okay, I got it.

428
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,640
I got another perm.

429
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,520
You can't come, Mom.

430
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,240
Okay?

431
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,210
Okay, I won't go.

432
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,150
Don't worry. Go and have a nice day.

433
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,050
- Darling. 
- Come on.

434
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,420
Go.

435
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,370
Guys, play with me.

436
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,160
My dad is a CEO.

437
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,730
He has lots of employees. He has a huge car.

438
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,300
Wow, really?

439
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,600
So amazing.

440
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,910
Min Ho.

441
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,930
What about your dad?

442
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,720
He doesn't have a dad.

443
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,670
What?

444
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,340
Is there anyone without a dad in the world?

445
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,400
Teacher's coming in.

446
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,320
Attention.

447
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,330
Greeting.

448
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,920
Hello.

449
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,730
Today, we have a dad participation class.

450
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,820
You know we have one day teacher, right?

451
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,090
Yes!

452
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,290
You must listen to him and behave, okay?

453
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes!

454
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,790
Min Gook's father will teach first period.

455
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,940
Come in please.

456
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,970
He's a grandpa.

457
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,920
Right, he's old.

458
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Hello.

459
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,450
I am Min Gook's dad.

460
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,200
Huh?

461
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Aren't you his grandpa?

462
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,950
I'm going to teach today...

463
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,180
I mean...

464
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,830
Something you like...

465
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,400
How to farm sweet and juicy strawberries.

466
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,870
Quiet.

467
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,900
Strawberries are...

468
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,940
one of the perennial fruit vegetables...

469
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,830
that thrive in cool climate.

470
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,760
Please go on.

471
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,250
What? What's going on?

472
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,270
What?

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,190
Seedlings are...

474
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,140
planted after mid September...

475
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,680
What again?

476
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,830
Father?

477
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,850
What's going on?

478
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,540
I...

479
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,890
Teacher...

480
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,010
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,240
Can I change the subject?

482
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,150
Of course, do as you like.

483
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,550
Thank you.

484
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,680
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,220
What?

486
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,690
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

487
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,540
What this is...

488
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,160
It's "Hello" in Uzbek.

489
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,630
Repeat after me.

490
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,030
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

491
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,560
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

492
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,410
Isn't it fun?

493
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,670
Yes!

494
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,510
Then...

495
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,400
shall we listen to a native speaker?

496
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,500
Yes!

497
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,640
Just a moment please.

498
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Sure.

499
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,210
Darling.

500
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,710
Come in.

501
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,350
Come.

502
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,670
Come in. It's okay.

503
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,660
This is...

504
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,730
Min Gook's mom.

505
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,700
Isn't she pretty?

506
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,130
Yes!

507
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,450
Min Gook's mom...

508
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,570
...is from Uzbekistan.

509
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,450
So, she's fluent in Uzbek.

510
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,000
Listen carefully and repeat, okay?

511
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,540
Yes!

512
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,950
Try it. Do it.

513
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,920
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

514
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,770
"zdra-stvooy-tye"

515
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,720
Then...

516
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,040
this time...

517
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,510
in Uzbekistan...

518
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,010
Kim Tae Hee plows the field, and...

519
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,770
Song Hae Gyo raises sheep?

520
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,410
Shall we listen to that 
from a native speaker?

521
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,940
Sure!

522
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,430
It must be so nice.

523
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,070
It's fun. Do it for them.

524
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,670
Then, Teacher.

525
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,160
How do you say...

526
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,490
"I love you"...

527
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,480
...in Uzbek?

528
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,680
"ya lyublyu tyebya"

529
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,890
Come on. Repeat after her.

530
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,470
"ya lyublyu tyebya"

531
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,200
One more time! What did you say?

532
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,360
"ya lyublyu tyebya"

533
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,860
What?

534
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,560
"ya lyublyu tyebya"

535
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,270
This is so good.

536
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,230
This Rice Winelatte.

537
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,610
This is rather addictive.

538
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,250
Hello.

539
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,130
Who's this?

540
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,050
This is...

541
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,240
...Eun Woo's father.

542
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,310
She made a call...

543
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,920
...with this phone earlier.

544
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,810
Oh, yes.

545
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,250
Hello.

546
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,850
I have an emergency.

547
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,970
I can't go to her school today.

548
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,750
Please tell her I'm very sorry.

549
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,640
Okay, I will.

550
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,770
Thank you.

551
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,140
Then bye.

552
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,170
Okay. Bye.

553
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,600
Jeez, he should've called earlier.

554
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,260
Damn. My ass.

555
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,780
Did you like Min Gook's 
father and mother's class?

556
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,540
Yes!

557
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,840
A big round of applause!

558
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,000
Next is Eun Woo's dad's 
turn, but he's not here yet.

559
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,750
Eun Woo, your dad said 
he'd be here today, right?

560
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,750
Yes, he promised me that 
he'd come. He'll be here.

561
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,350
Who...

562
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,730
I received a call from Eun Woo's father.

563
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,820
He said he can't come 
because of an emergency.

564
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,580
Oh, really?

565
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,180
Instead...

566
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,970
can I do it?

567
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,630
I'm like her uncle.

568
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,230
Oh, really?

569
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,840
It's fine with me.

570
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,040
Okay.

571
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,770
I'll teach you today...

572
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,600
That is...

573
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,710
Jeez.

574
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,180
Right.

575
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,720
I'll teach you how to open rice 
wine bottle without spilling over.

576
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,150
You know, rice wine is...

577
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,920
You need to mix first and drink.

578
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,980
To one direction only...

579
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,670
If you don't want to spill, 
you shake it in one direction.

580
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,690
You shake it like this.

581
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,560
After that...

582
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,130
you twist the cap a little and push the 
belly button. You ask, "Did you eat?"

583
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,390
"Yeah, I did". You get the 
answer and twist the cap again.

584
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,910
Like this. And push the 
belly button. Like this.

585
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,490
And then, now you can open the cap like this.

586
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,110
This...

587
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,970
Oh, my.

588
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,110
This shouldn't have spilt over.

589
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,740
It's because I ran here.

590
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,210
Uncle's way of opening the rice wine 
bottle without spilling over...

591
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,380
How to store rice wine...

592
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,280
and Rice...

593
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,660
It's Rice Winelatte.

594
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,190
Rice Winelatte.

595
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,330
Oh, yes.

596
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,040
You learned how to make Rice Winelatte.

597
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,120
Yes.

598
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,730
It's Min Ho's turn next.

599
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,240
Min Ho, your mom's not here yet.

600
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,330
Well...

601
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,640
She can't come because she's busy.

602
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,050
Oh, really?

603
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,980
Today's dad participation class is completed.

604
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,370
Wait! Wow. Jeez.

605
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,990
My heart...

606
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,720
Hyung!

607
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,120
I...

608
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,280
I am Min Ho's uncle.

609
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,360
Can an uncle participate in 
the dad participation class?

610
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,060
Huh?

611
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,230
Oh, sure.

612
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,670
Really? Thank you.

613
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,280
Hey, kids.

614
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,890
This is a music class.

615
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,640
Special...

616
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,110
Rock and roll!

617
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,380
I'll invite you to...

618
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,070
the world of rock and roll.

619
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,850
Let's go.

620
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,820
Everyone, get up!

621
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,020
Shake like this.

622
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,340
Oh, yeah. Everybody, rock and roll!

623
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,050
Shake your head like this.

624
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,740
Noona.

625
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,370
What are you doing? You're in a hurry.

626
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,850
- Run. Go. 
- Huh?

627
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,740
Hurry up.

628
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,450
Rock and roll!

629
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,270
Yeah!

630
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,190
Come on.

631
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,130
Shake your head like this.

632
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,410
Eun Woo.

633
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,250
Eun Woo!

634
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,650
Listen to me, Eun Woo.

635
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,090
That punk...

636
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,200
Min Gook.

637
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,840
How did your mom and dad do today?

638
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,720
Weren't we great?

639
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,430
Yes, kids had so much fun.

640
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,630
They said you're super pretty, Mom.

641
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,920
Really?

642
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,550
Shall we go to town and eat 
some pork ribs you love?

643
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,630
Pork ribs?

644
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,020
Come on. Let's go.

645
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,970
Let's go!

646
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,600
Where were you yesterday?

647
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,360
That...

648
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,590
We went to the beach...

649
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,280
...inadvertently.

650
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,830
We had a drink inadvertently.

651
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,450
Good going, a mom... You really...

652
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm sorry.

653
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,320
Min Ho.

654
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,180
I'm so sorry.

655
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,960
No, it was so fun because of Min Ki hyung.

656
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,570
Mom.

657
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,170
We're going on a picnic tomorrow. 
Can I go with Min Ki hyung?

658
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,980
You can't. He's busy.

659
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,400
I can go.

660
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,810
I worked so hard.

661
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,280
I can take a day off. It's okay, it's okay.

662
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,940
Really?

663
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,250
Wow, you're the man. High-five!

664
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,240
I'm so happy. Min Ki hyung's the best!

665
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,330
Thank you.

666
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,510
Don't mention it.

667
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,730
It's nothing.

668
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,570
I mean it.

669
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,830
I really appreciate it.

670
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,450
Min Ho, let me go with you.

671
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,070
So sly...

672
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,310
You scared me.

673
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,630
What are you talking about?

674
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,000
You're so sly, jerk.

675
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,690
He's really...

676
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,810
Hi, Yoo Na.

677
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,680
What's up?

678
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,910
Nothing.

679
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,980
I just thought of you.

680
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,860
How's your country life?

681
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,800
It's good.

682
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,850
The cabbages are...

683
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,800
...growing so fast.

684
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,100
That's great.

685
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,700
Should I...

686
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,160
quit being a singer...

687
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,710
and become a farmer like you?

688
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,140
What are you talking about?

689
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,400
Just because...

690
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,150
I'm just getting tired of this.

691
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,300
You're full of it. I'm growing 
cabbages to make an album.

692
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,530
You, wait right there.

693
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,250
I'll be up there soon.

694
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,630
Okay.

695
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,270
I have a shoot. I have to go.

696
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,970
Why don't you answer my call?

697
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,030
The CEO wants me to bring you.

698
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,300
I said I won't go to a party like that.

699
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,310
They are heirs to well-known conglomerates.

700
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,870
There's no harm looking good to them.

701
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,090
Do you want me to be 
treated like a toy again?

702
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,710
Moreover, they do drugs. You know that?

703
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,570
Just go along with the atmosphere.

704
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,810
Others are dying to go there.

705
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,650
Then take whoever is dying to go there.

706
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,930
Hey, are you really gonna be this way?

707
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,220
Yoo Na.

708
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,170
I really hate this.

709
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,520
The CEO wants to bring you no matter what.

710
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,390
For my sake,

711
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,400
please go today.

712
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,940
Please?

713
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,810
I hate Dad!

714
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,220
Dad is bad!

715
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,750
Well...

716
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,210
He had an emergency.

717
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,960
He's really sorry.

718
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,950
So, don't hate him, okay? Understand?

719
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,660
Stop crying.

720
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,950
What are you talking about?

721
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,050
Mi Young.

722
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,220
What do you mean Dad?

723
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,480
Did you call Dad?

724
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,530
You know...

725
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,260
It's not her fault.

726
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,030
I... I called him.

727
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,600
I heard about the dad participation class.

728
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,340
What?

729
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,040
Who are you to do that? How dare you?

730
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,870
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,470
You think saying sorry is enough?

732
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,040
Let's say she's just being immature. 
You should've stopped her.

733
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,940
Okay.

734
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,410
I was thoughtless.

735
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,380
I'll go.

737
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,170
Eun Woo, I'll go.

738
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,060
Don't make her cry.

739
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,450
It's warm. So warm.

740
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,240
So good. Jeez, so nice.

741
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,060
Thanks.

742
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,830
You know...

743
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,670
About today...

744
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,470
Thank you so much.

745
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,550
I said don't mention it.

746
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,250
I'm glad Min Ho liked it.

747
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,100
I know.

748
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,490
I don't even know when was the last 
time I saw him smiling like that.

749
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,470
It's been so long since 
I saw you smiling, too.

750
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,270
So...

751
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,800
don't frown. Keep smiling like that.

752
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,050
You know...

753
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,570
can I ask you something?

754
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,720
What?

755
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm grateful you're being 
nice to Min Ho and me.

756
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,210
What's your intention though?

757
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,830
What intention?

758
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,410
If you don't look good,

759
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,220
it bothers me.

760
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,890
If you cry,

761
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm sad, too.

762
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,580
If you smile,

763
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,930
I'm happy, too.

764
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
I wish you happiness.

765
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,210
You're my first love. I should 
offer some after service, you know.

766
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,910
It's cold. I'll go in. Goodnight.

767
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,130
Okay. Go inside.

768
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,320
Mi Young.

769
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,620
What are you doing at this hour?

770
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,800
I'm sorry...

771
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,110
...about earlier.

772
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,080
Not at all.

773
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,360
I overstepped my boundary.

774
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,460
It's all my fault.

775
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,330
No, I was too much.

776
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,060
It's okay.

777
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
I understand you.

778
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,490
Let me have one.

779
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,380
Sure.

780
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,800
I was busy fighting when I was married.

781
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,570
He had so many women.

782
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:43,570
I lived like that from the moment I got 
married 'til the moment I divorced.

783
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,140
For Eun Woo's sake,

784
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,180
I endured...

785
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,370
endured...

786
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,500
...and endured.

787
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,220
I couldn't stand it.

788
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,780
When I asked for a divorce,

789
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,870
he threw money at me and signed the 
paper as if he was waiting for it.

790
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,790
This is...

791
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,260
the punishment I got for leaving you.

792
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,130
What are you saying?

793
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,160
What kind of life is this?

794
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,500
Don't cry.

795
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,120
Don't...

796
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,530
Jeez.

797
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,980
Oppa...

798
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,960
Oppa...

799
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,520
Stop it.

800
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,780
It's all in the past.

801
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,600
Don't say...

802
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:49,190
Why am I sleepy at the start of the day?

803
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,440
Jeez, I might just fall asleep.

804
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,960
I'm so sleepy. So sleepy.

805
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,770
What's all this mess?

806
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,720
They should've cleaned after 
themselves. Who did this?

807
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,320
Crazy jerk. He left a sock.

808
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,230
Jeez, so crazy.

809
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,540
Jeez.

810
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,880
Oh, my...

811
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,900
Ki Joon, come here and eat.

812
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,050
Hey.

813
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,470
Ki Joon!

814
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,170
What's wrong with you? 
Looking like a ghost...

815
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,890
I said it's nothing.

816
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,100
Why can't I daydream?

817
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,690
Never mind. Why are you 
getting mad at me, jerk?

818
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,200
It's because you keep saying absurd things.

819
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:58,830
A group of heirs to the conglomerates were 
smoking marijuana in Seoul and got arrested.

820
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,720
[Singer Yoo Na caught smoking 
marijuana with heirs.]

821
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,450
The famous singer, Yoo Na 
was with them at the scene.

822
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,220
Hyung, look at this.

823
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,650
The test results were negative 
and she was sent home tonight.

824
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,300
However...

825
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,920
it's expected to have a 
negative impact on her image.

826
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,680
Noona, I'm sorry.

827
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,020
I don't think I can go today.

828
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,560
Aren't they ever gonna sleep?

829
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,120
They're camping out in front of the agency.

830
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,420
All scheduled events are canceled.

831
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,030
The advertisers are threatening 
to sue us for breach of contract.

832
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,160
What should we do?

833
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,120
We totally stepped in shit.

834
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,900
Why did you get involved 
in a marijuana scandal?

835
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,500
Where are you going?

836
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,420
To the bathroom.

837
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,180
Min Ki.

838
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,160
Follow me.

839
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,200
Where did Min Ki hyung go?

840
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,090
Did he go to Yoo Na noona?

841
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,670
No way.

842
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,080
What can he do even if he goes to her?

843
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,230
By the way...

844
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,360
do you know the singer on the news earlier?

845
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,570
Yeah, we were apprentices together.

846
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,800
Really?

847
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,240
Right.

848
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,550
You guys said you were singers before.

849
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,110
Yes.

850
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,210
We failed, but...

851
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,750
What are you doing?

852
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,340
Ah...

853
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,530
It's Sang Eun's birthday tomorrow.

854
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,240
Sang Eun?

855
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,110
That idol wannabe?

856
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,420
Why do you care for her birthday?

857
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,160
You don't need to know.

858
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,630
Right.

859
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,960
I don't need to know.

860
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,760
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,910
Oh, my... my puppy.

862
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,000
Did you have fun at the picnic?

863
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,370
No.

864
00:45:59,370 --> 00:45:59,970
Why not?

865
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,470
Did you fight with your friend?

866
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,010
No.

867
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,540
But is Min Ki hyung home yet?

868
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,190
Huh?

869
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,970
He's not here yet.

870
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,370
Dad.

871
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,090
Tomorrow, you're going to Seoul 
direct marketplace, right?

872
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,500
On the way home,

873
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,010
buy me a cell phone...

874
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,830
for my birthday gift.

875
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,510
Why?

876
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,140
What's wrong with listening to music?

877
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,160
You always say you have no money.

878
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,910
Fine. Forget it.

879
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,130
I'm an idiot to expect anything from you.

880
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,680
Frustrating. Jeez.

881
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,030
Damn it. Why do rocks keep coming out?

882
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,500
Was this place a quarry or something?

883
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,530
Let's take a break, hyungnim.

884
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,030
Jeez, sure.

885
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,200
Why did I even start doing this 
"weekend farm" thing anyway?

886
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,640
Hyungnim.

887
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,310
Where are you going?

888
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,430
Hey, I'll be right back.

889
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,180
You two, pick out rocks.

890
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,560
Excuse me.

891
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,050
You're In Ki, right?

892
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,840
You're Han In Ki, right?

893
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,480
Don't you recognize me?

894
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,690
It's me.

895
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,650
Seung Chul.

896
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,020
Where are you going, punk?

897
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,850
We have a lot to talk about.

898
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,080
What the heck are you doing?

899
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,730
Are you teasing me?

900
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,570
What the heck?

901
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,180
What's wrong with you?

902
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,560
Huh?

903
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,350
[I'm sorry.]

904
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,110
You think saying sorry is enough?

905
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:36,630
Huh?

906
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,450
Do you even know what happened 
to us after you disappeared?

907
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,530
Sang Pil drives a taxi and 
Gun Tae sells fruits on a truck.

908
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,240
I became a loan shark who lends money...

909
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,760
and live off interest, punk.

910
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,050
Hey.

911
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,680
Tell me.

912
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,110
Why did you disappear 
without a word back then?

913
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,810
Jeez, punk...

914
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,260
You must have a glamorous life after 
you ruined others' lives like that.

915
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,590
What kind of life is this?

916
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,620
Tell me.

917
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,010
Why did you do that?

918
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,170
Huh?

919
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,160
Is it...

920
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,490
...because of Sook Kyung?

921
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,530
[Practice is the only way. 
Let's not get lazy smiling.]

922
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,750
Hey, hey.

923
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,280
Are you all ready?

924
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,050
Yes, we are.

925
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,400
You know the Dream Record 
CEO is coming today.

926
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,530
If you do well,

927
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,240
you'll make a debut. Debut!

928
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,620
Debut! Debut!

929
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,990
Hyung, don't you worry.

930
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,530
We have In Ki, you know. Right?

931
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:57,180
If In Ki's on stage, everyone will die!

932
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,040
In Ki.

933
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
You can do well, right?

934
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,360
Don't worry.

935
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,320
I'll pretend this is my last 
chance and do it for my life.

936
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,470
Let's succeed and...

937
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,500
...have a good life, okay?

938
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,340
Let's stop living in a basement 
and breathing in all that dust.

939
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,590
Jeez, that damn ramen. 
I'm so sick and tired of it.

940
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,920
Right, we're counting on you. Okay?

941
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,580
- Okay. 
- We only got In Ki.

942
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:23,620
Hello.

943
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,160
Yes.

944
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,570
Hold on a second.

945
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,340
In Ki.

946
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,080
Take the call.

947
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,720
Hello.

948
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,950
Yes.

949
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,300
What?

950
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,110
Hey, where are you going?

951
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,960
Sook Kyung...

952
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,210
...collapsed.

953
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,190
I gotta go.

954
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,770
Punk.

955
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,550
Are we in a situation to think about that?

956
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,830
If you go now, it's all over for us. Over.

957
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,010
I'm sorry.

958
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,830
You punk...

959
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,960
Hey, In Ki!

960
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,670
Han In Ki!

961
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,440
Um...

962
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,160
Yoon Sook Kyung...

963
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,980
Where is she?

964
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:24,630
Oh...

965
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,320
Are you Yoon Sook Kyung's guardian?

966
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,200
Yes.

967
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,100
Come this way.

968
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,690
Congratulations, Yoon Sook Kyung.

969
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,490
You just delivered a princess.

970
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,370
Dear.

971
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,070
Are you okay?

972
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,860
Dear...

973
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,630
Thank you, honey.

974
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,810
Your performance...

975
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,010
You want to hold the baby?

976
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,480
Excuse me? Yes.

977
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,930
She's bleeding.

978
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,730
Check her blood pressure.

979
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,710
Are you okay?

980
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:21,430
Hello!

981
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,120
Her blood pressure is going down.

982
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,300
There's no way.

983
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,010
Let the guardian out. Prepare for surgery.

984
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:26,780
Hand over the baby.

985
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,860
You must leave now. Right now.

986
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,090
Sook Kyung.

987
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:30,860
Sook Kyung!

988
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,910
Sook Kyung!

989
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,690
Oh, no! Sook Kyung!

990
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,710
Sook Kyung!

991
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,660
Sook Kyung!

992
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,400
Sook Kyung!

993
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,300
So, you live like this because of that?

994
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:56,820
That's why you ruined your friends' lives 
and live in this remote country, punk?

995
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,510
[I'm sorry.]

996
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,230
Sook Kyung...

997
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,370
...died because of me.

998
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,340
Why is it because of you?

999
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,490
Your wife died while giving 
birth. Why is it your fault?

1000
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,070
Where am I supposed to dig today?

1001
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,270
I paint during the day and dig at night.

1002
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,680
I'll die of fatigue even 
before I find the money.

1003
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,890
Hello.

1004
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:15,950
I told you not to call me.

1005
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,460
Did they...

1006
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,480
...come again?

1007
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,060
Don't even talk about it.

1008
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,970
They come whenever and...

1009
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,120
threaten me to spill where you are.

1010
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,490
You're having a hard time because of me.

1011
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:31,360
I'm sorry.

1012
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,660
But...

1013
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,000
where are you anyway?

1014
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,880
That...

1015
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,570
I'll explain later. Later.

1016
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,870
Okay, wench.

1017
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,790
Anyway, take care.

1018
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:45,930
If anything happens,

1019
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,940
call me, okay?

1020
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,970
Okay.

1021
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,520
Forget it.

1022
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,970
You don't need to explain.

1023
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,520
Now that I think about it,

1024
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,730
I understand everything.

1025
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,910
The reason why you never told me about mom...

1026
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,810
The reason why you never bought 
a cake on my birthday...

1027
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:54,910
My birthday...

1028
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,280
...is mom's memorial day.

1029
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,580
It's all because of me.

1030
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,370
If I had not been born,

1031
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,770
mom wouldn't have died...

1032
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,300
and you wouldn't be like this.

1033
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,350
I'm so sorry, Dad.

1034
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,900
Let go.

1035
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,910
I don't want to talk to you right now.

1036
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,270
Sang Eun.

1037
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,640
Sang Eun!

1038
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,500
It's not you.

1039
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:20,990
Mom?

1040
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,550
Why are you coming out?

1041
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,410
Go inside and rest.

1042
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,430
I'm fine.

1043
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,680
By the way...

1044
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,310
You have an important performance today.

1045
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,450
Yes.

1046
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,720
The CEO of an agency who 
is interested in our band

1047
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,690
is coming to see us.

1048
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,690
If things work out,

1049
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,260
we might be able to make an album.

1050
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,630
Great!

1051
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,200
Do a great job today.

1052
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,760
Fighting!

1053
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,560
You know...

1054
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,500
If things don't go well this time,

1055
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,130
I'll give up on music.

1056
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,100
Endure a little longer.

1057
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,610
Don't say such a thing.

1058
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,820
I trust you. Never give up.

1059
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,540
Okay?

1060
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,560
Thank you.

1061
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,070
I'll get going.

1062
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,020
Wait a second.

1063
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,480
It's okay. I don't need money.

1064
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,090
Men shouldn't go around with empty pockets.

1065
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,500
If it works out,

1066
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,260
have a drink with the members.

1067
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,440
I'm sorry. You're suffering because of me.

1068
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,820
I can't face you.

1069
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,230
What hardship?

1070
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,050
Hurry up. Go.

1071
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:48,780
Leave, honey.

1072
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,740
Okay. Anyway...

1073
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,950
I'll be back.

1074
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,200
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1075
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,090
Do a great job. Fighting!

1076
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:54,940
- Go inside. 
- Okay.

1077
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,240
Straighten your shoulders.

1078
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,110
- Sure. 
- Your hair.

1079
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm back.

1080
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,410
Jeez, your husband is so shameless.

1081
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:27,550
How can he make his wife 
work who's about to deliver?

1082
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,120
Don't say things like that.

1083
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,930
My husband will soon...

1084
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,270
become more famous than Cho Yongpil.

1085
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,370
Cho Yongpil, my ass.

1086
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,930
He's a musician who can't even make a living.

1087
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,280
Don't be like that.

1088
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,600
My baby might hear that.

1089
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,250
Oh, baby.

1090
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,200
Your daddy is a great man.

1091
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,930
Then...

1092
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,320
I'll clean up the rest.

1093
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,840
Okay, take it inside.

1094
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,880
Sook Kyung!

1095
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,410
It's...

1096
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,960
It's all my fault.

1097
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,810
I...

1098
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,910
I wanted to make music...

1099
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,480
If I didn't insist...

1100
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,010
your mom...

1101
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,600
I...

1102
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,430
I killed her.

1103
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,120
No.

1104
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:58,000
You didn't.

1105
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,690
Hey.

1106
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,030
Hey, be gentle.

1107
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,790
If you damage it, you can't 
sell it at the market tomorrow.

1108
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:14,580
Okay.

1109
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,440
Mom.

1110
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,520
Can you call Min Ki hyung 
and ask when he'll be back?

1111
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,910
He'll come when it's time.

1112
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,370
Min Ho, it's cold. Go inside.

1113
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,390
No, I don't want to.

1114
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,590
I'll wait until he comes home.

1115
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,680
It's Min Ki hyung.

1116
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,010
Min Ki hyung!

1117
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,080
Hey.

1118
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,230
It's Yoo Na!

1119
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,530
I'm sorry, noona.

1120
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,990
Let her stay for a few 
days. She has her reasons.

1121
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,740
A princess has come.

1122
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,840
Why are you talking like that?

1123
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,730
Don't like me. I said we can't be.

1124
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,110
What kind of relationship does 
that woman and Soo Yun have?

1125
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,830
It doesn't make sense at all.

1126
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,230
What did I do wrong to you, Ki Joon?

1127
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,650
Don't look at other men. Don't 
talk to them. Don't smile at them.

1128
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,140
Excuse me?

1129
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,380
You should've cared for her.

1130
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,240
Am I her maid or something? You do it then.
