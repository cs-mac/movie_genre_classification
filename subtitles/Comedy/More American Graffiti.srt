It's</i> a <i>little pig with wings.</i>

00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,704
<i>Next up on this
last day of the year,</i>

3
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,411
<i>our undefeated track champion for
all of 1964, John Milner.</i>

4
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,254
Hey, hey, hey.
You're looking real good there, Roger.

5
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,591
- I'm gonna beat you today, Milner.
- I'd like to see you win once.

6
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,177
Especially since this is gonna be
your last chance.

7
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,351
What do you mean?

8
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,681
I mean I'm gonna be
riding with the factory from now on.

9
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,890
The big time, you know?

10
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,772
But don't let that upset you.
It might throw your timing off.

11
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,279
You got the
Wolfman Jack Show, <i>baby.</i>

12
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,700
<i>Gonna get it on together. Can you dig it?</i>

13
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,996
<i>Martha and the Vandellas
on the last day of the year 1964.</i>

14
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,867
Do you have my wallet?

15
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,167
I thought you got
it off the cupboard.

16
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,712
- No, I don't. It must be in there.
- Laurie, I got it.

17
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,710
- No.
- No, no, no. It's all right. I got it.

18
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,838
- No sweat. Forget it.
- We're gonna be late.

19
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,636
- You're driving without your license?
- I thought I had it.

20
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,309
<i>Beckwith beats Milner.
He held the holeshot all the way through.</i>

21
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,637
Come on, let's go. We're late.

22
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,277
- We have Hawaiian Punch.
- This'll just take a second.

23
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,854
Give it to me.

24
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,653
No sweat.

25
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,459
Whoa! Hey, Johnny!

26
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,131
Damn, I kicked your <i>ass,</i> didn't I?
First time, too. I got you good, buddy.

27
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,208
- Beat it.
- What?

28
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,385
Hey, what happened anyway?

29
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,551
I came out of the hole a little fast.
I had some wheel shake. That's all.

30
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,927
Oh, yeah? You know what I think?

31
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,385
I think the damn factory guys
are coming after the wrong man.

32
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,220
- Hey, Beckwith!
- Hey!

33
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,265
Thompson, did you see me wipe him out?

34
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,600
Hey, John. John.

35
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,108
Hey! The gang's all here. All right. Hi.

36
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,064
- Hi.
- How's it going?

37
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,366
Well, I lost a race.

38
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,910
You lost? Man, you never lost!

39
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,739
No big deal.
Was just a preliminary run anyway.

40
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,869
Ah, good.

41
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,666
Laurie, you're looking prettier than ever.

42
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,494
- Nah, I look fat.
- Just a little chunky.

43
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,172
Doctor says it might be twins.

44
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,624
- Really'?
- That's right.

45
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,798
Got my orders.

46
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,751
- Yeah?
- Leaving tonight.

47
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,886
- Where to?
- Vietnam.

48
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,633
That's right.
Uncle Sam <i>says,</i> "I need the Toad."

00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,595
"Only way we're gonna win this one,
get the Toad in there."

50
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,725
Gonna go kick some ass, huh?

51
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,933
Kick ass, take names
and eat Cong for breakfast.

52
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,305
Baby, I'm coming home.

53
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,182
Terrific.

54
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,684
Terrific!

55
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,952
Jammed. Jammed!

56
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,958
Typical. Typical!

57
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,502
The gun don't work. Nothing works.

58
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,337
Sniper!

59
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,758
- Sniper!
- Beautiful. It's me, you idiot!

60
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,723
Cease firing! Oh, boy. Oh, terrific.

61
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,351
Keep down, sir. We can't afford
to lose a United States congressman.

62
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,901
Red Two, give me that arms call.

63
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,653
- Calling.
- Fire!

64
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,946
Hold your fire! Hold your...

65
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,201
Jesus Christ!

66
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,953
- What's going on?
- Keep down, sir.

67
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,465
Red Two, give me that arms call.
Keep down, sir.

68
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,139
It's me out here! What are you doing?

69
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,350
Knock it off.

70
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,361
Cease fire!

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,527
All right, Red!

72
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,859
Red One, fire on Concentration Blue.

73
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,990
Keep back, sir. Keep back.

74
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,289
<i>Roger, Six. Commencing dive now.</i>

75
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:41,499
You know,
New Year's is really depressing for me.

76
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,053
It's really weird but I have lost
two friends on New Year's Eve.

77
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,008
Last year it was
this old boyfriend of mine, Terry.

78
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,225
He was really sweet.
He wanted to get married to me.

79
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,898
- Guess what?
- What?

80
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,022
Ralph and Nance got married.

81
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,611
Yeah?

82
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,486
Mmm-hmm. In Golden Gate Park on the 24th.
It was really groovy.

83
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,284
- Acid in the punch?
- I don't know.

84
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,206
- You know what? I've been thinking, Lance.
- What?

85
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,085
I've been thinking
we could have something like that.

86
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,583
- Acid.
- No!

87
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,044
Have a ceremony like that.

88
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,003
- Like what?
- Marriage.

89
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,682
I was thinking we could have it
on the top of Mount Tam at sunset,

90
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,977
which would be really groovy
for a Gemini and a Libra.

91
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,804
We could write our own ceremony.

92
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,640
Dave Freeland just got his papers
from the Universal Life Church,

93
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,021
so he could say the words.

94
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,731
I could wear that white,
antique velvet dress that I have.

95
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,902
What do you think?

96
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,444
Wow. Here.

97
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,822
Oh, Jesus, a cop! Ow!

98
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,416
I have to swallow it.

99
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,452
Uh...

100
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,041
Yes, sir.

101
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,003
- Pull over there.
- Can't find the brake.

102
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,880
Here. Swallow this. Swallow this.

103
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,960
Uh...

104
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,754
We're trying to.

105
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,053
What do you want me to do,
stop right here in the middle of the road?

106
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,351
- Don't you have any respect for the law?
- Keep going.

107
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:20,181
What kind of law officer are you
if you don't have respect for the law?

108
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,515
Nothing?

109
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,600
Gun it.

110
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,903
Go ahead. Why don't you shoot me, huh?

111
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,778
- I said stop!
- Kill maybe three, four innocent people.

112
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,200
- Go ahead.
- It's all right. It's cool.

113
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,073
Roll the window down.

114
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,038
Sorry to disappoint you, Officer,
but we're on the natch.

115
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,964
Oh, yeah? What have we got here?

116
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,675
Looks like a narcotic substance to me.

117
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,096
- It's one lousy joint.
- You're under arrest, friend.

118
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,766
Come on, man. You got nothing better to do
than hassle longhairs?

119
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,185
My life, friend. I love my work.

120
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,309
Will you take down his number?

121
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,608
Make it easy for you, lady. It's 54362.

122
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,905
Name is Falfa. Officer Falfa. F-A-L-F-A.

123
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,941
I'm telling you, Lance,
we gotta get out of this city.

124
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,073
We gotta get married and
get out of this city.

125
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,157
- For sure.
- You do? You do wanna get married?

126
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,998
Bail me out, huh, and we'll talk about it.

127
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,762
<i>WOLFMAN JACK". Boy, this is a great
tune for the last day of 1967.</i>

Ow!

130
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,406
Feel better now?
You wanna act like an idiot? Terrific.

131
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,119
You like wasting money? I got something
you're really gonna like to break.

132
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,165
What's that?

133
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,336
Take this. This is real expensive.
Break that.

134
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,795
God damn it. What are you, crazy?
That's your mother's wedding present.

135
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,341
She's gonna come over here
and want to have tea...

136
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,385
Then you'll explain it to her, won't you?

137
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,007
Are you guys having a fight?

138
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,349
Hey, kiddo. No, Mom and I aren't fighting.

139
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,769
- We're having an adult conversation.
- I heard something break.

140
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,515
Yes, well, Mommy just tripped
and broke a glass, that's all, sweetheart.

141

<i>Say, isn't it time for Mister Rogers?</i>

142
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,444
Why don't you and your brother go watch
<i>Mister</i> Rogers? Take Duckers and go on.

143
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,896
Go on, Mark.

I mean, I work my butt off.

I'm not gonna stand around and have you
all of a sudden decide that...

147
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,712
I don't wanna watch <i>Mister</i> Rogers.
I wanna watch cartoons.

148
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,508
Well then watch cartoons, sweetheart,
but let Mommy and Daddy talk, okay?

149
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,130
Why are you crying?

150
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,928
I'm not crying, honey,
I've just been peeling onions. Now, go on.

151
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,091
- I hate onions.
- I know, sweetheart. Go on.

152
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,808
What about them, huh?

153
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,349
I'm not gonna stand for it.

00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,355
I'm not gonna have my kid
brought up by babysitters.

155
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,528
It's just three hours a day
at a nursery school.

156
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,526
Steven, it'd be so good for them.

157
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,528
The best thing for any kid is their mother.

158
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,655
You don't understand.
I want to be more than a mother.

159
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,111
You are more than a mother. You're a wife.

160
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,578
- I can't believe you!
- Are you gonna hit me with that?

161
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,670
I wanna go to work! We need the money!

162
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,917
You're pissing me off!

163
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,920
It's just three hours a day
in Dr. Martin's office. That's all it is.

164
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,969
It's not three hours anywhere. It's here.
Taking care of your kids.

165
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,796
- Mary-Jo worked...
- That's the bottom line.

166
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,847
End of the conversation.

167
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,925
Not another word.

168
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,727
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

169
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,654
- Oh, yeah? Where are you going?
- My brother's.

170
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,736
Curt? Great. Curt's in Canada.

171
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,567
Well, Andy's at school.

172
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,243
But what about our New Year's party?

173
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,996
- Can I go to work?
- Absolutely not.

174
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,619
Then screw the New Year's party!

175
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:13,288
<i>You got the Wolfman Jack
Show on the last day of the year 1964.</i>

176
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,638
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

177
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,181
Milner, here's your car.

178
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,055
I hope it fits my ass.

179
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,102
You're gonna look great
sitting behind the wheel, John.

180
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,147
Yeah, I'm gonna look great standing beside
it at the winner's circle, too.

181
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,816
You can't even beat me. I don't know
what the hell they want with you.

182
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,941
Hey, Mr. Hunt. Here's your new driver.

183
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,193
- New driver?
- Milner. How are you, sir?

184
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,652
Oh, John Milner, right.
Come with me, will you?

185
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,362
What did you think of those radio spots?

186
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,872
Guy at the station thought up that "Madman"
business. John "the Madman" Milner.

187
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,372
Hope you don't mind.

188
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,957
Anyway, the reason I wrote you the letter was
I need you to sign a release for the ad.

189
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,086
Sit down.

190
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,045
You know,
giving us permission to use your name.

191
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,553
There's a $20 honorarium.
Just give me your signature.

192
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,556
What's wrong? It's just a simple release.

193
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,936
But your letter said you wanted to welcome
me on to the Hunt Brothers' racing team.

194
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,185
Everybody knows
you're looking for a new driver.

195
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,691
No, that's a figure of speech.

196
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,944
I mean, you were in the ad,
so you're on the team. Okay?

197
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,946
But that's bullshit.

198
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,996
Come on. You didn't think we were gonna
hire you to race for us, did you?

199
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,743
Why not? I'm the best out here.

200
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,835
Come on. These are just hobby racers.
This is a whole different league.

201
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,006
Look. I can beat anybody off the line, and
that includes this clown you've got driving.

202
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,550
And I just turned 190.77
in a car I built myself.

203
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,880
Give me your signature, champ.

204
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,718
I'll tell you what.

205
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,266
I'm not gonna sign it, but why don't you
light it on fire and stick it up your <i>ass'?</i>

206
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,856
- Hey, what's the matter with him?
- John, what's up?

207
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,863
Relax, kid. Win a few
races, then come back.

208
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,111
Yeah, John, just win a few races.

209
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,199
Hey, look, buddy. We'll see about that.
I'm gonna beat you today.

210
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,248
Come on, man.
You're gonna cream those guys, no problem.

211
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,293
John, we're gonna have to
get him back to the base.

212
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,544
Sure you don't wanna come along?

213
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,126
I'd like to, Steve, but I
got some races to win.

214
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,211
I gotta beat the factory.

215
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,718
Hey, look.

216
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,683
I want you to keep this.
Take that with you.

217
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,807
That's from when my flywheel
blew up, remember?

218
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,270
Hey, that's great. Man,
that's really great.

219
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,187
Hell, you know what I'm gonna do for you?

220
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,614
I'm gonna capture you a VC flag.

221
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,358
Nah, don't do that, man.

222
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,827
Just come back alive.

223
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,798
- Mess with the bull, you get the horn.
- Nobody could survive an hour of that.

224
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,512
Hold on.
I think there's another one out there, sir.

225
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,312
- Hey, man, that's Fields.
- What are you doing out there?

226
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,642
Fields!

227
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,980
- Fields? Who's Fields?
- He's one of ours, sir.

228
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,695
American soldiers
have a knack for survival, sir.

229
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,990
Well, let's go meet the boy.

230
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,906
What the hell were you doing out there?

231
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,366
Well, sir...

232
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, I don't know, sir.

233
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,629
I was just kind of cleaning my rifle
and it sort of went off.

234
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,423
And I guess these guys
must have thought I was VC.

235
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,547
- You mean Charlie wasn't out there?
- No, sir.

236
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,632
- And you...
- Major!

237
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,139
You say you saw
about a dozen of the enemy?

238
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,218
Uh...

239
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,644
Yes, sir.

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,687
How about the body count?

241
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,858
Tell the congressman here
about the body count.

242
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,269
Oh! Ah...

243
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,649
The best. Absolutely the best, sir.

244
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,322
There were guts and pieces
all over the place.

245
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,149
Well, how many would you say?

246
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,988
Oh, heck, I don't know. You'd have to
count up all the arms and legs and stuff.

247
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,199
I'd say, two dozen maybe.

248
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,668
Two dozen? That's very good, Fields.

249
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,338
- Yes, excellent. Good work, son.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

250
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,791
Well, I'd better be getting over
to the dispensary now, sir.

251
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,922
- The dispensary?
- Yes, sir.

252
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,964
The little people put up a hell of a fight.
I sustained a wound.

253
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,970
- Where?
- Oh, nothing serious, sir.

254
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,803
I'll be fine after a few days of bed rest
back in the rear.

255
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,388
Let me see it.

256
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,232
Excuse me?

257
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,945
That doesn't look too bad to me, son.

258
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,988
Yes, sir, but there's always
the danger of infection

259
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,192
and it's better to be safe than sorry.

260
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,700
You go have a medic look at it, Fields.
Then report to your unit.

261
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,039
Yes, sir.

262
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,041
Son of a bitch.

263
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,124
What did you say, Major?

264
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,924
I said, it's sort of a beach.
We leveled it!

265
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,588
Hell of a job, men! One hell of a job.

266
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,468
Let's have a drink.

267
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,902
Everybody! Emergency! Emergency!

268
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,698
Lance just got busted again.
I'm $25 short to meet the bail bond.

269
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,072
- Does anybody have any money?
- Out of luck.

270
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,952
If I get a couple of bucks from
each of you, we can bail him out.

271
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,047
Ed, you know he'd help you.

272
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,296
He still owes me 50 bucks
for that key I fronted him.

273
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,879
We just can't let him sit in there.
It's New Year's Eve.

274
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,968
Let him rot.

275
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,765
I just want you to know that
I think this behavior is really crappy

276
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,723
and when it comes time to do any favors,
I'm gonna remember this.

277
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,979
Come on, Debbie. I don't blame him.
Lance is a flake.

278
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,607
Rainbow, I don't appreciate
that kind of talk.

279
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,781
And besides, Lance and I are
thinking about getting married.

280
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,654
Married? What?

281
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,782
Lance has some bread
stashed in here somewhere.

282
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,291
- Damn it! Where is the light switch'?
- Try the switches on the panel.

283
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,833
You can't marry him, Debbie.

284
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,287
You're gonna end up supporting him
for the rest of your life.

285
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,966
I don't mind helping Lance out and I don't
see why it should bother you so much.

286
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,794
I happen to think
working as a topless dancer is creepy.

287
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,006
Maybe that's your hang-up
if you think the human body's creepy.

288
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,260
Besides, the money's great.

289
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,810
If the money is so great,
why don't you have the 25 bucks?

290
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,059
Hey, good idea.
I'll get an advance from my boss.

291
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,442
So Steve doesn't want you to get a job.
Big deal.

292
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,995
- Go home and work it out.
- I can't, Andy. I can't.

293
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,913
Please let me stay here. Please, Andrew.

294
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,993
No. No, go to Mom and Dad's
or go to one of your dopey girlfriends'.

295
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,673
No. No, please, I can't do that.
I won't get in your way, I promise, Andy.

296
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,001
And maybe I could straighten up
this place for you.

297
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,338
No, thanks.
I like this place just the way it is.

298
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,923
- You like living in squalor?
- He loves it.

299
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,761
Yeah, I love it. Every little
piece of trash and rancid dirt.

300
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,646
Now go home.
I was just getting ready to leave.

301
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,938
You know what I think?

302
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,064
I think that Mother and Daddy made a big
mistake letting you come to this school.

303
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,363
Yeah? Well you made a bigger mistake
getting married when you did.

304
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,567
I didn't have to get married.
I didn't have to get married.

305
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,449
No, she didn't have to get married,
the twins just arrived a little early.

306
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,374
Oh, that's funny. That's real funny, Andy.
Thanks a lot.

307
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,075
Here. Finished.

308
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,544
What do you think?

309
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,007
That's lovely. That's lovely.

310
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,051
You're missing the point.

311
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,802
We have to communicate in a vernacular
that the police will understand.

312
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,431
"Pigs eat shit"?

313
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,354
"Pigs eat shit" does not
make an understanding police officer.

314
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,648
You're gonna be in big trouble.

315
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,277
What happened to that sweet little boy
you used to be, huh?

316
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,569
Remember how I used to tease you and tie
those pretty little ribbons in your hair?

317
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,118
- Stop it.
- What's happened to your hair? Look at that.

318
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,740
Andy, come on.

319
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,245
Buck up, kid. It'll be all right.

320
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,457
Yeah. Thanks.

321
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,930
I'll just clean up the place a little bit,
it'll make me feel a lot better.

322
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,848
Don't you dare.

323
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,016
I better find every piece of crap
exactly where I left it.

324
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,029
<i>Holy smokes!
The Marvelettes.</i>

325
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,363
<i>Oh, baby, I love it.</i>

326
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,545
Hi, John. What you doing? Is that nitro?

327
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,299
God, at least you can say hi.

328
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,127
You don't have to take it out
on the whole world

329
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,883
for what happened with the factory.

330
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,464
Get hosed, will you?

331
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,299
You can't believe the
date I had last night.

332
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,728
You know, Earl La Farle,
the guy with the yellow jet?

333
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,523
Talk about crude!
This guy is such an animal...

334
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,560
- Hey, hey!
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

335
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,404
Hey, Carlos, check out my new formula.

336
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,323
80% nitro, 20% Cheetos.

337
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,407
Will you do us a favor, Teensa,
and get out of here!

338
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,165
Okay, if that's the way
you feel, maybe I will.

339
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,334
Come on, Eva, let's bug this pop stand.

340
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,038
Hey, hold it! Hold it.

341
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,928
I'm John Milner,
the owner/driver of this car here.

342
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,349
And this is our team T-shirt.
I'd be deeply honored if you wore it.

343
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,732
Well, I don't do this every day.
The thing cost $3.75. Here.

344
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,023
Nice, huh?

345
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,445
She's a foreigner, John.

346
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,363
She doesn't understand
a single word you're saying.

347
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,737
It's just like <i>as</i> if she was deaf and dumb.

348
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,817
Huh?

349
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,376
See what I'm talking about? I don't know
what she's yapping about either.

350
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,045
What are you doing with her?

351
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,966
My dad. It's like this foreign exchange
program with his Rotary club or something.

352
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,840
At least she's only gonna be here a week.

353
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,466
My last shirt, too.

354
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,220
<i>WOLFMAN JACK". Now we're gonna do the
weather for all the valleys.</i>

355
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:58,149
<i>It's about 200 degrees in Merced,
400 degrees out in Fresno.</i>

356
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,074
All right, my name is Bob Sinclair. I like
to think of myself as tough but fair.

357
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,286
Bob Sinclair, tough but fair.
Hey, that rhymes.

358
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,917
Now, <i>as</i> I was saying,
I'm tough but I'm fair.

359
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,376
We're gonna run a tight ship here.

360
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,086
But it's gonna be
a ship we can all be proud of.

361
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,345
I like a proud crew. Proud of what
they're doing, proud of each other.

362
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,766
Proud of the war they're fighting.

363
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,594
A proud crew is a professional crew.
And a professional crew...

364
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,690
- Who did that?
- A rat smells his own cheese first.

365
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,190
Sorry, sir, but during a time of war,
a soldier gets gas on his stomach.

366
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,369
- What's your name?
- My name? They call me Joe, the Pharaoh.

367
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,077
- See, back home I was a low rider.
- What's your name'?

368
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,250
This is Terry the Toad.
We're from the same home town.

369
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,998
Sir, if I could tell you some stories
about the beavers...

370
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,829
I asked him his name.

371
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,835
Terry Fields. And, sir,

372
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,800
I don't want to disappoint you, sir,

373
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,424
but you got yourself in
with a couple cowards here.

374
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,382
We like things safe and easy. Understand?

375
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,101
Well, I am a little disappointed,
but maybe pride will change attitudes, huh?

376
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,393
Now, since this is my first day
as your new aircraft commander,

377
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,568
I wanted to make it a great day
so I volunteered us for medevac duty.

378
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,361
- You volunteered?
- That's right.

379
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,483
- Now, listen up.
- Shit.

380
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,691
Every time we go out on a mission,

381
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,492
I'm gonna put a little American flag
sticker right here on this door.

382
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:37,077
Now, by the time I've finished my tour,
I want this whole door

383
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,541
and this bulkhead covered with flags.

384
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,372
Volunteered.

385
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,299
Happy goddamn New Year.

386
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:02,140
You want me to lend you $25
so you can bail out your goofy boyfriend

387
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,940
who got beefed for weed?

388
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,236
Yeah, but Ralph, you can take it
out of my next week's paycheck.

389
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,364
Debbie, you oughta stay away from weed. You
know it's gonna lead you into cigarettes.

390
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,283
Yeah, so what about the $25?

391
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,865
I'm gonna tell you something.
Come over here.

392
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,413
This is your lucky day. You know why?

393
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,331
For two reasons.

394
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,160
First of all, I believe in you.

395
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,547
When I believe in someone,
I can't bear to let 'em down.

396
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,714
You know what I mean?

397
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,044
And secondly, I'm gonna make you
the biggest thing in this street.

398
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,552
- How's that grab you?
- Yeah. What with'? Forty pounds of silicone?

399
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:39,727
No. I got something in here
that's gonna make you

400
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,769
bigger than the topless grandmother of six.
Think of that.

401
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,312
- Jesus Christ! That's a snake!
- You bet it is.

402
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,737
I thought we'd call you
Debbie the Topless Snake Charmer.

403
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,567
Are you out of your crummy mind?

404
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,155
I'm not offering you a poisonous snake
to handle. Would I do such a thing?

405
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,162
They're just like dogs. They're very
affectionate. Give him a little scratch.

406
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,245
When I think about that slimy
thing on my... I could just urp.

407
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,288
Why, they're not slimy.

408
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,755
Touch it, scratch it.

409
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,294
- Give him a touch. Come on.
- Ralph!

410
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,503
God, Ralph! That's it. I
quit this gig. I quit.

411
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,921
I quit.

412
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,302
Come on. I've lost two girls tonight.
I really need you.

413
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,726
All right, the snake goes.
I'll never mention it again.

414
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,179
And I'll give you the loan, okay?

415
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,805
You'll make it a gift?

416
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,107
A gift? Are you crazy?

417
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,194
All right, I'll make it a gift.
I'll make it a gift.

418
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,865
Boy, you artists, you're so touchy.

419
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,453
Fido?

420
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,085
Fido? Jesus, I've lost a rented snake.

421
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,628
Fido?

422
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,206
I can't lose a rented snake.

423
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,759
- Yes.
- You like that?

424
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,881
Yeah, I like...

425
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,886
Get out of the way!

426
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,843
Jesus, where'd that come from?

427
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,891
That's my snake. I rented that snake.
I'll have to put that on your tab.

428
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,693
Eat your food, Mark. Don't play with it.

429
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,149
I'm gonna puke.

430
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,281
And don't say "puke," okay? Say "throw up."

431
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,078
That's what I'm gonna do. Puke.

432
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,781
I hate this. Where's Mommy?

433
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,117
- She went shopping.
- She'll be back.

434
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,371
Eat your food, will ya?

435
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,670
I made it for you myself
and it's better for you than that crap.

436
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,746
Bull.

437
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,799
- What did you just say?
- Bull.

438
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,679
Shit.

439
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,590
Come on in. The door's open.

440
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,845
Hello. Yeah, Mary-Jo.

441
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,019
A recipe'? I don't know...

442
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,645
Where do you
want this thing?

443
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,820
Just a second. That's not supposed to
get here until tonight.

444
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:55,896
Didn't my wife tell you that?

445
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,652
We were told now. Where do you want it?

446
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,950
Well, Jesus, it's gonna melt!

447
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,489
I told you I'm turning this off
if you didn't eat.

448
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,790
- Oh, come on, it...
- Look at that.

449
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,631
I can't talk right now. She's not here.
I'll see you tonight.

450
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,177
You fart!

451
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,801
Come on. Where do we put this thing?
This ain't feathers, you know.

452
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,384
I don't care where you put it.
Find a place and you put it down.

453
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,060
This ain't gonna work.

454
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,478
Get your feet out of the fish tank,
Michael. Get 'em out right now.

455
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,898
Laurie, get this straight.
I am a man, you understand that?

456
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,570
And a man has a certain role in life.

457
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,073
<i>And a man goes to work and
he earns money for his family.</i>

458
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,321
And a man is a man.
A man is not a housewife.

459
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,573
A woman is a housewife.

460
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,074
And we're having a party tonight.

461
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,202
And my mother loved being a housewife.
And my mother loved being a mother.

462
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,706
<i>And I'm coming to pick you up right now.
Do you understand that? Answer me.</i>

463
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,503
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

464
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,630
And another thing.
All you really care about is your...

465
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,178
<i>- Laurie, it's me, Andy.</i>
- Oh, <i>hi, Andy. Hi.</i>

466
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,423
- I need my wallet.
- Your wallet?

467
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,804
- Why?
- Because it's an emergency, that's why.

468
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,602
- Tell her you need your driver's license.
- I need my driver's license.

469
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,846
Why?

470
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,519
Because you're staying at my apartment
without my permission,

471
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,316
and you can damn well bring me my wallet.

472
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,564
All right. Okay. Boy, you have a
mean streak running through you.

473
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,738
Where'd you put it?

474
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,112
It's in my sweatshirt
hanging in the corner of the kitchen.

475
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:27,283
Okay. By the way, I cleaned
the apartment just a...

476
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,534
Hello?

477
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,835
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

478
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,896
He's all right.

479
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,903
Teensa!

480
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,197
Hey. Don't worry about her. She'll be back.

481
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,742
She's got an attention span
of about 15 seconds.

482
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:09,951
Don't worry.

483
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,579
<i>The thing that we always
dread has happened.</i>

484
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,079
<i>A rod coming out of the...</i>

485
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,662
Well, lookee here, it's the Milner crew.

486
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,373
God damn! Getting after it, aren't we?

487
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,673
Yeah, John, I really feel bad about the way
everybody's laughing at ya.

488
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,754
I think it's a damn shame.

489
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,007
First I wipe you out

490
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,435
and then after all the bragging you guys
been doing, them Hunt Brothers,

491
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,683
they shut you down.

492
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,065
Hell, a guy like you deserves more respect.

493
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,772
You're practically a legend.

494
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,071
Who is this beauty queen here?

495
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,901
Hey, now. Leave her alone. She's Swedish
or something. She doesn't speak English.

496
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,453
Well, great.
I parlez-vous a little German myself.

497
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,748
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Really, I do.

498
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,289
- Hello.
- Hello.

499
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,760
Her name's Eva, John,
in case you didn't know.

500
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,177
Eva, listen...

501
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,282
- What are you saying to her?
- I told her she had a beautiful body.

502
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,200
And I asked her
if she'd like to make it with me...

503
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,528
Get outta here.

504
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,237
She said she would.

505
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,166
Something about a motel.
I didn't quite pick up here. Let's see...

506
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,095
See, John.
This chick's hot for me, I'm telling ya.

507
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,093
- Get outta here.
- So, what do you say, baby?

508
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,142
How about giving me a little bit of that
free love you got over there in Sweden?

509
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,061
Hey, Rog! Hey! That's enough.

510
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,858
What? Look, man, I'm sorry.
I was kidding you.

511
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,855
- I was just playing with you.
- It's not funny.

512
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,607
Take a hike, huh?

513
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,813
Sure, John. Sure.

514
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,365
Hey, listen, I'll see you later, baby.

515
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,240
I don't know...

516
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,247
<i>WOLFMAN JACK". Rubbing your sou!
with a little rock 'n' roll.</i>

517
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:36,351
Look at Flag Ass.
He's actually enjoying this crap.

518
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,474
That's 'cause he's too stupid to be scared.

519
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,146
<i>Red Cap, Two-Six,
come in. Over.</i>

520
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,974
Red Cap Three, is the LZ still hot?

521
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,643
<i>Bulldog, get down here,
they're moving on us.</i>

522
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,228
<i>Get that goddamned machine in here.</i>

523
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,781
- Hey, get over the trees.
- Don't tell me how to fly my ship, soldier.

524
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,784
But we're a target in the clear area, man.
Get over the trees.

525
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,412
- We're hit! We're hit!
- Get over the trees!

526
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,009
Shit.

527
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:15,342
This is Red Cap Three. I've got your
visual. I'm throwing smoke. Now.

528
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,480
<i>Bulldog, you're heading straight for us.
Can you see the smoke? Red smoke.</i>

529
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,059
That's a roger, Red Cap Three.
Get your heads down. Bulldog's coming in.

530
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,653
That's a roger, Bulldog. Over.

531
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,234
Go! Go! Get the wounded to the LZ.
Stay close to the trees.

532
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,236
<i>Bulldog, we're moving our wounded
into the open.</i>

533
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,992
<i>Get that machine in here fast.
Charlie's moving in.</i>

534
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,618
All right. Young, open up.

535
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,358
Get in, God damn it! Hurry up!

536
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,160
- Get him inside.
- Here. Get him in here!

537
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,533
Come on, man. Get in here.

538
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,496
Well, go ahead! Lift off, man! Let's go!

539
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,505
Take it easy, man.

540
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,359
Oh, my God.

541
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,938
Don't worry, man. You don't get used to it.

542
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,497
Hey!

543
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,043
- Hey.
- Thanks for bailing me out, honey.

544
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,469
All right!

545
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,725
- So, how much was the bail?
- $212.

546
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,394
Wow! You're great. You know that?

547
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,933
You love me?

548
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,481
Come on.
Does Raggedy Ann have cotton tits or what?

549
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,688
Have you been thinking
about what we were talking about?

550
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,115
- About getting married?
- Sort of.

551
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,487
Well, what do you think?

552
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,491
Don't worry, it's dead.
Slick Eddy killed him.

553
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,916
What the hell you got him for?

554
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,536
You know how Rainbow's
always stealing towels?

555
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,996
I thought I'd put it on the top shelf

556
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,798
and then when she takes a towel
it'll fall on top of her head.

557
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,341
So what do you think about getting married?

558
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,384
It'd make a good hood ornament,
don't you think?

559
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,555
Don't you think it would
strengthen our relationship?

560
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,224
Feel this lump. I think it ate a rat.

561
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,558
- You're pregnant.
- I'm in love.

562
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,479
So am I, baby, but...

563
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,607
What does a piece of paper mean anyway?
It's so middle class.

564
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:25,615
We gotta keep this thing free and open
and groovy, you know?

565
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,620
Come on. Get in.

566
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,254
- Contact.
- Contact!

567
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,680
Listen to him. Don't you
think he's a genius?

568
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,839
Uh-huh.

569
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,179
Come on. He's really great.

570
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,931
How come he's not getting any gigs?

571
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,513
I told you, it's all in who you know
in this town.

572
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,270
You think Mick Jagger was always rich?

573
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,823
So, who was on the phone, hon?

574
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,530
Bad news. Good news, sort of.

575
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,409
Brian got sick, and he asked if I could
take his pizza-man route for him tonight.

576
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,492
Lance, it's New Year's Eve!
You're not gonna do it, are ya?

577
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,955
I feel lousy about you paying my bail.
I gotta make some money and pay you back.

578
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,212
Yeah. But we're gonna go to the Fillmore.
There's six bands and everything.

579
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,668
You can go with Rainbow.

580
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,755
Electric Haze is gonna be there.
It's your favorite group and everything.

581
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,932
What can I do? We need the bucks.

582
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,634
That's for sure.

583
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,806
A snake! It bit me!

584
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,518
It bit her.

585
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,744
So, how long has this demonstration
been going on, anyway?

586
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,202
Since just before the vacation, but I think
they're getting ready to kick us out.

587
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,129
- Good. Good.
- You got my sweatshirt on.

588
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,175
It was cold out so I borrowed it.
Do you mind?

589
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,217
No, but have you seen what's on the back?

590
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,341
- What?
- VIKKl: Oh, that's great.

591
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,637
What is it?

592
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,809
Oh, I'm sorry. Vikki, this is my
sister Laurie. Vikki Townsend.

593
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,602
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

594
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,806
That's really a cute outfit you got there.

595
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,393
I used to be a cheerleader myself
in high school. Varsity.

596
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,816
Well, I'm not a cheerleader
anymore exactly.

597
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,489
I used to be,
but now I'm a cheerleader for peace.

598
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,443
That's my baby. Why don't you
do one of your cheers for her?

599
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,574
- VIKKl: Right now?
- Oh, yeah, come on.

600
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,830
Murder, murder every day!
Hey, you generals, what do you say?

601
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,833
Drop your napalm, drop your gas!
And suck it all right up your ass!

602
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,170
Yay, Peace! Yay, peace!

603
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,254
She's got a million of 'em. Wait till
you hear Kill a Commie for Your Mommy.

604
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,337
Did you bring my wallet?

605
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,470
That's the one I'm gonna do
when Andy burns his draft card.

606
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,517
You're not gonna burn your draft card.

607
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,515
I would have never brought your wallet
down here, Andy.

608
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,720
It's against the law.

609
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,351
- Absolutely not.
- It's a matter of political commitment.

610
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,104
I don't care. You could go to jail.

611
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,692
Hey, guys, look who's here.
It's Madman Milner.

612
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,951
Why don't you put that little Chevy
back in your streetcar, pal?

613
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,669
Hey, you wanna go get something to eat?
Go to the snack bar?

614
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,379
Yeah! Come on.

615
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,251
So you're from Sweden, huh?

616
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,052
So, you know Anita Ekberg?

617
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,847
- Anita Ekberg?
- Hey, yeah. How about...

618
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,308
What's that car? Volvo?

619
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,930
- Volvo'?
- Yeah, Volvo.

620
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,479
It's from Sweden
so you must be from Sweden.

621
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,478
Eastland? I don't know where that is.

622
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,862
North Pole? You from the North Pole?

623
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,535
North Pole? They got Eskimos
and a bunch of ice up there.

624
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,300
Whatever you say. I'm just...

625
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,347
Hey, it's the little twerp.

626
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,642
Don't "little twerp" me, John. I've grown.

627
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,512
- A little bit.
- John, this is Perry.

628
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,559
- Hi there, Perry.
- Hello, John.

629
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,232
How do you like the drags?

630
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,106
I don't know too much about cars.
I'm from New York.

631
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,482
- Why don't you introduce me to your friend?
- This is...

632
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,660
This is my friend.
She's from another country.

633
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,612
She's foreign. She doesn't speak English.

634
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:40,168
She comes from the North Pole, actually.
She was raised by Eskimos.

635
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,168
Oh, wow. You two must have
some real stimulating conversations.

636
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,168
Well, there are a few conversations
you're too young to even know about.

637
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,471
- I'm older than you think, John.
- Carol, we're gonna be late.

638
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,048
Yeah, we gotta get going.

639
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,216
Perry's taking me to a coffee house.

640
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,635
Coffee house? Well, okay, listen,

641
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,265
I want you to take care of yourself.
And be good, okay?

642
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,225
Bye, John.

643
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,066
Now, what I wanna know is
how do these Eskimos make love?

644
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:12,026
<i>Heading for the staging lanes,
the state-of-the-art in drag racing today,</i>

645
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,829
<i>the undefeated Hunt Brothers' Headhunter,
cubic money.</i>

646
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,774
Lucky son of a bitch.
He'll be home tomorrow, man.

647
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,413
Hey. Let me take care of that big guy.

648
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,703
Are you crazy? He'll break you in half.

649
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,831
He'd be on your ass like
a June bug on shit.

650
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,254
No sweat, man. I can handle him.

651
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,589
Break.

652
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,594
Your wife is a cow. Your mother's a hog.

653
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,517
- You're dumb and ugly...
- I'm gonna kill you.

654
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,723
Ow!

655
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,934
- What's the matter?
- My knee!

656
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,901
Holy shit!

657
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,738
Some guys got all the luck.

658
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,943
Luck? He just broke his leg.

659
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,198
It's a ticket home, yo-yo.

660
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:24,078
Fields, you don't mean to tell me
you wanna go out there and get hurt?

661
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,830
Pal, in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

662
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:31,164
they're trying to get us killed in
this war. I'm gonna get outta here.

663
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,670
You ever tried shooting yourself?

664
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,801
I told you, sir, I was
just cleaning my rifle.

665
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,098
That's not the scuttlebutt I get.

666
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,676
Honest, sir. It was just an accident.

667
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,808
Let's hope you don't have
any more accidents, Fields.

668
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:51,063
In the meantime,
how does latrine duty sound to you?

669
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,770
About a month of it?

670
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,572
- You're kidding!
- Starting now!

671
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,028
Get moving!

672
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,119
Come on, let's go take a shit.

673
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,073
Terrific. Just terrific.

674
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,116
Fields!

675
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,170
Fields! Hold that salute
till I return it, soldier.

676
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,461
Move out!

677
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,811
All right. You're playing like
candy <i>asses</i> here. Let's hit somebody!

678
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,687
Fecal waste shall be moved
a distance of not less than 50 meters

679
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,609
from the mess hall or living area.

680
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,527
Diesel fuel shall then
be added to the waste matter

681
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,071
and the mixture shall then be ignited.

682
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,490
When the drum is cooled,
it shall be replaced in the latrine.

683
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,158
- You understand?
- No.

684
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,910
- What part don't you understand?
- Start at the beginning.

685
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,411
- Now look, Toad. Don't give me that crap.
- Don't give me this crap.

686
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:55,374
You get to it or I'll be talking to the major.
This is his personal favorite shithouse.

687
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,584
- Understand?
- Yeah.

688
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,516
<i>This really doesn't
help the problem any.</i>

689
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,891
<i>Out of sight and out of mind.
It gets worse instead of better.</i>

690
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,722
<i>If the problem is venereal disease,
you may be setting yourself up</i>

691
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,776
<i>for permanent physical
damage, like insanity.</i>

692
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,481
<i>There are several types of venereal disease
and each requires special medication.</i>

693
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,625
I'll walk. Get right out of here
and keep walking till I get home.

694
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,967
I know I could do it.
It's just getting past the MPs.

695
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:50,894
Shit!

696
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,208
How do you think I
scored Robbie Jordan?

697
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,880
I heard he left the group.

698
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,878
Yeah, they're looking
for a new guitar player.

699
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,709
Oh, yeah? Maybe Lance could get that gig.

700
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,756
- Forget it, Debbie.
- There's no harm in asking.

701
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,934
- You'll introduce me, won't you?
- Sure, I'll introduce you.

702
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,861
Hey, what's the matter?

703
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,281
I'm thinking about how I'll look
all splattered down there.

704
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,157
Come on, Debbie. This may be the
big break in Lance's career.

705
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,423
Moonflower, you're a genius.

706
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,639
- Wow!
- Who do I talk to?

707
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,190
Fe Lix.

708
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,108
Do you know who that is?

709
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,905
Well, he's only the bass player
for the Strawberry Prunes!

710
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,607
- Talk about cute!
- Dibs!

711
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,628
Alone tonight, beautiful one?

712
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,923
I hold before you my magic satchel
containing 2,000 mgs

713
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,218
of pure, uncut Owsley Sunshine.

714
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,930
- What do you say?
- Beat it, bozo.

715
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,497
Eric Benson and I ain't going.

716
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,218
Andy, you don't think we'd be in Vietnam

717
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,968
unless the President knew a few things
we don't know, huh'?

718
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,261
Not so loud. You're embarrassing me.

719
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,217
I don't see what's so embarrassing

720
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,020
about saying that you support
the President of the United States?

721
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,722
Because somebody might hear you,
that's why.

722
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,933
Yeah, we elected him,
we should stand by him.

723
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,145
If we give these communists an inch,
they're gonna take a mile.

724
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,730
Today it's Vietnam,
tomorrow it could be here,

725
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,612
- in our very own backyard.
- She's drunk.

726
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,867
<i>Attention. This is Sergeant
James Dutton speaking.</i>

727
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,742
I don't understand you, Andy.
I really don't understand you.

728
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,043
- Let go of that.
- Go on, Andy.

729
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,663
You're an idiot, Andrew. You're an idiot.

730
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:09,719
My name is Andy Henderson and I'd like to
dedicate this to the police outside.

731
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,511
There it is.

732
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:21,056
<i>BUTTON". You are ordered
to evacuate the building immediately.</i>

733
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,281
Hi. I'm looking for Andy Henderson.

734
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,530
He lives next door. You know where he went?

735
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,158
- You got a warrant?
- A warrant? No.

736
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,409
- Then I'm not talking to you, man.
- Wait. Just one second.

737
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,706
Why would I need a warrant?

738
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,705
You got narc written all over you.

739
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm not a narc.
Actually I'm an insurance agent

740
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,833
and I'm looking for my wife.
He's with my wife.

741
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,090
Sure. An insurance agent
and Andy's schtupping your old lady.

742
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,139
- Good try, man. But it ain't gonna work.
- Hold it! Please!

743
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,387
You got it all wrong. I'm not a narc.

744
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,933
In my book, an insurance agent
and a narc are the same thing. Pigs.

745
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:05,437
And if I were you, I'd truck my oinking,
Wonderbread self right on out of here.

746
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,268
You're right.

747
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,195
- About what?
- You're under arrest, asshole.

748
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,317
Up against the wall.

749
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,990
- Now where are they?
- Don't be doing that.

750
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,818
- Where are they'?
- On campus, man. A demonstration.

751
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,537
- Is that all you know?
- Yeah, honestly. Please don't fuck me, man.

752
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,365
- I'll tell you where I buy my weed. I'll tell...
- He's gone.

753
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:23,909
Jeez!

754
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,627
<i>The fabulous
Hunt Brothers' factory car</i>

755
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,460
<i>meets the first challenger of the day.
It's Alan Billy.</i>

756
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,184
<i>The Hunt Brothers are first by a mile.</i>

757
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,888
- Man, he's smooth!
- Go tell John.

758
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,097
Yeah.

759
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,734
Hey, you want a beer?

760
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,411
Here.

761
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,245
Yeah, right.
That's one of the things I like about you.

762
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,452
You're real easy to talk to.

763
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,001
Yeah?

764
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,960
What do you say I move a
little closer to you?

765
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,802
Just a little bit.

766
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,635
Yeah, that's right.

767
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,721
John, Hunt Brothers beat Alan Billy
with a 7.82.

768
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,857
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?

769
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,069
Sorry, John, I didn't see you were busy.

770
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,897
I'm not busy,
I'm trying to get busy, all right?

771
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,746
Now, where was I?

772
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:53,716
The North Pole. Yes.
The North Pole and Eastland and Volvo.

773
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,264
That's right. Um...

774
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,058
You know, you really are beautiful.

775
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,442
Right. That's... That's right.

776
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,736
That's what I was thinking.
You're turning me on.

777
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,780
Right?

778
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,459
Well, I...
This conversation's getting us nowhere

779
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,913
so I think that I'll just try
the physical approach, okay?

780
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,842
You think? The physical approach.
Like getting to first base.

781
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,258
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

782
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,932
Oh, now, now, now.

783
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,434
Just relax.

784
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,112
Hey. Now wait a minute.
You came into my camper.

785
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,734
What do you think I'm gonna do?

786
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,526
Hey. Come back here!

787
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,616
Hey, come on back.

788
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,116
Wait!

789
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,269
Hey, Toad, wake up, will you?
What planet you on?

790
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,185
Just thinking what day it is today.

791
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,232
New Year's Eve tonight, so what?

792
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,192
Kind of an anniversary.

793
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:25,071
Good buddy of mine
got killed a year ago today.

794
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,573
Did he cop one?

795
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,866
No, it was back in the world. John Milner.
You knew him.

796
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,544
Had the hottest wheels in the valley.
Good buddy of mine.

797
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,875
Good friend.

798
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,384
Hey, Toad, I been thinking.

799
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,012
- I'm taking care of you, right?
- Yeah.

800
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,558
When we get back home,
I'm gonna make you an honorary,

801
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,265
full-fledged member of the Pharaohs.

802
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,063
No blood initiations, nothing like that.

803
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,143
Me, you and Nance,
we gonna open up a used-car lot.

804
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,112
You sell 'em, we steal 'em.

805
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,816
The Flying Pharaohs.

806
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,501
<i>Bulldog, you're two
klicks north-east of our position.</i>

807
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,920
You heard him, gunner, two klicks
to the LZ. Get back in position.

808
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,298
<i>Red Cap One,
we're going in.</i>

809
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,420
<i><i>Right by you there, chief,</i>

810
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,876
<i>it looks pretty hairy down here, I don't...</i>

811
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,677
<i>Watch it, watch it!
Incoming from the left!</i>

812
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,254
<i>I</i> See if! Oh, Shit!

813
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,806
<i>Red Cap Two,
we've got heavy ordnance.</i>

814
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,554
We're <i>hit! Get</i> out of here.

815
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,010
<i>We're going down! We're going down!</i>

816
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,720
<i><i>Put her down here.</i>

817
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,684
What, me worry?

818
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,219
<i>Okay, Red Cap Two,
we're right above you. Left and above.</i>

819
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,397
- We're going in ahead of you.
- Okay. Clear. Left and above.

820
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,942
- Got a steep approach. Just hang on.
- Pre-landing check complete.

821
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,611
All right, Young, open up.

822
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,277
Get outta here!

823
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,663
Move out.

824
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,249
Gunner, check the left rear.

825
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,585
Ow!

826
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,633
Jesus Christ!

827
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,345
- Jesus! Toad! Toad!
- Hold on! You all right?

828
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,518
- Hey, man, you're all right.
- What the hell's going on back there?

829
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,772
Joe. Come on, man, don't die on me!

830
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,189
We got hit! There's fire back there.

831
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,611
- Come back to me, man!
- Get up here and give me a hand!

832
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,359
I can't hold it.

833
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,910
- He's dead, man.
- I can't control it.

834
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,866
Hold on.

835
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,794
Get away from the trees! Jesus!

836
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,125
Looks like Rainbow found somebody.

837
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,927
Seems like she always goes
for those '50s kind of guys.

838
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,518
- Felix?
- No, I'm Newt. Can I help you?

839
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:25,599
Uh...

840
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,726
No, I'm looking for Felix.

841
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,779
That's him right there. Hey, Felix?
Wants to talk to you, man.

842
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,652
- Hey, how ya doing?
- Hi.

843
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,530
My name's Debbie,
and I'm a friend of Moonflower...

844
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,532
Don't say no more.
I know exactly who you're talking about.

845
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,205
You're talking about Moonflower.
The one with the red hair, right?

846
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,748
No, she's got blue hair.

847
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,700
Maybe she dyed it.
Anyway, she got a ring of roses

848
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,831
- tattooed around her arm, right?
- No.

849
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,209
This Moonflower has roses
tattooed on her arm.

850
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,211
She thought it looked pretty.
I thought it looked like a snake.

851
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,338
And let me tell you,
snakes are not my style.

852
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,794
It's really funny
that you should mention snakes...

853
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,881
When I was a kid, I saw a snake.
I freaked out.

854
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,761
But my sister loves snakes.

855
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,389
Calls her old man a snake. His
name is Bill. He's a barber.

856
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:04,142
She shot him two years ago
right through the <i>ass.</i>

857
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,768
But it was cool. 'Cause he's a barber.

858
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,475
He works standing up
so he didn't have to sit down on it.

859
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,357
I wanted to tell you about this friend
of mine who plays really great guitar.

860
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,403
He's really a beautiful...

861
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,356
But long hair put Bill
right out of business.

862
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:19,070
Got so upset, got drunk, ate his kid's
hamster, said it tasted like a mackerel.

863
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,405
- Who?
- Lance Harris.

864
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,741
Never heard of him. Probably a youngie.
And I'm not a youngie.

865
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,576
But I'm not an oldie either.
But it's tough enough.

866
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,587
Well, this guy is really good.
He's like Jerry Garcia, Jimi Hendrix,

867
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,338
Frank Zappa, he can play anything.

868
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,838
- What's his name?
- Lance.

869
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,671
- What about him?
- He'd be great for your group.

870
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,301
- What's his name?
- Lance Harris.

871
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,225
Do you know I used to know a surfer named
Lance? His name was No Pants Lance.

872
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,098
- Listen to me.
- What? What is it?

873
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,145
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?

874
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,313
Talking.

875
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,266
I think she thinks you talk a lot.

876
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,852
Hey, let me tell you something.
What's wrong with talking?

877
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,859
I'm gonna tell you something.
It's better I talk 'cause I can't spell.

878
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,363
And if I had to spell, I would be out
of luck. Do you know what I mean'?

879
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,943
Wait a minute!

880
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,543
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- We're moving.

881
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,665
I know.

882
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,213
- So, where we going?
- I don't know.

883
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,458
You tell me where we're going.

884
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,091
We have a gig over in Oakland. Don't worry.
You'll have fun.

885
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,716
With five guys?

886
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,765
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

887
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,058
<i>You have one minute to vacate the building.</i>

888
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,230
<i>Okay, we're gonna have a vote.</i>

889
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:33,277
<i>All of you that wanna chicken out,
please raise your hands.</i>

890
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,230
<i>We have one vote?</i>

891
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,533
She's an outside agitator. Doesn't count.

892
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:43,783
- Don't you believe in democracy, Andy?
- With qualifications.

893
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:47,412
<i>Well, if you wanna give in,
maybe you should just go.</i>

894
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,292
Thank you.

895
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,296
Good luck. Good luck. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

896
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,668
Andy?

897
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,252
<i>We have to stand together.
They can't take us away because...</i>

898
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,376
The door's locked! Andy!

899
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,114
Tear gas! Tear gas!

900
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,664
Andy!

901
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,878
Wait up!

902
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,056
<i>The Calhoun car is
coming up to the line.</i>

903
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:32,763
<i>Jimmy Calhoun's engine
starting to warm up, but where's Milner?</i>

904
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,106
<i>He knows better than this.</i>

905
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:39,687
<i>He's going to be disqualified if he doesn't
get up to the line real quick.</i>

906
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,234
- John, wait.
- Come here, Eva. I wanna talk to you.

907
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,412
Come on. Let me explain.
Would you stop? Wait!

908
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,787
Come here. I'm trying to talk to you.
Hold it. Come here, come here, come here.

909
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,249
I know. Listen, I'm sorry.

910
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:01,674
I'm trying to apologize. You understand?
How am I supposed to talk to you?

911
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,923
Why can't you speak English or something?
I'm trying to apologize.

912
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,883
I didn't mean it.
Pardonne-moi, you understand?

913
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,982
You came into my camper.
What do you expect me to do?

914
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,855
- John, come on, man.
- We got a race.

915
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,246
Gimme that thing.

916
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,508
<i>ANNOUNCER". Okay. Milner's crew now
muscling the car up to the starting line.</i>

917
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,507
<i>And listen to that hand for John Milner.</i>

918
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,931
<i>He's had a bit of bad luck today but
apparently the fans are still behind him.</i>

919
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,720
<i>He's up against little Jimmy Calhoun
from West Covina, California.</i>

920
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:59,353
<i>Jimmy's gonna need more than his usual
cockiness to defeat Milner here today.</i>

921
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:28,463
<i>And the winner of the race,
thanks to little Jimmy's exploding engine,</i>

922
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,047
<i>is John Milner.</i>

923
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:33,884
- Not bad for an independent.
- Yeah, but he's no competition.

924
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:47,234
Bulldog, Bulldog, this is Escort One. Over.

925
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,318
I don't think this radio works.

926
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,530
Typical. Nothing works here.

927
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,495
<i>This is Escort One. Over.</i>

928
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,706
American know-how.

929
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,419
Bulldog, are you under fire? Over.

930
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,263
That's affirmative.
From the other side of the river.

931
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,841
You gotta get us out of here quick!

932
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,690
Bulldog, we'll order
artillery into that area.

933
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,894
We haven't got time for that.

934
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,025
You gotta get us out of here now
before they get here.

935
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,608
Break, break. Dog, I'm gonna give your
position to artillery.

936
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,695
And we'll drop some rocket fire
into that tree line.

937
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:38,156
<i>When the area is secured,
we'll come pick you up.</i>

938
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,668
You know what I think, Major,

939
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,793
I don't think you have the guts
to come down here, you asshole!

940
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:50,211
Can it, Fields. You're talking
your way into a court-martial.

941
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:54,048
Now drop some smoke. Mark your position.
You little shit!

942
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,513
What I'd give to open up on that guy.

943
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,562
I think you're right.
He is afraid to come down here and get us.

944
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,890
Very good. You're catching on.

945
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,236
And he had just gotten here
from Guam in his canoe,

946
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,487
and he was trying to get her to buy...

947
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,739
- Can I interrupt you for one moment?
- for this German submarine.

948
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,446
- All right. Let me just say this much. Okay?
- Okay.

949
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,703
Bobbie, whatever you do,
don't drive through that park.

950
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,878
Whatever I do,
I won't drive through that park up there.

951
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:25,953
Hey. man!

952
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,005
- That's a good weave.
- Are you guys crazy?

953
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,090
Do you play an instrument?

954
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,175
You know what I think?
Everybody should play an instrument.

955
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,511
You know, I learned to play trombone
when I was only six years...

956
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,939
Bobbie, whatever you do,
don't hit those trash cans.

957
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,268
Hey, Bobbie, go for two.

958
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,027
The trumpet, the guitar, the ukulele...

959
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,776
Can I interrupt you for one moment?

960
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,782
He doesn't mean anything.
He just talks a lot.

961
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,580
Whatever you do,
don't hit that Christmas tree.

962
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,954
- Don't hit that tree.
- No sweat.

963
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,170
Hey,

964
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,132
This is not normal. This is crazy.

965
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,757
It's just a little bit crazy. We're the...

966
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:19,091
I just wanted to tell you about this friend
of mine who's a guitar player.

967
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,595
And I know you have an opening.

968
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,269
And if you just audition him,
I know you'd never live to regret it.

969
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,687
Sure, we'd be glad to.

970
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

971
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,645
- That's okay with you?
- Mmm-hmm.

972
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,524
Okay, I'm gonna let my
hand off your mouth. Okay.

973
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,485
Bobbie, whatever you do,
don't hit those trash cans!

974
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,038
I think we hit something.

975
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,544
I think it was a fire hydrant.

976
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,585
Isn't it bad enough
what's going on in Vietnam, Andy?

977
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,257
You want it to start here too?

978
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,676
Don't start that. I don't wanna hear it.

979
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,130
You remember Terry Fields?
Do you remember Toad?

980
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,307
- Yeah.
- Doesn't his death mean anything to you?

981
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,052
Well sure,
he's one of the reasons I'm here, Laurie.

982
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:08,015
But if we give up this war, Andy,
then he'll have died for nothing.

983
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,395
He already died for nothing.

984
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:14,730
I don't want anyone else to die for
nothing. I mean, that's the point.

985
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,290
No, no.

986
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:47,766
Whoa!

987
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,900
Sorry.

988
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,586
Campus is closed.

989
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,671
- Closed?
- Get moving.

990
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,928
- No, I'm sorry, I've gotta go through...
- I said get moving.

991
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,265
Pacific Benefit Life. Claims inspection.

992
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,974
Home office wants a preliminary
damage report and they want it fast.

993
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,401
These creeps have really
torn the hell out of the place.

994
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,195
That's what
they come to school for nowadays.

995
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:41,525
All right, buddy, go on through.
You need any help, you just let me know.

996
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,075
Thank you.

997
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,990
Check my fuel line, make sure it's on.

998
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:53,374
Are you gonna pull the plugs?
And get this other tire. Damn! Jesus.

999
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,875
Hey, Beckwith, take it easy, huh?

1000
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,755
<i>Two of the guys a lot of you
came to see,</i>

1001
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,883
<i>Milner and Beckwith.
This is gonna be a war.</i>

1002
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:07,684
<i>Only one of them comes back to race the
factory car, the Hunt Brothers, in the final.</i>

1003
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,227
<i>They're strapped in, the
engines are running.</i>

1004
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:13,227
<i>Nitro fumes so thick,
the starter's about to pass out.</i>

1005
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:16,059
<i>They're pounding the ground. This is it.</i>

1006
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,870
The winner of the race is John Milner.

1007
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:23,877
His chute ain't popping, man.
Let's get on it.

1008
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,775
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please,
keep off the end of the racetrack.</i>

1009
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,357
<i>We don't need your help.
Please stay in the grandstand.</i>

1010
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,070
<i>Our safety safari team here at the raceway
is the best in drag racing.</i>

1011
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,826
<i>All you could possibly
do is get in the way.</i>

1012
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,535
<i>As soon as we get an official report
on the condition of Milner...</i>

1013
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:21,063
It's too close! You're supposed
to be the other side of the river!

1014
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,316
- Jesus Christ. They almost killed us!
- Typical.

1015
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,872
- Just call the major, tell him it's clear.
- But it's not, they're all over...

1016
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,702
Tell him it's clear. Come on, man.
You'd land, wouldn't you?

1017
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,870
Tell him!

1018
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:45,083
Red One, Red Two. You better come on in.
Charlie's on the run.

1019
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,794
Come on in here and get us out quick!

1020
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,434
Okay. Here he comes, let's go. Come on!

1021
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,474
Sinclair! Sinclair!

1022
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:09,532
- Come on! What's the matter?
- My foot. I think I turned my foot.

1023
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,159
- Can you run?
- I don't know.

1024
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,657
Come on. You gotta try!
We gotta stay alive.

1025
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,286
Get on your feet! Get over there!

1026
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:23,713
Move it, God damn it! Get outta here!
Go, go, go!

1027
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,576
Come on, Fields. Move it!

1028
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,230
- All right. Come on now, let's go.
- We're going to be late for the gig.

1029
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,898
Hey, let's get a hand.

1030
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,817
Hey, girl, come on over here and help us.

1031
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,320
- Hurry up.
- You promise to give Lance a chance?

1032
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,865
- Ask him, he's the leader of the group.
- Let the brake off and give it some horses.

1033
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,692
- Him? Why didn't you tell me?
- You didn't ask me.

1034
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,493
Come on, y'all, we're gonna be late.

1035
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,573
Yeah.

1036
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,790
We did it! Look! Police, man! The police.

1037
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,124
- Shit!
- You better stall them.

1038
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,460
It was terrible. They had guns.
It was a '64 Chevy, light blue.

1039
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:55,046
And they went thataway. They shot at us.

1040
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,097
- Go get 'em!
- Yes, ma'am.

1041
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,851
Genius. I love you! I love you!

1042
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,096
Let's go. Come on.

1043
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,973
I should've never brought you your wallet.

1044
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,139
No, I should've never
gotten up this morning.

1045
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,228
I wonder if Steven fed the kids lunch.

1046
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,432
Mark's such a finicky eater.

1047
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,559
And Steven...

1048
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,772
Steve! Steven! Steve's out there!

1049
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,153
Steven! Steve! Steven!

1050
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,152
Steve! Steven!

1051
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,409
- Steven!
- There you are!

1052
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:03,785
Steve!

1053
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,618
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1054
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,415
How are the kids? Are the kids okay?

1055
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:10,792
The kids are fine.
Are you sure you're all right?

1056
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,997
Yes. I am. Steven, I'm sorry.

1057
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,833
- I should have never left like that.
- It's all right.

1058
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,586
- I know we can work this out.
- I know we can, too, baby.

1059
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,546
I'm gonna let you get a job.

1060
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,006
Oh, Steve!

1061
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,891
In a couple of years
you'll find something you like.

1062
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,140
- A couple of years?
- I'm gonna be reasonable about this.

1063
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,439
- We're gonna compromise.
- That's no compromise. A couple of years?

1064
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,313
- I wanna work now. Yesterday.
- Damn it, Laurie!

1065
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:34,236
- You bastard!
- Now, it's completely out of the question.

1066
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,281
How dare you follow me like this and then
tell me it's out of the question.

1067
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,233
How can you do that?
You're so inconsiderate.

1068
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,444
- You're stubborn. And you're bitchy.
- You're selfish.

1069
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,904
- You're egotistical.
- You're conniving.

1070
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:46,617
- You're just like your father.
- And you're exactly like your mother.

1071
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,793
My dad always said, "You wanna see
what your wife's gonna be like?

1072
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,744
"Just look at her mother."
Well, Jesus Christ.

1073
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,876
I want a divorce. Here's your ring back.

1074
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,175
Here's your ring back. Oh, great.
Throw it away.

1075
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,923
Right. Why not?

1076
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,763
Oh, man. We gotta get 'em outta there.

1077
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,052
- Oh, pick up your ring.
- Where did it go?

1078
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,014
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait a minute. My ring.

1079
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,689
Holy shit!

1080
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,672
Pacific Benefit Life!

1081
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,016
<i>WOLFMAN JACK". Can you dig it, baby?</i>

1082
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,438
We got it. We got it. We got it.

1083
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:55,105
- Oh, they're dead.
- That's it!

1084
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,946
That's a shame, too. You beat me bad.

1085
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:02,658
I wish I hadn't now.
You'd have had a shot at the factory.

1086
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:05,202
I couldn't have beat those guys anyway.

1087
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,156
You're the only one who
ever had a chance. Really.

1088
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,866
Thanks, but you're pretty good yourself.

1089
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,416
You don't know shit about engines
but your dragster looks good.

1090
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,706
Well, thanks.

1091
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,542
I know my front end wouldn't have bent
like that.

1092
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,377
What are you talking about?

1093
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,713
- Isn't this Schiefer linkage?
- So?

1094
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,969
- So, your wheels are the same as mine.
- So?

1095
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:29,723
Hell, man, we'll take the whole damn front
section off my car and put it on your car.

1096
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,182
Huh?

1097
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,060
Yeah. Bob, we're gonna need
that welder. Okay?

1098
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,063
Jim, can you get us some guys?
We only got about 15 minutes.

1099
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,940
Maybe I can get 'em to slow up at the line.

1100
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,397
Check that out.
That might give us enough time.

1101
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,902
Hey, we're gonna beat them, John.

1102
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,654
- Me and you, together. Okay?
- Thanks, Roger.

1103
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,235
Sure, man. I'll see you.

1104
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,992
Come on, Carlos, get the tools.
Let's pull this front end off.

1105
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,414
Thanks a lot.

1106
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,992
Here, you take something, go to work.

1107
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:54,418
No, wait. Get your T-shirt on.

1108
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,712
If we're gonna beat those guys
you gotta have your T-shirt.

1109
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,334
Go on. Get it!

1110
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,675
All right... Look at the tools she gave me.

1111
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,458
Fields?

1112
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,048
You shouldn't be doing this.
You saved my life.

1113
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,877
Yeah. Some New Year's Eve, huh?

1114
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,010
I wanted to thank you.

1115
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,726
Hey, I was scared. I was really scared.

1116
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,521
Congratulations. You're normal.

1117
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,190
I'd like to propose a toast.

1118
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,318
Look at that, man. Look at those jerks.

1119
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:07,649
Joe's dead and they're having a party.

1120
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:10,407
The Bulldog Helicopter Assault Company.

1121
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:15,537
May our victory be a complete,
full and lasting one.

1122
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,330
Hear, hear.

1123
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:20,913
And to you, sir, a barrel of shit.

1124
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:26,085
I gotta get out of here, man.
This isn't my war.

1125
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,509
And now I'd like to propose another toast.

1126
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,091
To a very, very brave man,

1127
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,765
who today led his men in a mission

1128
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:40,516
that accounted for
more than 200 communists dead.

1129
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,986
You're too kind, congressman.

1130
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,946
An officer is only as good

1131
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,953
- as the men he leads.
- Hear, hear.

1132
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,453
Oh, man, that does it! I've had it.

1133
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,376
And I'm gonna do something about it.

1134
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:07,255
I gotta get a hand grenade.
No, a satchel charge.

1135
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,256
And I know just where to get it.

1136
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,715
Terry, you can't. They're officers.
It's not gonna solve anything.

1137
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,971
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

1138
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,693
- Hello.
- Hello.

1139
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,820
Wanna dance?

1140
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,025
Um...

1141
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,786
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

1142
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,573
Just don't feel like dancing, that's all.

1143
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,626
- That ain't a very good reason.
- She's with the band.

1144
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,079
- So what?
- She's gotta get on stage.

1145
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,413
We can't do the gig without her.

1146
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:48,084
Well, you know what? You need a haircut.

1147
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,677
You look like shit.

1148
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,592
You know, I woke up this morning,

1149
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,970
I looked in the mirror
and I said, "Newt, boy, you look like shit.

1150
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:59,269
"Get a haircut."
But hell, you gotta have long hair nowadays

1151
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,688
or you can't work. Have a beer.

1152
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,516
Come on. Check you later, amigo.

1153
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,944
Are you sure we got the right place?

1154
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,987
Pretty tough joint.

1155
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:12,783
It's a good gig. We're making 20 bucks
apiece tonight. Here, you can play this.

1156
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,735
- What do you want me to do with that?
- Play it.

1157
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,946
Unless you want that creep
hitting on you all night.

1158
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,702
Yeah, he was a creep.

1159
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,250
I can't blame him much.
I'd be hitting on you myself

1160
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,874
if I didn't know you had an old man.

1161
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,464
So, how do I play it?

1162
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:32,215
It's a pretty complicated instrument.
Basically, what you do is you hit it like this.

1163
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,924
More advanced musicians
will hit it like that, that, that.

1164
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:39,969
You're gonna play with the group.

1165
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,305
Yeah. But I don't know any of your stuff.

1166
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:46,392
It's nothing. Just hit that thing
once in a while, dance around.

1167
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,398
You're beautiful and
they're gonna love you.

1168
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,328
- Where'd you take my wife?
- Shut up.

1169
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,129
I want you to know
you're facing false arrest charges.

1170
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:09,627
- What's your badge number?
- Turn around!

1171
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:12,129
I got it. I saw it.
You're gonna hear from my attorney.

1172
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:14,382
One more word out of your commie mouth,
kid, I'll wring your neck...

1173
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,010
- Commie'? I... I voted Republican.
- Turn around.

1174
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,217
Would you rather be called a fascist pig?

1175
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:21,518
I got a right to know where my wife is.

1176
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,846
Take it easy, Steve. She's all right.

1177
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:27,524
Anyway, what can you do now? Relax.

1178
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,314
I'll tell you one thing.
Something like this happens,

1179
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:33,113
it just makes you realize how trivial
your marriage problems are.

1180
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,735
Not trivial.

1181
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,283
Low priority.

1182
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,169
Hey, quiet back there!

1183
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,503
I wonder if this is gonna
cost me my PTA membership.

1184
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,462
You should be so lucky.

1185
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:07,348
Hey!

1186
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:08,982
Oh, yeah?

1187
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,401
Okay, let's get that butt out.
Go on, get it out.

1188
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,692
All right.

1189
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,703
<i>Baby love, my baby love</i>

1190
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,780
Who's singing? Who's singing?

1191
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:28,165
<i>I need ya, oh how I need ya</i>

1192
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:32,130
<i>But all you do is treat me bad</i>

1193
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:35,842
<i>Break my heart and leave me sad</i>

1194
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,886
<i>Tell me, what did I do wrong</i>

1195
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,516
<i>To make you stay away so long?</i>

1196
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,936
<i>Baby love, my baby love</i>

1197
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:50,607
<i>Been missing ya, oh, miss kissing ya</i>

1198
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:53,936
<i>Instead of breaking up
Don't throw our love away</i>

1199
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,944
<i>- Let's do some kissing and making up
- Don't throw our love away</i>

1200
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,446
<i>Don't throw our love</i> away

1201
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:04,405
<i>In my arms you'll always stay</i>

1202
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:07,412
<i>Baby love, my baby love</i>

1203
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:11,878
<i>I need ya, oh, how I need ya</i>

1204
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:20,300
Come on now. Let's hurry up.
Get those cars started.

1205
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,214
<i>Looks like some
of the local drivers</i>

1206
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,049
<i>are intentionally slowing down the pace,</i>

1207
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,385
<i>trying to buy Milner some extra time.</i>

1208
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:31,143
<i>From here I can see the competitors,
who are usually feuding with each other,</i>

1209
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,397
<i>all helping out in Milner's cause.
Incredible!</i>

1210
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,440
<i>Here's the Hunt Brothers' car,
prepared for the kill.</i>

1211
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:43,198
<i>They fully expect to win.
The factory demands they win.</i>

1212
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,003
<i>Minutes to go, still no Milner.</i>

1213
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:01,883
<i>Looks like the Hunt Brothers are about to
demand a single-run victory by default.</i>

1214
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:06,220
- Carlos, you got those plugs changed?
- Yeah.

1215
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,810
I got you some fuel here, John.

1216
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:12,811
- I got my own mixture. 90%.
- You'll blow your engine, man.

1217
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,851
<i>Still no sign of John Milner.</i>

1218
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:20,314
<i>He knows the rules. if you're not on
the line in time, you're disqualified.</i>

1219
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,910
- Okay, we got it.
- We'll never make it.

1220
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,411
Come on, man! Let's go!

1221
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,373
<i>Frankly, it doesn't look good
There's so little time left.</i>

1222
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:38,548
<i>Probably a single run for the Hunt
Brothers, Milner losing by default.</i>

1223
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,251
<i>But hold it! Look, over
on the fire-up road.</i>

1224
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,880
<i>Against all odds Milner has got it moving!</i>

1225
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:03,899
<i>Milner's made it to the line</i>

1226
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,202
<i>but that's just half
of this incredible mechanical miracle.</i>

1227
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:10,577
<i>After all their patchwork,
will the car go straight down the track?</i>

1228
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,829
<i>Will it go straight into the guard rail?
It's a big gamble.</i>

1229
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,631
Do you think that front
end's gonna hold up?

1230
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,333
I know it's gonna hold up.

1231
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,840
<i>Nothing wrong
with Milner's motor.</i>

1232
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,422
<i>In fact, both engines
making awesome power.</i>

1233
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,348
<i>2,000 horsepower side by side.</i>

1234
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,893
<i>The final race for top eliminator.</i>

1235
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,668
<i>He's done it.
Milner has done it, the impossible.</i>

1236
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,841
<i>He's defeated the Hunt Brothers.</i>

1237
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:06,295
<i>The crew has gone crazy,
the whole place has gone crazy.</i>

1238
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,551
<i>John Milner, top eliminator.</i>

1239
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,896
- Terry, you can't...
- Shut up!

1240
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:24,571
- What if you get caught?
- Just shut up and do what I told you!

1241
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:28,108
I greased that one myself.
Right, Lieutenant?

1242
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,159
You damn sure did, sir.

1243
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,496
Magnificent. Magnificent.

1244
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:33,947
Here we are.

1245
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:38,918
Major, sir?

1246
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,330
- You're on officers' turf, Fields.
- Yes, I know, sir.

1247
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:45,258
I just wanted to have a word with you
if I could.

1248
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:49,759
You can speak to me in the morning.
Can't you see who I'm with here?

1249
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:54,264
Yeah, I just wanted to know, sir,
since it's New Year's Eve tonight,

1250
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,554
why don't you let me off latrine duty?

1251
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:09,274
No way. You're gonna be in the shithouse
the rest of your life, Fields.

1252
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:10,700
Now get back over there.

1253
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,953
All right, Major,
if that's the way you feel about it.

1254
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:16,578
I just hope you enjoy your cake.

1255
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,624
- It's a good one.
- Thank you.

1256
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,701
Oh, uh...

1257
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,910
Sir?

1258
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,005
It's angel food.

1259
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:27,130
Son, maybe you'd like
to stay and have a piece of it with us?

1260
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,678
No, sir, he has a very
important job to finish.

1261
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:33,841
To the latrines, you little turd.

1262
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,604
Well, who'll cut the cake?

1263
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,230
On!

1264
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,696
I think this is an honor
you should have, Major.

1265
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:49,613
Thank you, sir.

1266
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:00,667
When I get back to
Washington, I'm going to tell the President

1267
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:04,463
about the fine fighting spirit
your men have here, too.

1268
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:11,671
Wait a minute, Major.
Can we have a photograph of this, please?

1269
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:17,263
Fields! Get in there and get to work!

1270
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:21,096
Could you stand up, please?

1271
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,807
One moment.

1272
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,227
We'll do it together.

1273
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:36,611
To the VC. Let 'em eat cake.

1274
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:49,920
What was that?

1275
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:53,003
Charlie must have
booby-trapped the latrine.

1276
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,839
There was a man in there. Fields!

1277
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,765
Oh, my God, Fields!

1278
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,390
Probably won't be enough left of him
to send home.

1279
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:12,026
- It's a dirty war.
- It's a lot of shit.

1280
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,152
They love you, Debbie. They love you.

1281
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:20,580
- Where'd you learn to dance like that?
- Ballet class.

1282
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,374
Get on it, woman.

1283
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,776
What's wrong?

1284
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,817
Debbie, what's wrong?

1285
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,900
- What's wrong, girl?
- It's Lance out there.

1286
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,281
He's dancing with another girl.

1287
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,948
Maybe there's a reason.
Maybe it's his sister or something.

1288
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,908
That's not his sister.

1289
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,998
Oh, hell. My bet is it's nothing at all.

1290
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:11,377
Why don't you just go over
and ask him what's going on?

1291
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:12,833
Oh, come on.

1292
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,090
Come on. Cut this stuff out.

1293
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,428
Okay, look. Debbie?

1294
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:25,392
The only way to handle these kind
of things is to be adult about it.

1295
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,435
Just go over and ask him what's happening.
All right'?

1296
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:29,766
Come on.

1297
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,455
Lance?

1298
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:50,958
Debbie.

1299
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:56,175
I loved you! I paid your bail!

1300
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,677
It looks bad. I know.

1301
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,097
- It's New Year's Eve. I tried to get you a job.
- Happy New Year.

1302
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,472
Just a minute. Okay?

1303
01:36:58,396 --> 01:36:59,488
Stop!

1304
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:07,330
Steven! Up here.
Here I am. Hey, Andy.

1305
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:08,622
Laurie, are you all right?

1306
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:11,622
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Good. I have to tell you something.

1307
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:15,126
I just want you to be happy, so if that
means getting a job, or whatever...

1308
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,706
- Really? You mean it?
- I swear to God.

1309
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,666
Good. I found my ring.

1310
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,253
Hey, buddy. Step away from the bus, please.

1311
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,929
- This is my wife.
- I'm his wife.

1312
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:27,305
I don't care if she's your pet monkey.
Just step away from the bus, will you, pal?

1313
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:28,930
Look, she's not a demonstrator.

1314
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,308
- No, Officer, we just got caught up in this.
- That's right.

1315
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:33,515
- We're both innocent.
- Nobody's innocent.

1316
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,724
You're not innocent.

1317
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,981
- We don't even go to this school.
- No, we don't. We're not students.

1318
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,404
Step away from the bus.

1319
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:42,778
Leave him alone. Would
you just leave him...

1320
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:49,788
Don't do that to him!

1321
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,804
You pig! You pig!

1322
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,924
- Steven! Steven!
- Come here!

1323
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:33,157
What happened?

1324
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:36,377
The bus! They're stealing the damn bus!

1325
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,121
Out Of Sight!

1326
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:19,329
- You're a hero of the revolution!
- He's my hero!

1327
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:32,008
He deserves a little kiss, too.
The victory's partly his.

1328
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,183
Hey.

1329
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,731
John, people are gonna be
hearing about this.

1330
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,483
You'll be getting sponsors, sure <i>as</i> hell.

1331
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:48,908
When I do, I'll just come back here
and beat the shit out of you again.

1332
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,446
Yeah, well. Here, you
look better holding it.

1333
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,872
Excuse me.

1334
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:57,541
- Eva, we gotta go. Come on.
- Where have you been?

1335
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:00,712
Dickie Dollwith. What a mistake that was.

1336
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:04,632
Talk about an animal. 100% crude animal.

1337
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:07,256
- Come on. We're late.
- Wait a minute. I gotta talk to her.

1338
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,680
She can't talk to you. We're supposed
to go to some dippy dinner with my parents.

1339
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,759
Anyway, she doesn't understand
anything you say.

1340
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,889
Yeah, no. It's important.
I gotta talk to her.

1341
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,720
Does anybody here speak Swedish?

1342
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,606
- I speak a little Swedish.
- Get outta here.

1343
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,227
- Hey, John, I bet old Ole does.
- That's right.

1344
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:28,030
- Come here.
- Wait. Hey, I gotta get her home.

1345
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,944
Hey, Ole, wait a second. Come on.

1346
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,409
Listen, do you speak Swedish?

1347
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,580
No.

1348
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,877
- I speak Norwegian.
- Well, try talking to her.

1349
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,135
She isn't Swedish. She's from Iceland.

1350
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,888
Iceland? Well, you can talk to her?

1351
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,141
- I think so.
- Well, tell her I love her.

1352
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:07,770
Tell her I wanna marry her.

1353
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,702
And tell her I wanna go
out with her tonight.

1354
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:17,997
How many times do I have to tell you?

1355
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,040
We gotta have dinner
with my parents tonight.

1356
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,961
Well then ask her if she wants to watch
the Rose Bowl game tomorrow.

1357
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:32,719
Yes.

1358
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,026
She said she would like to very much

1359
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:58,488
and she also thinks
you are a very attractive man.

1360
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,040
And one other thing.

1361
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:04,410
A big victory kiss.

1362
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,714
Come on, Eva. Now really, we gotta go now.
Come on.

1363
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:12,468
Be careful and I'll see you tomorrow.

1364
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:14,713
- Thanks, Ole.
- Yeah.

1365
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,518
<i>Mary</i> Wells, <i>with</i> My Guy.

1366
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,479
<i>It's a great New Year's Eve</i>

1367
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:31,153
<i>and don't be checking your clocks, 'cause the
old Wolfman's got the correct time here.</i>

1368
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:35,825
<i>I'm gonna be counting you down and
counting you right up into the New Year.</i>

1369
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:49,338
You should've been there.

1370
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,420
- How'd they take it? How'd they take it?
- How did they take it'?

1371
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,467
- Right on the head, yeah. Tons of it.
- I love it.

1372
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,427
Tons of it. It was beautiful. It was great.

1373
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:57,130
And they think I'm dead?
They really think I'm killed?

1374
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:58,965
The congressman said it was a tragic loss

1375
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:01,676
and he's personally gonna write
a letter of condolence to your family.

1376
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,928
Oh, yeah.

1377
01:43:04,553 --> 01:43:06,647
Well, that's not easy,
but I guess nothing we can do about it.

1378
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:07,974
- Did you get the stuff?
- Oh, yeah.

1379
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:12,107
There's food, survival kit.
I even scraped together some dough.

1380
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,439
- Terrific, man. Boots?
- Two pair.

1381
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:15,614
Oh, great. Thank you.

1382
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:18,113
You really gonna walk out of here?

1383
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,945
I got news for you, pal,
I'm halfway home already.

1384
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:24,119
You know, you may not be able to go home.
You're a deserter now.

1385
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:28,336
What the hell.
I've always kind of wanted to see Europe.

1386
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:33,083
Oh, come on. Look at me. I'm a free man.

1387
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:35,293
The war is over and I win.

1388
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:37,010
And I love your shirt.

1389
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:45,470
- Take care of yourself, pal.
- Hey, you, too.

1390
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:48,389
- I owe you dinner.
- It's a deal.

1391
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:03,329
How you doing?

1392
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,871
- Terrible.
- Me, too.

1393
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:12,380
I wish I could make you feel better.

1394
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,754
Oh, well.

1395
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,961
Hey, listen, why don't you come with us?

1396
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:24,009
- Where are y'all going?
- Mount Tam, watch the sun come up.

1397
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:32,142
- I don't think so.
- Come on. You got nothing better to do.

1398
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,944
It's New Year's Eve. Cheer up.

1399
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,572
Come on.

1400
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,041
Hey, Debbie, come on. Cheer up.

1401
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:01,129
Hey, listen, breaking up ain't easy to do.
I know it because I've been there before.

1402
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,972
I mean, I never will
forget my old girlfriend.

1403
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:07,928
Loretta Louise Willemay Jordan ll.

1404
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:11,184
Did you know that her old man before me
was a welder?

1405
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,516
And Debbie, let me tell you,
he had scars all up and down his arms.

1406
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,442
You should've seen it, I mean solid scars.

1407
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:18,237
Let me ask you a question.
You got any scars? I got an appendix scar.

1408
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:20,818
You know what? It just came to my mind.

1409
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:23,151
But you know, I used to know a guy
whose whole face was a scar?

1410
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,736
And guess what they called him?
You won't believe it.

1411
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,913
- What?
- Right? Scar. Mm-hmm.

1412
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,330
But I didn't think
that was very funny because

1413
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:32,000
Debbie, the poor guy burned himself up
trying to pour gas in a carburetor.

1414
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:34,579
- Wait a minute...
- Speaking of gas, you know, I had beans...

1415
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:37,085
- Stop! Stop!
- What, what, what?

1416
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:39,501
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, okay. What?

1417
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,844
Whatever you do,
don't hit those garbage cans!

1418
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:54,933
I wonder what the guys at the
Junior Chamber are gonna say about this.

1419
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,810
I mean, it was just...

1420
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,190
Look at this.

1421
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,200
Oh, I almost forgot what day it is.

1422
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,324
<i>Oh, it's been
a great New Year's Eve.</i>

1424

1425

<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

1426
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,715
- Five, four, three...
- Five, four, three...

1427
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:22,043
- two, one!
- two, one!

1428
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:24,174
Happy New Year!

1429
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:25,713

1430
