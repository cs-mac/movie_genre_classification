1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,009
When Oh Jak Doo didn't say
anything...

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,250
and ran away to the countryside,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,019
that's when you were supposed to
watch a movie with me.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,789
You are not going to make me
wait again, are you?

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:15,949
No, no, no!

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:17,620
Never!

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,660
I met Gyeong Sook and her husband
at the broadcasting station.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,260
Jae Hyung said we should
buy them dinner...

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,030
since the documentary
went well.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,199
What should we do?

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,100
We can watch the movie tomorrow.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,299
Do you want me to go there?

13
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,170
(Do you want me to go there?)

14
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,649
No, it's okay.

15
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:49,920
(Episode 23: Marriage is
having someone you always care.)

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
I thought you are going to be
here at night.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,770
My student doesn't have
sensitive hands.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,329
So I was worried.

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,170
Aren't you here because you are
not meeting Seung Joo anymore?

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,010
Because I don't even know
where to start.

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,049
Right...

23
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,150
I dropped by the broadcasting
station this morning,

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,989
and I knew you wouldn't be able to
see the movie with her tonight.

25
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,390
I knew she was going to ditch you.

26
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,700
Did you meet Seung Joo?

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,299
No, I just heard something
at the broadcasting station.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,930
What is it?

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,500
Well, the documentary
was successful.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
Of course, it's positive news.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,810
It's just a problem that
you don't know what I know.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,010
Don't talk around and
be complicated.

33
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,849
Can you not go back
to the countryside?

34
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,519
Can you just live in Seoul?

35
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,819
Han Seung Joo is the only one
who can suggest that to me.

36
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,890
You can't do that.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,859
It looks like she can't say it
even though she wants to.

38
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,530
- That's why I'm saying this to you.
- She and I can...

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,900
talk about everything.

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,530
Then how did you not know that she
got the job offer from the station?

41
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,569
You know how much Seung Joo wants
to work at the broadcasting station.

42
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,539
- Of course, I know.
- She can do it now.

43
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,780
But she's supposed to go to
the countryside with you.

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm sure that's why she couldn't
talk about it freely.

45
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,080
That's why I'm telling you
about it in advance.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,620
Are you Seung Joo?

47
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,120
If there's any good news,
she'll tell me first.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,159
If she's concerned about anything,
she'll also tell me first.

49
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,830
Who do you think you are
to have these unnecessary worries?

50
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,530
I was just...

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,659
You know you have to focus
as much as you can...

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,430
and that's not even enough
to be better than now.

53
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,639
Do you think you can make one
proper gayageum before you die...

54
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,800
when you are this distracted
by everything?

55
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,310
Hold the wood
and think about yourself.

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Let me pick up the phone first.

57
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,349
Hello?

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,219
Oh, Mrs. Park!

59
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,620
Did you finish the paperwork?

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,729
Excuse me.

61
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,229
I see.

62
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,430
Really? If you look at the file...

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,900
I'll see you at the office.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,909
- Take care.
- Take care, sir.

65
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,210
Take care, sir!

66
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,340
Jae Hyung, I have to go.

67
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,509
We are going to go get some coffee.
Why don't you join us?

68
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,449
I'll do that next time.
Bye! I'm going!

69
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,509
But...

70
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,789
She can take the job
for our new project.

71
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,889
We don't know if she's going to
work with us or not yet.

72
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,819
Who can say no to the position
at the broadcasting station?

73
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,789
That's where she always came to
get confirmations for her work.

74
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,900
We can just make a new team
for the new project for her.

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Should we?

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,500
Sir!

77
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,539
Yes, Han Seung Joo?

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,069
Excuse me.

79
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,810
I couldn't tell
you about it properly...

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,750
when we were in the restaurant
because there were other people.

81
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,750
I thought about it a lot.

82
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,889
But I came here because I thought
it would be better...

83
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,949
if I told you what my opinion is.

84
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,360
Tell me what it is.

85
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,229
First, I would like to thank
you for proposing...

86
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,860
such a wonderful opportunity for me.

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,730
I heard you applied
for a job at our station before.

88
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,899
But my situation changed...

89
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:27,110
a little bit since then.

90
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,639
So...

91
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,579
You might think that I'm rude,

92
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,410
but could I work
by contract for each program?

93
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:39,550
There are some producers
who work by contract like that.

94
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,220
If you could consider my situation,

95
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,459
I can work harder than anyone else.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,029
The reason why I'm trying
to recruit and hire you is...

97
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,160
because
our organization needs you.

98
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,600
I see.

99
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,500
I don't know what happened
to make you turn down...

100
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,069
such a great opportunity,
so take care of that.

101
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,509
I'll wait to hear good news.

102
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,139
Think about it and contact us.

103
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,509
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

104
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,410
Where are you?

105
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,920
Home.

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,389
("Home")

107
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,399
("I'm sorry that...")

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,370
I'm sorry that I couldn't keep...

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,870
my promise to watch a movie.

110
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,779
It's okay.
I didn't keep my promise back then.

111
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,750
I think I'm going to be
a little late today.

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,029
I'll wait.

113
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,399
Okay.

114
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,399
What is the world like?

115
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,899
The world?

116
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,430
It's frustrating.

117
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,100
The world...

118
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,639
labels me...

119
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,810
the minute I leave home.

120
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,550
Woman,

121
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,649
born from poor parents,

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,889
and graduated
from a third-rate university.

123
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,759
Do you know how hard...

124
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,129
it is to remove
even one of those labels?

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,040
You have to be
cowardly at least 1,000 times,

126
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,209
and get rid
of your pride 10,000 times.

127
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,740
Still then, you're not even sure
whether that will be enough or not.

128
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,120
But...

129
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:02,620
if I do a good job on this project,

130
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm going to hide...

131
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,759
all of those labels
behind my name, Han Seung Joo.

132
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,170
Then it ended up to be...

133
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,000
better that Seung Joo
didn't get that job that time.

134
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:19,199
Of course.

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,939
Recruit and hire,
doesn't it even sound special?

136
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,379
Remember that producer Jeong gave
us the worst time...

137
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,839
when we went to the broadcasting
station to get confirmation.

138
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,509
Show him how good you are
and defeat him.

139
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,850
Do you think I'm going to the
broadcasting station for a revenge?

140
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,950
When you applied for that job last
time, producer Jeong criticized...

141
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,549
you the most for not having
a documentary on your filmography.

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,419
You took care of that.

143
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,659
The world is in your hands.

144
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,159
Of course. What should we eat?

145
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,600
This isn't a normal celebration.

146
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,929
I decided
to go to the country with him.

147
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,200
What?

148
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,769
After the documentary,

149
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,740
we're going to live
in the country together.

150
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,909
What will you do in the country?

151
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,580
I can come to Seoul sometimes...

152
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,009
if someone requests a job.

153
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,580
So does that mean that
you rejected that offer?

154
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:04,919
I didn't yet.

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
To be honest, I became greedy.

156
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,250
That's not greed.

157
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,690
If people knew how hard
you worked to remain in this field,

158
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,860
they wouldn't ask
you to keep your promise.

159
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,799
I have to be separated from him.

160
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,659
Tell him to live in Seoul together.

161
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,700
After watching the documentary,
even I wouldn't be able to say that.

162
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,070
When I got the offer,

163
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,940
it was my dream,

164
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,340
but I wanted to do it more
because of realistic reasons.

165
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,779
What kind of realistic reasons?

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,379
If you have 2 or 3 years
of work experience...

167
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,049
at a broadcasting station,
it is more stable...

168
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,879
to work as a freelancer
in the country.

169
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,250
It would also be
easier to get shows.

170
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,490
Seeing that she's thinking
like that,

171
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,990
she must have really decided to bury
her bones in the country.

172
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,690
Oh, my. What should we do?

173
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,690
Doesn't Hyuk know yet?

174
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,960
No.

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm not confident of being
separated from him.

176
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,070
It's my greed...

177
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,840
to ask him to live in Seoul.

178
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,269
I can't see his face yet...

179
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,340
because I haven't organized
my thoughts yet.

180
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
How can I tell him?

181
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,539
You should decide with your head,
not your heart.

182
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,509
You won't be able to stand
giving up all of your work...

183
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,519
and live in the country
only because of Hyuk.

184
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,350
She's not giving up.

185
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,889
I wish Seung Joo would be
with him more...

186
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,549
and work less.

187
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
You can't survive only with dreams.
Aren't you going to make money?

188
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,490
Don't you remember how happy
Seung Joo is when she's with him?

189
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,029
I know, but she's not in
a situation...

190
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,230
where she can just be with him.

191
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,529
Still...

192
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,240
This is the news.

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,549
This is the subject
of the piano recital.

194
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,990
Are you home?

195
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,419
Yes.

196
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,590
- No.
- That's not enough.

197
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,230
There's not enough food.

198
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,700
- Is it okay?
- No.

199
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,539
Should we eat?

200
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,840
This is really nice.

201
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,470
It's really delicious.

202
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,809
The sudden rescue request of a hero.

203
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,350
Yes, I'm being in the headlines.

204
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,490
You can see a square filled...

205
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,389
with impressive buildings.

206
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,129
How about...

207
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,940
getting married?

208
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,149
Why?

209
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,980
Are you not going to get married?

210
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,759
Not like last time.

211
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,830
When you first came to me...

212
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,360
and asked me to marry you,

213
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:06,769
and asked me to be your husband,

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,470
it sounded like you were asking...

215
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,970
me to save you to me.

216
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,340
But...

217
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
but it also sounds like last time...

218
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,980
today.

219
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,220
Why didn't you tell me...

220
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,289
about the broadcasting station?

221
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,759
I already know everything.

222
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:40,769
Why aren't you telling me?

223
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,600
I was just...

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,210
sorry.

225
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,809
Why are you sorry?

226
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,580
I thought I might not be
able to keep...

227
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,879
my promise to go with you.

228
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,590
Are you going to marry me...

229
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,059
to make me go back
feeling relieved?

230
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,289
I want to be with you...

231
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,570
rather than a marriage like that.

232
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,600
I'll be...

233
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,509
by your side.

234
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,379
I know how hard it is...

235
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,519
for you to be in Seoul.

236
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,419
That's my issue to take care of.

237
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,509
Gushing.

238
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,480
Do you remember?

239
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,789
Yes.

240
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,919
Why are you throwing it out?

241
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,230
Isn't it a good thing...

242
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,700
that you got to quit
that broadcasting system?

243
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,970
That's why I saved them.

244
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,340
Let's go outside.

245
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,690
Cheers.

246
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,519
I mean... It's...

247
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,629
Don't we have to cheers...

248
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,429
in a couple's manner?

249
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,809
I love you.

250
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,220
I have to say this...

251
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,830
when I really want to get married
to someone.

252
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:24,759
You're right.

253
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,250
So you're saying you're not going
back to the country?

254
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:46,250
I just switched my time there
to the one in Seoul.

255
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,419
It's not that I should
come back to Seoul when I need to.

256
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,759
I'll be going to the country
when I'm needed.

257
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,529
Is it because of Seung Joo?

258
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,659
No, it's because of me.

259
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,860
For what I understand, you are
the opposite of city life.

260
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,399
Instead of just missing Seung Joo
in the country,

261
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,470
I rather see her here...

262
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,710
and endure my life in Seoul.

263
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,139
Are you going to quit gayaguem
if Seung Joo tells you to do so?

264
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,309
What kind of rubbish are you saying?

265
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,379
Have you never been in love?

266
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,750
It's not that
I've never been in love.

267
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,789
It's just that I don't want to.

268
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,419
If it's compared to an unemployed,
it's not that I don't want to work.

269
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,389
I just don't want to be in love.

270
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,730
There's no condition to ask for.

271
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:32,230
I just don't want to be in love.
Do you understand?

272
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,529
Why do you have to be like that?

273
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,970
Every woman thinks I'm just a fool
with a lot of money.

274
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,340
My friends think of me as a saint,

275
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,340
but they'd just talk behind my back.

276
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,409
They're all fake.

277
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,080
Then what's real...

278
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,049
in your life?

279
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,860
Hey, Mr. Choi. How many
times do I have to tell you?

280
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,559
Oh Hyuk doesn't want to do...

281
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,000
any interviews including...

282
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,900
Just tell him that you'd do it.

283
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,970
I've already paid off all the debts.

284
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,839
The debts
I'm paying off from now on...

285
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,470
will be a debt of gratitude.

286
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,579
I'll call you back.

287
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,359
Instead, I'll leave...

288
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,819
a real gayageum in your life,

289
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,789
so get prepared for it.

290
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,099
Is that how he seduced Seung Joo?

291
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,700
Is that how?

292
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,049
- Let's go to work.
- I'm on my way!

293
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,140
What is it?

294
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,109
Who are you?

295
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,549
You startled me.

296
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,490
You don't look like Seung Joo
I know.

297
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,690
It's because I have to take
an ID photo.

298
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,660
Stop staring. Let's go already.
It's going to rain.

299
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,759
We're going to be late. Hurry.

300
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,140
What? Watch the road.

301
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,920
This won't do. Pull the car. Hurry.

302
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,700
Move over.

303
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,240
Honey.

304
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,440
Honey.

305
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,609
- Stop it.
- Just drive.

306
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,779
Concentrate on driving.

307
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,319
Pull your chin a little.

308
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,019
Stare to your left.

309
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,019
Smile a little. I'm going to
take it. In 1, 2, 3.

310
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,529
- It's all good.
- Thank you.

311
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,000
That's good.

312
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,170
What? What is it?

313
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,039
Could you take us two?

314
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,940
Oh, no. It's okay. Don't.

315
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,109
- Thank you.
- What?

316
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,250
Okay. Here we go.
In 1, 2, 3.

317
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,359
This is the list of documents
you need. So prepare them.

318
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,160
The official appointment
will take three weeks.

319
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,230
Okay. Thank you.

320
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,750
I wanted to show you this first.

321
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,650
Thank you. And I'm also sorry.

322
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,960
Don't be.

323
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,750
Gosh, you startled me.

324
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:22,690
The 12 of them are done.

325
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,890
I've never pulled an all-nighter.

326
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,960
I've done enough, so I'm leaving.

327
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,529
Are you telling me to sit down?
My goodness.

328
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:37,099
The specialized sound in gayaguem
is never possible with this aspect.

329
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,769
They all need to be
in the same shape...

330
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,609
in order for gayaguem to play
in a synchronized sound.

331
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,180
Gosh, they're all in the same shape.

332
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,049
It's as if they're mechanized.

333
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,460
They all look the same.

334
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,329
It's just one.

335
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,859
It's just that one that's
in different size.

336
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:15,240
Sir, excuse me.

337
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,710
It takes four hours to carve this.

338
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,910
Do it again.

339
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,980
Most of documentary shows
regading Chuseok contains...

340
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,950
a story of people visiting
their hometown.

341
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,150
How about we twist it a little?

342
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,750
Instead of visiting the hometown,

343
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,160
there are many who just
try to survive in Seoul.

344
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,720
That's a good idea.
Chuseok.

345
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,490
The original one sounds so boring.

346
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,259
There's no similar document
in this world.

347
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,069
There needs to be a new perspective.

348
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,099
Look for more related
documents online.

349
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,240
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,410
I'll collect the documents found
on magazines and personal documents.

351
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,039
I have ones ready.

352
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,279
- You're so well-prepared.
- That's great.

353
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:56,779
This is called a double-resonance.

354
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Double-resonance.

355
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,990
- Fit it right into its position.
- All right.

356
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,759
Hold on.

357
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,829
You're making a hole in it?

358
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,160
Why don't you use this?

359
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,799
All right. I'll put it down.

360
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,670
Insert this here.

361
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,509
Insert it and then pull it tightly.

362
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,180
I see.

363
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,630
You need to have a good ear
to differentiate good sounds...

364
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,730
Sir, the reporters are...

365
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,430
Get out.

366
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,009
For it to have a good sound,

367
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,049
you need to have a good ear.

368
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,210
All right.

369
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,880
That way,

370
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,990
you'll become an artisan
who can make good instruments.

371
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,420
All right.

372
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,000
Making a proper instrument...

373
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,599
as an artisan means...

374
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,470
you'll have to be responsible
for yourself.

375
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:29,140
That tells how deep that person's
life is.

376
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,880
Now,

377
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,410
you'll have to manage
everything on your own.

378
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,480
I know that.

379
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,690
What happened
to Grandfather's seal...

380
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,859
Here.

381
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,549
The reporters are waiting.

382
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,789
CEO Eric.

383
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,559
This is the first gayaguem of
Mr. Oh Geum Bok's seal.

384
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,599
Have you prepared any special
event for it?

385
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,569
There's no other interview
prepared today.

386
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,240
You're going to make gayageum
yourself...

387
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,579
and continue the legacy
of Mr. Oh Geum Bok.

388
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,509
Are you going to collaborate
with Oh Hyuk?

389
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,720
Hold on. If you're done
taking photos,

390
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,849
shall we wrap this up?

391
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,990
Can we get a separate interview
with Oh Hyuk?

392
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,460
Is there a special reason his
grandfather left the seal with you?

393
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,190
I'm sorry. Let's make another
appointment for interviews.

394
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,559
Gosh, I think I've seen the document
about plan somewhere.

395
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,130
I got it!

396
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:03,869
Grandma.

397
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,369
Isn't it the season for harvesting?

398
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,710
I bet it's really green...

399
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,549
to see it whenever you go out
to the town.

400
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,420
I bet it's full of the scent
of lilac.

401
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,589
It's hard to smell that scent here.

402
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,220
I've never noticed how the spring
has gone by.

403
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,140
Are you sleeping?

404
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,039
Why are you here?

405
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:47,880
Why are you asking me that?

406
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,579
Gosh, I'm busted.

407
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,420
It's hard to find a place...

408
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,650
to lie down here like this in Seoul.

409
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,589
But I can see the mountains
from here,

410
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,759
and it's not suffocating.

411
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,289
It's nice to come
whenever I want to relax.

412
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,630
If you want to go back
to your place in the country...

413
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,970
I become a fool without you.

414
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,839
Where would I go without you?

415
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:17,579
What if I'm next to you?

416
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,380
Then...

417
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,650
I'll be another type of fool.

418
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,130
Gosh, come on.

419
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,799
- What do you want?
- Gosh.

420
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,099
Get out already.

421
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,099
It's not that I asked you
to pay for everything.

422
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,569
Why don't you let me get a car?

423
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,440
How can I have a thief
inside my house?

424
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,869
Besides, you're full
of unrightful thoughts.

425
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:49,670
I've given up on you.
I can't handle you anymore.

426
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,609
- You can get out.
- What?

427
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:53,509
Excuse me,

428
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,309
for people to raise
a kid thesedays,

429
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,019
it's a must to have a car.

430
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,450
Yes. I told her that she can
use my car if she needs to.

431
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,789
When a kid has to go to a hospital
and you're away with the car,

432
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,619
what are you going to do?

433
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,190
If that's your logic,

434
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,299
those without cars can't bring
their kids to a hospital, can they?

435
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,670
I mean, why to have no hope?

436
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,200
We need to have hope in order
to improve...

437
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,309
Of course. That's right.

438
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,170
But for someone like her,
it's hard to have hope.

439
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,009
It's a relief if she doesn't
hit rock bottom.

440
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,750
How can she have hope?
What if she ruins everything?

441
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,150
I mean, she needs to keep herself
positive, doesn't she?

442
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,720
How can you say that?

443
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,319
You should get out with her.

444
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,490
What? What did you say?

445
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,619
Well...

446
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,230
You can't do this.

447
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,559
What? You think we can't?

448
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,930
This is why you can't have a kid.

449
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,269
Hey, Jeong Mi.

450
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,200
- How dare she...
- How dare...

451
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,769
- Have you seen her?
- Don't be like this.

452
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,569
Don't do this.

453
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,640
What are you doing?
Come with me.

454
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,710
- Hey.
- Come with me.

455
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,839
- Come with me.
- Wait.

456
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,779
- Let go of this.
- Come with me.

457
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,980
Yong Min.

458
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,049
Jeong Mi.

459
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:03,349
Mother, where are you going?

460
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,819
I'll get my stuff
when Yong Min isn't here.

461
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:06,990
Just so you know.

462
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,119
Darn you.

463
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,490
- Let's go.
- Wait.

464
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,190
- Gosh.
- Excuse me.

465
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,529
Goodness.

466
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,529
Honey, were you harsh on them?

467
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:18,200
Why would they talk about
packing their stuff?

468
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,430
They'll probably spend a day or two
in a dry sauna or something.

469
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,200
She's done that before,
don't you know?

470
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,339
Honey, let's go back
to the infertility clinic.

471
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,710
I thought you didn't mind
having no child.

472
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,609
Honey, I can't stand...

473
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:36,609
Jeong Mi bragging about her
having a kid.

474
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,650
- Are you being jealous?
- What?

475
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,890
Anyway, let's make an appointment.

476
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,890
Oh, that flyer from the desk.
Give me that number again.

477
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,930
What's the number?

478
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,730
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

479
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,930
I can't read this.

480
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,200
Could you read this out for me?

481
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,170
You're not supposed to let
anyone read your security card.

482
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,269
Who's the person you're talking to?

483
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:03,910
They said the money in my account
keeps getting out.

484
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,940
The policeman told me so.

485
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,180
Give it to me.

486
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,849
Hello? You're working hard
scheming a grandma, aren't you?

487
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,890
Aren't you voice phising?

488
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,160
Then let's exchange names.

489
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,759
I'm a police officer too.

490
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,329
Since we work in the same field,
let's exchange names.

491
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:24,460
- Well...
- Gosh.

492
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,670
What should I do?

493
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,299
What's wrong?

494
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,900
Hold on, Jeong Mi.

495
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,279
Don't waste your time on this,
and get a grip, you jerk.

496
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,980
Grandma,

497
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,779
just hang up when you get a call
like this, okay?

498
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,119
Thank you.

499
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,890
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

500
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,890
I ran away from home.

501
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,329
- Go back in.
- I don't want to.

502
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,829
You'll only have a hard time
if you run away from home.

503
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,599
- Hurry. Go back.
- Don't push me. No.

504
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,440
Mom suddenly visited, so I think
I should have dinner. Is that okay?

505
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,809
Okay.

506
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,809
I won't be too late, okay?

507
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,279
Seung Joo.

508
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,980
I'm going.

509
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,990
Ever since I started
living at his home,

510
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,230
I've never had a chance
to have a proper meal.

511
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,029
How can he be so mean?

512
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,529
I can have this kind of meal since
you're hired, right?

513
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,299
Eat up.

514
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:41,869
This tastes so good because
it's expensive.

515
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm so glad that you're not like
any other moms.

516
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,950
What do you mean?

517
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,720
When I was young, I talked
about this with my friends.

518
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,289
I told them that my mom likes
the middle part of fish.

519
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,819
So they thought I was weird.

520
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,789
Their moms all liked eating
the heads of fish.

521
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,759
Are you talking badly of me?

522
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,000
I felt bad when I was young,

523
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,670
but now that I think of it,
if you only sacrificed for me,

524
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,769
I wouldn't have felt so easy
like how I'm feeling right now.

525
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:17,539
Are you being sarcastic about how
I shouldn't expect so much from you?

526
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,079
Before, I used to take care of
your living expenses...

527
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,519
and Seung Tae's school fee...

528
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,450
that I never found joy in working,

529
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,059
but now it's different even though
I'm working the same job.

530
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,589
I don't expect much from you either.

531
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:35,559
So please just get married...

532
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,700
before Jak Doo sees
the real side of you.

533
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,029
Don't judge me.

534
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,839
I'm just being honest.

535
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,470
What? Is it a crime to want
a rich son-in-law?

536
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,480
Is that such a crime?

537
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
He has an unrivaled skill.

538
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,009
- He can just...
- He's...

539
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,619
someone who should not
care about money.

540
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,549
Even if we get married,
I'll be the one earning.

541
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,819
- What did you say?
- So...

542
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,660
please don't tell me
to get married,

543
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,960
thinking he'll bring us a fortune.

544
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:11,559
I won't sacrifice myself for you,

545
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,769
but I will do my duty as a daughter.

546
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,140
Then why don't you give me
a monthly payment as a daughter?

547
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:24,640
Well, I'm getting good responses.

548
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
Our foundation...

549
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,009
Hey, wait. Excuse me, Seung Joo.

550
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,349
Hold on. I'll call you back.

551
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,450
Hey, what are you doing here?

552
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,690
- Isn't he at his workshop?
- Wait.

553
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,160
He is,

554
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:46,200
but while he was trying to teach me,
one of his musicians...

555
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,000
who was practicing visited him
as the string broke.

556
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,740
Oh, he must be fixing it now.

557
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,809
That's right.

558
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,569
So...

559
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,710
I think you can wait for him
with me here.

560
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,880
Can I not watch him
fixing the string?

561
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,119
That's not what it is.

562
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,420
The gayageum player is...

563
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,619
Jang Eun Jo.

564
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,489
What?

565
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,159
It's Jang Eun Jo.

566
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,230
Jang?

567
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,260
It's Jang Eun Jo.

568
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,039
I'll go watch then.

569
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,099
What?

570
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,869
Seung Joo...

571
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:36,210
Silk strings are
really weak at humidity.

572
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,150
The hot weather loosens it a lot.

573
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:55,070
It's been a while.

574
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,570
Hi.

575
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,739
Is it going to take a while?

576
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:00,670
No, it's almost done.

577
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,980
If you try to tighten
the strings up too much...

578
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,440
to make sounds...

579
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,780
when they are loose,
they can break.

580
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,150
I know.

581
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,030
You have to have spare strings.

582
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,190
I see.

583
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,070
The body of your gayageum can be
a bit shaky during the performance.

584
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,869
So don't forget the rosin powder.

585
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,369
Thank you.

586
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,469
Eun Jo, if you are done,

587
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,539
I need to have a word with you.

588
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,639
Okay.

589
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,980
- I'll go.
- Good luck with your performance.

590
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,789
Hey,

591
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,610
Strings of Gayageum...

592
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,940
easily break during performances.

593
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,210
For some performances, gayageum
makers even stay at the backstage.

594
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,050
That's not what it is.

595
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,349
I feel a bit weird.

596
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:54,789
It's not because of Jang Eun Jo.

597
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,489
It's because of myself.

598
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,360
What is it?

599
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,460
It feels like...

600
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,429
I have...

601
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,800
forgotten about something.

602
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,400
Working at the broadcasting station,

603
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,170
I had a lot of things
I needed to take care of.

604
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,940
But working there was fun.

605
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:22,179
So I couldn't really think about
other than my work.

606
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,280
But how can I be like this?

607
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,119
Did something happen to you?

608
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,000
I've forgotten about...

609
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,599
who Oh Jak Doo really was.

610
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,309
They are the same gayageums
you've been making.

611
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,480
When we were filming
the documentary,

612
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,010
how you looked at the studio
in the countryside...

613
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,650
was very different from how you are
here. Did you know that?

614
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:01,889
No, I didn't know that.

615
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,030
You are at somewhere
you don't belong.

616
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:09,659
How can you not know?

617
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,300
I...

618
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,429
I chose to be here because
I want to be next to you, Seung Joo.

619
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,469
Is that right though?

620
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,010
Someone I like...

621
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:25,010
doesn't look happy at all...

622
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,750
when he's doing his job.

623
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,920
So I don't know if I should make you
stay here to be next to me.

624
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,960
I have to reconsider it.

625
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,559
About what?

626
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,369
Us.

627
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,909
You made the right decision.

628
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,380
You have to go if you have to go.

629
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:03,250
You've been holding on to
somewhere you don't like.

630
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,820
Just watching you is painful.

631
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,789
I'm going to be here
once every two weeks.

632
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,719
So don't forget your homework.

633
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,329
I told you I'll do it!

634
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you not need anything
to bring there by the way?

635
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,670
What should I give you?

636
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,199
Do you want to take this with you?

637
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,449
Take this.

638
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,880
I live on the ground.
Why would I need that?

639
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,179
Do you live in a mud hut?

640
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,380
But...

641
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,090
it's the most comfortable
place for me to live.

642
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,219
You can take my car if you want.

643
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,719
I stay in the mountain
6 days a week.

644
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,130
So I don't need a car.

645
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,760
If I tell you to take it,
just take it!

646
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,230
Why are you yelling at me?

647
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,170
I express my affection
by spending money...

648
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,039
Money is the only thing I have.

649
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,440
Since I was young,

650
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,409
that's how I've been living my life.

651
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,940
So I can only feel comfortable
after giving you something.

652
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,179
You don't want the vacuum cleaner,
but you don't want the car either.

653
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:07,550
Well...

654
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,710
Should I just give you cash?

655
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,880
We are friends. We should know
how we feel even without a word.

656
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,989
I can feel your heart,

657
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,989
Eric Cho Bong Sik.

658
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,059
Is this enough?

659
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,760
Well...

660
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,860
You are the cool one
in this relationship.

661
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,429
This is when Oh Jak Doo
comes to Seoul.

662
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,329
And...

663
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,440
This is...

664
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,440
when Han Seung Joo
comes here.

665
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,079
From now on, we are going to be...

666
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,519
in a long-distance relationship.

667
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:27,230
Have you heard of it before?

668
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,030
Long-distance?

669
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:30,500
No.

670
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,630
It's a romantic relationship where
they are physically far away...

671
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,070
because of working overseas and
countryside, or studying overseas.

672
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:40,940
So even though we are far away,
nothing changes.

673
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,679
We live our own lives
at our own places.

674
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,780
Then?

675
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,010
We meet each other
just once a week.

676
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,280
And we don't see each other
forever again.

677
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:53,889
But we've become husband and wife
as soon as we met each other.

678
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,150
So what are we now?

679
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:56,960
We are dating.

680
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:04,260
When you arrive at your place,
the first thing you have to do is...

681
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,059
finding the best spot
for your phone to work.

682
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:09,369
8am and 9pm.

683
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,769
We are going to talk on the phone
twice a day.

684
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,340
That's the basis of
the long-distance relationship.

685
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,510
Hello?

686
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,780
Hi.

687
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,079
Hi.

688
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,090
This is a bit awkward, isn't it?

689
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,489
Are you going to work now?

690
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,960
Yes, I am.

691
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,260
Did you have breakfast?

692
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,630
Yes.

693
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,429
You found somewhere
with the good reception!

694
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,500
That's the first thing I did
when I got here.

695
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,070
How's the weather there?

696
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:46,400
It's a bit sad that I have to
enjoy this alone.

697
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,409
I want to be there.

698
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,280
I miss you.

699
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,340
Me too.

700
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,550
Are we going to meet this Saturday?

701
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,420
- Yes.
- That's good.

702
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,099
(Guardian)

703
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,840
Your call is not connected.

704
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,510
Please leave a message.

705
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,050
(Hang Seung Joo)

706
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:39,360
I can't talk to you right now.
Sorry.

707
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,199
Where's Polaris?

708
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,440
I could find it quickly in Seoul.

709
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:54,340
You could find it soon there
as there are not so many stars.

710
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,179
You can't see it well here
as there are so many stars.

711
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,780
Do you know how bright it is here...

712
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,250
at a night with a full moon?

713
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,650
It's as bright as day.

714
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,420
That's nonsense.

715
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:11,460
You're ignoring me as I don't know
much about those things.

716
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,730
It that a phone call?

717
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,329
Where's my cell phone?

718
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
(Guardian)

719
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
(Han Seung Joo)

720
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,190
Are you really coming?

721
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:27,659
The express bus to the nearest city
is only at 10am and 3pm.

722
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,860
The last bus to the town is at 7pm,
so I'll take the 10am bus.

723
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,570
It's hard to come here
after you get off the express bus.

724
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,900
Can you come here all right?
Shall I pick you up?

725
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,000
After I get off the express bus,
I take the intercity bus.

726
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,239
Then I get off at Gucheon-dong,
take the bus again,

727
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,610
get off at Jachori,
and I walk to Ttasoonbaegi.

728
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,340
After that I take
the local bus again, right?

729
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,880
Now I can go there
even with my eyes closed.

730
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,119
We might miss each other
if you come too far.

731
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:55,250
Come to the town entrance
by the time I arrive there.

732
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,289
Do you get it?

733
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,590
Yes, I do.

734
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:46,440
(Seoul express bus terminal)

735
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,639
(Station manager Choi)

736
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,050
Hello, Mr. Choi.

737
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:55,750
I got back from a business trip,

738
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,449
and just saw the proposal
for the Chuseok special.

739
00:47:57,619 --> 00:47:59,949
- Director Han, this isn't enough.
- What?

740
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:03,590
Now?

741
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,960
You should report to headquarter
on Monday.

742
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,460
So, you have to choose a new item
and make a proposal until tomorrow.

743
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,230
Let's talk about the details
in my office.

744
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,769
Excuse me, Mr. Choi, I'm now...

745
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:18,170
Mr. Choi. Mr. Choi?

746
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,639
This is driving me crazy!

747
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,150
(Guardian)

748
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,420
You'll be connected
to the voice mail...

749
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,719
Gosh.

750
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,860
(Culture production department
proposal, "Her Rest Area")

751
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,699
Your proposal is not exciting.

752
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,070
That won't bring out high ratings.

753
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,210
Mr. Choi, I'm off today.

754
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,880
If you change the item
so suddenly...

755
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,250
People in broadcasting don't have
a day off.

756
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:03,550
You're working 24 hours
until the program is on air.

757
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,280
You should know better than that.

758
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,949
The director of the headquarters
supports this item too.

759
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:11,460
Do you have to delay the briefing
on Monday because of a day-off?

760
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,389
I understand.

761
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:28,769
(Han Seung Joo)

762
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,829
(Grandma)

763
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,570
- Hello?
- Jak Doo.

764
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,840
You have a parcel delivery.

765
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:08,309
- A parcel delivery?
- Yes.

766
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:11,510
Han Seung Joo is the name
of that miss from Seoul, right?

767
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:14,079
Wait a minute.
I'll go there right away.

768
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,690
Gosh. My goodness.

769
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:29,489
- You will fall down!
- Gosh, I'm so good.

770
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,199
Goodness, you're so good.

771
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,599
Gosh. Goodness gracious!

772
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,170
- I knew it.
- The one who falls down is out!

773
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,070
Jin, it's your turn.

774
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,809
You threw it very well.

775
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:46,639
- That's it. Good.
- You're doing good, Jin.

776
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,380
Jin, you're doing great.

777
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:50,179
Gan Nan and Joong Rye,

778
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:53,349
you should do this instead of me.

779
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:56,050
Jin only wants to play with you.

780
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,489
Even though he's young,

781
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:01,659
he knows
you're the most energetic here.

782
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:05,500
I'm truly about to get ill.

783
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,769
- It's Uncle.
- What?

784
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,199
- Uncle!
- Hi.

785
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,969
- How have you been, Jin?
- Good.

786
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,909
Haven't you met Seung Joo?

787
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:19,510
- No.
- That means she didn't come...

788
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,780
- and only sent the delivery?
- What?

789
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,750
What's this?

790
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,590
Seung Joo sent it.

791
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,159
Hasn't she called you?

792
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,960
- No.
- What's inside?

793
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,530
By the way, you must be so sorry,
Jak Doo.

794
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,369
She must be so busy
that she didn't come.

795
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,280
What if she doesn't come again?

796
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,949
People feel like they would come
every day when they separate.

797
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:03,219
However, out of sight, out of mind.
That's what people do.

798
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:04,889
Don't say such a thing.

799
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,030
She must have been busy
that she couldn't come.

800
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,760
Could it be something
Jak Doo used in Seoul?

801
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,300
Goodness. I guess she got herself
sorted at last...

802
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,599
and sent it to him.

803
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,300
Stop saying!

804
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,909
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

805
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,010
There will be charges
after the beep.

806
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,940
What's this?

807
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,309
Gosh.

With this sad song

822
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,849
In my small heart

823
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:40,429
I want to become

824
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:44,239
One of the stars

825
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:51,539
And shine forever

Oh Jak Doo.

00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,019
I'm going today.

832
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,360
You're not supposed to come today.

833
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,929
Does that mean...

834
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,530
I can't go?

835
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,699
I didn't mean that.

836
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:26,869
Just wait.

837
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:29,139
I'll wait until you come.

838
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,039
