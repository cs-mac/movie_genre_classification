1
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,862
<i>Hello, and a very good morning to you.
It's BBC London, 94.9.</i>

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,604
<i>- It's me, Jo Good, and Paul Ross.
- May I say,</i>

3
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:36,567
<i>with the sun shining outside as
it plays across the beautiful buildings,</i>

4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,903
<i>- you look gorgeous this morning.
- Thank you very much.</i>

5
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,034
<i>- You said a bit of sun.
- My favourite vista ever</i>

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,791
<i>is going over Waterloo Bridge.
You see Westminster, Big Ben,</i>

7
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,749
<i>you see the London Eye,
the South Bank.</i>

8
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,173
<i>The great thing is it's better to be on
Waterloo Bridge looking across the river</i>

9
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:56,175
<i>because Waterloo Bridge is the most
boring bridge apart from London Bridge.</i>

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,716
<i>But on Waterloo, you see good things.
Never stay at the Dorchester.</i>

11
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:02,561
<i>Stay at the cheap place next door
and look down on the Dorchester.</i>

12
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,601
<i>- You save money, get a better view.
- You're so right.</i>

13
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,974
<i>What a lovely city we live in.
Enough of our yakking...</i>

14
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:17,949
<i>Dear Wendy, Olive,</i>

15
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:22,329
<i>Rhona, Natalie and Gemma:</i>

16
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:25,620
<i>I hope you're all very happy.</i>

17
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,911
<i>Did that sound sarcastic?
It was meant to.</i>

18
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,577
<i>What you've collectively done to me...</i>

19
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,470
<i>What you've collectively
done to me is...</i>

20
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:55,890
<i>What you've collectively done to me
is quite an achievement.</i>

21
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,652
<i>Four years ago, I was happy to believe
in a very simple concept.</i>

22
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:03,737
<i>You might have heard of it.
It's called love.</i>

23
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,362
<i>But thanks to the five of you,
I now know that love is a lie,</i>

24
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,247
<i>a myth specifically concocted</i>

25
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:13,164
<i>to bring me as much pain
and misery as possible.</i>

26
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,750
<i>Wendy.</i>

27
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:20,130
<i>Were you ever really
that interested in me?</i>

28
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:21,795
<i>Or was I just understudying for Alex</i>

29
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,255
<i>while you and him
went though a dull patch?</i>

30
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:26,973
<i>Olive.</i>

31
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,928
<i>Almost everything I told you was a lie.</i>

32
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:32,686
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

33
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,357
<i>Rhona. Who did you think I was?</i>

34
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,683
<i>If I was that wrong for you,
you should have been</i>

35
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,398
<i>paying more attention at the start.</i>

36
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,149
<i>Natalie.</i>

37
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,691
<i>OK, so I got myself out of that one,
but did you really want me?</i>

38
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:48,860
<i>Orjust someone?</i>

39
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,696
<i>And Gemma.</i>

40
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,078
<i>What should I say to you?</i>

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,919
<i>I suppose I should forgive you.</i>

42
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:00,003
<i>This is a suicide note, after all.</i>

43
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:03,338
<i>OK, I forgive you.</i>

44
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:07,296
<i>But I don't want that
to make you feel any better.</i>

45
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:11,097
<i>I'm sure you'll all find someone.</i>

46
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:15,014
<i>You might even think you're in love.
But don't kid yourselves.</i>

47
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:18,353
<i>We're all just playing out scenes
we've seen in films.</i>

48
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:22,354
<i>The only difference is our stories
have depressing endings.</i>

49
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:25,195
<i>When real people
walk towards a sunset,</i>

50
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:28,696
<i>no music swells, no credits roll.</i>

51
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,273
<i>They just get to the end of the beach,</i>

52
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,737
<i>have a row and walk back to the car.</i>

53
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,202
<i>And that's depressing.</i>

54
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:42,452
<i>In fact, after reading this you might
feel your only option is to join me.</i>

55
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,582
<i>And that's the one thing
I wouldn't blame you for.</i>

56
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:47,915
<i>Bye, then.</i>

57
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,752
<i>Duncan.</i>

58
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,394
Sorry, but I think my belt
is stuck under your...

59
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:04,102
Sorry. I thought this seat
felt a bit uncomfortable.

60
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,064
No, that's normal.
That's just economy.

61
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,103
Sorry, that's just what?

62
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,357
Economy. That's just being in...

63
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:18,119
- It doesn't matter, wasn't very funny.
- No, I get it.

64
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,750
Sorry. I'm a bit slow sometimes.

65
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:29,381
I'm only in economy because
my firm are such cheapskates.

66
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,836
- Me, too.
- Were you at Graphica?

67
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,672
- Sorry, what?
- At the expo.

68
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,801
You've got no idea
what I'm talking about.

69
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,850
Not really.

70
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,305
Sorry, you must think you've got
lumbered next to a right nutter.

71
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:47,566
- I promise I'll shut up now.
- No, no, not at all.

72
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,272
What is it? Graphic...?

73
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:53,067
Graphica. It's just a work thing.

74
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,276
And I just assumed that you were
coming back from it as well.

75
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,657
Which is, of course, ridiculous.

76
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,204
And a little bit arrogant.

77
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:03,041
I have this tendency to think other
people's lives revolve around mine

78
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,877
so I am gonna stop talking
and leave you in peace.

79
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:08,914
No, that's quite all right. It's OK.

80
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,246
No, I...

81
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:18,840
<i>Of all the people I could have sat
next to, I sat next to Wendy.</i>

82
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,923
<i>I couldn't accept that meeting her
on that plane</i>

83
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,308
<i>had merely been a coincidence.</i>

84
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,598
<i>Had heavenly forces been subtly
shifting our movements</i>

85
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:32,356
<i>so that we would one day meet
on the Paris to London shuttle?</i>

86
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,815
<i>Or was it just down to chance?</i>

87
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:37,194
- Johnny?
- Thanks, Duncan.

88
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,365
OK. Well, between Charles De Gaulle
and Heathrow Airport,

89
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,278
there are two national airlines.

90
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:45,122
And they were running that morning
six flights.

91
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,531
So the odds: one in six.

92
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,287
I'd actually planned to get
the 10.30 Air France flight.

93
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,830
<i>But somehow, a bottle
of shampoo leaked in my bag,</i>

94
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:57,248
<i>wasting a valuable ten minutes.</i>

95
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:00,094
<i>By the time the hotel clerk
had produced my bill,</i>

96
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:04,045
<i>cleared my credit card and
I found a taxi, it was already 9. 15.</i>

97
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:08,470
<i>Then because of some ridiculous
roadworks on the Champs-Élysées,</i>

98
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:11,894
<i>by the time I got to the airport,
my flight had finished boarding.</i>

99
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:15,397
<i>I couldn't be bothered waiting for the
next Air France, so I got the next BA.</i>

100
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,604
- Would you like some lunch, madam?
- Yes, thank you.

101
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,652
- And you, sir?
- No. I don't...

102
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,862
- We have sandwiches if you'd like.
- I'm not really...

103
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,405
Go on. Take them.
I'll eat them. I'm starving.

104
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:28,862
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,781
- Are you sure I'm not depriving you?
- No. Absolutely not.

106
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,039
Thank you.

107
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:43,749
- I love airline food.
- Really? You must be the only one.

108
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:49,134
I don't know, it sort of...
It still seems like a treat somehow.

109
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:51,930
My mum used to have
one of these trays at home,

110
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:55,103
and anything I wouldn't eat,
she'd put in it

111
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,976
and pretend we were going on holiday.

112
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,557
- Did it work?
- Yeah. Every time.

113
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,522
It's kind of...
It's a bit silly, really.

114
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:07,195
No. Not really.
Not as silly as collecting sick bags.

115
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,155
Collecting what?

116
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,121
- No, it's nothing.
- No, do you collect sick bags?

117
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,664
Not anymore.

118
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,628
So how many have you got?

119
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,579
About a hundred?

120
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,214
Blimey! You must have travelled a lot!

121
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:31,553
It was my dad, mainly.
He'd collect them for me.

122
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,929
They were sort of like postcards.
He'd write little messages

123
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,469
and draw pictures on them.
They're like works of art.

124
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,518
- Sweet.
- Really?

125
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:41,480
Well, it did make me want to travel.

126
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,273
He'd write reviews
of the places he'd been.

127
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,185
I always wanted to know
if he was right.

128
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,030
So you're working your way
through the sick bags?

129
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:51,150
Sort of. I suppose I'm about halfway.

130
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:54,610
That's so great. I wish
I had a mission like that.

131
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,870
Something to devote myself to.

132
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,122
I'm Wendy, by the way.

133
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,413
<i>For the next 33 minutes,</i>

134
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:08,209
<i>Wendy gave me her mini biography.</i>

135
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,627
<i>Wendy had been in Paris
attending a trade fair.</i>

136
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:18,213
<i>She worked as a graphic designer
for a fashion magazine in Soho.</i>

137
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,017
<i>She was born in Blackpool...</i>

138
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,728
<i>...but moved to Wiltshire as a child.</i>

139
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:39,361
<i>She did fine art at Camberwell...</i>

140
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,284
<i>...and now lives alone
in a flat in Earl's Court.</i>

141
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,176
The whole place
is falling apart, though.

142
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:09,473
I really shouldn't have bought it.
It needs so much doing to it.

143
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,432
But it was one of those rash decisions.
I have a tendency to do that.

144
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,481
<i>Well, one of those
rash decisions became me.</i>

145
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,861
<i>Soon my life would be full of...</i>

146
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:21,439
I need to see you now.

147
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:24,191
- ... and...
- You make me very happy.

148
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,154
<i>Despite incredible odds,
we had found each other.</i>

149
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,582
<i>Didn't that prove that these things
weren't just down to chance?</i>

150
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:36,248
<i>That God is running some kind
of heavenly dating service?</i>

151
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:42,337
<i>Have you given up hope of ever
finding that special person?</i>

152
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,003
<i>Well, don't despair.</i>

153
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:49,262
<i>At Divine Dating, we have hundreds
of expertly trained staff</i>

154
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,018
<i>standing by to meet
your romantic requirements.</i>

155
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,810
I never thought I'd find her.
I'd given up hope.

156
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,020
<i>A friend introduced me to Divine Dating,
and I've never looked back.</i>

157
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,401
Now, I just think of the future
for both of us.

158
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,529
The three of us, remember?

159
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,320
Oh, yes, the three of us!

160
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,988
<i>Divine Dating.</i>

161
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,365
<i>'Cause one day,
the big fella will get round to you.</i>

162
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,209
And that means you!

163
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,871
<i>It has to be something like that</i>

164
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,829
<i>because otherwise people are just
meaninglessly bumping into each other.</i>

165
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,418
Let me look.
I happen to be a doctor.

166
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,509
- It's very kind of you.
- I had to believe that Wendy and I

167
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,920
<i>were meant to be together.</i>

168
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:29,722
I mean, just look at the evidence.

169
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,764
<i>We were both born at around midnight</i>

170
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:35,634
<i>in the same month
of an even-numbered year.</i>

171
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,019
<i>Both of us tried to learn the clarinet.</i>

172
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,689
<i>We were both in school productions
of A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

173
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,727
<i>We both have two large freckles
on a toe on our left feet,</i>

174
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:48,479
<i>and a cavity in the same rear molar.</i>

175
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:51,410
<i>And both of us
do this in bright sunlight.</i>

176
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:55,077
<i>We even own the same edition
of Anna Karenina.</i>

177
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,617
<i>I was convinced that I was always
destined to sit next to her</i>

178
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,288
<i>and not just any other girl.</i>

179
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:04,035
<i>I was meant to fall in love
with those eyes,</i>

180
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:07,879
<i>that way of combing her hair,
of biting her lower lip.</i>

181
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:12,713
<i>That despite odds of 0.313 per cent,</i>

182
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,638
<i>I was sure that I was put
on this earth to be with Wendy.</i>

183
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,560
I love being with you.
I know that.

184
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:29,523
So, what's the problem?

185
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:32,270
It just wouldn't be fair on Alex.

186
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,241
I thought you said
that didn't matter anymore.

187
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,655
I know, but...

188
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,404
He should be devastated.

189
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,078
You're wonderful.

190
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:46,369
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

191
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:49,879
Stop! Don't, I can't.

192
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,591
It's gonna be painful
whatever happens.

193
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,002
The longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna get.

194
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,088
- I know.
- You told me yourself

195
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,590
that you don't love him any more.

196
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:04,679
It's just that Alex has had so much
tragedy in his life this year.

197
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:08,271
- This'll just destroy him.
- But surely if you keep Iying to him,

198
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,600
it's only gonna make things worse.

199
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,106
I don't know
if I'm Iying to him, though.

200
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,035
What does that mean?

201
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,197
I don't know.

202
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,284
No. Come on, Wendy.

203
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,041
You either love him or you don't.

204
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:34,709
Yeah, I do love him.

205
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,087
Yes, but do you love him
more than me?

206
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,808
Wendy?

207
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,064
Wendy?

208
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,276
<i>So how did this happen?
Where was...?</i>

209
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,692
I need to see you now.

210
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,194
- And...
- You make me very happy.

211
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:09,242
<i>Was this the same person that
on the sixth of December said...</i>

212
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,492
Yeah, I'm sort of with this guy.

213
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:16,828
Sort of. But it's been pretty ropy
for quite some time now.

214
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,631
<i>And two weeks later...</i>

215
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,508
That's it. It's over.

216
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,586
It really is all over.

217
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:25,763
<i>At what point did that become this?</i>

218
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,265
- So you didn't tell him?
- Kind of.

219
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,926
It's kind of obvious.

220
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,096
He's not stupid.

221
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,850
<i>When did the rot set in?</i>

222
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,776
<i>When did Alex start to seem
not that bad after all?</i>

223
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,770
<i>Was it the night
I described Wendy as...</i>

224
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,863
<i>- She's a bit dizzy.
- ... in front of her friends?</i>

225
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:49,536
<i>Was it my lack of enthusiasm
for this piece of contemporary dance?</i>

226
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,902
<i>Maybe I was too clingy.</i>

227
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,871
- Hiya!
- Christ!

228
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,949
<i>Or just too laid back.</i>

229
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:59,419
Hey! Come on, it's starting!

230
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,584
Quick.

231
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:04,338
<i>Or maybe I never really stood
any bloody chance in the first place.</i>

232
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,901
Would you like some wine?

233
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,579
I don't mind. Do you?

234
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:05,946
Whatever you want.

235
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,584
- Either way is fine by me.
- I agree.

236
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,628
So should we have it or not?

237
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,546
Well, I don't think I'll have any.

238
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,381
<i>After five dates with Olive,</i>

239
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:25,510
<i>I still knew almost nothing about her.</i>

240
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,476
What kind of books do you like?

241
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:32,105
I like James Joyce, Henry James,
John Kennedy Toole.

242
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:36,145
<i>I developed new personalities.</i>

243
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,486
- Do you like your job?
- I think all jobs are pretty crappy.

244
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,111
<i>Personalities based
on what I thought</i>

245
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:44,027
<i>she might like.</i>

246
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:46,194
What do you like to do
at the weekends?

247
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,371
I run Saturday mornings,
and I have to see some nature.

248
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,946
Right.

249
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:55,292
<i>But I couldn't tell who she was.
One minute she'd say...</i>

250
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,084
I think there's nothing wrong
with being emotionally vulnerable.

251
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:00,747
<i>- And the next...
- People are such wimps.</i>

252
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,761
<i>Had she liked any of the places
we had been together?</i>

253
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,507
<i>Did she like me?
I had no idea what she wanted.</i>

254
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:11,518
Do you think two people
should live solely for one another?

255
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:15,268
- In most cases.
- Was your childhood difficult?

256
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,977
In parts.

257
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,397
Have you ever been truly, truly in love?

258
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:25,821
It felt like it,
but I think I was deceiving myself.

259
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,992
- So, what's your favourite colour?
- Orange.

260
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,202
Dessert, madam?

261
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,496
What do you think,
the chocolate or caramel?

262
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,246
I just love chocolate, don't you?

263
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,872
I can't understand people
who don't like chocolate.

264
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,050
- That one, please.
- Sir?

265
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,135
Well, it's only
a mild chocolate allergy.

266
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,014
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

267
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:54,852
You'll have to give him
something else for Easter.

268
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,562
Perfect.

269
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:04,315
<i>Did Olive like me any more
because I lied?</i>

270
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:07,155
<i>I mean, why had I been
attracted to her?</i>

271
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:10,484
<i>Exactly.</i>

272
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:14,608
<i>It had nothing to do with her interest
in chocolate or James Joyce.</i>

273
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,256
<i>When I originally told Olive...</i>

274
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:31,628
- It's all right. I'll drop you home.
- ... it wasn't loaded with significance.

275
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:34,009
- I better get off then.
- Yeah.

276
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,012
<i>But with a quarter of a mile to go
before Six Liverpool Mews,</i>

277
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:40,426
<i>it seemed monumental.</i>

278
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:44,437
<i>At some point, one of us
would have to define the situation.</i>

279
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,557
<i>- But the risks were high.
- What are you doing?</i>

280
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:51,815
<i>Everything would change.
The end of hidden signs</i>

281
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:55,274
<i>- and coded speech.
- Have you ever been truly,</i>

282
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,443
truly in love?

283
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,944
<i>But how to go about it.</i>

284
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,455
<i>Maybe I should propose
the metaphorical cup of coffee.</i>

285
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,873
<i>Orjust leap straight in.</i>

286
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:20,806
<i>In the end, the double chocolate cake
made the decision for me.</i>

287
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:46,164
It's one of the world's
most extreme rides, the Rhona-coaster.

288
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,289
Highest drops, the most loops.

289
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,795
It's supposed to represent the
two months you spent with Rhona.

290
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,836
Let me tell you, most people
feel sick when they get off.

291
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,837
Why are they in shoes?

292
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:17,818
<i>As my next girlfriend's influence
spread across my flat,</i>

293
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:21,818
<i>one thing was clear:
Rhona and I were very different.</i>

294
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,655
<i>And to begin with,
I rather liked each new exotic addition</i>

295
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:28,152
<i>she added to my life.
But at some point,</i>

296
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,541
<i>we would have to deal with the fact
that our tastes were not the same.</i>

297
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,078
I'm back!
I've got to show you something.

298
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,997
I've got to show you
what I bought today.

299
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:41,790
I could have bought the whole shop.
They have such amazing things there.

300
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,340
You should have seen
the boots they had.

301
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:47,347
I'm going to wear them every day.

302
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:51,466
Don't you just love them?

303
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:08,200
A fine leather caresses the ankle.

304
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,490
The heel gives a perfect balance

305
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,867
between functionality and style.

306
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,708
This upturned toe
has a remarkable way

307
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,282
of lengthening and flattering the leg.

308
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,789
And I'm loving these pin tucks that
lead you through to this jaunty bow,

309
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:26,001
making this a beautiful shoe.

310
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:30,339
Yeah, and you forgot to mention,
they're fucking horrible!

311
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,721
<i>How could this person,
the person I'd spent three months</i>

312
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,353
<i>feeling so in touch with,</i>

313
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:42,898
<i>be in such raptures about
the world's most unattractive shoes?</i>

314
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,981
<i>If I'm honest, other differences
between us had started to appear.</i>

315
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,987
<i>Why did Rhona insist
on walking everywhere?</i>

316
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,285
<i>Why did she always
complain in restaurants?</i>

317
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,650
Excuse me?

318
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,830
<i>Why did she never have
more than six hours sleep?</i>

319
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,291
<i>Why did she find
Patch Adams so funny?</i>

320
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,256
<i>Why did we have to have sex
at every conceivable opportunity?</i>

321
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:13,086
<i>And why-oh-why
was she so bloody clumsy?</i>

322
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,393
<i>It was like Rhona
was a wonderful symphony orchestra,</i>

323
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,853
<i>but one or two of the players
were slightly off-key.</i>

324
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,987
- Do you fancy going to a club?
- OK. Or we could go to the cinema.

325
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,580
No, you're right, let's go to a club.

326
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,293
<i>Those shoes came
to symbolise our differences</i>

327
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:54,964
<i>and the need to gently accommodate
each other's bum notes.</i>

328
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:58,843
<i>Unfortunately, that isn't what happened.</i>

329
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,683
- You don't like them?
- Frankly, I don't.

330
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:08,219
Why not?

331
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:11,066
I just don't like that kind of shoe.

332
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:14,851
- It looks like a pelican.
- It's elegant.

333
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:16,938
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

334
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:18,738
Look at the heel and the bow.

335
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:21,824
I think you're on your own
with this one, Rhona.

336
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:24,612
You don't know anything about fashion.

337
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:27,788
That may be, but I know a horrible shoe
when I see one.

338
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:31,077
It's not horrible. You're jealous
I bought a new pair of shoes.

339
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm trying to tell you how I feel.

340
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:35,536
I really don't think they're suitable
for the party tonight.

341
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:40,341
Well, that's great. 'Cause that's
why I fucking bought them.

342
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:44,425
- Well, so wear them.
- Now, I can't, can I?

343
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:47,136
- Why not?
- Because a minute ago,

344
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,764
you told me I looked like
a pelican wearing them.

345
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:53,886
<i>Why did I have to tell her?
Why couldn't I have lied?</i>

346
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:58,111
- Haven't you got any milk?
- There's some at the back.

347
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:00,353
- Hang on a second.
- A few days earlier,

348
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,937
<i>I noticed Mr. Paul, our local newsagent,</i>

349
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:06,484
<i>was wearing thick grey socks
and brown leather sandals.</i>

350
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,902
<i>They were spectacularly ugly.</i>

351
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,194
<i>But did I say...</i>

352
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:12,863
You're not gonna keep wearing
those sandals, are you, Mr. Paul?

353
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,915
- Why not?
- Because they're disgusting

354
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,078
and frankly rather offensive.

355
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:19,827
<i>Of course I didn't,
because I'm not in love with Mr. Paul.</i>

356
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,414
<i>So why did I spare his feelings
and not Rhona's?</i>

357
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:27,752
<i>I suppose we could have just politely
tolerated each other's differences.</i>

358
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,682
<i>But you see, I didn't want
to end up like my parents.</i>

359
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,642
Good night, dear.

360
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:37,729
Good night.

361
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:40,270
Why can't you keep
your opinions to yourself?

362
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,269
Because I care about you, Rhona.

363
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,398
Someone has to tell you when you've
bought a pair of disgusting shoes.

364
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,695
Anyway, why do you care
about what I think?

365
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:52,326
Because I want you to like them.
I bought them hoping you'd like them,

366
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:55,069
and now you're telling me
I look like an alien wearing them.

367
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:58,118
Why does everything I do
always have to be wrong?

368
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:01,127
Come on, don't throw that one at me.
You know that's not true.

369
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:03,502
Yes, it is.
You don't even like my shoes.

370
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:06,045
I like almost everything else.

371
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,917
So why can't you forget
about the shoes?

372
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:13,298
- Because you deserve better.
- OK.

373
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:16,011
- Maybe I deserve better than you.
- What?

374
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:19,055
<i>I'll spare you the full melodrama.</i>

375
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:22,230
<i>Suffice to say, she didn't
eventually wear them to the party</i>

376
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,941
<i>because we never went to the party.</i>

377
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,608
<i>In fact, we never went
to any parties ever again.</i>

378
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:33,192
I know what you mean, pal.
Those shoes were shocking.

379
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:36,072
- I should have lied.
- No. You tell it how it is.

380
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:37,869
Hardcore. Keep it real.

381
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,995
- Would you have lied?
- Yeah.

382
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:00,363
Excuse the mess.

383
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:03,994
The rest of the flat's
really just for show.

384
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,159
This is where I really live.

385
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,904
And meet Guppy, my first love.

386
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,619
Oh! Your shoes.

387
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:38,537
- What?
- What's wrong?

388
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:41,745
- What do you mean?
- You're not into it. What's up?

389
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,538
- I can't help thinking.
- Don't think, just get on with it.

390
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:48,835
I'm trying to, but all sorts of stuff's
spinning round my head.

391
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,304
Look, mate, take my advice.
You've just got to switch this off.

392
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:59,261
Do you think I'd be able to do this
if I thought about it? Do you?

393
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:04,477
- I know, but it's all a bit...
- A bit quick? Yeah.

394
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,437
- Yeah, a little bit too easy?
- I suppose.

395
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:10,528
And if this was so easy for you,
how many other...?

396
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,022
I don't want to think about that,
but I can't help it.

397
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,070
- Well, then you've got to stop.
- What?

398
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:19,447
Yeah, you got to stop immediately,
tell her that you respect her

399
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:21,864
far too much to continue
having sex with her.

400
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,579
- Really?
- Course not, you moppet!

401
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:26,163
Just enjoy it.

402
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:31,588
- Thanks, Guppy.
- Don't mention it.

403
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,194
<i>When did a fire alarm go off</i>

404
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,575
<i>in an inappropriate moment
in your life?</i>

405
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,035
<i>It may be in the middle
of the West End...</i>

406
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,846
You can leave some
of your stuff here.

407
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:23,220
It has been nearly six months now.

408
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:33,733
<i>To begin with, my old leather bag
had been just a quirky character trait.</i>

409
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,894
God! What have you got in there?

410
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,365
<i>But eventually it began to symbolise
my deliberate attempts</i>

411
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:44,699
<i>to keep my relationship
with Natalie unclear.</i>

412
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,989
<i>As soon as I let it go,
I knew that a few of my clothes</i>

413
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:52,292
<i>and my toothbrush would take up
permanent residence in her flat.</i>

414
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,710
<i>Every morning I would re-pack it
as though this was the last time</i>

415
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,038
<i>we would ever see each other.</i>

416
00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:02,009
It's all right.
They need washing anyway.

417
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,335
Your toothbrush doesn't.

418
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:07,513
<i>And this inevitably led on
to a discussion about...</i>

419
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,802
<i>And I had very definite
opinions about that.</i>

420
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:15,978
You just need to be
a bit patient with me, that's all.

421
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:18,188
I just need time to adjust.

422
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,606
<i>The truth was it felt like Natalie and I
were quickly melting into one person,</i>

423
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,900
<i>and frankly I found that
a little disturbing.</i>

424
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:28,198
<i>- She now freely used my...
- Perfect!</i>

425
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,195
<i>- And my...
- How dare you?</i>

426
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,162
<i>...in general conversation.</i>

427
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:36,827
<i>I acquired Natalie's need
for total darkness in the bedroom.</i>

428
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:40,164
<i>She copied my way
of folding newspapers.</i>

429
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:44,213
<i>I took to wandering round things
to think a problem through.</i>

430
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:47,384
<i>And she acquired a taste
for lying on the carpet.</i>

431
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:54,007
<i>We even developed our own secret
language based on ourjoint history.</i>

432
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:59,854
<i>A language of mutual references
that no one else would understand.</i>

433
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,606
I did a bit of a ming last night.

434
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:11,069
<i>But all these common incidents, like the
accountant on the bus that told us...</i>

435
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,614
I always keep a gun in my bag.

436
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:16,028
Look, there's that accountant!

437
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:19,539
<i>...created our own little world
that brought us closer together.</i>

438
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:25,786
<i>And soon my old leather bag
was powerless</i>

439
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:28,171
<i>to prevent us dissolving into one.</i>

440
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:32,007
Don't you think we should
walk your granddad's dog?

441
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:35,598
He's not an accountant.
He's an IT consultant from Leicester.

442
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:38,054
A Ming vase?
Emperor Ming from Flash Gordon?

443
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:40,265
- Maybe he just smells.
- His granddad's dog died

444
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,643
- over six months ago, so what is it?
- Keep trying.

445
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:45,139
The answer's got to be
out there somewhere.

446
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:48,767
- Hiya!
- Hi. Sorry we're a bit late.

447
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:52,396
Don't worry. I'm running behind myself.
You must be Duncan.

448
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:54,565
- Hi.
- I'm Gemma. Come on in.

449
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,152
Thank you.

450
00:35:56,994 --> 00:35:59,070
I would have loved
to have been an architect.

451
00:35:59,246 --> 00:36:02,449
I don't have the concentration.

452
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,747
Have you done anything
I would have seen?

453
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:07,919
Doubt it. Unless you've been to
one restaurant on Charlotte Street.

454
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:10,460
- Which one?
- Chew Chew.

455
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,917
No! I love Chew Chew!

456
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:16,086
- You didn't?
- No. Well, sort of.

457
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:19,346
- Have you been to the toilet?
- With all the glass! I love that!

458
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,507
And it has the great big shiny...

459
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:23,557
Well, that's not me either.

460
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:28,140
But the corridor
and the area around the fire escape.

461
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:29,690
Well, that's me.

462
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,727
I'm hoping they have a fire.
Then my work will really get noticed.

463
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:37,818
- I'll start one next time I'm there.
- Could you? I'd appreciate that.

464
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,983
No problem.

465
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,903
<i>All right, so I fell in love with Gemma
just a little bit that night.</i>

466
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:47,537
<i>Watching her talk,
blowing out a candle,</i>

467
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,709
<i>messing about in the kitchen,
brushing hair from her face.</i>

468
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:54,827
<i>I began to consider alternative
love-lives I could have lived.</i>

469
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:57,295
- Hiya!
- Hi. Sorry we're a bit late.

470
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,590
It's fine. I'm running behind
a bit myself.

471
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,922
<i>In city streets or busy restaurants,</i>

472
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:06,264
<i>I'm often aware of the millions
of women whose lives are doomed</i>

473
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,723
<i>to remain a mystery to me.</i>

474
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:11,896
<i>Seeing these women fills me with regret.</i>

475
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,848
It normally only takes me 20 minutes,
but it's being fixed, you see.

476
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,434
I want to be back in Colchester
by the weekend.

477
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,566
If I don't book my ticket now,
I'll have to stand on the train.

478
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,117
She's looking much better now.
She's been ill for almost a year.

479
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,243
<i>I would feel momentarily sad</i>

480
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,663
<i>that I would never get to hear
the rest of these stories.</i>

481
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,211
<i>What was it about Gemma that evoked
such confused feelings in me?</i>

482
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,041
<i>Feelings that my love for Natalie
didn't seem to resolve.</i>

483
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,051
So did you fall in love with her?

484
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,433
- What?
- I saw you with her.

485
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,759
- Who?
- Gemma.

486
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,596
Of course not.

487
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,936
- She's just your type.
- No, she's not.

488
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,516
<i>So, what was I feeling so guilty about?</i>

489
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,565
<i>Had my feelings
towards Natalie changed?</i>

490
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,487
Is something wrong?
Do you not like me today?

491
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,494
- I like you less.
- Really? Much less?

492
00:38:11,662 --> 00:38:14,747
- No, not that much.
- Out of ten?

493
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:17,489
Today? I should say six and a half.

494
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:21,666
No, six and three-quarters, perhaps.
How about you with me?

495
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,508
I'd say about minus three.

496
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:28,458
Although it might have been
a 12 and a half last night.

497
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:31,591
<i>Often I couldn't tell whether
my feelings towards Natalie</i>

498
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:35,299
<i>had anything to do with her at all.
Here, for instance.</i>

499
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:39,937
<i>Was I furious with Natalie for making a
racket while I tried to watch the news?</i>

500
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,513
<i>Or did it have more to do
with losing the contract</i>

501
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,898
<i>for Tooting Bec tube station?</i>

502
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,651
Wankers!

503
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,568
<i>Or was I still disturbed by a comment
I had overheard Natalie say at a party?</i>

504
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,664
You can't spend forever
looking for the right person.

505
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,158
- You've got to get on with your life.
- On the face of it,

506
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:06,629
<i>Natalie and I were a perfect match,
but in reality something was missing.</i>

507
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:10,048
<i>That mysterious, indefinable spark</i>

508
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:12,257
<i>just wasn't there.</i>

509
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:14,302
<i>To stabilise our feelings
for each other,</i>

510
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:17,141
<i>we would often project
a future for ourselves,</i>

511
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:21,175
<i>imagining we were a couple of oldies
with stacks of grandchildren.</i>

512
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:25,185
<i>Or find houses we both liked
and decorate them in our heads.</i>

513
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:34,154
<i>We tried to make ourselves believe
in a future together.</i>

514
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:43,156
<i>A future that deep down both of us
knew would never happen.</i>

515
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:57,793
And so in a pattern that we've
now seen repeated many times over,

516
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:02,218
another ride representing
another failed relationship

517
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:05,761
- comes to an end.
- God, what a loser.

518
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:10,187
Are you getting on?

519
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,975
Yeah, OK.

520
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,070
Which brings us
to the next stop on our tour.

521
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:25,403
An area devoted to

522
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,996
a rather difficult period
in Duncan's life.

523
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:46,765
This landscape represents Duncan's life

524
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,389
in the second half of this year.

525
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:52,134
A bleak and barren time,

526
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:55,848
devoid of any companionship
or happiness.

527
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:59,691
Six months of take-away pizzas
and video rentals.

528
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:02,904
Perhaps some of you might like

529
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:05,232
to take a quiet moment of reflection.

530
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:09,074
It's something that many of our guests
like to do at this point.

531
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,968
But let's not dwell here for too long,

532
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,591
as an area of the park devoted
to the new year

533
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:34,097
is just around the corner.

534
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,761
And who could have guessed
what that would bring?

535
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:04,542
Visitors of Duncanworld.

536
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:09,506
Today I have the great pleasure of
opening this theme park's latest ride.

537
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:21,221
Higher, faster, more exciting than
anything you have experienced before.

538
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:29,603
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

539
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,441
I give you...

540
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,824
...the Gemma.

541
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:18,864
Hey! Excuse me!

542
00:43:19,035 --> 00:43:21,194
The alarm's gone off.
Can I check your bags?

543
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:23,778
- I paid for everything in my bag.
- I'm not saying you haven't.

544
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:27,242
But I need to check your bags.
Maybe there's a tag or something.

545
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:31,287
There, you see? Socks.

546
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:34,998
- Still got the tag. Got a receipt?
- No, I didn't put those in my bag.

547
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:36,753
You saying you didn't pay for 'em?

548
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:38,920
I'm saying I didn't
put those in my bag.

549
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,931
I paid for my food, I literally
came straight from the checkout.

550
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,890
I'm not gonna have time
to steal socks, am I?

551
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:47,642
Why are you losing control? I'm
asking to see a receipt for the socks.

552
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:50,185
- You're joking, aren't you?
- Gemma!

553
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:54,359
Are you all right?

554
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:58,609
- I think so.
- I need to see your receipt.

555
00:43:58,781 --> 00:44:02,364
Come on. You don't seriously think
she stole those, do you?

556
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:05,405
- So sorry. I don't mean to be rude.
- No, it's only your job.

557
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,659
- Your party about six months ago.
- Hey.

558
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:13,285
First of all, what would she want
with a pair of men's socks?

559
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:15,501
I don't know, sir.
Maybe her boyfriend?

560
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:18,543
How do you know that? Gemma,
do you need a pair of men's socks?

561
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:20,674
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

562
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:24,129
No. So we're all just wasting our time.

563
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:30,558
- So how are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

564
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:35,515
- Where's your car?
- Just down here.

565
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,314
- Are you still designing fire exits?
- Wow. You remember.

566
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:43,813
Yeah, I'm your biggest fan.

567
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:46,446
Your emergency corridor
is one of my favourites.

568
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,907
Really? They let me do
a bit more now, you know.

569
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,700
- I'm designing a health centre.
- Oh, shame.

570
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:53,700
I really thought
you'd found your medium.

571
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,749
Do you think? Thanks very much.

572
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:03,372
- Isn't all this a bit premature?
- I'm sorry?

573
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:06,670
- She might not be very interested.
- Does she really fancy you?

574
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:08,126
Mere details, friends.

575
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,878
Yeah, what's to say that you won't make

576
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:13,383
exactly the same mistakes as before?

577
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,351
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

578
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,272
But this time
things are gonna be different.

579
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,183
I'm going into it
with a whole new attitude.

580
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,275
- I'm not going to let this one go.
- Right, OK.

581
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:26,114
I'm gonna pay attention
to every tiny detail.

582
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,278
I'll anticipate the problems. I'm gonna
make use of all of this experience.

583
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:36,913
Do you think? I just found people
were too unappreciative

584
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:39,538
during an emergency evacuation.
They don't take the time

585
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,838
- to appreciate the craftsmanship.
- That's what I've always felt.

586
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:49,503
- Please don't tell me this is it.
- Hey, do not be rude about my car.

587
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:52,844
- I love my little car.
- No, it's lovely.

588
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:56,015
It's just not much of a getaway vehicle.

589
00:45:56,184 --> 00:45:57,844
If you're gonna plan
daring sock robberies,

590
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:01,103
you really ought to think
the whole thing through.

591
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,560
- Where were you headed?
- I was shopping.

592
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:05,939
- Where?
- In the supermarket.

593
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:08,811
Where's your shopping?

594
00:46:11,156 --> 00:46:13,149
They didn't have what I wanted.

595
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:15,034
Which was?

596
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,704
An avocado.
I really needed an avocado.

597
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:26,245
What, like this one?

598
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:31,794
You put those socks in my bag,
didn't you?

599
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:37,345
Is that important? Really?

600
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:41,847
Surely, the most important thing
is that you go out with me.

601
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:45,434
Blimey, you're forward.

602
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:48,440
Not really, I'm just desperate.

603
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:53,815
<i>And this time it was different.</i>

604
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,693
<i>T- minus ten, nine, eight,</i>

605
00:46:56,866 --> 00:47:00,531
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

606
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:02,742
<i>four, three,</i>

607
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:05,119
<i>two, one.</i>

608
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,749
<i>We have lift-off.</i>

609
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:13,707
<i>This was someone I could imagine
spending the rest of my life with.</i>

610
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:19,127
<i>We seemed able to accommodate
each other's differences.</i>

611
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,681
<i>And there wasn't some old relationship
waiting in the wings,</i>

612
00:47:30,856 --> 00:47:32,730
<i>ready to be re-started.</i>

613
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:43,823
I was walking past Jigsaw today.

614
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,911
There's this really nice jumper
in the window.

615
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,449
- Great.
- It's lovely.

616
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:54,539
- Why are you telling me?
- Shut up.

617
00:47:54,712 --> 00:47:57,037
I was walking past Bang & Olufsen
the other day.

618
00:47:57,214 --> 00:48:00,500
- But it's not your birthday, is it?
- Why, whose is it?

619
00:48:00,676 --> 00:48:03,511
You are such an idiot.

620
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,016
<i>I picked up the jumper
on my way back from work.</i>

621
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:20,145
<i>But as I was filling out
the accompanying card, I realised</i>

622
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,020
<i>that this was my first non-intimidating
chance to legitimately tell Gemma</i>

623
00:48:24,198 --> 00:48:28,065
<i>that I loved her. I had wanted
to tell her plenty of times.</i>

624
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,364
I love you.

625
00:48:36,168 --> 00:48:38,706
<i>You see,
Gemma was suspicious of words.</i>

626
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:41,749
People can talk problems into existence.

627
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:45,422
Problems that aren't even there
in the first place.

628
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:52,339
<i>When I was 12 years old,</i>

629
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:56,596
<i>I fell madly in love with this boy
on a holiday camp,</i>

630
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,680
<i>called Giles.</i>

631
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:10,654
<i>We ended up walking
around this lake together.</i>

632
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:13,495
Do you want to sit down?

633
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:22,119
<i>It was like the first time</i>

634
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:25,295
<i>that I'd held a boy's hand.</i>

635
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:28,299
<i>I got really emotional,</i>

636
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:32,928
<i>and for some reason,
I decided to tell him that.</i>

637
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:36,050
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

638
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,348
<i>Which turned out to be a big mistake.</i>

639
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:50,314
Gemma loves Giles! Gemma loves Giles!

640
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,905
<i>I don't trust words.</i>

641
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,456
<i>They always spoil things.</i>

642
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:56,919
<i>Maybe a pullover
was enough of a sign of love.</i>

643
00:50:57,092 --> 00:50:59,583
<i>A message in knitwear code.</i>

644
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:05,430
<i>But even if I told her,
would she actually know what I meant?</i>

645
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,850
<i>Come to think of it,
does anyone know what love means?</i>

646
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,178
<i>If I told Gemma
that I had a stomach ache,</i>

647
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:12,731
<i>a red car</i>

648
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,975
<i>or a bunch of daffodils,</i>

649
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:17,476
<i>then I know she would understand.</i>

650
00:51:17,653 --> 00:51:18,685
<i>More or less.</i>

651
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:21,484
<i>Naturally, our perceptions
might differ slightly.</i>

652
00:51:21,657 --> 00:51:26,366
<i>But love is so ambiguous that it could
mean completely different things to us.</i>

653
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:28,778
Some people would
never have fallen in love

654
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:30,580
if they had not heard of love.

655
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:31,994
He could be right.

656
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,954
Who's to say there's any such thing
as love in the first place.

657
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:38,497
<i>For instance, the Manu tribe of New
Guinea don't even have a word for it.</i>

658
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:41,674
<i>And the Chinese traditionally
have scant regard</i>

659
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:43,503
<i>for romantic love in their culture.</i>

660
00:51:43,678 --> 00:51:47,426
<i>Nevertheless, the manager
of our local Chinese restaurant</i>

661
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:49,389
<i>was delighted to take our booking.</i>

662
00:51:49,558 --> 00:51:52,228
<i>Maybe the feeling in my stomach
wasn't love at all,</i>

663
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:54,102
<i>but a viral infection.</i>

664
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:55,896
<i>Or food poisoning.</i>

665
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:58,306
<i>Or a coronary attack.</i>

666
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,984
<i>S.M. Greenfield, in an article
in Sociological Quarterly,</i>

667
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:08,110
<i>writes that love is kept alive
by modern capitalism</i>

668
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:09,316
<i>only in order to...</i>

669
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:14,701
Motivate individuals where there is
no other means of motivating them,

670
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:17,365
to occupy the positions

671
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:19,868
husband-wife and wife-mother

672
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:23,461
and form nuclear families
that are essential

673
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:27,131
not only for reproduction
and socialisation

674
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:30,837
but also to maintain
the existing arrangement

675
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,300
for distributing consumer goods
and services,

676
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:37,393
and in general,
to keep the social system

677
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:39,436
in proper working order,

678
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:43,817
and thus maintaining it
as a going concern.

679
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:49,231
<i>In the end, I decided that a card
featuring cats and dogs</i>

680
00:52:49,406 --> 00:52:52,989
<i>on a bicycle wasn't the best place
to first declare my love.</i>

681
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,236
<i>I would do it properly.</i>

682
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:57,321
<i>I would tell her myself.</i>

683
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:01,877
Oh, God, I feel so much better.

684
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:05,996
I must have been starving.
I've been so depressed all day.

685
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:07,370
Why?

686
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:10,122
Because I have this thing
about birthdays.

687
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:14,002
They always remind me of death
and forced jollity.

688
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:18,470
- Know where I was this time last year?
- No, where?

689
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:22,094
Being taken out to dinner
by my horrible aunt.

690
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,765
It was, like, awful.

691
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:27,557
I kept having
to go to the bathroom to cry.

692
00:53:27,734 --> 00:53:30,605
I was so upset that it was my birthday

693
00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:33,530
and the only one who'd invited me out
was my aunt,

694
00:53:33,698 --> 00:53:36,569
who couldn't stop telling me she didn't
understand how a nice girl like me

695
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:38,866
didn't have a man in her life.

696
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:43,241
It's probably not a bad thing
that I ran into you.

697
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:49,210
<i>There was my chance.
But itjust seemed too obvious.</i>

698
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,253
<i>- Too corny to say...
- I love you.</i>

699
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:54,673
<i>The words had lost their power,
worn out by a million soap operas.</i>

700
00:53:54,843 --> 00:53:56,966
- I love you.
- I love you.

701
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:58,631
I love you.

702
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:01,130
<i>But I was determined to say something,</i>

703
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:04,344
<i>so I cowardly turned
to alcohol for help.</i>

704
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:06,393
<i>Until, at quarter to 12,</i>

705
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:10,512
<i>I found myself staring at a
complimentary miniature marshmallow.</i>

706
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,814
<i>And for some reason it seemed to
perfectly sum up</i>

707
00:54:12,985 --> 00:54:14,859
<i>how I felt about Gemma.</i>

708
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:17,602
I've something
very important to tell you.

709
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:19,608
OK.

710
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:22,357
It's very important.

711
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:25,495
Yes?

712
00:54:26,748 --> 00:54:28,657
Are you ready?

713
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:31,412
Yeah.

714
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:35,871
I marshmallow you.

715
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:43,424
That's the sweetest thing anyone
has ever said to me.

716
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:46,053
<i>I think she understood.</i>

717
00:54:46,225 --> 00:54:49,012
<i>By the way,
she was delighted with the jumper.</i>

718
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:54,265
<i>But I should have got the purple one.</i>

719
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:14,871
<i>The thing about declaring
your love for someone</i>

720
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:17,332
<i>is from that point on,
everything changes.</i>

721
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:23,049
<i>For me, everything
seemed so much clearer.</i>

722
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:25,803
<i>For Gemma...</i>

723
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,271
Isn't it wonderful?

724
00:55:39,442 --> 00:55:41,730
- Isn't it?
- But is it?

725
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:44,109
Shush, don't spoil it.

726
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,403
No, you're right, it is wonderful.

727
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,566
I couldn't have imagined
a place like this existing.

728
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:53,451
It seems cut off from everything, like
a paradise no one's bothered to ruin.

729
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:56,077
I could spend the rest of my life here.

730
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:58,158
So could I.

731
00:55:58,335 --> 00:56:00,623
We could live here together.

732
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:03,879
I'd tend to the goats,
you'd handle the olives,

733
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:07,215
we'd write books, paint and...

734
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,966
Are you all right?

735
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,297
Yeah.

736
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:15,716
I am now.
I don't know what happened.

737
00:56:15,893 --> 00:56:18,929
I just got this terrible pain
in my head,

738
00:56:19,104 --> 00:56:22,769
it was like an awful throbbing
or something.

739
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:28,235
It's probably nothing.

740
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:35,489
- No! Shit!
- Let me feel.

741
00:56:35,661 --> 00:56:38,579
No, Duncan! You're not gonna
feel anything. It's inside.

742
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:41,867
- I know, but I'll empathise.
- God.

743
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:44,331
I better go inside and lie down.

744
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:48,203
It's probably just the height
or the travelling or something.

745
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:51,585
I'll go inside.
You stay out here. I'll be fine.

746
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:55,879
<i>In actual fact,
Gemma had a habit of doing this.</i>

747
00:56:58,141 --> 00:57:01,261
<i>She seemed incapable
of enjoying pleasurable experiences</i>

748
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:02,634
<i>as they happened.</i>

749
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,059
<i>A couple of weeks ago,</i>

750
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:08,398
<i>we'd spent the afternoon
on my work partner Will's house boat.</i>

751
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:11,901
<i>Our friends were there, the food was
delicious, Gemma looked beautiful.</i>

752
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:15,107
<i>But for some reason,
she had to find fault.</i>

753
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:19,944
- Are you cold?
- No, no, I'm all right.

754
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,745
Have you seen my shoes?

755
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:25,908
Yes!

756
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,461
<i>We'd both been looking forward
to the meal for weeks.</i>

757
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,758
<i>- On the way home, she'd told me...
- That was lovely.</i>

758
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:37,595
<i>But at the time,
she just couldn't accept it.</i>

759
00:57:37,762 --> 00:57:42,340
<i>It was like she could only enjoy things
in anticipation or as memories.</i>

760
00:57:56,988 --> 00:57:59,064
I don't know what it is, Will.

761
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,406
I just can't quite
put my finger on it.

762
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:05,613
Don't worry.
It's bound to go through phases.

763
00:58:05,788 --> 00:58:08,196
I just feel like something is wrong.
I don't know what,

764
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:10,662
but since we came back from Spain,
I've been noticing things.

765
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:13,408
I don't just mean in the bedroom.
I mean everywhere.

766
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:15,710
Like?

767
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:20,377
Nothing I can put my finger on directly.
All right, here's one thing.

768
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:22,675
<i>She likes a different cereal from me.</i>

769
00:58:22,846 --> 00:58:25,088
<i>But because I spend
a lot of time at her place,</i>

770
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:30,010
<i>she usually buys the cereal I like
so we can eat breakfast together.</i>

771
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:33,637
<i>Then all of a sudden last week
she stops buying it and says...</i>

772
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,309
It's far too expensive.

773
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:37,771
I don't want to come to any
conclusions, I'm just noticing.

774
00:58:37,943 --> 00:58:39,651
- Hey!
- So which parts of these designs

775
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,856
- are yours then, Will?
- Well, really it's a collaboration.

776
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:46,780
Don't be so modest.
I know you did all the interior design.

777
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:49,906
I love the way
you've used brick and metal.

778
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,322
Why can't you do more stuff like that?

779
00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:55,998
Well, my work is more structural.
It's not quite so obvious.

780
00:58:57,253 --> 00:59:00,622
Well I think Will's work is great.
Incredible, in fact.

781
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,716
- I'm so glad I've seen it.
- It's great to hear you say so.

782
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:05,842
No, I am so impressed.

783
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:09,380
Your work is exactly
the kind of thing I'm interested in.

784
00:59:09,557 --> 00:59:13,636
It's such a pity that more architects
aren't trying to do what you're doing.

785
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:16,811
- I imagine it can't be easy.
- It's not that easy.

786
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,645
But I've always been taught
to go with the things I believe in.

787
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:23,818
I work on projects that emit
a sort of energy from them.

788
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:26,904
Yeah, I think I see what you mean.

789
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:29,694
I was working on a project
in Monterey, and I mean,

790
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,904
there you can really get a sense of what
you can achieve by using different sorts

791
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:35,700
of stone as well as some steel
and aluminium,

792
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,364
about working with the landscape
instead of against it.

793
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,460
- Don't you think we better be...?
- What?

794
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:43,455
It seems to be winding down.

795
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:50,083
- Maybe we should go for a drink.
- Its a bit late, isn't it?

796
00:59:50,262 --> 00:59:51,969
- Come on.
- Will anywhere be open?

797
00:59:52,138 --> 00:59:54,760
Will, do you fancy a drink?
You can't say no.

798
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:56,640
OK.

799
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:59,927
That's it then.
We're gonna go for a drink.

800
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:02,346
I'm pretty tired, to be honest.

801
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:04,979
OK. Well, I'll see you tomorrow then.

802
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:08,317
I know this amazing bar in the West End.
Have you been to the Monkey Bar?

803
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:11,322
- I've heard of it.
- Oh, my gosh. You'll love it.

804
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,696
It has these huge screens
on either side.

805
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:18,196
- So... will I see you later then?
- Yes.

806
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:21,372
Don't worry, I'll call you
as soon as I get home, OK?

807
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:24,495
Anyway, as I was saying...

808
01:00:24,669 --> 01:00:27,623
<i>Of course, I had no problem
with Gemma and Will going off</i>

809
01:00:27,797 --> 01:00:30,502
<i>for a drink without me.</i>

810
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,833
<i>No problem at all.</i>

811
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,382
<i>I was absolutely fine with it.</i>

812
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:41,094
<i>Hi, it's me. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

813
01:00:41,268 --> 01:00:42,976
<i>Completely OK.</i>

814
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:50,015
<i>Over the moon, in fact.</i>

815
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:59,315
<i>Hi, it's me. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

816
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,371
<i>I was just glad that my best friend
and my girlfriend</i>

817
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:10,916
<i>were getting on so well.</i>

818
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:22,258
<i>Really, really well.</i>

819
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:29,723
<i>Hi, it's me. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

820
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:34,769
People can talk problems
into existence.

821
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:37,565
Problems that aren't
even there in the first place.

822
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:40,110
You can drop me anywhere
round here, thanks.

823
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:43,864
- Will this do?
- Great, yeah.

824
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,945
Well, thanks. That was lovely.

825
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:47,663
It was, wasn't it?

826
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:51,911
I should get going, Will.
Duncan is gonna be worried sick.

827
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:54,658
Sure. OK. I'll see you around.

828
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,541
Bye.

829
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:18,275
<i>Hi, it's me. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

830
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,543
Hiya.

831
01:02:44,801 --> 01:02:46,959
<i>Gemma's alibi went like this:</i>

832
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:50,552
<i>She'd gone to that bar in Soho
and stayed there chatting till late.</i>

833
01:02:50,723 --> 01:02:53,345
<i>By which time,
she'd had quite a bit to drink.</i>

834
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:56,388
<i>So she decided that it would be easier
to stop off in Bloomsbury</i>

835
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:58,804
<i>than travel all the way back
to Islington.</i>

836
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:01,187
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry.

837
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:02,639
It's OK.

838
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:05,487
<i>She stayed the night
at her girlfriend Paula's house.</i>

839
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:08,145
<i>She had wanted to call me,
but didn't want to wake me up.</i>

840
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:10,363
<i>After all, had I not said...</i>

841
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:12,277
I'm pretty tired, to be honest.

842
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:14,492
<i>All perfectly feasible.</i>

843
01:03:15,747 --> 01:03:17,122
<i>But then she blew it.</i>

844
01:03:21,294 --> 01:03:23,417
Why are you making that face?

845
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:28,208
It's the one you like, isn't it?

846
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:33,590
<i>Why had Gemma gone to all the trouble
of getting me my favourite cereal?</i>

847
01:03:33,764 --> 01:03:35,673
<i>What was she feeling so guilty about?</i>

848
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:38,470
<i>After all, I thought
Three Cereal Oat Bran was...</i>

849
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:40,102
It's far too expensive.

850
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,843
<i>Surely, this proved she was covering up.</i>

851
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:46,723
- The polygraph's clean.
- But she's Iying.

852
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:49,439
- She'll walk.
- What about the cereal?

853
01:03:49,612 --> 01:03:51,605
- Circumstantial, my friend.
- It'll never stick.

854
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:54,106
I just know it, though.
Did you speak to Paula?

855
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:57,237
The whole thing's airtight.
She was there all night.

856
01:03:57,411 --> 01:03:59,487
You must be able to do something.

857
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:02,415
Sounds to me like you want her
to cheat on you?

858
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:04,990
- Of course not.
- Then why look for problems?

859
01:04:05,169 --> 01:04:07,410
- Maybe you're looking for a way out.
- What?

860
01:04:07,587 --> 01:04:10,422
Perhaps you don't love her any more,
you don't want to tell her.

861
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,788
- That right, Duncan?
- Hang on a minute.

862
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:14,043
- Are you not man enough to tell her?
- No...

863
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:15,796
- I thought not.
- I do love her.

864
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,010
I'm not trying to break it up.
I want it to work.

865
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:21,881
Then what's the problem? The lady
clearly feels bad about not ringing you.

866
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,602
She's trying to make things up.
What do you do?

867
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:26,556
- You make her feel worse.
- She doesn't deserve this.

868
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,103
- What kind of animal are you?
- OK! So I'm wrong!

869
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:31,397
- I made a mistake!
- Damn right.

870
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:34,904
So, what should I do?

871
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:39,905
You need us to tell you?

872
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,415
Don't, not now.

873
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:55,540
I said once already, not now!

874
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:06,767
<i>Right then, I knew it.</i>

875
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:10,766
<i>If I didn't act quickly, I'd lose her.</i>

876
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,523
Look what I got today.

877
01:05:23,617 --> 01:05:26,702
<i>I had planned the perfect weekend.</i>

878
01:05:26,871 --> 01:05:30,156
<i>A first-class trip to Paris.</i>

879
01:05:30,332 --> 01:05:34,080
<i>Our own chauffeur on standby
for three days.</i>

880
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:37,538
<i>An executive suite
in a five-star hotel</i>

881
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:41,664
<i>with all the comforts and amenities
you could possibly imagine.</i>

882
01:05:41,843 --> 01:05:45,591
<i>It even had a balcony
with stunning views across the city.</i>

883
01:05:45,763 --> 01:05:48,135
<i>I pulled every string I could
to get a window seat</i>

884
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:50,845
<i>at a three-star Michelin restaurant.</i>

885
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:55,016
<i>I somehow managed to get
two tickets to her favourite opera.</i>

886
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:58,024
<i>I even booked a twilight trip
down the Seine</i>

887
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:01,857
<i>with music, champagne, the works.</i>

888
01:06:02,988 --> 01:06:04,779
<i>And do you know what?</i>

889
01:06:04,948 --> 01:06:09,028
<i>From the minute we arrived, I knew
it was going to be a fucking disaster.</i>

890
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:15,450
Have you got the key?

891
01:06:17,293 --> 01:06:19,286
No, you said you had it.

892
01:06:19,462 --> 01:06:23,210
No, I didn't. I don't have the key.
You've just locked us out.

893
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:26,833
I haven't locked us out. I just shut
the door thinking you had the key,

894
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:28,754
because the key wasn't where I left it.

895
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:31,301
That was really silly of you
because I don't have it either.

896
01:06:31,473 --> 01:06:34,178
- So we're locked out, thanks to you.
- Thanks to me.

897
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:37,850
For God's sake, stop blaming me for the
fact that it was you who forgot the key.

898
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:41,224
I had nothing to do with the key.

899
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,277
I'm sorry. I did have it all along.

900
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,159
That's it.

901
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,459
Duncan.

902
01:07:02,627 --> 01:07:06,292
Duncan! Don't be so silly.
Where are you going?

903
01:07:06,464 --> 01:07:09,038
Duncan. Duncan!

904
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:12,218
<i>Childish, I know,
but I felt I deserved a sulk.</i>

905
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:16,336
<i>I'd put up with so many of Gemma's.
Wasn't it my turn?</i>

906
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:19,552
<i>Successful sulking, a guide.</i>

907
01:07:19,727 --> 01:07:23,392
<i>One, the sulk must be sparked
by some wrong-doing,</i>

908
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:25,272
<i>the more trivial the better.</i>

909
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:28,682
<i>Two, the punishment
inflicted by the sulk</i>

910
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:30,687
<i>must be disproportionately large</i>

911
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:32,736
<i>in relation to the original offence.</i>

912
01:07:32,906 --> 01:07:35,942
<i>Three, beware of
making sulks too short</i>

913
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:40,032
<i>and therefore not allowing sufficient
guilt to build up in the sulked.</i>

914
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,781
<i>Four, the sulk should never be about
the incident that sparked it.</i>

915
01:07:44,959 --> 01:07:46,122
<i>For example, for...</i>

916
01:07:46,294 --> 01:07:48,785
I am angry at you for accusing me
of losing the key.

917
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:49,994
<i>...read...</i>

918
01:07:50,172 --> 01:07:52,580
I am angry at you
for not loving me any more.

919
01:07:52,758 --> 01:07:56,708
<i>Five, the sulk should be
gauged a success if and only if</i>

920
01:07:56,887 --> 01:08:00,801
<i>the sulker has to be talked out
of the sulk by the sulked.</i>

921
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:22,158
So? Are you gonna
forgive me or what?

922
01:08:23,954 --> 01:08:28,248
Come on. You know I hate
leaving arguments unresolved.

923
01:08:29,793 --> 01:08:33,921
Anyway, we're on holiday. We're
supposed to be enjoying ourselves.

924
01:08:40,803 --> 01:08:42,511
OK.

925
01:08:45,391 --> 01:08:48,926
<i>We were on our best behaviour
that night, trying to avoid tensions.</i>

926
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:52,020
<i>In fact, if you had watched the scene
from the maître d's point of view,</i>

927
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:54,680
<i>we would have seemed like
the classic romantic couple.</i>

928
01:08:54,858 --> 01:08:57,230
<i>Little would you know, however,
that our relationship had just</i>

929
01:08:57,402 --> 01:08:59,478
<i>entered a dark new phase,</i>

930
01:08:59,654 --> 01:09:03,154
<i>a phase called romantic terrorism.</i>

931
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:06,325
<i>You see, my sulk had been
little more than an attempt</i>

932
01:09:06,494 --> 01:09:08,202
<i>to force Gemma to love me.</i>

933
01:09:08,371 --> 01:09:10,364
<i>Dialogue had failed.</i>

934
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:16,494
Is something wrong?

935
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,541
No. Should there be?

936
01:09:19,715 --> 01:09:22,835
I just thought you might
want to talk about things.

937
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:26,544
- About what things?
- About us.

938
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:30,636
- You mean about you.
- No, I mean about us.

939
01:09:31,893 --> 01:09:35,476
<i>I had to break the deadlock
in our romantic negotiations.</i>

940
01:09:35,647 --> 01:09:38,351
<i>So on the way back to the airport,
I flirted with a woman</i>

941
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:43,186
<i>we met at the hotel. It was just
an attempt to make Gemma jealous.</i>

942
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:46,280
<i>But she called my bluff
by acting unconcerned.</i>

943
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:50,398
There will be no negotiation
with terrorists of any kind.

944
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:54,824
<i>She wouldn't allow me
the pleasure of a jealous reaction.</i>

945
01:10:17,353 --> 01:10:20,270
<i>I may have scored a minor victory
with my afternoon sulk,</i>

946
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:21,637
<i>but it was a hollow victory</i>

947
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:24,816
<i>because the romantic terrorist
is doomed to be disappointed.</i>

948
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:26,977
You must love me.

949
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:31,103
I will force you to love me by sulking
you and making you feel jealous.

950
01:10:31,283 --> 01:10:34,402
But if you force me,
it will never be spontaneous love

951
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:37,068
and therefore never genuine love.

952
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:39,746
OK, let her go.

953
01:11:00,226 --> 01:11:01,637
Are you all right?

954
01:11:04,105 --> 01:11:05,765
You're too good for me.

955
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,027
What?

956
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:15,361
I said you're too good for me.

957
01:11:18,077 --> 01:11:19,701
What?

958
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:22,955
Why?

959
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:26,665
Because you are.

960
01:11:29,879 --> 01:11:32,168
What are you saying this for, Gemma?

961
01:11:35,468 --> 01:11:37,046
I don't know.

962
01:11:39,138 --> 01:11:41,807
If anything,
I'd say it was the other way round.

963
01:11:41,974 --> 01:11:45,308
You're always the one to make
an effort when there's a problem.

964
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:49,309
- You're just more self-deprecating...
- Please stop.

965
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:52,731
- Why?
- Because I've been seeing Will.

966
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:04,572
You've what?

967
01:12:06,247 --> 01:12:09,532
I've been seeing Will, OK?

968
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,499
What does seeing mean?
Seeing Will?

969
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,793
For God's sake!
I've been to bed with Will!

970
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,252
Would madam like a beverage
or a light snack?

971
01:12:17,424 --> 01:12:19,084
- No, thank you.
- Nothing at all?

972
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:21,051
- I'm all right.
- How about for sir?

973
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:23,046
No, thank you.

974
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:26,595
I can't believe this.

975
01:12:27,934 --> 01:12:29,761
Tell me it's a joke.

976
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:33,139
A terrible, horrible joke.
You've been to bed with Will?

977
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:34,595
When?

978
01:12:34,774 --> 01:12:36,565
How could you?

979
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:39,059
I'm sorry. I really am.

980
01:12:39,236 --> 01:12:41,276
I'm just...

981
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:43,356
I'm sorry.

982
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:56,208
Gemma, please don't cry.

983
01:12:57,754 --> 01:13:00,043
We can talk about this.

984
01:13:03,468 --> 01:13:05,674
Here, take this handkerchief.

985
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:10,006
It'll be OK. It will, I promise.

986
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:13,633
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I've just
turned on the seat belt signs</i>

987
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:16,515
<i>as we will be landing shortly.</i>

988
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:20,556
<i>Let me take this opportunity to thank
you for flying with British Airways.</i>

989
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:23,607
<i>We hope you've had
a very pleasant flight</i>

990
01:13:23,778 --> 01:13:27,823
<i>and will choose to fly with us again
very soon.</i>

991
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:21,382
I'm sorry for offering you
my confusion.

992
01:15:21,556 --> 01:15:23,928
I'm sorry for ruining our trip to Paris.

993
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,673
I am sorry for the melodrama of it all.

994
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:29,686
You were so sweet to me.

995
01:15:29,856 --> 01:15:31,813
That's what made me cry all the more.

996
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:34,355
Other men would have told me
to go to hell, but you didn't.

997
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,148
And that's what made it
so very difficult.

998
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:40,820
There is still
so much holding me to you.

999
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:44,277
But I realise I cannot continue
to deny you the love you deserve.

1000
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,240
It would be unfair.
It would destroy us both.

1001
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:49,038
I will miss you.

1002
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:51,366
Nothing can take away
what we have shared.

1003
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:53,831
I simply don't wish
to continue hurting you.

1004
01:15:54,003 --> 01:15:56,541
And I couldn't bear for it
to slowly go stale.

1005
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:58,339
I don't know where I will go from here.

1006
01:15:58,508 --> 01:16:03,004
I'll probably spend time on my own
over Christmas, or go to my parents.

1007
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:05,171
Don't blame Will, don't be unfair.

1008
01:16:05,347 --> 01:16:08,432
He was only a symptom,
not the cause of what happened.

1009
01:16:08,601 --> 01:16:10,392
Excuse this messy letter.

1010
01:16:10,561 --> 01:16:14,772
Its confusion will probably be
a reminder of the way I was with you.

1011
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,309
Forgive me, you were too good
for me. I hope we can stay friends.

1012
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:20,561
All my love, Gemma.

1013
01:16:39,755 --> 01:16:42,162
<i>It seemed to be
the most sensible thing to do.</i>

1014
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:45,166
<i>- Of course, people will say...
- You'll get over it.</i>

1015
01:16:45,343 --> 01:16:48,178
Pick yourself up. Dust yourself off.
Get yourself back out there.

1016
01:16:48,346 --> 01:16:50,635
- People drift apart.
- You're young.

1017
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:54,639
You'll find somebody really,
really lovely who will adore you.

1018
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:57,977
It's like a bus. One is going,
the other one is coming.

1019
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:02,014
<i>But this was important. This wasn't
something you just shrug off.</i>

1020
01:17:02,193 --> 01:17:04,600
<i>My suicide would show
the world once and for all</i>

1021
01:17:04,778 --> 01:17:08,858
<i>that love is a deadly serious matter!
I would become a martyr.</i>

1022
01:17:09,032 --> 01:17:11,440
<i>A martyr to love.</i>

1023
01:17:11,618 --> 01:17:14,323
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes!

1024
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:18,707
Oh, God, yes!

1025
01:17:32,513 --> 01:17:34,885
<i>All right, so it didn't end like that.</i>

1026
01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:41,476
<i>I had actually only taken
20 effervescent vitamin C tablets.</i>

1027
01:17:41,647 --> 01:17:42,678
<i>Which was lucky</i>

1028
01:17:42,856 --> 01:17:46,936
<i>because it suddenly dawned on me
how unsatisfying suicide is.</i>

1029
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,825
<i>All I'd wanted to do was make a point.</i>

1030
01:18:00,998 --> 01:18:03,915
<i>But why make such a scene if you're
not around to witness the result?</i>

1031
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:07,418
<i>If you don't get to see the reactions
of those you're trying to affect.</i>

1032
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:11,003
<i>Commit suicide and you're too dead
to get pleasure from it.</i>

1033
01:18:16,346 --> 01:18:20,094
And the award goes jointly
to Duncan Anderson and Will Knott

1034
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:22,425
for the Hackney Health Centre.

1035
01:18:36,573 --> 01:18:40,523
My work partner, Will,

1036
01:18:40,702 --> 01:18:43,027
can't be here this evening

1037
01:18:43,205 --> 01:18:45,874
because he ran off with my girlfriend.

1038
01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:51,703
No, he really did.

1039
01:18:58,219 --> 01:18:59,677
Thank you!

1040
01:18:59,845 --> 01:19:02,253
<i>For months,
I saw her wherever I went.</i>

1041
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:05,432
<i>Anything could trigger it.
Tomato paste.</i>

1042
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:07,807
<i>A pile of cushions.</i>

1043
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,851
<i>Rain on Hammersmith Bridge.</i>

1044
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:15,058
<i>Some days I would convince myself
that Gemma and I were still together.</i>

1045
01:19:15,235 --> 01:19:19,067
<i>That any moment I could pick up
that phone and she'd be there.</i>

1046
01:19:20,573 --> 01:19:23,942
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, it's me. You wanna meet up?</i>

1047
01:19:25,786 --> 01:19:28,075
<i>I would make myself forget
that she had now settled</i>

1048
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:30,655
<i>with another man in Battersea.</i>

1049
01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:46,597
<i>But then I'd find her hairbrush
down the back of the sofa,</i>

1050
01:19:46,765 --> 01:19:49,386
<i>and the horrible reality
would hit me again.</i>

1051
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:57,940
<i>Then one day I drove past that
supermarket, and you know what?</i>

1052
01:19:58,109 --> 01:20:01,477
<i>It was a good minute and a half
before I remembered the link.</i>

1053
01:20:01,654 --> 01:20:03,942
<i>Gemma was beginning to fade.</i>

1054
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:08,689
<i>I became able to think of this area
as not just the Gemma District</i>

1055
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,324
<i>but as Islington again.</i>

1056
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:18,502
<i>I threw myself into work.</i>

1057
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:20,461
Obviously, this is...

1058
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,381
<i>How refreshing to think
about just me for once,</i>

1059
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:24,794
<i>about what I wanted.</i>

1060
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:27,209
This is the future of urban living.

1061
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:31,715
<i>No longer did I have to worry about
whether she would like this film.</i>

1062
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:36,218
<i>Or what time she had to be
wherever in the morning.</i>

1063
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,399
<i>In fact, who needed
this love thing anyway?</i>

1064
01:20:41,566 --> 01:20:44,022
<i>Hadn't it just brought me
heartache and anguish?</i>

1065
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:48,061
<i>After all, I'm not the first one
to try and make sense of love.</i>

1066
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:51,397
<i>There's been centuries of analysts,</i>

1067
01:20:51,576 --> 01:20:53,200
<i>preachers,</i>

1068
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:54,614
<i>gurus</i>

1069
01:20:54,787 --> 01:20:56,198
<i>and writers who've tried.</i>

1070
01:20:56,372 --> 01:20:57,866
<i>And did they find a solution?</i>

1071
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,872
<i>An answer to the misery
of most people's emotional lives?</i>

1072
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:07,499
<i>So one day I decided.</i>

1073
01:21:07,674 --> 01:21:09,999
<i>I wasn't going
to play this game any more.</i>

1074
01:21:10,176 --> 01:21:14,091
<i>I didn't understand the rules
and the injuries were just too painful.</i>

1075
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,621
<i>Hi.</i>

1076
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,627
<i>And then I met Angela.</i>
