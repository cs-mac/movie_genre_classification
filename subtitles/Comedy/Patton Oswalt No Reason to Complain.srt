00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
The trouble was no air cover.

159
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,900
-General Smith on the line, sir.
-Excuse me, Brad.

160
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Bedell?

161
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,600
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here.

162
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,800
I need a good number-two man, I want
to make Brad my deputy commander.

163
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,900
You clear it with Ike?

164
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
All right, thanks, Bedell.

165
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,400
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower
anymore, you're working for me.

166
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,100
-Okay?
-Fine, okay.

167
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,800
Dick. You got those stars?

168
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
-Yes, sir.
-Let's get them on.

169
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,100
What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.

170
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,900
I know, but it doesn't become official
until it's approved by the Senate.

171
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,900
Well. . .

172
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,100
. . .they have their schedule
and I have mine.

173
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,600
George. . .

174
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,000
. . .if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy. . .

175
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,500
. . .I believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks. . .

176
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,800
. . .and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.

177
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,800
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.

178
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,500
You know. . . .

179
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,000
I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.

180
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,900
Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

181
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,200
It was green leather,
it had red stripes. . .

182
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
. . .and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.

183
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
And topped off
by a gold football helmet.

184
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,000
The Army rejected it, of course.

185
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

186
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,900
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

187
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

188
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,600
George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.

189
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,700
Some of our boys
were just plain scared.

190
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,700
That's understandable.

191
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,700
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.

192
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
I can remember. . .

193
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,400
. . .when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of. . .

194
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
. . .a bullet coming
straight for my nose.

195
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,500
I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose. . .

196
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,000
. . .was more horrible
than any other possibility.

197
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,700
Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.

198
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,900
You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?

199
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,100
Blind man could see it in a minute.

200
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,300
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.

201
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
Why should they fight like soldiers?

202
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,700
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.

203
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,700
ln about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys. . .

204
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,600
. . .into fanatics, razors.

205
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,300
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.

206
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,800
I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.

207
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?

208
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,600
Have all my officers
finished breakfast?

209
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,900
We're open from 6 till 8.

210
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,500
Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.

211
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.

212
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,200
But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.

213
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,200
From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6:15.

214
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,800
Where are your leggings?

215
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,800
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.

216
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,100
You're a soldier.

217
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
$20 fine.

218
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,500
Gentlemen. . .

219
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,400
. . .from this moment any man. . .

220
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,700
. . .without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie. . . .

221
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform. . .

222
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
. . .is going to be skinned.

223
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,600
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.

224
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,200
(CHATTERING)

225
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

226
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Doctor.

227
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,700
Sir.

228
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,200
I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.

229
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,700
Yes, sir, we do.

230
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,500
Get them out of here.

231
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,100
One has developed a serious infection.

232
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,500
I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.

233
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,200
Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.

234
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,300
-I'll see that they're moved.
-One more thing.

235
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,800
There'll be no "battle fatigue. "
That's an order.

236
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,400
Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.

237
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

238
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,100
Yes, sir.

239
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,700
Doctor. . . .
Where's your helmet?

240
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,600
I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.

241
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
Start.

242
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.

243
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,000
Well. . .

244
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,000
. . .then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.

245
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,800
And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.

246
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,600
Hold it.

247
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,700
Turn right, here.

248
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The battlefield is ahead.

249
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,500
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.

250
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,300
He was out here yesterday.

251
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,300
It's over there. Turn right, damn it.

252
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,300
It was here.

253
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,300
The battlefield was here.

254
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,400
The Carthaginians
defending the city. . .

255
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,900
. . .were attacked by three
Roman legions.

256
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,000
They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.

257
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,100
Arab women. . .

258
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,700
. . .stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.

259
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
The soldiers lay naked in the sun. . .

260
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,700
. . .2000 years ago.

261
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,700
I was here.

262
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,400
You don't believe me.

263
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
You know what the poet said:

264
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,400
"Through the travail of ages

265
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,200
It's the pomp and toils of war

266
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,100
Have I fought and strove and perished

267
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,300
Countless times upon the star

268
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,000
As if through a glass and darkly

269
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,800
The age-old strife I see

270
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,900
Where I fought in many guises
Many names

271
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
But always me. "

272
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,200
You know who the poet was?

273
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
Me.

274
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,500
There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.

275
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
We've concentrated on the flank. . .

276
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,000
. . .draw strength from the British.

277
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,500
It appears now that we could. . .

278
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,600
. . .split the African corridor.

279
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,300
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

280
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved. . .

281
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,100
. . .for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

282
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.

283
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,000
They're entitled to have their hero.

284
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,500
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.

285
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,000
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?

286
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,500
You have anybody in mind?

287
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,100
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.

288
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
Excuse me, gentlemen. . .

289
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
. . .while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.

290
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,700
BRADLEY:
Harry.

291
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,300
How are you?

292
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,600
George. Good to see you.

293
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,700
-You know Arthur Coningham.
-Sir Arthur.

294
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,400
Delighted to see you.

295
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
I've heard so much about you.

296
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,200
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here. . .

297
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
. . .and Ike thought we should fix it.

298
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,900
No, no. No misunderstanding.

299
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,000
We're supposed to have Allied
air cover and we don't.

300
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,900
German planes are strafing my troops.

301
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,300
lf I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.

302
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,200
Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car. . .

303
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
. . .ran my ass into a ditch.

304
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,500
My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy. . .

305
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,500
. . .everywhere in the Mediterranean.

306
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,800
PATTON:
When I complained about air cover. . .

307
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,800
. . .you said our troops
were not battleworthy.

308
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,900
You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi. . .

309
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,100
. . .for lack of success on the ground.

310
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,000
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.

311
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,900
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.

312
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,700

may lead to an absolute disaster.

466
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,100
Oh?

467
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,900
Bedell, look.

468
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,300
This is Sicily.

469
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,900
Now then, according to Patton's plan. . .

470
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,700
. . .I will attack Syracuse here.

471
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,500
And he would attack Palermo up here.

472
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,100
Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.

473
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,900
And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.

474
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,700
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way. . .

475
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,300
. . .is this.

476
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,300
(MONTGOMERY EXHALES)

477
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,300
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

478
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,300
But the Americans--
The Americans will land here, at Gela.

479
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,300
I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.

480
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,700
After all, Messina is the key.

481
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,500
It's the reason for invading Sicily.

482
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,300
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

483
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,100
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

484
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,700
-Amusing, isn't it?
-What?

485
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,700
That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily. . .

486
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,700
. . .should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

487
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,500
George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

488
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Ike has turned it down.

489
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,500
Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time. . .

490
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,300
. . .and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

491
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,900
-Well, where do my people land then?
-In the Gulf of Gela.

492
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,900
There's nothing there
but a beach.

493
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:11,100
Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.

494
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,100
Where does Montgomery land?

495
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:18,500
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

496
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,100
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

497
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
I see.

498
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,900
ln other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.

499
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,100
Ike had to consider all points of view.

500
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,700
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.

501
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,100
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.

502
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,700
No. . .

503
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,300
. . .I've been in the Army 30 years.

504
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:52,100
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir. "
And I do my best to carry it out.

505
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,300
This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American. . .

506
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,900
. . .and starts being an Ally.

507
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,100
I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.

508
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,900
It's true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.

509
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,100
However, if we're--

510
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,900
Perfectly clear.

511
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,900
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

512
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,100
But this order from
General Alexander. . .

513
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,100
. . .directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

514
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug-- slug, mind you. . .

515
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,700
. . .his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?

516
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,300
Yes, sir.

517
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,700
Messina, Bell.

518
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,300
Messina. . .

519
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,300
. . .is the heart of it. lf they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

520
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,900
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!

521
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,100
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

522
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,700
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

523
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,900
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if it's the last thing I ever do!

524
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,300
Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

525
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,900
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.

526
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,700
Now, that road was assigned to me.

527
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,300
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.

528
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,700
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.

529
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,900
You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?

530
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

531
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,100
Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps. . .

532
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,700
. . .would be out of a job.

533
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Free for you to go into Palermo.

534
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
Who said anything about Palermo?

535
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,900
I can read a map.

536
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,500
Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?

537
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,300
That's a reconnaissance in force.

538
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,700
George. . .

539
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,900
. . .are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains. . .

540
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,300
. . .with heavy resistance?

541
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,700
Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

542
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,700
General. . .

543
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,900
. . .I just follow my orders.

544
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,500
Like the simple old soldier I am.

545
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,100
General Bradley.

546
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,100
Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.

547
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,700
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.

548
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,900
Repeat. Stop, immediately. "

549
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,900
That's what you think it says.

550
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,100
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

551
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,000
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

552
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,300
That'll take half a day at least.

553
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
Yes, sir.

554
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,500
Now, Brad.

555
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,700
Where were we?

556
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,100
We were talking about a simple. . .

557
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,300
. . .old soldier.

558
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,100
Look at that, gentlemen.

559
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,100
Compared to war. . .

560
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,900
. . .all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.

561
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,100
Let's go, sergeant.
Move out!

562
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
Give me that helmet.

563
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,300
Come on, let's get out of here!

564
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,800
What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?

565
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,700
I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.

566
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,300
PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.

567
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,100
PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program. . .

568
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,300
. . .for the spiritual welfare
of the men.

569
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,100
We'll take you right into Palermo.

570
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
Col. David toured us around
your quarters. . .

571
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,300
. . .and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?

572
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,500
I sure do.

573
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,700
Every goddamn day.

574
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,100
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

575
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,300
Damn!

576
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,900
(CHEERING)

(BAND PLAYS)

578
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,100
Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.

579
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,300
First the Phoenicians. . .

580
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,300
. . .the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.

Then came the Arabs. . .

01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,100
. . .Spaniards, Neapolitans.

583
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,700
Now comes. . .

01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,900
. . .the American Army.

585
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,100
This is from General Alexander, sir. . .

586
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,500
. . .reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.

587
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,100
Send him a message, Cod.

588
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,700
Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.

589
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,900
PATTON: Let me ask you a question
for a change.

590
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,100
You've just come from Washington.

591
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,900
How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?

592
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:50,300
The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance. . .

593
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,900
. . .while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.

594
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,900
Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Göring division?

595
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,700
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

596
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,900
The people at home
are interested in you.

597
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,500
They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.

598
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,700
They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse. . .

What about your language?

601
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,900
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.

602
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,900
What do your troops feel about that?

603
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,500
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.

604

Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.

605
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,100
Ernie calls him "The GI General. "

606
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

607
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,900
MAN:
What's your feeling about Montgomery?

608
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,300
PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.

609
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:37,100
He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.

610
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,500
He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?

611
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,900
Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

612
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,100
Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners. . .

613
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,100
. . .didn't have enough latrine.

614
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,700
They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.

lf I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague. . .

. . .let's forget about it.

617
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,100
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.

618
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,700
I'm gonna beat that. . .

01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,900
. . .gentleman to Messina.

620
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,500
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?

621
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,900
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.

622
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,300
This report might interest you.

623
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,100
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans. . .

624
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,700
. . .while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

625
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Well!

626
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,500
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.

627
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,700
He's not going to get Messina.

628
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,300
That's reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.

629
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,500
(BOMBS EXPLODING)

630
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:53,100
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1st Division is bogged down.

631
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,100
You're bogged down too.

632
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,700
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.

633
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,300
-Lucian. How's my fighter?
-Fine, George.

634
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,700
Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.

635
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,100
Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea. . .

636
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,900
. . .to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.

637
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,500
You want me to do a land-based attack.

638
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,900
Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11th.

639
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,500
I don't think we can make it
by the 11th.

640
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:32,500
-Hell, it's only 15, 20 miles.
-My boys have been dying for yards.

641
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,900
Hm.

642
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,100
Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.

643
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,100
I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.

644
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,900
I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

645
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,100
Excuse me, sir.

646
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,500
I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.

647
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,500
You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.

648
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,300
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.

649
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,700
lf we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.

650
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,900
Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.

651
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,900
-What's the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is. . .

652
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,700
. . .not to rush in until we're ready.

653
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,700
Give him an extra day.

654
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,300
Just one more day.

655
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,700
The landing is on.

656
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,500
We're going to Messina.

657
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,100
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.

658
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,700
-What's so important about that?
-General Truscott. . .

659
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,700
. . .if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation. . .

660
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,700
. . .I'll find somebody who can.

661
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:41,900
General, it's your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.

662
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,300
This match will not be postponed.

663
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,700
Any questions?

664
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,700
No, sir.

665
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,700
You're a very good man, Lucian.

666
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,700
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

667
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,100
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:

668
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,900
''L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!''

669
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,100
Go on, have a drink.

670
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:19,100
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.

671
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,500
lf anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.

672
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,900
You're not going, so forget about it.

673
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,100
You believe Truscott's right?

674
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,100
No.

675
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,500
But you're gambling
with those boys' lives. . .

676
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,300
. . .just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.

677
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,700
lf you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't. . . .

678
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,500
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.

679
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,300
He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.

680
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,900
He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.

681
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,100
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.

682
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,900
I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.

683
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,500
You do it because. . .

684
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,300
. . .you love it.

685
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,100
The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.

686
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,900
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.

687
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,700
I can't break through to the coast.

688
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,900
I'm going down there myself.

689
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,500
PATTON:
Colonel!

690
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,300
How did he get over there?

691
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,500
PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?

692
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,100
Looking for a place to ford, general.

693
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,300
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

694
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,900
PATTON: I've done that. Down there
this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

695
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,300
Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!

696
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,500
-And put that helmet on.
-Yes, sir.

697
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,700
Move it! Let's go!

698
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:02,100
-What's holding up this column?
-I don't know, sir.

699
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,500
Planes!

700
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,300
Come on, move it!

701
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,100
Pull up over there.

702
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,100
-Come on.
-What's going on here?

703
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
Sir, these mules--

704
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,700
Jackasses!

705
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,300
You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!

706
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,500
(GUNSHOT)

707
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,500
No. No.

708
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,100
Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!

709
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,100
We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!

710
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,500
Nobody's getting any air support!

711
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,900
Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.

712
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,400
Major!

713
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,500
-You the executive officer here?
-Yes, sir.

714
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,100
-Your name?
-WaIker.

715
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,100
You're now commanding officer.

716
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,700
You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.

717
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,900
lf you don't make it, I'll fire you.

718
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:28,100
50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.

719
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,900
Please take me home.
Take me home.

720
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,300
Please take me home.
Take me home.

721
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:39,300
-There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts. "
-Yeah, our blood. His guts.

722
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,100
Hi, how are you, son?

723
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,900
Where are you from, Gomez?

724
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,100
California, sir.

725
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,900
Me too.

726
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,300
-Where were you hit?
-In the chest, sir.

727
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,300
Well. . .

728
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:14,700
. . .this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.

729
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,100
Didn't have any head either.

730
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,300
You get well quickly, son.

731
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,100
What's the matter with you?

732
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,700
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

733
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,100
What did you say?

734
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,500
It's my nerves, sir.

735
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,700
I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.

736
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,300
Your nerves?

737
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,900
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

738
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,900
Shut up!

739
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,300
I won't have
a yellow bastard crying. . .

740
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,100
. . .in front of these
brave, wounded men.

741
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,900
Shut up!

742
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:12,300
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.

743
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:17,100
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.

744
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,500
You're going back to the front,
my friend.

745
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:25,100
You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.

746
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,500
Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.

747
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,900
I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!

748
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,900
Send him up to the front!

749
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:42,100
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

750
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
I won't have cowards in my army.

751
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,500
I had to kick a few butts. . .

752
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,700
. . .but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.

753
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,300
Have you seen the casualty lists?

754
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,500
Yes, I've seen them.

755
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,100
What's the word from the coast road?

756
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,100
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.

757
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:43,700
Let's get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.

758
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,900
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.

759
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,700
General Bradley. . .

760
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:54,300
. . .it's time to consider how many
casualties we'd have. . .

761
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,900
. . .if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.

762
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
Forward, march!

763
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,700
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.

764
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:52,700
Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.

765
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,700
Forward, march!

766
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,500
You wanted to see me, George?

767
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,300
Got a letter here from Ike.

768
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,100
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.

769
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:04,500
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.

770
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,300
I was struck by that fact because--

771
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,700
"Despicable. " First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.

772
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:18,100
Well, at least it's a personal
reprimand, it's not official.

773
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:22,100
The man was yellow. He should've
been tried for cowardice and shot.

774
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,700
People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.

775
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,500
I ruffled his pride a bit.
What's that compared to war?

776
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:35,100
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general. . .

777
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,900
-. . .since Stonewall Jackson.
-Now they draw cartoons about you.

778
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,100
Dirty bastard!

779
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,500
They got me holding a little Gl
and kicking him with an iron boot.

780
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,300
You see that, what's on my boot?
A swastika.

781
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,100
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!

782
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,900
"You will apologize to the soldier
you slapped. . .

787
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,700
God, I. . .

789
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,700
PATTON:
Oh, God...

790
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,700
... Thou art my God.

791
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,700
Early will I seek Thee.

792
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,500
My soul thirsteth for Thee.

793
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:48,100
My flesh longeth for Thee
in a dry and thirsty land.

794
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,300
So as I have seen Thee
in the sanctuary.

795
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,700
My soul followeth hard after Thee.

796
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:00,500
But those that seek my soul
to destroy it...

797
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:04,300
...shall go into the lower parts
of the earth.

798

They shall fall by the sword.

799
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:12,100
They shall be apportioned for foxes.

800
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,300
But the king shall rejoice in God.

801
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,500
Everyone that sweareth by him
shall glory.

802
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:25,700
But the mouth of them
that speak lies...

803
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,700
...shall be stopped.

804
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,300

. . .some appreciation of his

. . .I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.

816
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,800
This was on my mind.

817
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,700
Now, I freely admit. . .

-Dismissed.
-Ten-hut!

825
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,700
Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.

826
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,700
What poll?

827
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,100
The fan mail.

828
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,900
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.

829
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:32,700
And that 11% of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

830
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:36,500
But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.

831
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:40,300
"I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.

From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why. . .

. . .but we want you to know
we're for you.

Keep going, and God bless you. "

835
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,700
Keep going, huh?

836
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,500
Where?

837
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:01,300
I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. It's New Year's.

838
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,500
You didn't celebrate at all
last night.

839
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,700
I'm sick of sitting around this. . .

. . .royal doghouse.

841
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,300
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.

842
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,900
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.

843
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,700
Cod.

844
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,100
I've been relieved.

845
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:38,500
They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.

846
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,300
I don't believe it.

847
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,300
Happy New Year.

848
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,500
Just a minute, sir.

849
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,100
Since they're sure to give you
another command. . .

850
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,700
. . .isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?

851
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,100
You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?

852
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,700
It's possible. I know it's been
discussed from time to time.

853
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,500
The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.

854
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:19,500
Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle of wine.

855
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,500
No, Sir Cod. . .

856
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,100
. . .but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.

857
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:36,300
-How you feeling tonight, general?
-Not bad, not bad at all.

858
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,500
-Get me some writing paper, will you?
-Yes, sir.

859
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:43,100
Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?

860
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,700
All the time, sir.

861
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:48,700
Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.

862
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,700
Lucky for us we got them.

863
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,900
Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse captains?

864
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,900
That's what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.

865
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,900
Why are you up so late, George?

866
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,700
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.

867
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,100
I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.

868
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,100
Sleeping pill!

869
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,700
-What's going on here?
-I heard the news, sir.

870
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,300
-They announced it on the radio.
-What news?

871
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:31,500
About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.

872
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,700
Oh.

873
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,300
Oh, yeah.

874
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,700
I just thought you might be
feeling kind of low, sir.

875
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,900
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.

876
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:06,100
Yeah. Thank you, George.

877
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,100
One little dog face.

878
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,500
One measly little slap.
That's what done it.

879
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,300
Ah, George.

880
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,300
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.

-Good afternoon.

Can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to Corsica?

slapped, "The rat should've been shot. "

for cloak and dagger.

923
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,300
Who picked this cathouse?

924
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,300
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.

925
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,500
To spite me, that son of a bitch.

926
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:29,300
-Welcome to London, Georgie.
-Bedell. How are you?

927
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,900
-Is Ike here?
-He asked me to brief you.

928
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,900
Would you excuse us, please?

929
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,300
Let me put you straight about Ike.

930
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,900
We hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions.

931
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:45,100
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.

932
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:48,700
At times, I do wonder whether
he isn't a limey at heart.

933
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:52,500
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.

934
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:56,900
Ike's trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.

935
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,300
-It's a hell of a job.
-I understand.

936
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:03,700
You have an important assignment
connected to the Normandy invasion.

937
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:08,100
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan
and there's a number of flaws in it.

938
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:12,900
You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.

939
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:16,500
I've drawn up an alternate plan
to land at Calais. . .

-Will you just listen for a change?

941
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:24,100

I mean everyone. . .

with a rope around his neck.

943
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:36,300
We're gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover.

944
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,700
That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.

945
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:42,500
We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there. . .

946
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:45,700
. . .so that they can't be used
against us at Normandy.

947
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:48,100
Is that all I'm good for?

948
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:52,300
We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you.

949
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,500
All fictitious, of course.

950
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,700
Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft. . .

. . .simulated radio traffic.

952
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:04,900
The Germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort.

953
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,300
Their agents will spot you soon. . .

954
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,100
. . .then we can move you to Knutsford.

955
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:13,500
-What do I do there?
-Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

956
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,900
Frankly, George, you're on probation.

957

Take my advice and behave yourself.

I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?

That's quite all right, madam.

WOMAN:
My dear friends.

974
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,100
General George S. Patton, Jr.,
has accepted our invitation. . .

975
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,000
. . .to say a few words to you. . .

. . .on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony.

General Patton is not here
in an official capacity. . .

most earnestly. . .

. . .that nothing he says
will be quoted.

01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:43,300
May I present General Patton.

-Remember, sir, watch your language.
-Yeah.

982
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,300
My dear ladies.

983
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,800
Until today. . .

984
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,900
. . .my only experience
at welcoming has been. . .

985
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:12,400
. . .to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.

986
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:16,500
At this I have been
quite successful. . .

987
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:20,000
. . .since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command. . .

988
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,800
. . .have, to date, killed or captured. . .

. . .some 170,000 of our enemies.

990
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:40,400
I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value. . .

991
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:43,600
. . .because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw. . .

01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,600
. . .that the British and the Americans
are two peoples. . .

. . .separated by a common language.

994
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:59,200
Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world. . .

995
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,900
. . .the better we know each other. . .

996
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,000
. . .the better we will do it.

997

The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.

998
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,800
I think that a club like this. . .

999
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:14,500
. . .is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.

1000
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:20,700
Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies. . .

1001
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:26,400
. . .and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are. . .

1002
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:34,100
. . .then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous. . .

1003
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,400
. . .and force this war
to a quick termination.

1004
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:46,300
And then I'll get the chance to go
to the Pacific and kill Japanese.

NARRATOR:
All over the nation...

1006
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:10,500
...mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton 's statement...

1007
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,700
... that Britain and America
will rule the post war world.

1008
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,800
That Russia will have no say.

1009
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:20,300
Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.

1010
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,300
This man has insulted
our Russian allies...

1011
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:26,400
...implying Anglo-American world rule.

1012
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:29,700
In my opinion, he should be
severely disciplined.

1013
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,100
This time I didn't do a damn thing.

1014
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:35,000
They promised there
wouldn't be any reporters.

1015
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:37,500
I made a few remarks off the record.

1016
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,200
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

1017
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:44,100
You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.

1018
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,700
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.

1019
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,200
lf I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.

1020
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,700
Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.

1021
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,900
I have no political ambitions.

1022
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,100
All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.

1023
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,400
Well, it's out of our hands now.

1024
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:07,900
Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.

1025
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:13,300
Now it's up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy. . .

1026
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:15,700
. . .or he sends you home.

1027
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,900
He's a good man.

1028
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,600
At least he's a fair man.

1029
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,900
I'll let it sit with him.

1030
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,400
PATTON:
George. . .

1031
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:44,900
. . .our war is over.

1032
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:46,400
Over, sir?

1033
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:50,300
It's just a question of waiting
for the orders now.

1034
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,700
I feel I'm. . . .

1035
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,700
I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.

1036
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:11,500
But this last incident is. . .

1037
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:16,300
. . .so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect--

1038
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,500
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.

1039
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,900
Yes, sir.

1040
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,000
The last great opportunity
of a lifetime. . .

1041
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:30,700
. . .an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?

1042
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,400
No, sir.

1043
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,800
God will not permit this to happen!

1044
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,700
I am going to be allowed
to fulfil my destiny!

1045
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,700
His will be done.

1046
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:02,700
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted...

1047
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,600
...a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way...

1048
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:08,900
...for allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches...

1049
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:12,700
...and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.

1050
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,100
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.

1051
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:37,300
And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.

1052
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:41,700
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

1053
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:46,300
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.

1054
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,300
But they don't listen to me.

1055
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,900
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.

1056
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,600
Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.

1057
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,900
Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.

1058
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:05,800
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.

1059
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:09,600
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.

1060
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:13,800
lf I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

1061
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:17,600
I'm gonna play the game.

1062
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:20,100
lf I forget, you remind me.

1063
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:25,100
-I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
-Give me a swift kick in the ass.

1064
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,400
Yes, sir.

1065
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,700
Welcome to France, sir.

1066
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,300
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?

1067
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,800
Right this way, sir.

1068
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,500
Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.

1069
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,900
How are you?

1070
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,700
You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.

1071
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,400
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.

1072
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:44,500
Best of everything, old boy.

1073
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:50,200
By the way. . .

1074
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:54,000
. . .intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.

1075
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,200
Rommel.

1076
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:03,500
Hi, how are you, George?

1077
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:07,800
-Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
-Fine.

1078
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:13,900
Well. My, my.

1079
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,900
Isn't this plush?

1080
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:19,000
Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.

1081
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:22,500
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.

1082
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:27,000
Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.

1083
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,600
That's right.

1084
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:33,300
We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.

1085
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:35,100
Do I get it?

1086
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,200
I'll be honest with you.

1087
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,200
I've had reservations.

1088
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:43,100
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.

1089
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:47,300
You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought. . .

1090
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:50,800
. . .well, it might be a problem for us.

1091
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:53,000
It wouldn't bother me.

1092
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:55,200
There's one other thing.

1093
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,400
We're different kinds of people.

1094
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:00,400
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

1095
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:05,100
With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.

1096
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,700
Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

1097
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,700
Brad. . .

1098
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:18,000
. . .I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.

1099
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:20,900
For God's sake, get me in this fight.

1100
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:25,900
The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.

1101
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,800
I gotta get back in the war!

1102
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:31,200
Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.

1103
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,900
First thing you know,
it'll be over and. . . .

1104
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:38,400
I'll. . .

1105
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,600
. . .keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.

1106
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,300
I give you my word.

1107
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:53,500
George. . .

1108
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,700
. . .I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.

1109
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,000
I'd like your opinion.

1110
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,600
We've been slugging through
hedgerow country. . .

1111
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:05,000
. . .half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.

1112
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:06,900
I want to use this road.

1113
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,800
The Saint Lô-Periers road.

1114
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,700
Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.

1115
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,500
We'll pulverize an area
3 1/2 miles wide with bombing.

1116
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,900
Then seven divisions will follow.

1117
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:23,100
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.

1118
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,300
What do you think?

1119
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:31,900
I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

1120
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:34,800
George. . .

1121
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,500
. . .Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.

1122
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,500
He what?

1123
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:48,500
Why, that dirty--!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1124
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:50,800
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

1125
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,200
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

1126
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,600
George could have the courtesy
to tell us where he's going.

1127
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,200
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?

1128
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,700
Berlin.

1129
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,800
I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

1130
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,900
(CHEERING)

1131
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:57,600
Hold it. Hold it!

1132
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,100
This place isn't on the map.

1133
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:03,200
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.

1134
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:17,500
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.

1135
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,800
(HONKING)

1136
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:19,100
SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!

1137
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:21,400
Hold it!

1138
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:29,200
Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.

1139
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,100
Let's move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.

1140
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,300
Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.

1141
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:39,000
All right, get up off your ass.
Let's go now!

1142
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,700
That's it.
That's the way to move.

1143
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,800
Good boy. All right, come on.

1144
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:59,200
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
That's it!

1145
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,300
That's it! Gun it!

1146
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,800
Gun that thing!

1147
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,000
Okay, come on.

1148
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,900
Watch it!

1149
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:12,000
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.

1150
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,500
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

1151
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,300
That's it.

1152
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:19,400
Come on, now.

1153
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,900
-Chet.
-Yeah, will do.

1154
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:30,400
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.

1155
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:34,800
Now come on! Hold it!

1156
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:38,200
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

1157
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,100
That's it. Come on.

1158
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:46,600
Good boy.

1159
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,100
-Hold it up there.
-General!

1160
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,600
General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.

1161
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,700
Okay. Come on!

1162
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:02,300
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

1163
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,600
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

1164
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,800
George this drive has been
magnificent. . .

1165
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:20,000
. . .but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.

1166
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:24,300
-What the hell for?
-We'll have to cut off your supplies.

1167
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,400
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.

1168
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,200
-I think I smell Montgomery.
-Take it easy, George.

1169
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:35,500
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.

1170
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,600
By God, it is Montgomery.

1171
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,800
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.

1172
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:44,100
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

1173
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:47,700
Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.

1174
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:49,700
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

1175
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:54,100
You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.

1176
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:56,300
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.

1177
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,300
George, I can't do it.

1178
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:00,400
The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.

1179
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:02,800
They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.

1180
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:05,800
It's crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.

1181
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:09,100
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.

1182
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,300
Why did you pick me to command?

1183
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:13,600
I didn't pick you.

1184
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:17,000
Ike picked you.

1185
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,900
George, you have performed
brilliantly.

1186
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,000
You are loyal, dedicated.

1187
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:28,000
You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.

1188
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:31,900
George, you're a pain in the neck.

1189
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:38,000
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

1190
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,600
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

1191
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,400
I owe you a lot.

1192
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:47,100
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.

1193
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:50,600
What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.

1194
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,200
(TANK SPUTTERS)

1195
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:19,300
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

1196
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:21,600
The point tank has run out too.

1197
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:25,500
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

1198
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,400
Yeah, I know.

1199
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:31,500
PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?

1200
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:34,200
I was in command.

1201
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:38,900
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.

1202
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:43,900
Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.

1203
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:48,200
We started 11:00 last night.

1204
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,800
Finished a couple hours ago.

1205
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,300
This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.

1206
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,700
I had a dream last night.

1207
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,100
In my dream it came to me. . .

1208
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:57,600
. . .that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.

1209
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,200
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

1210
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:05,600
Now I have precisely
the right instrument. . .

1211
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:10,500
. . .at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.

1212
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,300
The Saar?

1213
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:14,600
This will change too, very quickly.

1214
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:17,400
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.

1215
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,500
A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.

1216
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:23,500
All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.

1217
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:27,500
Right now, the weak spot is here.

1218
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,500
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.

1219
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:36,200
What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?

1220
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:40,400
Fixed fortifications, huh?

1221
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:43,600
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

1222
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:47,800
When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome. . .

1223
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:50,200
. . .anything built by man
can be overcome.

1224
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,600
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?

1225
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:01,200
The carts.

1226
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,100
They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.

1227
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:11,900
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.

1228
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,100
Then I remembered. . .

1229
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:21,300
. . .that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

1230
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:24,100
How cold it was.

1231
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:31,100
They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.

1232
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,200
Napoleon was finished.

1233
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:39,200
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.

1234
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:42,200
Only the snow.

1235
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:48,600
Look at this, Cod.

1236
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,800
I love it.

1237
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:04,000
God help me, I do love it so.

1238
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,800
I love it more than my life.

1239
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,100
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.

1240
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:27,600
The Allies march into the city
after four years of Nazi occupation.

1241
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:30,900
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...

1242
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,600
...under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...

1243
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:35,600
...gets an unforgettable welcome...

1244
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:38,200
...as they enter their beloved Paris.

1245
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:45,200
In a powerful drive to the north...

1246
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,800
... General Montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the French coastal towns...

1247
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:51,600
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.

1248
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.

1249
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:02,900
Meanwhile, the main body
of Patton 's army...

1250
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,300
...resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.

1251
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:10,400
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.

1252
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:15,300
It seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into Germany.

1253
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:27,300
-Sir, General Bradley on your line.
-Good, good.

1254
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:36,100
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.

1255
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:37,700
I'm on my way to Germany.

1256
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:40,500
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.

1257
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:45,700
I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

1258
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:47,900
Brad, you can't do that.

1259
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,100
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.

1260
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:54,200
There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.

1261
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,800
No, I don't know how serious it is. . .

1262
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:01,400
. . .but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

1263
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:03,000
Be there at 11 00.

1264
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:04,900
Yes, sir.

1265
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:48,600
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume. . .

1266
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,600
. . .that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.

1267
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,900
The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.

1268
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,500
The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.

1269
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:07,500
Therefore I believe that's exactly
what they're going to do.

1270
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,300
I want you to start making
contingency plans. . .

1271
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,300
. . .for pulling out
of our eastward attack.

1272
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:57,400
Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.

1273
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:01,100
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

1274
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:04,400
I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.

1275
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,500
From Diekirch, due north.

1276
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:11,000
From Orléans to Bastogne.

1277
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:14,800
From Neufchâteau against the German
left flank.

1278
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:37,500
We've identified four German armies:

1279
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:42,700
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.

1280
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:45,300
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

1281
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:48,400
They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.

1282
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:51,700
And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.

1283
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,700
Our concern is that von Rundstedt. . .

1284
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,800
. . .has the 101st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.

1285
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:05,900
Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.

1286
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:10,500
lf we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.

1287
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:13,900
lf they take it,
we're in serious trouble.

1288
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:17,400
Ike wants to know if anybody can go. . .

1289
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:20,800
. . .and relieve the 101st
before they're torn to pieces.

1290
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:25,400
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

1291
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:28,000
At any rate, not for some weeks.

1292
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,700
What about you, George?

1293
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:34,000
I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.

1294
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:39,700
I'd give myself some leeway.

1295
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:42,400
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.

1296
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:46,700
You're in the middle of a fight now.
It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

1297
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,400
My staff's already working
out the details.

1298
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:54,600
Frankly, I don't see how
it's possible.

1299
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:57,200
Not in this kind of weather.

1300
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:00,600
I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.

1301
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:03,600
Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.

1302
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,200
TEDDER:
But what about your men?

1303
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:09,700
You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.

1304
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,500
I trained these men.

1305
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:13,600
They'll do what I tell them to do.

1306
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:17,500
We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.

1307
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,800
I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.

1308
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:26,900
And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.

1309
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,900
Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.

1310
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,300
He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.

1311
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,200
Of course he would.

1312
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:41,600
Cause he's never realized that's
what we're in business for.

1313
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:35,900
(BOMB EXPLODES)

1314
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,400
General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.

1315
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,300
You know what he said?

1316
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,700
What?

1317
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:08,700
He said, "Nuts. "

1318
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:12,100
Keep them moving, colonel.

1319
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:14,700
A man that eloquent has to be saved.

1320
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,800
(SILENCE)

1321
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,900
This is where it pays off.

1322
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:36,900
The training and discipline.

1323
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,100
No other outfit in the world.

1324
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:44,400
Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.

1325
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:48,800
Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.

1326
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:52,700
God! God, I'm proud of these men!

1327
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:22,400
Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.

1328
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:24,900
101 st Airborne's barely holding on.

1329
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:29,400
We need damned air cover. lf we had
decent weather, we might make it.

1330
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:32,000
CARVER:
General Mason, sir.

1331
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:49,700
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.

1332
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:53,600
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.

1333
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,800
Yes, every last one you can find.

1334
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:57,400
Good evening, general.

1335
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,700
I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.

1336
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,000
There goes our air cover.

1337
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:05,900
We may have to wait
for better weather.

1338
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:11,000
Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.

1339
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:14,900
Going to keep moving.

1340
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:16,800
ls that clear?

1341
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:22,400
We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!

1342
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,800
lf we're not victorious. . .

1343
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,100
. . .let no one come back alive.

1344
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,700
You know something, general?

1345
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:48,000
Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.

1346
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,100
It isn't important for them to know.

1347
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,800
It's only important for me to know.

1348
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,200
-You want to see me, general?
-Oh, yeah, chaplain.

1349
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:09,100
I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans. . .

1350
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:11,700
. . .with supreme command,
no gasoline. . .

1351
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,900
. . .and now this ungodly weather.

1352
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:16,300
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.

1353
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:18,700
A weather prayer, sir?

1354
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,900
Yes, let's see if you can't get God
working with us.

1355
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:24,600
Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.

1356
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,100
I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.

1357
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:30,200
I don't know how this
will be received, general.

1358
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:33,500
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.

1359
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:36,800
I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty. . .

1360
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:40,200
. . .if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.

1361
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:43,200
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.

1362
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,300
Yes, sir.

1363
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:18,900
"Almighty and most merciful Father. . .

1364
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:22,300
. . .we humbly beseech Thee. . .

1365
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:24,700
. . .of Thy great goodness. . .

1366
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:29,100
. . .to restrain this
immoderate weather. . .

1367
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,700
. . .with which we've had to contend.

1368
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:37,600
Grant us fair weather for battle.

1369
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:40,600
Graciously hearken to us...

1370
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:43,900
...as soldiers who call upon Thee...

1371
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,900
... that armed with Thy power...

1372
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:50,200
... we may advance
from victory to victory...

1373

02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:24,900
...and whispering in his ear
a warning...

1527
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:27,300
... that all glory...

1528
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:29,900
...is fleeting.
