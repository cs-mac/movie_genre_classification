Boss! Boss!

27
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,691
Who's there!

28
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,383
- It's Tae-Ho.
- What?

29
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,792
I think Jonq-Du took off.

30
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,695
I thought he came over here.

31
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,492
What?

32
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,499
Who's here?

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,004
Jong-Du.

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,407
You're sure he's here?
I didn't hear a thing.

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,606
I'm sure.
I followed him here.

36
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,985
Son of a bitch.

37
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,291
- Maybe he's dead.
- Dead, my ass.

38
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,208
I knew it.

39
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,698
Wait.

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,604
Let's do one more round.

41
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,910
This is enouqh.

42
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,908
This is a one
in a million chance.

43
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,311
No way.
Hurry.

44
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,078
Shit, what the heck.

45
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,697
Just take only cigarettes
and liquor.

46
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,093
They sell at high prices.

47
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,804
Fuck, it's heavy.

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,007
Let go of me!

49
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,006
Hey, come out here!

50
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,408
You son of bitch!

51
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,984
You fuck, let go of me.

52
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,087
Come on out.

53
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,790
- Here's your cards.
- Got something good?

54
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,187
- Huh?
- I win, I win.

55
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,998
I win!

56
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,098
Who the hell is it?

57
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,912
Laugh, you fucker.

58
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,804
Laugh. Go on!

59
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,285
What's that noise?
Check it out.

60
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't move!

61
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,306
Move if your want
your head blown off.

62
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,173
Fucker.

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880
That's enough.

64
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:41,699
I saw some unauthorized stuff
on the market.

65
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,605
You sons of bitches.

66
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,100
You steal from
right under my nose.

67
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,206
Sung-Jae!

68
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,285
Now that it's summer and all,
let's round a few mutts.

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,080
Yes, boss.

70
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,180
Come here, you fuck.

71
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,883
I said come here, you fuck.

72
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,501
once upon a Time in Seoul

73
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,005
There are 50 boxes of liquor
and over 100 boxes of cigarettes.

74
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:35,376
The reason they mess with our stuff
is they're not getting it on time.

75
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:41,585
So I was thinking of finding
some new deals.

76
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,592
Take care of that with Myung-Soo.

77
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,391
Good job, yesterday.

78
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,897
I'll tell Sooyangro to expect you.

79
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,504
Take the boys for a drink.

80
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,772
Good day, sir.

81
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,474
Hello.

82
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,986
How are you sir?

83
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,485
It should be easy to find out
who supplied them.

84
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,891
You beat them for half a day
and still haven't find out?

85
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,395
That black guy
they were talking about,

86
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,697
I can't find him
anywhere.

87
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,598
Forget it.
I'll take care of that.

88
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,299
What about the stuff?

89
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,704
Why does it take half a day
to calculate how much it is?

90
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,905
Well...

91
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,184
How much is just the Luckies?

92
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,683
The Luckies?

93
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,281
Well, there's 50 boxes of Luckies.

94
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,687
And I got 5 more boxes.

95
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,793
That's 55 boxes.

96
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,890
So how much is that,
you dickhead?

97
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,400
Calculating that
is no big deal but...

98
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,698
I spent all morning looking for
that black master sergeant.

99
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,102
Get it done
by tonight.

100
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,207
Okay.

101
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,479
That's reward for yesterday.

102
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,585
I'd like something else, sir.

103
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,082
Something else?

104
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,585
Let us work the market, sir.

105
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:26,496
Look, boy, you need brains
to work the market.

106
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,997
1,760,000 huan.

107
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,202
What's 1,760,000?

108
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,901
One pack of Luckies is 40 huan.
One carton of 20 pack is 800 huan.

109
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,310
One box is 40 cartons,

110
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,503
8x4=32,
32,000 huan.

111
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,376
50 boxes x 32,
1,600,000 huan.

112
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:48,283
Plus 5 boxes equals
1,760,000 huan.

113
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:54,087
You can do that in your head?

114
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,988
Boss, he's really good.

115
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,590
Forget it.

116
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,797
Take that
and get out of here.

117
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,595
- I can do well, sir.
- You little prick...

118
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,995
Why not?

119
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,707
Give them Kyung-Soo's store.

120
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,409
They're only boys, boss.

121
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,180
What if someone robs them?

122
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,483
The market's unstable now.

123
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,789
You know that, boss.

124
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,483
So what if stolen goods
get stolen.

125
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,486
- Good day, boss.
- Let'em try.

126
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,180
Good day, sir.

127
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,092
Fuck, why do we have to
work for them?

128
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,300
We got U.S. goods, too.

129
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,203
So how are we gonna
get rid of them?

130
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:21,609
If we move too early,
we become targets.

131
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,883
Keep your enemies close.
I got an idea.

132
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,589
So you decided
for both of us!

133
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,290
Just take your share
if you want to leave.

134
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,403
That's for running out on me.

135
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,300
If I had stayed there,
we'd have both died.

136
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,404
All that for nothing.

137
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,211
Fuck.
That's all our stuff.

138
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,710
Forget about it.

139
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,174
We'll get another chance.

140
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,386
- Don't eat this.
- Okay.

141
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,797
If you' re told to stop,
then pack up and come back in.

142
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,993
There's lots of days
you can't work.

143
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,495
Wait, where is it?

144
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,407
Then find other work
or something.

145
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,101
Here, Johnnie Walker!

146
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,610
- Johnnie Walker!
- Hey...

147
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,277
You get into trouble,
mention our boss.

148
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,577
Then the market will
take care of things.

149
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,584
Mister Do-Chul?

150
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,989
Whatcha talking about?

151
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,583
I mean Boss Myung-Soo of course.

152
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,387
There's a fight.

153
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,582
Fuck off.

154
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,691
He grabbed his throat
and just threw him.

155
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,186
Never seen nobody
so strong.

156
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,399
He was like someone else.

157
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,999
They're all still thugs.

158
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,604
No, they said he was
even better during the war.

159
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,411
I don't think
he's just a thug.

160
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:16,382
I'm warning you now,
stay away from any fight.

161
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,082
They attacked first.

162
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,690
You're working here but
you take off at a time like that?

163
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,392
Shut up.

164
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,296
We got nothing to do
with them.

165
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:35,100
Whoever messes with me
is dead meat.

166
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,801
Make sure you don't mix it up
with our stuff.

167
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,580
This is really good.

168
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,790
Y eah, it's sweet.

169
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,896
- Give me that.
- No.

170
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,806
I heard about this place.
Is this real?

171
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,310
Of course.

172
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,677
We got them
straight from the Yankees.

173
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,477
Then l'll take one
for 1,000 huan.

174
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,282
No way.
That was the price yesterday.

175
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,393
From today,
it's 1,300 huan.

176
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,690
We can't do that.

177
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,893
It went up again?

178
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,295
This is getting crazy.

179
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,699
Then l'll take it for 1,200 huan.
But give me 3 bottles.

180
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:20,305
- I shouldn't.
- Then forget it.

181
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,106
All right then.

182
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,098
Here you go.

183
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,405
Thank you.
Do come again.

184
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,981
Give me chocolate.

185
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,977
This month's pay.
Go on.

186
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,588
- All done?
- One more to go.

187
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,587
Have a heart, bro.

188
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,192
- Please!
- Next time.

189
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,997
No way.
That doesn't make sense.

190
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,991
I' m telling you.
Look at the office.

191
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,901
There's stacks of stuff
that aren't being sold.

192
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,405
Why do you think?

193
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,205
Maybe other areas
don't sell well.

194
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,902
That's not it.

195
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,174
Mister Do-Chul isn't
interested in business.

196
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,180
We close shop a lot too.

197
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,684
I was wondering why
and now I get it.

198
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,085
When stuff sells,
you buy more stuff.

199
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,493
When it doesn't sell,
you hold onto it.

200
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,002
It's because
prices keep going up.

201
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,203
It might be better
to keep our stuff.

202
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,308
What?
Then you really won't sell it?

203
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,377
No, we could get
caught anytime.

204
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,177
We should get rid of
what we can.

205
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,181
Just as long as we don't
keep it in cash.

206
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,792
Then what do you suggest?

207
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,490
I don't know about
after that.

208
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,190
Pick it up.

209
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,804
Grab it.

210
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,505
Let go, you fuck.

211
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,202
- T ae-Hwan.
- Fucker.

212
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,874
Thief! Thief!
Help us!

213
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,776
Help!
Please!

214
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,886
Thief!

215
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,688
Thief!

216
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,285
Come on!

217
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,798
Let go, you fuck.

218
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,796
People are coming!

219
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,695
Come on, guick!

220
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,106
What's this?

221
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,971
What the hell
were you thinking?

222
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,682
Things like this always happen
on collection day.

223
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,783
You should have been careful.

224
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,082
Where the fuck are they?

225
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,587
Boss.

226
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,087
That's over 8,000 huan,
you fuck.

227
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,289
You send it
with these two babies?

228
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,595
- Are you insane or what?
- They took 2 cans of Spam.

229
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,900
- l'll repay it somehow.
- What?

230
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,509
They held onto the money.

231
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,976
- You checked it?
- Yes. It's 8,060 huan.

232
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,086
A good meal's the best cure
for a mugging, you know.

233
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,891
- They haven't had dinner yet.
- We don't need dinner.

234
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,198
Give 'em some money to eat.

235
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,196
Boss!

236
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,696
We rounded up the kids.

237
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,107
- You boys come too!
- Boss!

238
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,187
Please stop.

239
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,193
Please stop!

240
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,796
Please stop!

241
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,007
Please...

242
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,984
This is what we call
hanging up a mutt.

243
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:07,798
A mutt is a dog that keeps
biting you every time you let it go.

244
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,696
Then you have to take out
all its teeth.

245
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,907
Otherwise,
it'll try to bite you again.

246
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,013
So you have to take them all out
when you grab them.

247
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,177
Come on, you shithead.

248
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,089
You got something to say
to me?

249
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,902
Please don't.

250
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,577
Wait, wait, hold on!

251
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,185
Hey! Hey!

252
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,795
He's dead.

253
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:31,878
You' re so rough.
Why'd you do that?

254
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,782
Clean up.

255
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,703
You didn't kill him.
It was just bad luck.

256
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,080
We get screwed all the time.

257
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,876
So just forget about it.

258
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,491
But I never killed nobody.

259
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,396
What's with you, Jong-Du?

260
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,999
Stupid fuckers.

261
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,406
They should have left town
right away, not get caught.

262
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,081
They were dumb to begin with.

263
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,781
You can't get anywhere
with that kind of brains.

264
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,589
We' re different from
those idiots.

265
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,194
But we need to stay on
our toes.

266
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,798
See how he left it to you
at the end.

267
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:01,095
The more I see that bastard,
the less I like him.

268
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,408
- If we get unlucky...
- Just let them try.

269
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,112
I' m not afraid one bit.
Shit.

270
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,582
You' re right, Jong-Du.

271
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,390
We' re not that easy
to deal with.

272
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,591
Don't worry.

273
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,991
As long as I have you,
I got nothing to worry about.

274
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,497
I'll find a way somehow.

275
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,087
You made it?

276
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,492
Yes.

277
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,990
Do it like you're flicking it.

278
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,304
Where's the whiz kid?

279
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:27,781
Don't know.
He went to find out something.

280
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,392
The first time's
always the toughest.

281
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,699
- Goodbye, sir.
- Go on then.

282
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,805
No RlcE

283
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,706
- Sell rice?
- Y eah.

284
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,579
There's a lot of flour
coming in,

285
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,276
but you think Koreans can live
without rice?

286
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,382
Harvest has been bad for years.

287
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:44,091
I'll bet when it gets cold,
there'll be a huge fuss.

288
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,393
Fuss?

289
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,092
Cuz of rice?

290
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,403
I know this rice guy
from way back.

291
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,106
He says he'll give me more than
the market price for any amount.

292
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,911
How much more money
do we need?

293
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,082
I don't know.

294
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,778
But a box of cigarettes went up to
2,000 huan.

295
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,387
If the value of money keeps falling,
it'll get harder to get out.

296
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,496
But what choice do we have?

297
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,693
And we have to run
the store too.

298
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,000
Nope.

299
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,303
We could do better than that.

300
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,273
We might need kids
younger than us.

301
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,480
Get her!

302
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,090
Get her!

303
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,085
Get her!

304
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,395
Catch that thief!

305
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,395
- Got ya!
- Let me go!

306
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,092
What are you doing here?

307
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,804
Mister.

308
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,304
- She's my little sister, sir.
- So what?

309
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,005
She forgot to take money
with her.

310
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,407
Mom told me to go after her.

311
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,173
Here.

312
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,285
I'm really sorry
about that day.

313
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,185
But we were forced
to go there.

314
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:22,082
Maybe you were, but your pal
killed someone.

315
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,196
No. That's not it.
That was an accident.

316
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,393
He's still agonizing over it.

317
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,399
So what good does that
do now?

318
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,095
Is that gonna bring
a dead guy back?

319
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,601
I don't know what to say
when it comes to your chief.

320
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:44,072
But you guys would have ended up
like that one way or another.

321
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,982
What's that mean?

322
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:54,285
You would have kept stealing
and gotten caught someday.

323
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,290
I'm sorry
if I offended you.

324
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,694
That wasn't
why I came to see you.

325
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,892
I've been looking for
you guys all day.

326
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,999
That's Sang-Gook
and his brother Jae-Gook.

327
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,010
Woo-Shik, Young-Nam,
and Duk-Bae.

328
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,974
So what you got up
your sleeve?

329
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,778
Why are we listening to the guy
who killed out chief?

330
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,889
You keep guiet.

331
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,293
The reason
I asked to see you is

332
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,391
to suggest selling stuff with us
from now on.

333
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,196
I thought
it was a pickpocket j'ob.

334
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:43,198
Sell what?
Dirt from the street?

335
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,502
Selling ain't
for the likes of us.

336
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,305
Yeah, they don't even treat us
like people.

337
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,076
This is just a taste.

338
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,282
If business goes well,
you'll get fed 3 times a day

339
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,283
and we'll give you a cut.

340
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,189
I guarantee it.

341
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,585
You're google-eyed
over a few pennies?

342
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,391
- More soup please.
- Me too.

343
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,093
You already forgot
how our chief died?

344
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,403
So?
They're in?

345
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,503
Well...

346
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,376
Guys should just say yes or no.

347
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,884
What's so complicated?

348
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,389
All I need to do is pay you back
for what I did to you.

349
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,187
That's all you need, right?

350
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,395
Okay. I'll do it.

351
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,401
It won't get any worse
than this.

352
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,001
And like someone said,

353
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,376
we need to get paid back for
our chief's life, right?

354
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,477
Okay, l'm in.

355
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,785
- Me too.
- And me.

356
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,789
What about us?

357
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,885
Well, if everybody's doing it,
then...

358
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,497
Wow, it's an organ.

359
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,306
No one's been living here
since it got bombed.

360
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,204
- You sure?
- Y eah.

361
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:34,080
It's far from anybody
and perfect for storing the rice.

362
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,780
And it's close to the stream.

363
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,389
Hey, what's that?

364
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,387
- Come here.
- What is it?

365
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,690
Over there.

366
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,599
- Look at that.
- At what?

367
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,000
I mean over there.

368
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,708
There.

369
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,772
It's done.

370
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:44,186
I miss Mommy.
I wanna go with her.

371
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,590
I wanna go to Mommy.

372
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,189
Stupid fuck.

373
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,093
You want to be buried
here too?

374
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,198
Shut your trap and bow.

375
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,201
You don't know
how to bow?

376
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,689
Do what I do.

377
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,083
Go on out.

378
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,991
They said
they'd take care of it.

379
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,699
- Look here.
- Shut up.

380
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,301
Ask!

381
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,106
When are we startin
the rice business?

382
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:20,877
Well, we work in the store
tomorrow

383
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,080
and you guys need
to get your stuff,

384
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,589
so the day after tomorrow
maybe?

385
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,087
We don't really have anything
to bring.

386
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,398
But you' re gonna have to live here
from now on.

387
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,500
Tell me what you need
and we'll try to get it for you.

388
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,979
Thanks anyway.
It's all thanks to you.

389
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,580
Don't worry too much.

390
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,588
They know the market
so they think fast.

391
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,489
And they follow orders well.

392
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,597
What's he say?

393
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,403
When do we start the rice thing?

394
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,513
What?

395
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:27,277
find the biggest landowner
in the village.

396
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,879
All the rice will be there
anyway.

397
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,481
And then...

398
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,194
Hello, sir.

399
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,297
Huh?
Who are you kids?

400
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:50,799
Well, um.
We were...

401
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,104
What our big brother means is

402
00:36:54,745 --> 00:37:00,274
we're on our way to SeouI to find
our parents we split up with.

403
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,386
And we ran out of rice.

404
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,182
What's going on?

405
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,990
- Good day, sir.
- Yes.

406
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:15,792
Our uncle who works
on the U.S. base gave us this

407
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,196
to give to our parents
when we meet them.

408
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,604
But seeing
as we're in need now...

409
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,883
Fuck.
They wouldn't give us any rice.

410
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,492
They said
a girl was bad luck.

411
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:46,791
Shut up. I told you the place
we went to was stingy.

412
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,095
Don't worry. We can do
that much tomorrow.

413
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,694
I heard rice prices were good
in Kimpo.

414
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,705
How about we go there
next time?

415
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,609
I think I heard that too.

416
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,713
Okay.
We go to Kimpo next.

417
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,079
You did well for your first day.

418
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,285
We'll make it in no time.

419
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,089
We'll get more and more
from now on

420
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,895
and l'm worried about leaving
such a little boy here alone.

421
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,594
I think someone should
stay with him.

422
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,101
Then Soon-Nam should stay.

423
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,796
You got the least.

424
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,497
Why me?

425
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,007
I just had a run of bad luck.

426
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,411
You have no choice.

427
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,982
You guys did get the least.

428
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,700
Hey, it's the traveling doctor.

429
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:24,686
This medicine happens to work for
asthma, nervousness breakdown,

430
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,490
strengthening stamina.

431
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,791
The results will blow you away.

432
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,400
You gotta try it.

433
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,900
Mister, try this.

434
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,800
- Just try!
- It can heal every disease!

435
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,400
Look at that guy's belly.

436
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,303
- Shall we steal that?
- No.

437
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,882
Where are you from?

438
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,182
You' re not from around here,
are you?

439
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,588
Hey, what's that on your back?

440
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,090
- It's nothing, sir.
- Hand it over.

441
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,696
- You little...
- Run!

442
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,096
Stop right there!

443
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,080
Get up.

444
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,596
I said stop!

445
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,401
Come on!
Quick!

446
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,397
Bro!

447
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,000
Throw it!

448
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,805
Come on!

449
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,979
Bro!

450
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,496
I told him it was nothing.

451
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,997
But the cop just charged at me.

452
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,593
Then big bro Jong-Du swerved
and took out his whip...

453
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,901
Yummy?

454
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:22,108
- You're supposed to fall.
- Huh?

455
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,975
Ha, ha, ha!
You're pathetic.

456
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm PARK Jong-Du, the fighter
from Jong-ro.

457
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,788
That's bullshit.
He didn't say that.

458
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,285
Sure he did. I heard him.

459
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,894
Yeah, right.

460
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,996
Just shut up and eat.

461
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,479
I just got it
at the market.

462
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,998
- This is good.
- What is it?

463
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,099
This is porridge
straight from America.

464
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,106
- lvory.
- lvory.

465
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,770
- 1 dollar.
- 1 dollar.

466
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,183
Bro!

467
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,389
Good to see you.

468
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,491
Welcome.

469
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,802
Wow, that's heavy.

470
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,002
Wow!

471
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,490
Hey!
Stop that!

472
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,106
Attack!
Attack!

473
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,582
Guys!

474
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,288
- And this.
- Ok.

475
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,093
So you want to
come with us too?

476
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:17,205
No, staying with Soon-Nam
is fun too.

477
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,209
What's fun?

478
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:27,174
Dunno. She only talks about
the rice and T ae-Ho.

479
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,279
- What about me?
- Let's go.

480
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,286
Wow.

481
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,592
Jong-Du, look at this.

482
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,706
Gi-Dong, let's go.

483
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:57,576
Why? What's up?

484
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,881
Who's that little shrimp
with Jong-Du?

485
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,681
Never seen him before.

486
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,088
Why those little fuckers.

487
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:38,286
I went by the office earlier.

488
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,287
They were all looking for you.

489
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,785
The market seems weird.

490
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,086
Is something up?

491
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,599
How long are you gonna
stay here?

492
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,104
What?

493
00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,499
You miss your timing and
you'll never get out.

494
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,175
Like you?

495
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,082
No.

496
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,286
I don't care what happens.

497
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,491
It's time you stopped.

498
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:27,299
This place isn't that easy,
you know.

499
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,701
Watch your back.

500
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,472
Tae-Ho!

501
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,888
I walked over 10 kms.

502
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,993
Now my legs are stiff.

503
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,593
I don't think
l'm cut out for this.

504
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,898
It wasn't like that at first.

505
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:02,802
But now I can't even out-talk
country bumpkins.

506
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,972
But you' re good at
stealing money?

507
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,686
Why'd you do it?

508
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,489
We promised each other
from the start

509
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,890
we eat, sleep together
until we're done.

510
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,199
But why did you do it?

511
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,001
Eat together
and starve together?

512
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,474
Rice rations are 200 huan.

513
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,774
Rice we buy
from the country is 300.

514
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,777
Isn't that strange?

515
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,183
You ever been to the market?

516
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,784
No one's selling rice
in stores.

517
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:59,589
But rice on the black market is

518
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,893
600 huan.

519
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,103
Why are we working
our asses off?

520
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,004
We don't know shit.

521
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,006
And somebody's making money.

522
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,906
- You wanna die?
- Stop it.

523
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,479
We have to show that fucker.

524
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,583
A bastard who doesn't trust his
pack needs to learn a lesson.

525
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,582
We'll j'ust kick him out.

526
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,080
How does that make us
different from Do-Chul?

527
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,287
Fuck.

528
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:35,694
Yeah, l'm an ignorant pig.
You' re happy?

529
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,695
Bastard!

530
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,800
So you'll beat him to death too?

531
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,200
Shut up and butt out.

532
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,808
All right.
Do what you gotta do.

533
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,584
It was because of my mom.

534
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:07,889
I dropped by my house
just in case.

535
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,996
My family's come back.

536
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,095
My younger brothers
are starving

537
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,902
and my mom has a lung disease.
What was I supposed to do?

538
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,472
I feel really bad
about you guys.

539
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,480
But I had no choice.

540
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,983
Shut your trap, you fuck!

541
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,984
You go and betray us?

542
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,180
Don't hit him.

543
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,985
He said it was for his mom.

544
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,991
Don't hit him.

545
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,400
Shit!

546
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,304
Get lost.

547
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,778
You're letting me live?

548
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,881
Go back to your family, you fuck!

549
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,482
Thanks, Jong-Du.

550
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,676
They're depressed because
of Duk-Bae.

551
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,385
They're not talking
but they envy him.

552
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,695
You too?

553
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,094
I got no one to go back to.

554
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,795
My dad...

555
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,799
used to make western biscuits.

556
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:06,582
After the store got bombed,
I went after the U.S. soldiers.

557
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,985
I became a refugee
on my own.

558
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,488
I kept going to school.

559
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:19,389
But I dropped out
when I came to Seoul.

560
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:28,896
Then if this works out,
you go back to school?

561
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,908
I gave that up long ago.

562
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:38,278
I got a much better plan.

563
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,778
Wait and see.

564
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,678
I'll make money like crazy.

565
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,990
I'll build a market bigger than
Mangi Market.

566
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:56,598
Then nobody will look down
on us.

567
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:01,295
No. They' ll be
bowing to us instead.

568
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,605
That sounds good.

569
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:31,089
There used to be a stream
outside our house too.

570
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,502
I went with my sisters
at night.

571
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,700
We washed our hair
and took baths.

572
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,974
After I became alone,

573
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:53,583
I cut my hair like a boy.

574
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,891
Some girls who worked
on the U.S. base

575
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,195
said I looked real bad
for a girl.

576
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:09,396
They tried to keep me there.

577
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,005
But I took off.

578
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,273
It was suffocating.

579
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,386
But,

580
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,190
I won't have to do that now.

581
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,299
Give me a drink.

582
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,687
What do I have to do
to be tough like you?

583
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,987
What?

584
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,291
I saw you fight.

585
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,488
I want to be strong like you.

586
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,694
So you want to be a thug.

587
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,106
Anything's fine.

588
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,306
I don't want to rely on anyone.

589
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,573
I want to be strong by myself.

590
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,483
Like you.

591
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,672
You know why this is great?

592
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:21,286
It looks like it'll go out,
but it never goes out.

593
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,296
That's what being strong is.

594
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:37,898
I don't live like this
'cuz l'm strong.

595
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:46,070
I'm just hanging on
because I got no choice.

596
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:54,388
I thought you were the toughest man
I ever saw.

597
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,186
Toughest man.

598
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,693
Kid!

599
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,004
You listen to me.

600
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,805
You think
there's such a thing?

601
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,179
No way.

602
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,977
The tough, the weak, the cowards

603
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,181
all end up dying.

604
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,290
That's why
this world is fucked up.

605
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,293
You get it?

606
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,302
You don't know either.

607
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,677
You don't know,
do you?

608
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,800
Run.

609
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,609
Check our goods.

610
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,682
You're not practicing
the whip today?

611
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,282
Nope.

612
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,791
The market's unstable and
Do-Chul smells something's up.

613
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,596
I think we should pack up.

614
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,696
If you say so.

615
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,999
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

616
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,304
Just hang on a bit longer.

617
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:55,906
And then?

618
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:57,772
Huh?

619
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:03,579
What happens
after we sell off the rice?

620
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,580
I'll split the money with the kids
like I promised.

621
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,590
You round them up
when you need them

622
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,994
and spit them out
when you' re done?

623
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,300
How can you say that?

624
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,510
Who says l'll do that?

625
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,675
- l'll make sure they get paid...
- Money, money, money!

626
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,577
Fuck it.

627
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,476
All you think about is money?

628
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,588
That's all?

629
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,492
You listen.

630
01:02:55,037 --> 01:03:00,498
Jobs and a full stomach
is a lot in these times.

631
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,672
We're in no position
to look after anyone else.

632
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,282
They have to find
their own way.

633
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:23,797
Soon-Nam's gonna go with you?

634
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,196
Kids

635
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,104
Wrap it up
and come to the office.

636
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,801
Let's go.

637
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,882
- Is it weird?
- Wow.

638
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:56,294
I j'ust tried it on because
the laundry's still wet.

639
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,196
You' re so pretty
like an angel!

640
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,797
You're such a sweet-talker.

641
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,083
T ake this.

642
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:23,481
- Pass it back.
- Take whatever you fancy.

643
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,393
Take one each.

644
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,296
Jong-Du...

645
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,398
- Anyone not get one?
- Line up.

646
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,995
Who are we?

647
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:41,003
We went out on the battlefield,

648
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,475
crushed the commie bastards
and came back alive.

649
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,082
We' re mighty warriors.

650
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,184
- Yeah!
- That's right!

651
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,188
Commie bastards
who attacked us

652
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:57,383
couldn't get anywhere
near killing us.

653
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,585
- That's right.
- Yeah.

654
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,287
That's how tough we are.

655
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,695
If we lose our lives now,

656
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,302
if we lose our livelihood,

657
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:13,907
then that's worse than dying
at their guns.

658
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:17,376
- Yeah!
- Let's fight!

659
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,384
- Go on.
- Sis.

660
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,385
- Go on!
- What's wrong?

661
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,291
The heads of those running away

662
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:39,495
Iook much bigger than
commie bastards coming at you.

663
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,504
One shot for one bastard.

664
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:50,272
Fight like hell if you don't want
a hole in your head.

665
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,678
- Got that?
- Yes!

666
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:57,684
- Let's fight!
- Fight!

667
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:03,885
Hello, Boss.

668
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,690
You bring kids
to a territory fight?

669
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,494
Since when were you so low?

670
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,901
I called them.

671
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,803
If we have more people...

672
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,510
Are you okay?

673
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:23,677
Off!

674
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,279
Go home.

675
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,082
You shouldn't be here.

676
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:41,096
- I can fight.
- I said go home!

677
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:53,802
Don't make me tell you twice.
Send them home.

678
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,284
Go on.

679
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:04,269
- What is it?
- Soon-Nam...

680
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,781
- Soon-Nam.
- Stay back.

681
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,187
What's wrong?

682
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,084
I have a guestion.

683
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,995
Where's the rice?

684
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,592
What?

685
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,495
I was supposed to watch it.

686
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,001
Why isn't it there?

687
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:37,269
I moved it next door
after Duk-Bae left.

688
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,977
What is it?

689
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,683
Don't!

690
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,387
Who was it?

691
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:53,986
Who did this?

692
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,395
What bastard did it?

693
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:04,099
Duk-Bae.
I'm sure of it.

694
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,805
But he went home...

695
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:10,776
Who else knows
about the rice here?

696
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:15,179
He used to hang out
with some tramps.

697
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,376
It must have been them.

698
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,287
Let's go.

699
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,605
There was no rice
like he said

700
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:47,676
but at least
I got me some pussy.

701
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:52,883
She was so wild she bit me.

702
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,683
She hurt me.

703
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,485
You bastards!

704
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,701
Bastards!

705
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:27,982
Duk-Bae!

706
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,795
Fuckers!

707
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,691
Bastards!

708
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,703
Tae-Ho, no!

709
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,975
Tae-Ho!

710
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,877
Tae-Ho!

711
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,081
Don't come closer!

712
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,181
Forget about it.

713
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,781
Duk-Bae started it.

714
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:19,485
Let's go see Mister JANG

715
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,493
and tell him
we'll sell all the rice.

716
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:27,794
We have so much
and that's the best thing.

717
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:32,598
- What about the market?
- We guit.

718
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,104
If we disappear suddenly,
they'll get suspicious.

719
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,374
We'll say
we're going to see relatives.

720
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,783
Listen up.

721
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,081
Just hold up for a few days.

722
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:50,981
Don't think of going anywhere.

723
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:53,990
Bring the rice.

724
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,684
He's just having a hard time.

725
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,191
He'll be all right soon.

726
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,395
He's a smart one.

727
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:39,797
We haven't slept outside
in a while.

728
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,204
Let's feed them well.

729
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,174
What happened?

730
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:35,491
What's the use of having
a strong fist and fast feet?

731
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:43,500
You can't fight a bullet.

732
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:53,078
He killed our boss.
He deserves to die.

733
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,178
He deserves to die.

734
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,888
How could he do this?

735
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,989
He deserves to die.

736
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,783
Some party last night.

737
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:42,595
I thought the tramps were
talking nonsense.

738
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,493
I' ll make this short.

739
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:54,698
Bring all the money you made
on the side and the rice.

740
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:03,283
Now that Myung-Soo's gone,
no ones got your back.

741
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,688
Like I said before...

742
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,183
Run!

743
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,092
The bastards!

744
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,682
What the hell?

745
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,589
Get some woods.

746
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:49,994
Everything will be fine
if we sell off all the rice.

747
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,298
That's a lot of money,
even for adults.

748
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,101
With that money

749
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,300
they can all go live anywhere.

750
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:06,274
You think they can go anywhere
just 'cuz they have money?

751
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,977
What if Do-Chul finds them?

752
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,177
It's the same
if they're with us.

753
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:18,586
It might be more dangerous
to be with us.

754
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:24,297
No way l'm sending them off
like this.

755
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,698
Jong-Du! Tae-Ho!
It's ready!

756
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:29,999
Okay!

757
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,077
So warm.

758
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,272
Chicken! Chicken!

759
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:47,179
I' ll eat noodles every day.

760
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:48,687
Me too.

761
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:53,989
I'm gonna buy shiny boots
like the American MPs wear.

762
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:56,188
Wow! Me too!

763
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,196
- Copy cat.
- What!

764
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,796
Then are we splitting up?

765
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,903
Idiot!
Why would we split up?

766
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,773
Stop talking nonsense.

767
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,274
Jae-Gook!
There's liguor in my backpack.

768
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,577
Go get it.

769
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,382
Liguor? Liguor?

770
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,786
- Gi-Dong, pour me some.
- Okay!

771
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:38,699
Here.

772
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,684
Yeah!

773
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:53,076
Let's see.
17kg, 15kg, 14kg...

774
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,983
Are you gonna take all day?

775
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,482
I' m calculating.

776
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,384
I forgot where I was.
Little prick.

777
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,790
Let's count this.

778
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,793
Hey, it's a puppy!

779
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:16,498
48, 49, 50

780
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:19,903
51, 52, 53

781
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,010
54, 55...

782
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:30,473
- 57, 58
- 52, 53

783
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,587
58 Damn! 58.

784
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,594
Where's Gi-Dong?

785
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:44,792
He was here j'ust now.

786
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:53,906
Gi-Dong's disappeared!
I can't find him anywhere.

787
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,079
Split up and look.

788
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,878
- Gi-Dong!
- Gi-Dong!

789
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,177
- Be careful!
- Gi-Dong!

790
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,376
Gi-Dong!

791
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,679
Gi-Dong!

792
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:14,491
The lowlifes in the market.

793
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:19,596
You shouldn't have taken him
around with you.

794
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,303
It's a good thing
we got all the money.

795
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:27,899
I was worried about it
so I got it all at once.

796
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:30,270
Give me all of it.

797
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,579
What do you mean?

798
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,380
You don't get it?

799
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,182
We' ll use it
to get Gi-Dong back.

800
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,187
Isn't it obvious?

801
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,491
What are you gonna do?

802
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:55,396
You think Do-Chul will let him go
if he gets the money?

803
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,297
So you' re giving up Gi-Dong?

804
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,399
Shut up!

805
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,874
Gi-Dong's got nothing
to do with us.

806
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:12,778
You really wanna die?

807
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:17,483
You can beat me to death
but I can't do that!

808
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:18,988
You son of bitch!

809
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:37,271
Gi-Dong is one of us!

810
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:41,874
Bastard,
Gi-Dong isn't the only one.

811
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,680
We do what you say
and we all die.

812
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,479
I know!

813
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,883
Jong-Du

814
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,086
I know where Gi-Dong is.

815
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:06,506
We get our family even if
we get beat up trying.

816
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,880
Don't go.

817
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:15,475
Let's go.

818
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:32,992
I hope you get your wish.

819
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,982
Gi-Dong!

820
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,889
- Be on the lookout.
- Okay.

821
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,300
Gi-Dong! Gi-Dong!

822
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,302
Gi-Dong! Gi-Dong!

823
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:21,774
Hey, they wanted to know
where you were.

824
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,676
Didn't tell them.

825
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,281
Gi-Dong, you' re a real man.

826
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:32,484
It's okay now.

827
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,293
Let's go home now.

828
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,393
Bro!

829
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:12,797
You came?

830
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,804
I didn't think
you'd really come.

831
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:18,901
Stop!

832
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,606
I' m the one you want dead.

833
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:25,172
Do what you want with me
but let them go.

834
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,073
Why are you so upset?

835
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:34,482
After I saved your life and all.

836
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:39,382
We have a history, right?

837
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,188
Fuck that.

838
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,997
I know you' re a coward!

839
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:49,996
You shot Myung-Soo in the back
because you couldn't beat him!

840
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,568
Don't play dumb.

841
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:01,771
The whole world knows.

842
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,785
You got some balls.

843
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:12,587
Bring it on, you fuck.

844
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,199
If that's what you want,

845
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,694
I'll skin you alive.

846
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,768
Don't. You' ll lose.

847
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:34,670
He won't let you go
even if you win.

848
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:36,078
So don't.

849
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:47,493
Look kid,
the world's a tough place.

850
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:23,794
Jong-Du!

851
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:47,581
Come here.

852
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,086
You want to fight, you fuck?

853
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,992
Get up!

854
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:01,993
Get up, you fuck.

855
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,707
Get up, you bastard.

856
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,876
You piece of shit.

857
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,778
Damn it.

858
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,702
Who's this?

859
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,800
I thought you'd split
since you' re smarter.

860
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,877
What's wrong with all of you?

861
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,085
This is everything we earned.

862
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,179
I brought all of it
like you said.

863
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,889
This is what you wanted.

864
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:02,091
Take it and let my family go.

865
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:10,695
You got brains
and you don't get it?

866
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,107
You're not getting out of here.

867
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:18,778
Try it.
I'm not dying alone.

868
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:24,984
I'm disappointed.
I thought you were different.

869
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,682
Your brains shouldn't
go to waste.

870
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,692
It's still not too late.

871
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:33,987
How about working for me?

872
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,992
Fuck you!

873
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:43,901
Fuckers!

874
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,192
Stop!

875
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:09,487
Stop it!

876
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:31,883
That's enough.

877
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:41,286
You kids.

878
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,398
Never show your face here again!

879
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,699
Ever!

880
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:52,899
- Let's go.
- Boss!

881
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,004
What?

882
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:06,386
Tae-Ho.

883
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:07,883
Tae-Ho.

884
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,495
Stupid fuck.

885
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,796
Why'd you come?

886
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,996
Why'd you come, you fuck!

887
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,577
If I hadn't,
you'd have all died.

888
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:50,323
Tae-Ho.

889
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:56,796
Tae-Ho.

890
01:32:58,139 --> 01:32:59,401
Tae-Ho!

891
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:01,806
Open your eyes, you fuck!

892
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:07,173
Tae-Ho! Don't die!

893
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:21,885
It's weird
sleeping outdoors again.

894
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:24,891
Yeah.

895
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:30,295
Doesn't this remind you of
when we were in the camps?

896
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:33,901
Shit! Don't talk like that.

897
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,606
Just thinking about it sucks.

898
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:41,278
Me too.

899
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:49,983
I'm sure I can pull it off.

900
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:55,587
But what if it goes wrong?

901
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:03,795
Then our efforts are for nothing.

902
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:09,967
Then we do another raid...

903
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:16,681
But this time,
I'm taking off first.

904
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:19,479
You stay behind
and get beat up.
