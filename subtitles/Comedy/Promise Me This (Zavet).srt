Waiting, waiting..

To kill my wife and get you.

90
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,631
If you think about my ex-boyfriend,

Wanna fight ?

00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,971
Stop with that!

111
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,179
You want me to call police.

112
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,428

They just spread legs...and nothing.

00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,692
There is no communication.

176
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,831
Just without latz of blood,

177
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:47,913
I know, I know.

of my son.

198
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,360
My son is first to bild the twin towers

199
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:53,388

There was discount also.

285
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,747

That압 not testament.

291
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:44,696
Did you hear Tomic today?

292
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:47,675

293
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,649

How did you run away?

304
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,153
I jumped through the window.

305
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,112
Does Jasna know something?

306
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,120
No, she  doesn't.

307
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:54,821
Good, you didn't see or heard
something.

308
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:56,722
Didn't see, didn't heard.

309
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,281
Why is bell ringing?

310
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:24,705

311
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:26,806
What priest, call my Cane!

312
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:29,953
I will die when I want.

313
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:32,611
Priest is not only
for funerals.

314
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:33,912
Stop it now!

315
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,553
And that dress with flowers?

316
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,890
What I'm keeping.

317
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,541
If there is god's will,

318
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,542
You are not keeping her
for nothing.

319
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:05,461
<i>Kid, go out, don't disturb the class.</i>

320
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,203
I'll kill you.

321
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,420
<i>Go kid, or i lead you out!</i>

322
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:50,313
Here, its finished.

323
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,790
Watch the edges, its fresh.

324
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,959
Jasna, we need to go.

325

332
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:06,798
You didn't fill testament.

333
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,199
You should buy souvenir also.

334

335
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,501
Go in the town,

Buy something nice
and pretty.

You have money.

338
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,659

Your mom is in big debt Jasna.

346
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:29,309
You in debt to man with grey
moustache.

00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:33,713
We don't need your money.

351
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:35,826

Who's gonna demolish pyramides?

356
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,048
That's old theme leave that.

357
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,750
Like americans, whatever
is in the way of oil.

358
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:56,551
They just sign paper,
and say goodbye pyramides.

359
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,752
If something's on the way

360
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:00,454

00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:40,688
You need to ask the girl,
what does she want.

378
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:45,094
Must be, it압 testament.

When my mom is speaking,

398
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:24,875
When mom is speaking,

00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:26,851
Silence,or?

400

401
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,243

00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:58,779
Do we have any weapon?

418
00:32:58,815 --> 00:32:59,915
Nothing.

419
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:10,898
If any special request from the customer,

420
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,190
you decide the price yourself.

421

And that's your money.

422
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,612
Money you take right after
comming in room.

423
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,606
And one more technical thing.

424

428
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:45,629
Probably.

429
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:48,021
Probably not.

430
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:51,698

00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,678
Running.

509
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:34,247
Shame on you.

510
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:38,262
Go away from the table.

511
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:41,734
Hey, kid...

512
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,750
Come to uncle Paja.

513
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,917
Come, come...

514
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:10,656
Fucking bastards!

515
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,013
Boss, what happend?

516
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:15,025

00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:17,426
Take me out, fucking

518
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:19,327
Do something!

519
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,610
Should we kill you now?

520
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:34,236
It압 hurting me,
my love.

521
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:37,305
Stop it, stop!

522
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:39,453
I know what to do.

523
00:41:39,454 --> 00:41:40,454
Well done my boy.

524
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:42,655
I can see you are good man.

525
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:47,445
My love, with us Serbs, only
people is still good.

526
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:51,628
Is that my boss hanging?

527
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:53,958
Maybe you see wrong.

528
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:57,319
Hey man, are you dead?

529
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:08,055
Kid, only you will get amnesty.

530
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,460
And you three...so fucked...

531
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:17,327
Brother, he's so cold.

532
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:25,602
Little oxygen...

533
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,538
I wanna kill him!

534
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:09,259
Not on the head!

535
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:13,688
You wanna let him go.

536
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:15,882
No, no i don't wanna sin.

537
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:25,547
Instead of giving us 50%,
you wanna kill us all or?

538
00:43:25,148 --> 00:43:29,048
No, no if I'm in debt,
we can sort that out.

539
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:32,301
We can go on court,
old serbian tradition.

540
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,044
Why did you kick my
brother in the head.

541
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:40,045
I want money!

542
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:41,846
I don't have money.

543
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:43,964
What is this?

544
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:46,903
You are so rough...

545
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:50,846
And what you gonna do
with him?

546
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,011
We kill him.

547
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:54,389
Suddenly..

548
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:55,679
No, no.

549
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,680
We will not kill him.

550
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,950
We will castrate him.

551
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:06,152
Leave that tangs,
I have heavy hand.

552
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:07,757
Don앖 worry my hand is easy.

553
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,758
Like my grandpa.

554
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:50,763
Tangs please...

555
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:32,494
I forgot a icon.

556
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:34,454
You didn't, it's here.

557
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:45,239
Now I have everything.

558
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:48,568
You don't have a souvenir.

559
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:50,723
Don't kiss me for the souvenir.

560
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:51,724
So how?

561
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,373
Kiss me for the life.

562
00:45:53,374 --> 00:45:56,374
If there is no life, then
for a souvenir.

563
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:09,464
So...

564
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:12,777
What now?

565
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:14,192
Why are you asking me?

566
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,479
Why not?

567
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,906
You know for klamps,
ask stepbrother.

568
00:46:19,703 --> 00:46:20,703
You ask.

569
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:21,704
Me?

570
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:24,166
I앐 driving.

571
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:44,124
Stebrother, where is your village?

572
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,291
What village?

573
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,176
What did he said?

574
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:55,516
I didn앖 ask him?

575
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,625
Why?

576
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,027
They been speaking something.

577
00:46:58,599 --> 00:46:59,399
Don앖 shake!

578
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:00,394
I앐 not shaking.

579
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:04,084
Stepbrother is speaking
really fast.

580
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:15,578
Oh my good friend...

581
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:18,738
Poor friend...

582
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:38,850
Binocular.

583
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:48,319
Church bell!

584
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:51,087
What bell?

585
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:53,508
Is not good...

586
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:57,147
Stepbrother, bell is ringing!

587
00:47:58,854 --> 00:48:00,454
It's ringing in your head...

588
00:48:02,058 --> 00:48:03,058
It's over stepbrother.

589
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:05,112
Grandpa!

590
00:48:06,211 --> 00:48:07,811
It's really ringing.

591
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:08,812
The church bell!

592
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:13,879
Kid!

593
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Grandpa!

594
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:17,915
Grandpa...

595
00:48:18,052 --> 00:48:19,052
I knew it ...it's all over now.

596
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:21,325
What is over?

597
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:23,465
What is he yelling?

598
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:25,566
He said it's over.

599
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:28,275
Grandpa is dead.

600
00:48:28,276 --> 00:48:29,276
What?

601
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:30,277
When someone dies, its ringing once...

602
00:48:30,278 --> 00:48:31,778
To call all people.

603
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
It's not like that.

604
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:35,949
It was same with grandma...

605
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:36,950
That's wedding.

606
00:48:36,951 --> 00:48:37,952
Wait, wait...

607
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,220
Wedding!

608
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,319
Not so loud.

609
00:48:44,398 --> 00:48:46,098
Probably that guy is marrying  Bosa.

610
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,799
No he's not.

611
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:15,363
Grandpa!

612
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,134
What are you doing?

613
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:33,774
Leave the dead people
in peace.

614
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,067
Grandpa.

615
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:42,609
My grandpa...

616
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,311
We are grandson's from
Trifun.

617
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:46,312
We bring you your grandson.

618
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,788
My Cane!

619
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,867
Didn't I tell you that he will come?

620
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:01,425
I bought a icon.

621
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,770
Did you bring the wife?

622
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:17,826
Jasna Nikolic.

623
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:25,677
Let me see you.

624
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:27,669
Beautiful, beautiful...

625
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,448
People! Are you crazy!

626
00:50:38,428 --> 00:50:39,428
We have funeral here.

627
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:41,329
What we gonna do with dead man?

628
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:46,725
Man is dead, he will start to smell now!

629
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:47,726
One second...

630
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:49,227
God can't wait.

631
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:50,228
Yes he can.

632
00:50:52,095 --> 00:50:53,095
Everything will be allright.

633
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:55,526
Hey boldie, who are you?

634
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:56,627
Who are you to stop the funeral?

635
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,520
Do you know that funeral
has advantage on the road.

636
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:00,789
Who the fuck are you?

637
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,050
Should I shoot them all?

638
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:30,724
No, no ...

639
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:36,906
I do it myself.

640
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:37,907
One by one.

641
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:51,183
What's this boss?

642
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:56,292
Shoot a little, to scare them.

643
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,561
Run, run...

644
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:08,823
What's this Cane?

645
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:10,717
Criminals are chasing us.

646
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:11,125
Criminals...

647
00:52:12,117 --> 00:52:13,117
For me look's like fascist.

648
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:15,311
Third world war.

649
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:17,462
Second one is not over yet.

650
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:22,122
What will be...

651
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:28,410
My friend, this smells
like provocation in large scales.

652
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:31,749
I think this is only
small incident.

653
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,549
You said the same when
Hitler atacked Poland.

654
00:52:36,913 --> 00:52:39,813
Hitler has attacked Poland
because of hate,

655
00:52:39,814 --> 00:52:41,914
and today's force is gracefull,

656
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
she kills from love.

657
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:45,281
No, no not like this...

658
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:48,649
This is not the old war, don't...

659
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:51,576
No, please this is my wedding.

660
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,909
Woman and children in church, hurry!

661
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:02,493
Music , play!

662
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,390
You two, go in the church!

663
00:53:06,293 --> 00:53:07,293
Grandpa, I앐 not the child anymore.

664
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:08,294
Do you wanna marry?

665
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:09,761
I didn't ask her.

666
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:10,296
We will ask her.

667
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:12,397
Friend, bells!

668
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,498
Please, because couple bullets
we gonna ruin the wedding.

669
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,510
People, what are you doing?

670
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,870
Where are you going grandpa?

671
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,160
Friend order me to ring the bells.

672
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,771
Why the bell is ringing?

673
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,672
It's good that it's ringing twice,
then people are happy...

674
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:31,774
Sound's like it's ringing three times.

675
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,803
It's all about how they ring.

676
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:39,177
They can ring five times,
nine times,

677
00:54:40,516 --> 00:54:41,916
just not once.

678
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,360
Bells is ringing for us.

679
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,843
Priest, remember where did you stop.

680
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:12,777
I'm just gonna finish something.

681
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:17,142
He's coming, don't worry...

682
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,890
People are you gonna fuck around,
or get married!

683
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,138
Boss...

684
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,639
Wild pig...

685
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,840
Run!

686
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:14,582
Now...

687
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,583
He is here!

688
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:44,606
Do you Zivojin, take Bosa for your wife?

689
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:46,573
Yes!

690
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:51,974
Do you Bosa, take Zivojin
for you husband?

691
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:54,215
Yes!

692
00:56:57,852 --> 00:57:00,352
I pronounce you married.

693
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:04,088
In the name of father, son,
and the holy ghost.

694
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:05,089
Amen.

695
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:22,699
Fucking bastards!

696
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,700
Stupid farmers!

697
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:22,795
I pronounce you man and wife.

698
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,523
Angel!

699
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:45,011
Does anyone know results
from Italian league?

700
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:52,712
All this smells like big provocation...

701
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,500
THE END
