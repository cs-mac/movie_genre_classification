1
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,937
– Oh, this is awesome!
– Oh my God!

2
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:31,734
Oh my God!
This is crazy!

3
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,658
Oh my God. So incredible.

4
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,666
– You wanna know a secret?
– Yeah!

5
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:36,891
– I took a Viagra.
– What?

6
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,265
This is awesome.
Why don’t I use this every day?

7
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:40,621
What did you do?

8
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:41,562
– Wait. Stop.
– I can’t!

9
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:42,534
Stop, stop!

10
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,663
Stop!
– What?

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:44,865
Aah!

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,090
What’s the matter?

13
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:49,502
What’s the matter?

14
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,080
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

15
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:53,955
Well, I- I- I thought it
would make it better.

16
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:55,978
It was better. It takes
some of the pressure off.

17
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,734
Because you can’t get
hard without a Viagra?

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,460
Is it because you don’t I’m think sexy?

19
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:04,212
I thought you’d think it was fun
for me to supersize it for once.

20
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,478
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,433
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

22
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:13,493
My hard-ons are still in analog.

23
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,689
This shit’s digital.

24
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,023
I don’t want a turbo penis.

25
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,708
I like your medium soft one.

26
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:21,848
Look, I can get it up. Just…

27
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,575
not that far up.

28
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,223
Where did you get this?

29
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,575
I got it from Barry.

30
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:27,940
What?

31
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,933
You got it from Barry?

32
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:33,644
Why do you care? This is my
dick we’re talking about, not yours.

33
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,098
We are young people.

34
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:37,504
We don’t need medication to have sex.

35
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,708
I only took it ’cause it’s your birthday.

36
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:42,504
I thought you’d like it.
Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

37
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:44,436
I am not forty!

38
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:48,366
And I don’t wanna have a husband
who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on!

39
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:50,676
I don’t have to take it every
time, but once in a while…

40
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,854
Fuck forty!
Forty can suck my dick!

41
00:01:55,683 --> 00:02:00,977
THIS IS FORTY

♪Happy birthday to you.

51
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,216
Make a wish!

52
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,969
Can I watch Lost?

53
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,838
You can’t handle Lost.

54
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,502
It’s too violent, and
you won’t understand.

55
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:55,556
If I don’t understand it,
why can’t I handle it?

56
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:56,579
Because you’re eight.

57
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,333
I can handle it. I’ve seen a shark
eat a guy on Shark Week.

58
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,630
Shark Week is fake.

59
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,114
No, it’s not.

60
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,948
All of it is reenactments.

61
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,522
– I know but they sh--
– And that’s scary,

62
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,238
you shouldn’t be allowed to watch that.

63
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:12,581
They show the reenactments
but they actually happened.

64
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,349
It’s gonna give you nightmares.

65
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,858
I can handle a nightmare.
You’re a nightmare every day for me.

66
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,289
Hey!

67
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,266
– Don’t eat that cupcake.
– What?

68
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,504
The one you just put into the sink.

69
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,406
I saw you were hiding that.

70
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:31,389
This cupcake? You think
I might eat this cupcake?

71
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,240
– Yeah.
– I so don’t want this cupcake. Look.

72
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,170
– You’re still gonna eat it.
– I’m gonna eat this cupcake?

73
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,394
Just put it in the trash.

74
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,676
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

75
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,105
– Anything?
– Yeah, anything.

76
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:43,102
Just hang out with you guys.

77
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,133
Don’t you want to get a massage? Or…

78
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:48,368
do something fun, it’s a bit--
Forty’s huge!

79
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,478
I’m turning thirty-eight.

80
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,033
Okay. Thirty-eight.

81
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,654
We will move on.

82
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,147
Isn’t that weird that
our birthday is the same week

83
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,288
and that we’re gonna have
a party, and it’s just for me?

84
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,019
No. I don’t think it’s weird at all.

85
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,386
’Cause you’re turning forty
and I’m turning thirty-eight.

86
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:04,819
Come on. Do you really want to be one
of those ladies who’s just so insecure

87
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:08,662
about their age and they lie and then
they’ve got to remember, and it gets all--

88
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:12,239
You don’t get it. See, you don’t
understand how it works.

89
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,606
I don’t want to shop at old lady stores.

90
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,408
I don’t want to go to J. Jill and
Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft.

91
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,002
I’m not ready yet.

92
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:21,455
I need two more years.

93
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,901
That is so insane,
it kind of makes sense.

94
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:26,712
What did you get me for my birthday?

95
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,799
Wait a minute, I thought you said that we
shouldn’t get each other gifts this year?

96
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,349
What do you mean?

97
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,521
You’re supposed to get me a surprise gift.

98
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,159
This is a big birthday.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,552
I’m turning forty!

100
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,313
Mom!!

101
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,787
Mom, why can’t I get new clothes?!

102
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:49,887
What the fuck, nothing fits me!!

103
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,637
God damn it!!

104
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,916
I am gonna go work out.
I’ll be back in about an hour.

105
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:58,226
Hey, did your father call
to wish you a happy birthday?

106
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:00,061
No. That’s no surprise.

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,985
– Come on.
– Coming.

108
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,304
You’ve gotta keep up
with us, sweetheart.

109
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,086
Yeah, I’m coming.

110
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,359
That’s why your body looks like your
body and her body looks like her body.

111
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,993
Before, after. Before, after.

112
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:30,646
You guys just go on, go on
without me, I’m just gonna…

113
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,112
Look, I gotta…

114
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,706
Fuck.

115
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,965
Thanks for uh…

116
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,644
Thanks for letting me join this team.

117
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:43,979
It’s not really a team, it’s just a bunch
of guys who get together and ride.

118
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:44,931
I know, I know.

119
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:45,994
Wow wow wow wow!

120
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,384
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

121
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,053
It’s always the guy
in the fucking Infiniti.

122
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:55,511
Good seater. Get’em take here.

123
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,589
– Yeah. Okay.
– This we need to work on.

124
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,421
So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra?

125
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:01,241
What’s going on?
– I don’t know.

126
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:05,436
I think he just-- maybe he isn’t…
isn’t attracted to me anymore…

127
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,529
or something.
I don’t know.

128
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,841
Well that is ridiculous.

129
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,250
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

130
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:14,101
I would need an anti-Viagra pill.

131
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,341
To try not to get a boner.

132
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,362
But everyone gives you a boner.

133
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,315
Don’t sell yourself short like that.

134
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,925
You give me a boner.

135
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:23,714
Barb doesn’t give me a boner.

136
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:26,613
Maybe things are just getting stale.

137
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:29,472
That’s why maybe I work out really hard.

138
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,847
Maybe he’ll get…
he’ll be able to get a boner again.

139
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,213
Why d'you need to have sex, Deb?

140
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,669
Sex is the number one
thing people fight about.

141
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,910
You stop having
sex, there will be no more fights.

142
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,682
I am living proof.

143
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,924
I have no sex,

144
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,682
and I am the happiest I’ve ever been.

145
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:49,580
I knew it. I knew you were not having sex.

146
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,404
I can see it on your face.
It’s all…

147
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,760
uh, puckered and pained.

148
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,242
I’m enjoying our non-sex period,
that’s all I’m saying.

149
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:58,293
Don’t you miss it?

150
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,639
Well, I wouldn’t know, because I don’t
have any feeling down there anymore.

151
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:03,657
I have nerve damage from my C-section,
so everything's just kinda-

152
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,467
She’s numb down there.

153
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:09,830
I could sit down hard
on a fire hydrant, and

154
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:12,801
I wouldn’t even know that I was sitting.

155
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:15,606
I could get stung by a hornet
down there, and I would not feel it.

156
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,402
You could put anything…

157
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:19,488
in there…

158
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,074
and I would not know
what the object was.

159
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:25,447
I- I used to pee in a nice stream,
and now it just kind of goes

160
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:26,815
like a shower head.

161
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,489
That is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.

162
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,520
I think you need a family.

163
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,194
Don’t you want a family?

164
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,239
No, I think I wanna Clooney it.

165
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,831
– Clooney it?
– Yup.

166
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,495
He doesn’t seem happy.

167
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,605
Yeah, he is.

168
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,433
No. He’s lonely.

169
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:41,642
No, he’s not.

170
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,243
See, I think he has sad eyes.

171
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,056
Aw, you sweet little thing.

172
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,677
No. He’s doing sad, lonely eyes.

173
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:51,979
To get the next lady.
Look, I can do it too. Watch.

174
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,281
I bet George Clooney is really lonely.

175
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,672
Just him and his… pig.

176
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,555
You’d fuck him.

177
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,437
I wouldn’t.

178
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,502
– So would you.
– I would. I wouldn’t feel it but I-

179
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,679
You’d fuck him with your numb vagina.
Yes you would.

180
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:08,013
Ocean’s thirteen inches,
that’s what you’d find out.

181
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,066
Do you think?

182
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,922
I mean that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

183
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,813
I mean, that’s like the one thing you
don’t do is tell her that you used Viagra.

184
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:18,773
I think that’s even on the warning label.

185
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,562
We’re in one of those phases where…

186
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:26,021
everything that the other person says
just annoys the shit out of each other.

187
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,240
All the time. It’s a blast.

188
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,563
Don’t worry about it.
You just gotta ride that out.

189
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:32,343
This sounds terrible…

190
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,054
Okay. I like it.

191
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,124
.. but…

192
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,129
do you ever wonder
what it would be like…

193
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:42,795
if, say, you were separated by
something bigger, you know, like uh…

194
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:45,357
like death. Like her death?

195
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:48,614
I have given it a fair amount of thought.

196
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,502
Not in a painful way. Just…

197
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:54,719
quietly slid into death, like a gas leak.

198
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,365
Absolutely. It’s got to be peaceful.

199
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:58,536
I mean, this is the
mother of your children.

200
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,043
You want her to die…

201
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,538
– No, I’d want it to be a peaceful--
– gentle…

202
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:06,986
yeah, just like, drift, into a coma,
from which she never awakens.

203
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,284
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

204
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:11,261
That’s just it.
People love widowers.

205
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,285
They love widowers. It’s like
the polar opposite of divorced guys.

206
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:14,993
It’s the best.

207
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,186
It’s like, oh, that poor widower!

208
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:19,186
You know. If I could only…

209
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,757
– Somehow… somehow…
– .. make him happy.

210
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,906
– ease his pain. 
– cocksuck away his sadness.

214
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,371
Did you know that this uh--
Pixies did this song,

215
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,793
it’s about a Salvador Dali short film
called “Un Chien Andalusia”?

216
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,892
This music doesn’t make people happy--

217
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,507
This song kicks off Doolittle,
one of the best albums

218
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,890
of the last thirty years.
– Look how angry you get

219
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:48,765
while listening to this.
– An important record.

220
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:51,968
It’s my birthday. You don’t control
the radio on my birthday.

221
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,501
I do. I control the radio on my birthday.

Sadie’s watching Lost.

226
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,879
Sadie, how many times have
you watched Lost this week?

227
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,165
I’ve only watched eleven.

228
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:17,238
I- but I have eight more,
and then I’m done, so…

229
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,316
How many are there?

230
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,400
A hundred and fourteen?

231
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,062
Are you kidding me? You can’t watch over
a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks.

232
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:25,156
– No.
– It- It’ll melt your brain.

233
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,378
It’s not melting my brain,
it’s blowing my mind.

234
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,331
That’s really bad, Sadie.

235
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:31,948
You’re not allowed to do that.

236
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,714
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

237
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:37,190
It’s extremely personal.

238
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,181
Stop!

239
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,501
Stop it!
– Be nice to your sister.

240
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,938
You guys are gonna
cherish each other one day.

241
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,836
Stop it! Stop!

242
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:49,916
Honey, it’s your birthday,
you don’t need to go to the store.

243
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,197
I know, just five minutes.

244
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,080
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,924
All right, five minutes.
But then I’m pulling you out.

246
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,060
Hi.

247
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:01,049
Hi. How’s Jodi treating you?

248
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,732
Jodi?

249
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:04,597
Oh, Jodi’s my new BFF.

250
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,581
She’s like a little kitty cat. Sometimes
she comes and rubs up against my leg.

251
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,659
And you’re a ball of shit.

252
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:12,508
She loves me.

253
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,825
Huh.

254
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,769
Can you do inventory so that
we can do the sidewalk sale?

255
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,172
And you really need to pay
attention to the numbers

256
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:27,922
’cause we get like twelve thousand
dollars unaccounted for.

257
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:30,418
I think it’s probably Desi.

258
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:33,562
She’s been having a really hard time
using these simple computers,

259
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,426
it’s because she’s stupid.

260
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,934
I think she might be stealing.

261
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:39,940
She’s not stealing.

262
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,073
She’s our best employee.
She made nine grand last month.

263
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,894
Well, how much did I make?

264
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,466
You brought in twenty-two hundred.

265
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:49,770
That’s not bad.

266
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,668
Well, that’s not that good.

267
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,267
I mean, I’m not comparing you, but…

268
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,236
you’re not as good.

269
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,224
All right. See you.

270
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,490
I don’t think she’s wearing underwear.

271
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,748
What?

272
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,042
It’s all dark up there.

273
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,913
What…? Why are you looking?

274
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,374
Oh I didn’t mean to look, I just--

275
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,214
It was just like I said, ‘Hey- woah!’

276
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:21,811
There it- there it was.

277
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,327
Well maybe she’s wearing dark underwear.

278
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:28,444
Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has
a picture of a vagina painted on it.

279
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,628
Stop looking.

280
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,400
Maybe some deep oranges and browns
and maybe dark greens?

281
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,228
That would really play up your features.

282
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:38,370
I’ll just take out my AmEx and
you pick what stuff you think is good.

283
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,308
Good job!

284
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:47,691
Where’s daddy?

285
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,269
I think he went to poop.

286
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,080
Pete!

287
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:54,072
Q 80. Suck on that bitch.

288
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:56,702
Hey!

289
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,960
What are you doing?

290
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,927
Uh, going to the bathroom.

291
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,558
We’re all downstairs waiting for you.

292
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,964
You’ve been up here
for a really long time now.

293
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,599
Oh, I’m almost done.
I’ll be down in a second.

294
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,951
Charlotte just did her first flip on the
trampoline, and she landed on her feet.

295
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,863
She was really proud of herself.

296
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,863
– Oh, that’s great!
– And you missed it.

297
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:20,286
She- she’ll do it again.

298
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,286
It’s just that this is the fourth
time you’ve gone to the bathroom today.

299
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,673
C’mon, give me a break.

300
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,267
Why is your instinct to escape?

301
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:28,938
It’s not my instinct to escape from you,

302
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,671
it is my instinct to come into the bathroom
when I need to go to the bathroom.

303
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,239
How come I don’t smell anything?

304
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,330
It’s because I shoved an Altoid up
my ass before I came in here, I mean--

305
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:38,536
Let me see then.

306
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:39,968
– What?
– Let me see!

307
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,303
No, I’m not gonna let you see.

308
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,804
You’re not gonna let me see
because you’re not taking a poop.

309
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,426
I’ve been flushing as I go!

310
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:46,874
You’re flushing as you go?!

311
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,218
Who takes a half hour
to go to the bathroom?

312
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:50,171
John Goodman.

313
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,319
Don’t press Enter! I’m not
sure I want to make that move!

314
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,191
Thank you.

315
00:14:58,914 --> 00:14:59,820
Wow.

316
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,753
You know, when I started this label,

317
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,737
my dream was to work
with musicians and bands

318
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,360
whose music I just admired so much.

319
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,464
The person that I thought, “My god,
wouldn’t it be incredible to work with”

320
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:11,975
was Graham Parker.

321
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,421
Tonight we have him.

322
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:18,810
Solo.

323
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:21,296
Because we couldn’t afford
to fly in The Rumour.

324
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:23,118
Graham Parker.

325
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,127
It’s just not my kind of music.

326
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,103
Really. What is your kind of music?

327
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,267
I like Lady Gaga.

328
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,947
Oh, God, of course you do.

329
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,867
– What?
– Shallow dance music.

330
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:27,892
It’s not. It is fun, and it’s about
release and sex and power--

331
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,978
You know, you don’t have to like it.
It’s really not for you, that’s fine.

332
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,505
This- this is a job. This is not a hobby.

333
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,974
Can’t you love him just as a hobby?

334
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:41,240
And sign a fifteen year old
hot girl so we can eat?

335
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,778
Graham Parker and The Rumour
had two albums in the Rolling Stone

336
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,789
Top 500 Best Albums of All Time.
Two of ‘em.

337
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:53,779
If I can just sell ten thousand records
to his hardcore fan base, we’re golden.

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
The last of Graham
Parker’s fans just died.

339
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,486
– I do know. Hardly.
– .. into a depressive--

340
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,682
Charlotte. Sadie.

341
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,075
Sadie, what are you listening to?

342
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,344
Okay,

343
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,262
this is music that makes people happy.

344
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:24,004
And this is what people buy.

345
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,810
What?

346
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:30,344
Right, girls?

347
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,661
Come on, Sadie.

348
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:42,166
♪.. Like a dungeon dragon,
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,

349
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:46,679
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,

350

♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon…

352
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:55,790
Why did you take it off?

353
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:57,673
Now, something that really rocks.

354
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,201
This is called good music.

355
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,770
From somebody’s heart.

356
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,019
This is bumming me out.
This isn’t fun.

357
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,794
Just listen to these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

358
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:17,083
I don’t understand the words.

359
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,458
This is lyrics, this is poetry.
This is what-

360
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:22,567
This is what is gonna survive…
in a hundred years.

361
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:25,093
It just doesn’t make people happy.

362
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,968
It makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

363
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:36,455
You’re the only one
in the room who’s happy.

364
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,067
Sometimes, I wish
just one of you had a dick.

365
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:49,778
Well, we don’t want one.

366
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,851
Is there something that you can do
to be helping me right now?

367
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,015
Yeah, I’m ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

368
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:06,771
Can you go get a lunch box or something?

369
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,060
For me or for them?

370
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,939
Charlotte! I’ve got a test!

371
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,815
I’m coming! I’m coming!

372
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,070
Charlotte, I’m gonna kill you!

373
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,977
– Hi Debbie.
– Hi, any day now, huh?

374
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,056
Not really. Three months, still.

375
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,348
– Hi.
– Hi.

376
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,945
Katie’s dying for a play date.
Let’s hook these two up.

377
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,445
– That would be great, okay.
– Great.

378
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,979
– Hey, I’ll call you.
– Okay. Great.

379
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,252
Hey. No.

380
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,861
– “No” what?
– No.

381
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:36,332
– What?
– No.

382
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:37,461
She’s sweet.

383
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,890
She’s evil.

384
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,031
Hello.

385
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,031
– Hi.
– Hi.

386
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:43,225
Listen, uhm…

387
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,334
Charlotte really needs
to get here on time

388
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:47,802
because she needs the
extra time to just settle in.

389
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,722
Oh… We are on time.

390
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:52,058
Being on time means being early.

391
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:53,738
Oh. Okay.

392
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:55,861
Well, it’s nice to see you in class.

393
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,462
We’d like to see more of you.

394
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,851
I come t--

395
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:00,945
Hi Debbie!

396
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,313
Grandma Molly.

397
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,618
– How are you?
– Hey.

398
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,957
I’m so happy about the science fair.

399
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,307
– Thank you for helping.
– It’s going very well I heard.

400
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:08,923
Yeah.

401
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,501
I love you, you look so beautiful.

402
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,292
Happy birthday! I just learned
it’s your fortieth.

403
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,886
Are you forty?

404
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,019
Yeah.

405
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:21,066
I remember when I was forty,
and then I blinked,

406
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:23,462
and there I was, going to be ninety.

407
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:25,415
My God, where did it go?

408
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:28,678
One day you’re gonna blink,
and you’re gonna be ninety.

409
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:32,593
And I won’t be around to see it.
And that makes me very sad.

410
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,672
I’m telling you, I’m warning you.

411
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,860
Don’t blink. Don’t blink!

412
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:51,375
And then you missed the mortgage payment,
and that’s the second mortgage.

413
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:53,975
You’ve got to tighten your belt.
You’ve got to go home, sit down,

414
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:57,001
look at your expenses,
come clean with Debbie.

415
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,778
Oh, God. I can’t tell Debbie.

416
00:20:58,801 --> 00:20:59,950
You got to tell her, Pete.

417
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:02,826
I mean, she knows it’s bad,
but she has no idea just how bad.

418
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,786
You can sell the house,
it will really buy you some time.

419
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,964
No, no. Debbie’s not really
into selling the house.

420
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:11,474
As your business manager and
your friend, I can’t recommend that.

421
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:14,675
Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?

422
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:15,827
Okay…

423
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,993
– Bye.
– Hang in there.

424
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,645
<i>From the Retro label,
unfiltered, comes the first</i>

425
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,928
<i>Graham Parker and the Rumour
record in thirty years.</i>

426
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:32,974
When we played together,

427
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,621
the magic was just ridiculous,
and I think what we got is just so great.

428
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,805
What are you doing?

429
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,962
I’m contextualizing him as one
of the great figures in rock history.

430
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:46,085
Look, you can’t show him in his prime

431
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,958
in ‘77 and then jump straight
to him as he is now.

432
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,310
It’s terrifying. You have to reverse it.

433
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,096
You’ve got to show him as he is now
very briefly,

434
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:57,623
and then show him in 1977.

435
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,161
You have to “Benjamin Button” it.

436
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:02,152
I don’t know what you’re talking about,
okay? All rock stars are older now.

437
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,689
Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger--

438
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,383
Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger--
– Paul McCartney.

439
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,132
Okay, stop it. Everybody that you are
mentioning looks like an old woman now.

440
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:12,398
You’re just mentioning
a bunch of Jessica Tandys.

441
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,498
Keith Richards gets away with it.

442
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:17,537
But that’s because Keith Richards
looked seventy when he was forty,

443
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:20,202
and now that he’s seventy,
he looks sixty nine.

444
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:22,343
He’s regenerating.

445
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,744
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker is sexy.

446
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:25,979
Wow- would you fuck him?

447
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:27,697
– Yes!
– You…

448
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:30,744
You’d fuck him, and you won’t fuck me?

449
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,335
I mean, I kind of fucked you once,
like- if you could have finished,

450
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,278
you--
– Oh, I finished.

451
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:37,413
Okay, you know what now, enough of
who fucked who and who finished what.

452
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:38,593
I finished.

453
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,905
Look. It’s a retro label.
That’s our niche. That’s our market.

454
00:22:41,915 --> 00:22:45,038
It costs money to break new bands,
I can’t- well I can’t do that.

455
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,506
Okay. And also you’re the guy
who turned down Arcade Fire.

456
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,934
Everybody turned down Arcade Fire.

457
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,450
It’s crazy, there’s so many of them!

458
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,261
We don’t have the money
to market a new band.

459
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,392
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

460
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:56,700
Who is he talking to?

461
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,068
Um, the Jewish Journal.

462
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,614
The Jewish Journal?

463
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:04,436
Apparently, old Jews are the only ones
who still buy hard copies of records.

464
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,646
Because they don’t like to download music.

465
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:09,318
Because they don’t know
what downloading means.

466
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,491
Why is this album
different from any other album?

467
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,647
It isn’t.

468
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:16,284
What- what is he wearing?

469
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,326
Um, it’s a hat with the Oreo logo on it.

470
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:18,920
Why?

471
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,764
I don’t think he’s being ironic,
I think he just really likes Oreos.

472
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,323
Look. The Paul Westerberg record did okay.

473
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,308
Frank Black did all right.
The Haircut 100, not so much.

474
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:29,949
We have to break this record.
Otherwise, we’re not here next year.

475
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,801
He’s coming. He’s coming.
Oreo man is coming.

476
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,075
Hey guys, how are ya?

477
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:34,283
– Good, man!
– .. to see you.

478
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,087
– Aren’t cookies the best?
– Yeah.

479
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,812
Jewish Journal guy loves the record.

480
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,648
Great!

481
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,130
Got a bit of a problem though.

482
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:42,771
Touch of gout.

483
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,721
Gout?

484
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:46,671
Yeah, my whole family,
they all had gout.

485
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:49,130
– Jesus.
– That’s very unfortunate.

486
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:54,493
My auntie Queenie, she had a foot
like the size of a small pig.

487
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,719
I’ve got a photo of it.

488
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,298
I’d love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

489
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,030
And a couple of bunions as well.

490
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:00,858
Fuck!

491
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:04,054
I’ve got to go to the podiatrist, and
I hope he can shoot me up with something.

492
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,715
Yeah, well, let’s uh-
let’s get you to the podiatrist.

493
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:09,669
– Bye, Graham.
– See you later, Graham.

494
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,062
Good luck with your gout.

495
00:24:11,164 --> 00:24:12,376
Rock and Roll, baby.

496
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:17,570
The happiest period in people’s
lives is from age forty to sixty.

497
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,382
So this is it. We’re in it, right now.

498
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,945
– It’s true!
– Says who?

499
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,234
Says a lot of people,
most people say that.

500
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:25,867
Ηuh.

501
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,491
We have everything we need
right now to be completely happy.

502
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,657
We’re gonna blink and be ninety.

503
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,328
What?

504
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,968
So, let’s just choose to be happy.

505
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,662
Yeah. Yeah!

506
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:40,084
Your eyes are kind of glazing over.

507
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,850
No, I’m just, um- processing it all.

508
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,487
Some of these I wrote for you.

509
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,909
So, we have to exercise every day.

510
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:48,206
Spend more time alone together.

511
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,902
We have to go to the therapist every week.

512
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:52,860
It’s a little pricey.

513
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:55,756
No stressing over tiny things.

514
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,068
Yeah, that’s good.
You should do that. Mm-hmm.

515
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,995
We have to get more involved in school…

516
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,831
Have more patience with the kids,

517
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,865
and we need to work on our anger.

518
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,685
I- Yeah, I think it would be good
if you could take care of your anger.

519
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:08,892
No, I said both of us.

520
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,432
That’s what I said. Our anger.

521
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,932
Okay. And no more smoking…

522
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,119
Yeah, you’ve got to get-
you’ve got to cut that out.

523
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:18,583
I don’t want to make this about
a fight, I want it to just be positive.

524
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:20,113
Sorry.

525
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,721
Okay, and then no more
holding on to resentments.

526
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,753
We have to just let that go.

527
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,489
So, if- you’re saying that if
we’re arguing and I apologize,

528
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,899
you’ll let it go and not
throw it back in my face later?

529
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,979
Well, I don’t do that, but I will

530
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:36,690
continue not to do that.

531
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:39,366
And what did you write?

532
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:41,553
All of that. That’s plenty.
That’s a lot.

533
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:43,967
And you’re gonna eat better?

534
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,528
Oh, yeah yeah. I’ve been
doing a decent job, I mean-

535
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,486
but I don’t think there’s anything wrong
with having some fries every now and again.

536
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,072
And then I’ll smoke that day.

537
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,455
That’s not the same thing.

538
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:53,596
It is the same thing.

539
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:54,627
I like fries.

540
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:59,005
And the other thing is your
dad stuff, the not letting him…

541
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,616
you know, guilt trip you all the time,
because that puts a lot of

542
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,232
pressure on you, and stress and then
the whole family feels it and

543
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,259
he’s a grown man,
and he’s not our responsibility.

544
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,514
And you’re not giving him
money anymore, right?

545
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:13,005
No, no I haven’t been giving him money.

546
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,790
I haven’t done that for years, I told you.

547
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:16,493
Can you please put that down?

548
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:22,795
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

549
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:25,232
You sure you don’t want us to
just do a joint birthday party?

550
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:25,991
No.

551
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,604
– We always used to.
– No.

552
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,729
Did Jodi tell you
she thinks Desi’s stealing?

553
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,471
– Are you serious?
– Mm-hmm.

554
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:33,949
How much?

555
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:35,590
Twelve thousand dollars.

556
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:38,809
Oh, Dod. And Desi’s taking it?

557
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:41,469
Well, I don’t know.
That’s what Jodi said.

558
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,584
We really need the store to work.

559
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,983
It is.

560
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,709
Don’t put that kind of pressure on me.

561
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,250
No no, I- I…

562
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,285
That’s not what I mean, I’m just…

563
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:55,302
Are you nervous about money?

564
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,596
Are we okay?

565
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,768
– Yeah!
– Right.

566
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,374
Maybe we just suck it up so because
she’s clearly earning much more

567
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,185
than any other employee we have.

568
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:06,534
Oh, yeah. For sure.
We can’t fire her.

569
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,471
We’re barely breaking even with her.

570
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,206
That’s why we have to keep her.

571
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:13,211
Look at this, she’s making out
with somebody.

572
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:18,764
Is she screwing him?

573
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,686
That might be like a dry hump.

574
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,180
Look at the position of her skirt.

575
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,348
That’s too grainy to know for sure.

576
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:30,092
Oh my god, this is the middle of the day,
customers could be in there.

577
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:31,638
At least she’s getting some.

578
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,770
What did you say?

579
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,520
“At least she’s getting some”?

580
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,277
Yeah.

581
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,663
What are you talking about?

582
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,563
We had sex the other night, you have
to give me a little credit for that.

583
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,207
It’s not about credit.

584
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:45,675
It’s about- we just- we need
to have more passion.

585
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,276
Like this.

586
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:48,821
That’s not passion, that’s-

587
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,610
It looks like passionate to me.

588
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,548
What?

589
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:57,221
– What is she doing?
– Okay-

590
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:01,776
Oh my God. Oh my God!
Oh my God!

591
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,274
Don’t do that!

592
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:05,298
What am I doing?

593
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,212
Don’t fart in the bed!

594
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,915
I’m not, it’s the springs.

595
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:12,823
This is why we never have sex.
That’s disgusting. You’re gross.

596
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,907
– I don’t know what you’re talking about.
– You so--

597
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:17,391
God!

598
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,658
Sadie. Sadie, Sadie!

599
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,690
Sadie, Sadie!
– Charlotte,

600
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:24,252
I’m doing my homework.

601
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:25,576
Okay, watch this, watch it.

602
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,824
There’s a haunted cow back here,

603
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:33,066
and I’m pretty sure it does have milk!

604
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:43,946
Did you see that?
They took me away.

605
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:49,079
You’re no fun.
You never want to play.

606
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:52,669
Charlotte. How many times do I
to have tell you--

607
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:53,813
Sadie!

608
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:57,822
Sadie, Sadie!
Sadie…

609
00:28:57,963 --> 00:28:59,158
is boring!

610
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,276
You’re so mean
since your body got weird.

611
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:14,451
Close the door.

612
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:15,868
You’re no fun.

613
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:18,844
If you can just move,
just a little bit more.

614
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:20,642
– Oh shit!
– It’s okay.

615
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,613
One of my boob is in there!

616
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:27,714
Pete, did I tell you that
my son’s going to Stanford?

617
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,043
– No, that’s great!
– Oh, great.

618
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,784
Great for us and great for him.

619
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,081
– Cough again.
– Let’s go.

620
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:35,322
Everything looks good.

621
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:37,135
Your face is close to my face.

622
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,635
Descending colon…

623
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:42,089
I’m about four feet in right now.

624
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,511
That’s what he said.

625
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,232
Are- are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

626
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,070
I grind all night.

627
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,283
I think we need to turn the gas down.

628
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:57,197
Turn it up!

629
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,127
No, we’re gonna turn it down.

630
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,717
Turn it up!

631
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,015
Do you have to
breathe right on my neck?

632
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:12,774
Sorry.

633
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:15,122
What are you all doing for Christmas?

634
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:17,200
Uhm. I don’t know.

635
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:18,742
Do you have a tree and everything?

636
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:19,515
Mm-hmm.

637
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:20,536
– Ain’t that fun…

638
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:21,902
– Hi, I-
– .. Get in the spirit.

639
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,438
Sorry, I just have one quick question.

640
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,986
On your form you said
you were born in 1974,

641
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,502
but your paper, it said 1972,
so I just need to know which it is.

642
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,084
Oh. It’s 1974.

643
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:36,451
Oh it- uhm. Because on your last form,
you said that you were born in 1975.

644
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:39,171
Didn’t you tell me you were born in 1976?

645
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:41,155
No.
That’s funny.

646
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,537
So you want to go with 1974?

647
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:47,585
I’m not gonna “go” with 1974, it is 1974.

648
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:49,569
Okay.

649
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:52,599
Just remember to write 1974 every time.

650
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,458
It’s okay. It’s 1976.

651
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:00,064
I lie about my age, okay?

652
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,541
– Okay!
– Okay?

653
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,259
Okay? Okay?

654
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:04,761
– Okay!
– Okay.

655
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:06,581
You’re tightening up.

656
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,211
Oh my gosh.

657
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:09,969
I know how old you are.

658
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,857
By counting the rings!

659
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,342
Little gyno joke.

660
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:18,193
Oh my God. Please!

661
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,271
What are you doing?

662
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
Getting ready to go for my ride.

663
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:28,573
Do you want a blow job?

664
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:29,292
Yeah.

665
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:30,386
Why?

666
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,796
I really want a cigarette right now.

667
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:34,792
Well, happy to help.

668
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,528
Charlotte, where is my backpack?

669
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,869
Hello?

670
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:42,544
Mom’s busy!

671
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,627
Why are you locking the door?

672
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,283
Mom! What’s going on in there?

673
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,928
Mom, I can’t be late for school,

674
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,748
– I have a test!
– Mommy can’t talk right now!

675
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:50,920
This isn’t funny, Mom.

676
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,100
I need to go.
– Mom, let me in!

677
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:53,795
Please!

678
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:55,144
That’s not gonna help!

679
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,074
Put on your shoes.
We’ll meet you in the car.

680
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:58,754
Sadie hurt me!

681
00:32:58,796 --> 00:32:59,894
I didn’t!

682
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:00,817
Hit her back!

683
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:02,700
She’s faking!

684
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,035
– I’m not. Please!
– Go downstairs!

685
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,918
– Daddy, let me in-
– Stop crying!

686
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:08,343
– Stop crying!
– Stop it!

687
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,928
– God damn it!
– Mum, get out!

688
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,946
– Please Sadie, shut up!
– Mum, you need to come out.

689
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,680
– Shut up!
– Stop it!

690
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:15,879
– Open the door!
– Go away!

691
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:17,715
– Open it!
– Please!

692
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,964
Forget it.

693
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:22,031
No. Don’t forget it. Don’t forget it.
Don’t, don’t!

694
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:24,281
Oh God…

695
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,696
Hey, Boychik.

696
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:29,808
Hey.

697
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:35,395
That’s the eleven o’clock from London.

698
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:39,207
Drop something valuable, you shit!

699
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,440
How are you?

700
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:43,770
Loud.

701
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:45,586
Every eight minutes, buddy.

702
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:49,638
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

703
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,443
Yeah, I’m growing it out.

704
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:52,376
Oh, I’d get it cut.

705
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,246
Daddy, you never play with me.

706
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:57,236
I do but right now look who
I’m talking to!

707
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,368
– Hi.
– It’s your brother!

708
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,633
Alright, say-

709
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,914
You don’t look like my brother.

710
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:06,660
I told you honey, that’s
’cause of the egg donor.

711
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:07,285
Remember?

712
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,185
I came from a test tube.

713
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:14,290
– How’s business?
– It’s not good.

714
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:15,897
Nobody wants curtains.

715
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,927
They think of it like a luxury.
It’s not a luxury.

716
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,958
You need shade, you need privacy.

717
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:24,378
Who wants to have
other people watch you fuck?

718
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,289
I- I know how you feel. You know,

719
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:28,899
my business is going through
some growing pains right now.

720
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:30,240
– Oh, don’t jump on Daddy,
– Daddy. - Daddy!

721
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,097
be careful, don’t jump,
don’t jump on Daddy!

722
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,285
Remember, Daddy has high blood what?

723
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,598
– High blood pressure.
– That’s right.

724
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,023
Can you go outside
without me for a little bit?

725
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,046
Don’t go near that little pool!

726
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:43,983
All right?

727
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:47,140
Do the Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

728
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,415
I can’t tell them apart.

729
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:52,209
I swear to god. I need tattoos.

730
00:34:53,497 --> 00:34:56,971
Look, uh… I wanted
to talk to you about…

731
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,166
scaling back a little bit.

732
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:04,684
You know, Deb and I are
thinking about selling the house.

733
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,137
I think that house is more than you need,

734
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,897
I think it was too big of
a purchase when you made it.

735
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:12,521
Yeah. In the meantime, I’m gonna
have to make some changes.

736
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:15,027
Gonna have to cut back.

737
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,535
I understand.

738
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:17,785
What do you mean?

739
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:19,152
– With you.
– Oh.

740
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,636
I’m sorry, what?

741
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:22,620
I can’t lend you any more money.

742
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:26,524
No, that’s a- that’s a bad idea.
That’s not the way to cut back.

743
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,579
I- I have three children, here.

744
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,009
What about Claire?
Why can’t she get a job?

745
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,853
Claire takes care of your brothers!

746
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,946
What do you want her to do?

747
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:36,358
If she goes to work, then
I’ve got to hire somebody.

748
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,428
Well you’ve got to figure something out
because I can’t do it. I can’t do it!

749
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,113
Okay, fine. Why don’t we kill them?

750
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:44,080
Come on, we’ll kill two of them.
I’ll keep the best one.

751
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:46,189
Really,
it will save us both a lot of trouble.

752
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:47,671
– Come on-
– Line up!

753
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,416
 Line up for murder! Come on!

754
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,250
Who wants to be killed?

755
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,586
– I do!
– Okay,

756
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,245
we’re eliminating one already
we’re cheaper. You’re gone!

757
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,169
– Murder me!
– Okay! Boom, dead!

758
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:00,216
– Oh I’m dead!
– You’re dead, you’re dead!

759
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:03,565
All right, the kids are murdered.
That will save us some money.

760
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,131
Why would you have three kids, anyway?

761
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:07,121
I mean, you’re sixty years old.
You have no money-

762
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,261
Because Claire wanted a baby.

763
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,793
If we didn’t at least try,
she would have left me.

764
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,618
She was forty-five years old.

765
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,234
Nobody thought it would take.

766
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,474
The doctor when we were doing
in vitro, was winking at me

767
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,218
like, “Don’t worry, don’t worry.”

768
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,866
We were very unlucky.

769
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,099
And now we have these
three beautiful children…

770
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,536
Come on. I gotta tell you something.

771
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:33,425
What?

772
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:38,431
Your mother wanted you aborted.

773
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:39,970
Oh, Jesus Christ.

774
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,158
No no. It’s the truth.

775
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,666
You know, it was the seventies.
We were twenty-two years old.

776
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:48,549
That’s what everybody did. You did
some blow, had sex, had an abortion.

777
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:49,992
– Really?
– Yes.

778
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,008
We were on the way to the doctor’s office.

779
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,841
I said, “Let’s stop,
have a pizza, talk about it,

780
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:57,599
if you still want to do it
after lunch, it’s okay.”

781
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,661
The pizza saved your life.

782
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,314
But don’t give me money.

783
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:03,408
Because I’m not worth it.

784
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,452
So how much do I owe you then
for saving my life?

785
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:08,999
I don’t have a number.
You just keep giving like you’re giving.

786
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,452
Hey! Oh, Hi Pete!

787
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:11,545
– Hey!
– Hey!

788
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:12,668
Why aren’t you playing with kids?

789
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,144
We were playing with them all day.

790
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:15,675
Pete’s just uh…

791
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,199
talking to me about his fortieth birthday
party. Whatever I can do to help.

792
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,542
Okay. Did you feed them?

793
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:23,403
I’d fed half of one.

794
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:27,584
Let’s go. Okay, the family will feed them.

795
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,670
Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel?

796
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:38,444
Hi, I’m looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man?

797
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,901
So how’s Sony treating Pete?

798
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:56,773
Oh, he’s not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

799
00:37:56,893 --> 00:38:01,640
Now he’s able to focus on the artists
that he’s really passionate about.

800
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,515
How’s Sadie doing?

801
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:07,952
Last time I on  saw her she was
throwing her Cheerios on the floor.

802
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:10,575
What a mess.
– Right.

803
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,790
She just got her period.

804
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,471
Well…

805
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:20,287
I guess she’s not a little baby anymore.

806
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,048
It would be nice to see
more of each other.

807
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,029
Well, we can certainly arrange for that.

808
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,693
I’d love to see the girls.

809
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,504
– That would be nice.
– Mm-hmm.

810
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:35,336
Do you have a day that was better-
like, a good day?

811
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:38,529
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

812
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:41,357
– Soccer competitions, kids exams.
– Right, right.

813
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:45,368
I mean, we’re both so busy. I mean I have
young children, you have young children,

814
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:49,685
I… I don’t think we should judge
ourselves too harshly about that.

815
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,901
I know, I wasn’t.
I didn’t say anything.

816
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:57,120
No, I’m glad we’re here,
I think we should- this is-

817
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:01,421
this is a good start and that we can
spend more time together, it’d be nice.

818
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,469
It would be nice.

819
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:09,793
Do you want to see pictures of the kids?

820
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:11,326
Oh, yeah.

821
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:14,388
This is, uh…

822
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:17,288
This is Kell, my son, he’s-

823
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,534
He’s handsome. He’s thirteen?

824
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,685
Mm-hmm.

825
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:24,462
And that’s Alexandra, my daughter,

826
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,267
she’s a real perfectionist.

827
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:28,211
A lot- a lot like you.

828
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,305
That’s the whole gang at Cabo.

829
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,228
Now…

830
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,558
Excuse me dear,
I’ve got to use the restroom.

831
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,816
Be right back.
– Okay.

832
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:13,462
Daddy and I are making some changes,

833
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,196
so that we can be happier
and healthier,

834
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,281
and we’re starting with
this meal that I prepared.

835
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:20,515
I think it looks great.

836
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,484
Doesn’t it look good?

837
00:40:21,564 --> 00:40:23,023
What is that, grilled cheeses?

838
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,715
No, baked- baked tofu.

839
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,504
Aw.

840
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,053
 It’s actually really tasty.

841
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:31,137
And the lettuce is so fresh and
tasty that you forget how good

842
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,355
lettuce tastes on its own
without dressing.

843
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:37,801
No, dressing always gets in the way
of the natural taste of the lettuce.

844
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:42,762
And another thing we’ve
decided is to cut back on…

845
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,161
all of the electronics we use.

846
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:50,927
Basically, what we’re gonna do is get rid
of the wi-fi and only use the computer

847
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,940
– what?
– from 8 to 8:30 at night.

848
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,471
How are we going to go on the computer?

849
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:57,126
Well we’re gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

850
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,539
Yeah, we’ll supervise that.

851
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:01,453
You can’t do this.
You can’t take away the wi-fi!

852
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:03,646
No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!

853
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:06,180
You don’t spend enough time
with the family when you’re

854
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:10,071
constantly on your iPhone
and your computer, and

855
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:13,326
you know, you should-
you’re only here five more years.

856
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,013
So you won’t see me after five years?

857
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,901
No, but you won’t be living with us.

858
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,477
And you should get
to know your little sister.

859
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:21,196
You’ve got the perfect friend right here.

860
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:23,155
I don’t want to be friends with her now.

861
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:26,530
I’ll friends with her when she’s
twenty and a normal person.

862
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,344
I don’t want to hang out with her
when I’m in my twenties.

863
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:32,264
You’re on your computer too much as it is,
you need to get outside more.

864
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,700
Do some planning outside.

865
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:37,988
Yeah. You can build things out.
You can build a- a fort outside.

866
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:38,839
What?

867
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:41,445
Yeah, build a fort. Play with
your friends and they have-

868
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:44,126
Make a fort?! Outside?

869
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:45,556
And do what?

870
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:47,446
– Have a little-
– Do what in the fort?

871
00:41:47,478 --> 00:41:52,202
When I was a kid we used to
build tree houses and play with sticks.

872
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,499
Nobody plays with sticks.

873
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,569
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

874
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,702
Play Kick the Can.

875
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,217
Look for dead bodies.

876
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:01,027
It’s fun. That’s fun to do.

877
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,894
Get a tire and then take a stick
and run down the street with it.

878
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,303
Nobody does that crap. It’s 2012.

879
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:07,972
You don’t need technology.

880
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,835
No technology!

881
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:10,943
Charlotte, put that down.

882
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:15,154
I don’t need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

883
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:16,667
I don’t do anything bad.

884
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:17,948
Nobody said you were bad.

885
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:21,277
I don’t do things I’m not supposed to.
I don’t illegally download music.

886
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,155
I don’t look at porn like Wendy.

887
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:26,454
She is up to no good. She’s not
allowed to come over here anymore.

888
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:27,299
What’s porn?

889
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:28,159
No, she said corn.

890
00:42:28,174 --> 00:42:31,203
This isn’t turning out
the way I wanted it to.

891
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:32,328
I’m not hungry.

892
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:33,379
No computer.

893
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:34,520
Listen to your mom!

894
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,484
I need to use it for my homework.

895
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:40,515
She’s outplaying us.

896
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:43,867
I know. She’s tough.

897
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,908
This is the best birthday present.

898
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:52,034
It’s good to get away, you know? We haven’t
been to Laguna without the kids in years.

899
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:52,750
I know!

900
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:54,176
If we’re happy, they’re happy.

901
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:58,622
Yeah. I mean I can’t take it. With the
hormones, and the crying, and

902
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:00,308
– Jesus.
– “do my homework”…

903
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,658
Them’s little bitches!

904
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,072
Lil’ bitches!

905
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:05,143
Bugging us for shit all the time.

906
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,307
And they never appreciate anything.

907
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,328
No, God no. They’re selfish assholes.

908
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:13,579
Aw, I feel bad.

909
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,135
I love them.
– I know.

910
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,710
I miss them already.
Should we go home?

911
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:19,994
Nah.

912
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,754
Why do we fight?

913
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:05,485
I don’t know, it makes no sense at all.

914
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,906
It makes no sense.

915
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,766
When we get in a fight…

916
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,839
look in my eyes, and let’s remember
this moment right now,

917
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:13,727
and know that never have to fight.

918
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:15,587
But you’re such a dick sometimes.

919
00:44:15,595 --> 00:44:17,422
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

920
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,770
People think I’m so nice,
but I’m such a dick.

921
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:21,760
Thank you for admitting that.

922
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:23,360
And you get so mad at me.

923
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:25,144
– Oh my God.
– I feel like you wanna kill me.

924
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:26,954
I do wanna kill you.

925
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:27,873
How would you do it?

926
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:30,437
I don’t know… poison you.

927
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:34,390
I’d poison your cupcakes that
you pretend not to eat everyday.

928
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,800
And just put like enough in
to slowly weaken you.

929
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,339
I love it.

930
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,306
I would enjoy our last
few months together.

931
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,915
Me too.

932
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,046
’Cause you’d be so weak and like sweet,

933
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,397
and I could take care of you and-
but while killing you.

934
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,393
See? You know what I love about us?

935
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,010
You can still surprise me.

936
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:53,263
I figured for sure you’d knock me out
with one fell swoop, poison me.

937
00:44:53,271 --> 00:44:55,671
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

938
00:44:57,024 --> 00:44:58,597
Have you ever thought about killing me?

939
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,378
Oh yeah.

940
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,503
– Really?
– Sure.

941
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:02,155
– How would you do it?
– Wood chipper.

942
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,646
– A wood chipper?
– Yeah.

943
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,373
– A wood chipper!
– Yeah.

944
00:45:05,842 --> 00:45:07,378
– Wow.
– I know.

945
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:08,503
Did you see Fargo?

946
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:09,548
Yeah.

947
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:15,491
That’s a bad plan, the cupcakes
is a way better plan.

948
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:16,847
It is. You’re right.

949
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,628
You know what? I won’t murder you.

950
00:45:20,995 --> 00:45:22,167
I love you.

951
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:23,332
I love you too…

952
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,701
You know what I brought?
– What?

953
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:28,284
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to me last Christmas.

954
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,823
– What?
– Yeah. I brought it.

955
00:45:29,992 --> 00:45:31,599
– You did?
– Chocolate chip koo-kie.

956
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:32,418
Should we do it?

957
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,840
Let’s eat the cookie, and then we’ll order
a bunch of cheeseburgers and a bunch of-

958
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,645
Let’s order the entire room service menu.

959
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:41,212
Just get all of it.
You deserve it. You really do.

960
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:43,074
Wouldn’t you rather have me
around for less years

961
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:46,144
and I’m incredibly happy
than longer and miserable?

962
00:45:46,185 --> 00:45:48,846
Yes, and I just realized that right now.

963
00:45:48,865 --> 00:45:49,768
Go get the cookie!

964
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:51,519
– I’ll get the cookie!
– Go get the cookie!

965
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,237
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

966
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:57,532
Yeah. Should we get a block of porn?

967
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,814
I don’t think we need
twenty-four hours of porn.

968
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:03,522
Yeah, but you know, like two porns cost
just about as much as a 24-hour block.

969
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,405
I think that’s too much porn.

970
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,109
We don’t have to watch it all,
but for the value it makes sense.

971
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:11,086
How much are we supposed to eat?

972
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:13,497
I don’t know. I think like
six or seven cookies, right?

973
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,090
Plus, it’s old. It probably
has lost some of its-

974
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,183
– Potency?
– Mm-hmm.

975
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,320
No.

976
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:22,121
We should have sex. More.

977
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,194
I mean, girls have it so easy.

978
00:46:24,204 --> 00:46:27,858
You just show up with your sexual
organs and you’re good to go.

979
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,217
All the pressure is on the guy.

980
00:46:29,235 --> 00:46:30,108
It’s true.

981
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,588
And I look at guys, like… I look at
a guy like Prince, and you know that guy

982
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:35,519
fucks.
– Yeah.

983
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:37,984
I know I don’t fuck like Prince.

984
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,984
Prince can fuck.
I fuck more like David Schwimmer.

985
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:44,304
You do.

986
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:48,924
I fuck- you know, like Ross from Friends.

987
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,553
That’s good.

988
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:02,691
How does he do it?

989
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,916
The floating spoon.

990
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:09,292
Check it out. My dick and balls.

991
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,326
Oh my God! I’m gonna eat my own dick!

992
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:14,506
I ate my dick!

993
00:47:15,406 --> 00:47:17,880
Kelly, I think this room has rodents.

994
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:20,536
I just saw it!

995
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:22,361
Have you seen my starfish?

996
00:47:23,047 --> 00:47:24,653
Where did I put my starfish?

997
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:27,548
Hmm my God.

998
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,957
I’m gonna deep throat this éclair.

999
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,092
I wanna make out with you so bad.

1000
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:13,959
– Τhаt wаѕ nісе.
– Τhаt wаѕ nісе.

1001
00:48:17,524 --> 00:48:21,592
Mom! Charlotte’s crying.
She’s got an ear infection again.

1002
00:48:21,853 --> 00:48:23,653
I didn’t know what to do.

1003
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:27,354
We’re home.

1004
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,679
Are you okay?

1005
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:30,476
What’s the matter?

1006
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:34,891
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1007
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:38,483
I told you the pediatrician
didn’t know what he was talking about.

1008
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,351
Oh, come on. You can’t
blame it on our doctor.

1009
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,234
Ear infections are common in little kids.

1010
00:48:42,272 --> 00:48:44,600
Not in kids over six years old.

1011
00:48:44,665 --> 00:48:46,944
We’re going to the Eastern doctor.

1012
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:49,561
If she’s in this much pain,
we should call a real doctor.

1013
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,048
Are you kidding right now?

1014
00:48:54,273 --> 00:48:56,130
Alright, okay. Yeah.

1015
00:48:57,215 --> 00:48:59,533
What we should do is easy and simple.

1016
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:02,501
No more dairy, no more
wheat, no more sugar.

1017
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:04,770
Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.

1018
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,171
What the fuck is left?

1019
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,335
Sorry.

1020
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,273
Isn’t everything sugar, wheat and dairy?

1021
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,455
She can have
vegetables and f-r-ruits.

1022
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,130
So- oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits.

1023
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:15,278
Fr-r-ruits, yeah.

1024
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:17,188
Uhm, any kind of fr-r-ruits?

1025
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,635
Mangos, pineapple…

1026
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,549
It isn’t like there are safe fr-rruits
and then unsafe fr-r-ruits.

1027
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:22,337
No, no.

1028
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,657
What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries?
Can we do something like that?

1029
00:49:24,688 --> 00:49:26,891
Are you okay? Would
you like to come on the table?

1030
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:27,694
I’m okay. I’m-

1031
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:28,936
– Why don’t you go on the table?
– I don’t wanna-

1032
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,949
Why don’t you go on the table?

1033
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,347
Now it looks like you
need to get on the table.

1034
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:32,512
I don’t wanna get on the table.

1035
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:41,768
Pete!

1036
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,631
What are you doing?

1037
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:53,442
I need you to look at something.
In my butt.

1038
00:49:56,484 --> 00:49:57,380
Why?

1039
00:49:57,457 --> 00:50:01,544
I think I’ve got something in there,
and I’m not limber enough to…

1040
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,236
to see. I need you to look at it.

1041
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,763
See, I might have like an anal fissure
or a hemorrhoid or a-

1042
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:09,419
or a worm or something.

1043
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:13,134
What are you doing with your phone?

1044
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,881
Trying to take pictures of it, so I
can compare it to something on Google.

1045
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,592
Can we just keep like a
small shred of mystery

1046
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:25,195
in our relationship, please?

1047
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:27,384
Look, I saw you have two babies, okay?

1048
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,180
Seriously, I need you
to get all up in that.

1049
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:31,777
I do not want to investigate your anus.

1050
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:33,748
It’s payback time.

1051
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,754
It’s a hemorrhoid.

1052
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:45,815
Thank you.

1053
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,887
Now erase that from your memory.

1054
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:57,011
Where did she get those clothes?
That’s very expensive clothes.

1055
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:59,846
Think. Where do you think?

1056
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,562
I don’t want this to sound harsh, but…

1057
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,637
everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1058
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,909
Everything that comes into it is a dick.

1059
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,576
Everything that goes in is dicks?

1060
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:14,587
A dick.

1061
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:15,860
Don’t say that.

1062
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:18,914
I’m sorry, I’m just being
protective of the store.

1063
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:20,927
I’m gonna go talk to her.

1064
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:28,069
Hey Desi.

1065
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,569
– Hi.
– Hi.

1066
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,699
Is that your new Acura out front?

1067
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:32,933
Uh, yeah.

1068
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:35,466
So nice. Do you love it?

1069
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:38,654
Well, I mean, it’s not a fucking Porsche,
but it’ll do for now.

1070
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:44,262
Hey Desi, would you mind wearing some
of the clothes that we have in the store?

1071
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:46,603
Yes. Yeah, I’m sorry.

1072
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,940
– Would that be okay?
– Yeah.

1073
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:52,744
– Perfect.
– Good.

1074
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,641
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1075
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,091
– Did you?
– Yeah.

1076
00:51:58,187 --> 00:52:00,981
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1077
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:04,098
and then I actually
transferred it to the t-shirt.

1078
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Wow.

1079
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,384
So you- you stenciled on the tiger?

1080
00:52:08,568 --> 00:52:13,401
I drew it on a piece of paper, and then
I transferred the drawing to the t-shirt.

1081
00:52:13,524 --> 00:52:15,808
You have an amazing body.

1082
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,935
– Really?
– Yes.

1083
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:19,996
Are those real?

1084
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,800
– My boobs?
– Yeah.

1085
00:52:22,192 --> 00:52:24,519
Yeah…
Do you want to touch them?

1086
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:26,433
– Really?
– Touch ‘em!

1087
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,337
Okay.

1088
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:33,129
Wow.

1089
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,342
Huh!

1090
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,743
Jesus.

1091
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,753
I mean they really are amazing.

1092
00:52:41,053 --> 00:52:42,910
That’s firm, for real.

1093
00:52:43,387 --> 00:52:45,728
They’re like a memory mattress.

1094
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:49,886
It’s- Wow. Like Tempurpedic, you know?

1095
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:51,667
They look amazing.

1096
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,496
My kids just sucked the meat
right out of mine.

1097
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,652
– No…
– Yeah.

1098
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,894
There’s some meat in there.

1099
00:52:56,912 --> 00:53:00,714
My boobs are just gone. Since
I had kids, my boobs are just gone.

1100
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:04,131
They didn’t even say goodbye.
You know, they just left.

1101
00:53:04,276 --> 00:53:07,876
By the time I’m forty, these are
gonna go National Geographic on me.

1102
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,680
I feel bad about myself right now.

1103
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:14,851
I think this is a
really good offer on the house.

1104
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,698
We expected more. I mean,

1105
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:20,010
I know it’s a bad market but that’s still
way what under we were looking for.

1106
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,794
I know, but based on the market,
it’s like you’re gaining money.

1107
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:26,215
Because it’s so much more
than what you deserve.

1108
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:27,738
But these people are from Iran,

1109
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,316
and they don’t really know that
they’re offering too much.

1110
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,183
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?

1111
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,091
I doubt it. I mean, I don’t know, I-

1112
00:53:35,116 --> 00:53:37,030
There’s a lot of inventory out there.

1113
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:38,255
I mean, what’s her problem?

1114
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:42,185
She… she has unrealistic expectations.

1115
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,986
Hey! Did you miss me Travis?

1116
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:52,369
It’s Jack!

1117
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:53,914
Hey, Jack.

1118
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,129
My daddy doesn’t know my name.

1119
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:57,332
– Ok, come on, let’s go.
– Can I go show

1120
00:53:57,344 --> 00:54:00,119
my crystals before they leave?

1121
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:01,061
Yeah, really quick.

1122
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:03,311
It’s alright with me!
Hang up with your dad!

1123
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:04,502
Okay!

1124
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:06,888
Go play with your tiny uncles.

1125
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:08,732
– Let’s play murder.
– Yeah. Let’s go.

1126
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,597
So what are you doing, spring cleaning?

1127
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:15,566
I’m getting rid of everything
in the house that has gluten or sugar.

1128
00:54:15,779 --> 00:54:17,183
Why? What’s wrong with gluten?

1129
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:18,777
Gluten’s really bad for you.

1130
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:20,222
I don’t think so. It’s wheat.

1131
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:21,746
Don’t you watch Dr. Oz?

1132
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:23,340
As in the Wizard of?

1133
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:26,770
Hey, Mom. We were wondering if
we could use the computer to iChat.

1134
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:29,027
Remember the rules. 8 to 8:30?

1135
00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:31,171
Yeah, but I have a friend over.

1136
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,811
Hi Wendy.
Yeah. I know. Uh…

1137
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,335
Why don’t you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1138
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,778
Yeah, remember the Alamo?

1139
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:39,270
Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?

1140
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:40,939
Like on Facebook?

1141
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,142
I will take this if you’re
gonna throw it away,

1142
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:46,422
because at our house, we’re wheat eaters.

1143
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:49,379
But don’t you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

1144
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:50,845
That’s up to God, honey.

1145
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:52,645
Yeah but that’s really
not good for the kids.

1146
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:55,322
Eh! The kids eat grass. This is fine.

1147
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:58,150
Wendy’s mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1148
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:01,864
Yeah. My mom’s pretty cool about
it as long as I finish my homework.

1149
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,210
Yeah…

1150
00:55:03,364 --> 00:55:06,058
Well, I guess I’m not the cool one. But…

1151
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,183
the rules are just in our different house.

1152
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,335
Well, I get better grades than Wendy.

1153
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:12,460
She does. She’s so smart.

1154
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,553
Let me just grab the candy worms.

1155
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:16,159
Your rules are ridiculous.

1156
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:17,296
Don’t sass me.

1157
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:19,137
I’m only sassing you
because you’re throwing out

1158
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:22,028
all the food in our house
and I’m freaking starving.

1159
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:23,504
You’re being stupid.

1160
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:25,453
Wendy, can you go stand
in the other room, please?

1161
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:26,862
– Yeah.
– Mom.

1162
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,034
Give me your iPhone now.

1163
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,860
The nougat things are good.

1164
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,667
I have all my contacts in there.

1165
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:33,368
Okay, if you don’t give me
your phone right now,

1166
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:35,758
then I’m gonna have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1167
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:36,751
– Jesus Christ, I need
– That’s it.

1168
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:39,152
– my computer to do homework.
– That’s it.

1169
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:40,169
No phone, no computer.

1170
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:44,113
This is B.S. This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You’re acting like a B.

1171
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,168
Kids! Time to go!

1172
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:48,124
You go to your room right now,

1173
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:53,399
you are not allowed to use iPhone,
iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes,

1174
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:56,225
Netflix, Pandora, or Spotify!

1175
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:59,629
She’s a little pip.
Just like her mommy.

1176
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:04,348
So uh, I might have a job tomorrow.

1177
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:06,761
at least I’m gonna go
try to give an estimate.,

1178
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:09,128
Do you mind taking
the kids for a couple hours?

1179
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,452
Uhm…

1180
00:56:11,129 --> 00:56:12,329
Okay.

1181
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,435
This is nice.

1182
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,942
You and I don’t spend
enough time together, do we?

1183
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:19,044
We spend enough time together.

1184
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,080
We do?

1185
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:22,185
It’s quality time.

1186
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:25,604
Then we do.

1187
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,924
I’ll go with what you think.

1188
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,298
What else did they say?

1189
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:32,546
Alright, some kid named Joseph--

1190
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,310
I know Joseph.

1191
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,466
– You do?
– Mm-hmm.

1192
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:36,323
He’s making a “Hot or Not” list.

1193
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:37,401
What?

1194
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,888
So, Sadie said, “That’s so lame
and immature that you’re doing that.”

1195
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,464
And then Joseph says, “Yo, girl,

1196
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:45,987
We’re just having some
fun so don’t be a bitch, yo.”

1197
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:47,819
That is not nice.

1198
00:56:48,483 --> 00:56:50,465
So then Sadie said,
“Don’t call me a bitch.”

1199
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,714
And Joseph said, “I didn’t call you
a bitch, I said don’t act like a bitch.

1200
00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:55,949
And by the way you’re
in the ‘Not Hot’ column”.

1201
00:56:56,365 --> 00:56:58,348
Who made him the judge of hot?

1202
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,690
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1203
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,182
What a little fuckhead.
I’ll kill him.

1204
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:05,461
So then Sadie said, “You’re
in the jackass column.

1205
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,321
I’ve got to go. I’m bored of you.”

1206
00:57:07,797 --> 00:57:10,901
That is cool.
That’s taking the high road.

1207
00:57:11,213 --> 00:57:15,243
For some reason, there’s an
emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.

1208
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,875
I wonder what that means.

1209
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,213
I don’t think it means anything,
I think it’s just adorable.

1210
00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:22,479
Aww.

1211
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,815
She’s a good girl. She was polite,
and she stood up for herself.

1212
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,135
That’s pretty cool.

1213
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:31,501
– Shit!
– What?

1214
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:32,833
I thought she was coming in.

1215
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,695
Oh my God, that scared me to death.

1216
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,455
If she caught us, she would kill us.

1217
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,133
She would, she would kill us.

1218
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:47,680
I’ve got to make a call.

1219
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:51,328
We sold how many?

1220
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:54,707
Six hundred and twelve album downloads.

1221
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,285
Wait a minute. There
are no zeros after that?

1222
00:57:57,352 --> 00:58:00,826
No, there are zeros, but all of
them are before six hundred and twelve.

1223
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:02,370
There are none after.

1224
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,933
How is that even possible?

1225
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:06,222
Well, out of three hundred million
Americans,

1226
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:10,080
six hundred and twelve people
chose to download the album.

1227
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:13,385
You could personally call everyone
who bought this record.

1228
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,835
We’re fucked! We’re fucked!

1229
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:19,062
Here’s the deal. I want you to meet me
tomorrow morning at eight o’clock.

1230
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:22,390
I want a list of at least thirty ideas
of what we can do to change this.

1231
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:24,077
We have to change this.

1232
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,577
I started a record label
because I couldn’t get a job,

1233
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,476
so I have no other options.

1234
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:49,449
What financial problems?

1235
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:51,386
Well, I mean, for one thing
you were right,

1236
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:54,066
I mean, you are missing about ten
thousand dollars…

1237
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:57,556
from the store. And then, Pete’s record,
you know, not selling…

1238
00:58:57,638 --> 00:58:58,862
– Pete’s record not selling,
– .. well.

1239
00:58:58,898 --> 00:59:01,409
I thought we weren’t
supposed to hear for three weeks?

1240
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,551
– We heard.
– You heard?

1241
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,911
And they’re bad.

1242
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,419
You know, it’s that, and it’s the money
that he’s been lending to his father,

1243
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:08,044
That’s creating a strain.

1244
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,000
How- how much have we…

1245
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,546
How much have we…

1246
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:12,725
– lent him?
– Eighty thousand.

1247
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:16,679
Did you say “eight
thousand” or “eighty thousand”?

1248
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:19,612
Eighty thousand,
over the past couple of years.

1249
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:21,651
And then you missed the mortgage payment,

1250
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:22,591
– and-
– On the house?

1251
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,387
And- Oh, and uh, uh you missed
the rental… on the office.

1252
00:59:26,905 --> 00:59:28,254
Does Pete know that?

1253
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:30,518
Oh, yeah. We’re on the
phone all the time.

1254
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:33,127
Look, I know you’re going
through a hard time,

1255
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:35,971
and I want you guys to know that
we’re here for you.

1256
00:59:36,341 --> 00:59:39,094
Okay? Anything you guys need,
that’s why we’re here.

1257
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:41,008
We’re here for times like this.

1258
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:42,570
What are you gonna do?

1259
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:44,297
There’s not much I can do.

1260
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:56,424
What are you doing?

1261
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,815
Uh, I’m drawing the album
cover for Van Halen’s Diver Down.

1262
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:02,672
If you spent a little bit more time
focusing on Graham Parker

1263
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:06,015
instead of drawing album covers,
I wouldn’t be in this predicament.

1264
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:07,902
I’m focused on Graham Parker.

1265
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,764
You’re supposed to help me with him!

1266
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:11,944
You’re supposed to call the
companies, you’re supposed to-

1267
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:13,811
you’re supposed to get
people to the show!

1268
01:00:13,898 --> 01:00:17,466
I’ve done everything I can, Pete.
You had me pushing around a corpse!

1269
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,919
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham’s.

1270
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,659
What should we do?
I’m out of ideas.

1271
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,112
You fly in The Rumour.

1272
01:00:23,474 --> 01:00:27,941
I can’t sell a reunion concert
without the band, it’s ridiculous.

1273
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:30,051
With what? I can’t afford it.

1274
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,798
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility,

1275
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,415
take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1276
01:00:35,474 --> 01:00:36,995
What did you call me?

1277
01:00:37,172 --> 01:00:38,120
Chin.

1278
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:40,378
Pete!

1279
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:41,768
Wait! Wait, Pete!

1280
01:00:42,378 --> 01:00:44,618
Hey, I have an apartment,
I have health insurance,

1281
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,118
I have car payments,
I have responsibilities.

1282
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:49,920
You have responsibili- don’t talk
to me about responsibilities.

1283
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:52,381
I have a life, I have- I have a family.

1284
01:00:52,558 --> 01:00:55,446
I can’t afford to sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1285
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,460
and then goin’ to the Tommy’s Chili
Burgers at three in the morning.

1286
01:00:58,538 --> 01:01:01,059
That’s not even the order that happens in!

1287
01:01:01,278 --> 01:01:03,785
I have everything to lose here.
Everything.

1288
01:01:03,902 --> 01:01:07,605
Yes! Because you spent thousands
of dollars on shit we don’t need.

1289
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:12,096
You really need to spend thirty thousand
dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude?

1290
01:01:12,153 --> 01:01:15,971
Which is inside! It’s not even outside.
We know where we work!

1291
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:19,062
If you want to sign a band, you
have to look like you’re the real deal.

1292
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:22,095
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1293
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:24,934
– It’s twelve thousand.
– Twelve thousand dollars!

1294
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:26,432
Alright, you know what? Fine.

1295
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:29,477
Fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx.

1296
01:01:31,966 --> 01:01:33,864
No, you said it was impossible.

1297
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:36,419
I don’t think I said impossible.

1298
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,184
Yeah.

1299
01:01:37,306 --> 01:01:40,292
I usually don’t say impossible.
I like to-

1300
01:01:40,556 --> 01:01:42,356
I like to leave some wiggle room.

1301
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:46,161
You said that…
my fibroid was like

1302
01:01:46,406 --> 01:01:48,778
a giant boulder like the one from the

1303
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:49,997
– Indiana Jones.
– Indiana Jones

1304
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,190
movies blocking up my uterus.

1305
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,314
movies blocking up my uterus.
– uterus.

1306
01:01:53,495 --> 01:01:57,289
And I need to stop
using that reference of Indiana Jones.

1307
01:01:57,332 --> 01:02:02,343
I think that’s not appropriate when
talking about the reproductive system.

1308
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:03,460
It’s okay.

1309
01:02:03,538 --> 01:02:06,504
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

1310
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,645
and the fibroid has dissipated.

1311
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:12,391
– That’s great!
– Yes!

1312
01:02:12,486 --> 01:02:13,392
Wow!

1313
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:16,482
Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow…

1314
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,311
it allowed you to get pregnant.

1315
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:24,859
What?

1316
01:02:25,905 --> 01:02:28,228
You’re gonna have your third baby.

1317
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,230
Congratulations.

1318
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:34,353
No.

1319
01:02:34,979 --> 01:02:37,379
Yes.

1320
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,654
Would you like some water?

1321
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,646
That’s good news.

1322
01:02:47,795 --> 01:02:50,482
Another baby… at forty.

1323
01:02:51,046 --> 01:02:52,254
Debbie?

1324
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:54,703
I am thrilled.

1325
01:02:57,135 --> 01:03:00,187
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1326
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,031
So, you’re okay?

1327
01:03:05,008 --> 01:03:06,209
What a relief.

1328
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:09,620
I can finally relax now, you know?

1329
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:11,357
I spent like…

1330
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:19,184
It’s okay.

1331
01:03:21,325 --> 01:03:23,104
I’m so happy, you know,

1332
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:25,314
I really am. Cause… I mean…

1333
01:03:25,994 --> 01:03:27,114
It’s good.

1334
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,734
Great. Great.

1335
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,444
– Hey!
– Hey!

1336
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,317
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It’s the middle of the afternoon.

1337
01:04:25,353 --> 01:04:28,353
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1338
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:30,531
Look, I’m sorry about the record.

1339
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:34,835
You’re going through financial shit.
This is- this is what I live with.

1340
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:37,945
This is a horrible time
in human history. What is that?

1341
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,578
Something that might help
both of our situations.

1342
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:44,763
This… is a drawing… by John Lennon.

1343
01:04:45,003 --> 01:04:47,305
I got it ten years ago
for five thousand dollars.

1344
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:50,313
I don’t know how much it’s worth now.
Could be five, could be twenty.

1345
01:04:50,665 --> 01:04:52,834
I don’t want this.

1346
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,967
I don’t even like it.
I’m not gonna hang it up.

1347
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:57,420
It’s not for you to hang up.
It’s for you to sell.

1348
01:04:57,542 --> 01:04:59,823
That way I can give it to you
and you can make some money,

1349
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:01,761
and Debbie won’t know
that I’m giving you anything.

1350
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:04,777
Well, you’re not giving me money.
You’re giving me a project.

1351
01:05:04,855 --> 01:05:07,635
I don’t know how to sell this.
I’m not an art dealer.

1352
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:10,028
Sell it online.

1353
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:12,895
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1354
01:05:12,963 --> 01:05:15,304
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1355
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:17,625
All right. Don’t get snippy.

1356
01:05:18,108 --> 01:05:21,108
Just because you write a great song
doesn’t mean you can draw.

1357
01:05:21,445 --> 01:05:23,903
It’s incredible, Le-
John Lennon drew it.

1358
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:25,805
I think it’s a Ringo.

1359
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,594
Don’t beat me up if I get
three hundred dollars for it.

1360
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,202
Don’t take less than
sixty-five hundred for that.

1361
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,139
It’s very valuable.
It’s important to me.

1362
01:05:33,143 --> 01:05:34,920
I want you to sell it so I can help you.

1363
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:35,983
Okay.

1364
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,166
Alright. I’ll see you at my party.

1365
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,285
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1366
01:05:41,364 --> 01:05:42,184
No.

1367
01:05:42,345 --> 01:05:44,959
Don’t buy wine with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1368
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:46,365
– That’s mean.
– I love you.

1369
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:47,380
– Alright.
– Bye.

1370
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:50,507
How do I call eBay?

1371
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:54,417
Minnie called me of bitch,
what am I supposed to say?

1372
01:05:57,473 --> 01:05:59,564
But I think maybe
that might mean he likes me,

1373
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,179
I don’t know, can you believe he-
It’s really awkward.

1374
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:05,429
I think he might like you.

1375
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,758
She’s so cute. She’s so tall.

1376
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:13,312
I know. How did that happen?

1377
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:18,552
Do you ever wish
we had a bigger family?

1378
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:20,395
No, never for a second.

1379
01:06:22,325 --> 01:06:23,236
Never.

1380
01:06:23,534 --> 01:06:24,654
– Never. Never.
– Never?

1381
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:27,000
I love what we have.

1382
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,305
One? A breeze. Two? Brutal.

1383
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,594
Three? Put a bullet in my head.

1384
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:37,303
You know, I think about that gray-haired
pregnant lady from school

1385
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:39,164
and I just feel bad for her.

1386
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:41,186
And I feel bad for the kid.

1387
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,217
Can you imagine?

1388
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,629
All the other little kids, “Where’s your
mommy?”

1389
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:50,061
“Oh, she’s the one sitting in
that scooter eating a soft cracker.”

1390
01:06:50,226 --> 01:06:52,179
Kids don’t want to have old parents.

1391
01:06:52,764 --> 01:06:55,855
You know, it would also be nice for us
to spend some time apart.

1392
01:06:55,998 --> 01:06:58,831
Kind of rediscover who
we are individually.

1393
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,348
It would be so great to not
see you for like a chunk of time

1394
01:07:01,357 --> 01:07:03,520
so that I could really just miss you.

1395
01:07:04,334 --> 01:07:06,134
Remember when we used to miss each other?

1396
01:07:17,272 --> 01:07:19,191
Hey!
Hey, you!

1397
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,933
Yo, sup?

1398
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:22,709
Hey, I’m Sadie’s mom.

1399
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:25,096
Sadie…?

1400
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,203
Sadie, the one you chat
with on the internet?

1401
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:28,372
Nah, man. That ain’t me.

1402
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,354
Well, it was you, I saw your picture.

1403
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:34,635
Did you make a “Hot” list,
and not on put Sadie the “Hot” list?

1404
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,292
She was not on my list, no.

1405
01:07:36,307 --> 01:07:38,984
You know what I’m gonna do?
I’m gonna make my own “Hot” list.

1406
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:42,211
And you know what?
You’re on the “Not Hot” list.

1407
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:43,586
How does that feel?

1408
01:07:43,783 --> 01:07:45,894
It doesn’t bother me. I’m
comfortable with the way I am.

1409
01:07:46,113 --> 01:07:49,493
Maybe you shouldn’t be so comfortable
with yourself. You know why?

1410
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:52,548
You look like a miniature Tom Petty.

1411
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:54,171
How’s that feel? Huh?

1412
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:56,336
You think that haircut’s cool? It’s not.

1413
01:07:56,393 --> 01:07:59,383
It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards.

1414
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,969
You still comfortable with yourself?

1415
01:08:01,438 --> 01:08:03,309
Why are you wearing a tank top? Huh?

1416
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:07,512
So you can show off your bald pits,
you little hairless wonder?

1417
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:10,052
Cool tank top, man. Huh?

1418
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,982
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1419
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:18,260
on my daughter’s Facebook page,
just remember me.

1420
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:19,691
Remember me.

1421
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:23,668
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1422
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:25,151
Okay, I’m sorry.

1423
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:26,901
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

1424
01:08:27,792 --> 01:08:29,250
Well, you don’t- are you crying?

1425
01:08:29,294 --> 01:08:30,242
Just let me go.

1426
01:08:30,438 --> 01:08:32,092
Oh my… But you…

1427
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,326
I’m sorry.
– It’s okay.

1428
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,351
I’m de- I’m sorry.

1429
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:38,390
I’m not in my right head.

1430
01:08:38,538 --> 01:08:42,512
I understand. My mom is going
through menopause, too. It’s a hard time.

1431
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:44,574
What did you say?

1432
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,591
You’re going through menopause?

1433
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,615
I’m not going through menopause!

1434
01:08:47,638 --> 01:08:50,324
I’m not gonna go through
menopause for like twenty years.

1435
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:54,683
I’m pregnant you little bitch.
God damn it!

1436
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:56,312
God damn it!

1437
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:04,507
I’m going out with Desi to find out
if she’s stealing from us.

1438
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:06,841
I’ve got the Graham Parker concert.
Who’s gonna watch the kids?

1439
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,255
I don’t know. Figure it out.

1440
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:16,608
I kinda just wanted to talk.

1441
01:09:16,643 --> 01:09:20,567
I thought maybe we could go to
a coffee house or something?

1442
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:22,442
Oh, you want coffee?

1443
01:09:22,465 --> 01:09:24,822
This place has coffee,
they have all kinds of drinks.

1444
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,226
Uhm… better some place quiet, maybe?

1445
01:09:29,952 --> 01:09:33,660
This place can be quiet. The seats
there on the back are pretty quiet.

1446
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:36,696
What sport do you guys play?

1447
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,182
Uh, we play hockey.

1448
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:39,695
Oh, I like hockey.

1449
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:40,739
Who do you guys play for?

1450
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:42,874
We play for the Philadelphia Flyers.

1451
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:44,763
So you guys are all from Philadelphia?

1452
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:46,358
No. No.

1453
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:47,691
Actually none of us are.

1454
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:49,902
Do you guys still
have all of your teeth?

1455
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:52,259
Well, I’ve got all my teeth, except…

1456
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:54,154
These ones.

1457
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,490
You wanna try them on?

1458
01:09:55,514 --> 01:09:56,990
Yeah, I’ll do it.

1459
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:02,105
Do I look sexy?

1460
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:03,832
Yeah!

1461
01:10:13,806 --> 01:10:16,499
They definitely look way better
on her than they do on you.

1462
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:20,073
– Thank you.
– Very cute.

1463
01:10:20,295 --> 01:10:23,292
So, should we go to the quiet area?

1464
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:26,206
No no no, no, no…

1465
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:27,026
Where are you going?

1466
01:10:27,052 --> 01:10:29,674
We kind of have to have a
little business meeting tonight.

1467
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:32,293
Business meeting? Business girls, you have
to celebrate. We won tonight. Let’s go.

1468
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,788
I want to party with these winners,

1469
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:34,618
come on Deb!
– Yeah!

1470
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:37,035
Just come and stay, just dance with us.

1471
01:10:37,328 --> 01:10:39,122
– Okay.
– Yeah!

1472
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,614
Okay, let’s fucking dance!

1473
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:50,470
Don’t be shy, feel free to come down,
and fill up these empty seats.

1474
01:10:50,688 --> 01:10:53,303
Thank you so much for coming,
this is so exciting!

1475
01:10:54,352 --> 01:10:58,131
For the first time in over thirty years,

1476
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:00,576
Graham Parker and The Rumour.

1477
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:44,323
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

1478
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:46,274
It’s hard to watch a band…

1479
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:50,059
when you know all of them
remember D-Day.

1480
01:11:56,142 --> 01:11:57,726
Well, what’s press turnout like?

1481
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,912
Are you serious?

1482
01:12:01,015 --> 01:12:03,237
Nobody came!
Nobody.

1483
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:04,949
Nobody is here?

1484
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:06,848
Oh, the guy from Green Day is here.

1485
01:12:06,935 --> 01:12:09,182
Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him.
He’s a fan.

1486
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,964
You’ve got to get a photo
of the two of them.

1487
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,362
No, he says he doesn’t want to do
any press, he’s just watching the show.

1488
01:12:14,456 --> 01:12:16,086
Oh, how punk rock of him.

1489
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:18,545
“I don’t like- I don’t like photographs.”

1490
01:12:19,624 --> 01:12:20,996
Grow up, Green Day!

1491
01:12:21,072 --> 01:12:22,973
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck.

1492
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:04,744
You don’t have like- yeah, I wouldn’t
call them classically  good…

1493
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:08,547
dance moves, but you
left it all out there.

1494
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:10,383
It’s- you’re a blast to dance with.

1495
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,598
Thank you.

1496
01:13:11,693 --> 01:13:14,643
We’re having a little- a little
shindig at the hotel after this,

1497
01:13:14,646 --> 01:13:16,393
you should come by and, uh…

1498
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:18,273
and hang out, at the hotel.

1499
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:21,929
You want me to come to the hotel?

1500
01:13:22,024 --> 01:13:23,803
Yеѕ. Ι wаnt yоu tо соmе…

1501
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,529
by the hotel with me.

1502
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:29,947
Well, what would we do there?

1503
01:13:30,088 --> 01:13:34,117
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet, and
have fun, and kind of see where it goes.

1504
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,366
Do it like… adults do sometimes, and…

1505
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:41,465
Like… sex?

1506
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,376
Uh, I mean…

1507
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:47,548
if you want, if that’s
on the docket, but…

1508
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:49,640
I’m not trying to force that.

1509
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,922
So you would do sex with me?

1510
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:54,664
Do sex? What are you, Borat?

1511
01:13:55,153 --> 01:13:56,650
Are you hitting on me?

1512
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:00,549
Yes, yes, I’m hitting on you.
You’re hot and cool and nice and

1513
01:14:00,624 --> 01:14:02,129
you have beautiful eyes.

1514
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,913
I’m sorry.

1515
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,975
I’m married, I have two
kids, and I’m pregnant.

1516
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:15,096
That is what we call
the “hat trick.” Wow.

1517
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:17,602
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, I’m just…

1518
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,798
really enjoying you being so nice to me.

1519
01:14:21,577 --> 01:14:25,074
No, I- I hope this doesn’t
come off as super cheesy,

1520
01:14:25,655 --> 01:14:29,176
but uh, I think you’re a…
a very rare find.

1521
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:30,842
Thank you.

1522
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,856
And I would totally do sex with you.

1523
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:40,129
That was spectacular guys,
really well done, amazing.

1524
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:42,004
– Thank you.
– Good, good.

1525
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:44,072
Hey Graham!

1526
01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:45,314
Pete! How are you, man?

1527
01:14:45,853 --> 01:14:48,116
Well uh… the first numbers came in.

1528
01:14:48,398 --> 01:14:49,895
Yeah, right yeah. Uh…

1529
01:14:50,298 --> 01:14:52,098
Happy? How’s it looking?

1530
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:54,481
About half of your last record.

1531
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:57,574
Ah, so you were expecting it to sell.

1532
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,284
They never sell anymore.
They used to sell.

1533
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:04,206
But now they don’t. I’m not
a sexy sixteen-year-old girl.

1534
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:06,532
But I wanted to sell it.
It’s such a good record.

1535
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:07,825
I feel like I let you down.

1536
01:15:07,866 --> 01:15:11,723
Oh no, I’m gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

1537
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:13,896
I just got a song in Glee.

1538
01:15:14,121 --> 01:15:16,925
Guy in the wheelchair is going
to sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.

1539
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,411
I don’t know, I’ve never seen
the show, but that’s what I’m told.

1540
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:23,145
Secret is, make sure
you have a small nut.

1541
01:15:23,254 --> 01:15:25,036
That’s the key to life.

1542
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,916
Graham, I don’t have
small nuts, all right?

1543
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:29,104
I have big nuts.
And I need to provide for them.

1544
01:15:29,105 --> 01:15:30,220
Graham!

1545
01:15:30,455 --> 01:15:31,382
Hey, hey, what’s up?

1546
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:33,292
– Billie! Hey, buddy!
– How you doing, man?

1547
01:15:33,338 --> 01:15:35,281
– Great fucking show, man!
– I don’t get to see you!

1548
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,171
– Fuck, yeah!
– Thank you.

1549
01:15:37,184 --> 01:15:39,892
Like inspired. I wanna write
a fucking song right now.

1550
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:42,017
Inspired, huh? That inspires me.

1551
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,891
Let’s go get a drink.

1552
01:15:42,904 --> 01:15:43,709
Let’s get a drink.

1553
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:44,902
Alright.
You coming?

1554
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:47,511
No no, I’m… I’m fine, you guys go.

1555
01:15:47,954 --> 01:15:49,698
Congratulations on Glee.

1556
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:53,346
Yes, thank you. Right.
See you Pete.

1557
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:54,844
– Alright.
– Alright, see you.

1558
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:55,821
So long guys.

1559
01:15:56,642 --> 01:15:58,061
You got a song on Glee?

1560
01:15:58,085 --> 01:15:58,670
Yeah.

1561
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:01,243
That’s killer, that’s so much money, it’s-

1562
01:16:01,378 --> 01:16:02,751
It’s good that’s for all of us.

1563
01:16:32,474 --> 01:16:35,042
Why did you put that
guy’s teeth in your mouth?

1564
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:36,782
That’s so gross.

1565
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,661
He was dirty.

1566
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:41,831
No, he was wearing a tie.

1567
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:43,862
– That’s true.
– He wasn’t dirty.

1568
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:47,539
When I kissed him, I felt his
little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.

1569
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,924
– You did?
– Yeah.

1570
01:16:48,994 --> 01:16:52,026
It was like kissing a baby.
French kissing a baby.

1571
01:16:56,073 --> 01:16:58,536
Can I ask you something stupid?

1572
01:16:58,663 --> 01:17:01,645
 Do you know why we’re
missing money at the store?

1573
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,426
Are you guys missing money?

1574
01:17:03,516 --> 01:17:06,581
Yeah. Like twelve thousand dollars.

1575
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:08,449
Do you think I took it?

1576
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:14,510
No. I mean, I- well, no, I did,
and I don’t now. But I don’t-

1577
01:17:14,534 --> 01:17:15,344
It’s not me.

1578
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:20,578
Then, why do you live in such a nice
apartment and have such a fancy car?

1579
01:17:20,759 --> 01:17:24,006
Yes, you’re right. Uhm… Look.

1580
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:29,902
I… am… an escort.

1581
01:17:30,628 --> 01:17:33,625
I get paid to go out on dates.

1582
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:34,985
You…

1583
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:40,516
But only three to five times a year.
Ten times max.

1584
01:17:41,936 --> 01:17:47,793
But it’s not technically “prostitution”
because I don’t have to sleep with them.

1585
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:49,139
Ah well, that’s good.

1586
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:53,477
But I always do. That’s why I
only do it four to eight times a year,

1587
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:55,094
fifteen times max.

1588
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:56,391
Huh.

1589
01:17:56,574 --> 01:17:58,374
One year I did it twenty.

1590
01:17:58,563 --> 01:17:59,683
Well…

1591
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:01,714
As long as you think it’s safe.

1592
01:18:01,816 --> 01:18:02,936
It’s safe.

1593
01:18:03,056 --> 01:18:05,871
I only do it ten to thirty times a year.

1594
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:08,636
So, who do you think is stealing money?

1595
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:11,039
It’s fucking Jodi.

1596
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:11,922
No.

1597
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:14,133
Yeah. She’s a pilled-out whore.

1598
01:18:16,175 --> 01:18:17,295
Huh.

1599
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,933
Since you told me, I’m-
I want to tell you something.

1600
01:18:20,944 --> 01:18:22,504
You’re pregnant.

1601
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,527
How do you know?

1602
01:18:26,762 --> 01:18:27,882
Wow.

1603
01:18:28,553 --> 01:18:29,902
Maybe you should tell Pete.

1604
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:31,261
You didn’t tell Pete yet?

1605
01:18:31,308 --> 01:18:32,339
I haven’t told Pete.

1606
01:18:32,355 --> 01:18:33,027
Why?

1607
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:35,701
I don’t know.
I just want him to want me.

1608
01:18:35,726 --> 01:18:38,630
I don’t want him to want me because I’m pregnant.

1609
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:42,563
Go home and fucking suck his dick
and tell him then and he will love it.

1610
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,780
– You think?
– He’ll be so excited.

1611
01:18:45,076 --> 01:18:47,394
Or even better yet,
better yet-

1612
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,485
you should tell him
while you’re sucking his dick.

1613
01:18:50,555 --> 01:18:52,643
Look. “I’m pregnant.”

1614
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:00,067
What are you doing?

1615
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:02,333
I’m returning some emails.

1616
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:04,564
What time do you have to go to work?

1617
01:19:04,693 --> 01:19:06,330
Like ten minutes ago.

1618
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,936
You wanna be late?

1619
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,866
No, I can’t be late.
Not today.

1620
01:19:22,909 --> 01:19:26,063
Do you see me standing
here in front of you?

1621
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:28,141
Half-naked?

1622
01:19:33,528 --> 01:19:34,590
Yeah.

1623
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:39,576
And does that…
make you feel anything, or…?

1624
01:19:40,206 --> 01:19:42,485
Come on. Are you
trying to start a fight?

1625
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,283
No, I’m not trying
to start a fight with you.

1626
01:19:45,373 --> 01:19:46,775
I’m trying to fuck you!

1627
01:19:46,852 --> 01:19:48,443
Oh God, you know what? Just…

1628
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:52,713
Today of all days is the day
you need to cut me a break.

1629
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:54,533
All right?
– Whatever.

1630
01:19:55,033 --> 01:19:56,345
Oh God.

1631
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,040
What…?

1632
01:20:03,038 --> 01:20:06,038
I didn’t realize it was intentional!

1633
01:20:06,296 --> 01:20:09,496
I didn’t say anything because
I didn’t want you to be embarrassed.

1634
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:11,898
I thought I was being gallant.

1635
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,386
All right, fine, I’m an asshole.

1636
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:17,335
God.

1637
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:21,396
You know what your problem is?

1638
01:20:21,472 --> 01:20:24,935
You’re never ever in the moment,
you’re never ever present.

1639
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:26,822
You’re never in your body.

1640
01:20:26,877 --> 01:20:29,179
That’s not true.
I- I- I am in the moment.

1641
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:31,992
You know how I know? I want to
get the fuck out of the moment.

1642
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:33,817
I swear. It’s just- I can’t-

1643
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,989
I can’t win with you.
I just can’t do it.

1644
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:37,619
You can’t just walk away.

1645
01:20:37,721 --> 01:20:38,893
Oh, God.

1646
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:40,502
Hey!

1647
01:20:40,626 --> 01:20:42,814
How’s the record company going, Pete?

1648
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:44,827
What? Not great.

1649
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,397
I’m still waiting for
numbers to come in.

1650
01:20:49,023 --> 01:20:50,823
What have you heard?

1651
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:54,714
A couple numbers have trickled in.
It’s lower than we expected.

1652
01:20:56,847 --> 01:21:00,171
Then why are you giving Larry money?

1653
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:01,804
What?

1654
01:21:01,861 --> 01:21:04,500
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

1655
01:21:04,836 --> 01:21:06,983
Right, you know what? I don’t
want to get into some nasty fight.

1656
01:21:07,017 --> 01:21:10,303
So can we please talk to each other the way
the therapist told us to talk to each other?

1657
01:21:10,382 --> 01:21:12,186
Fine. Fine!

1658
01:21:13,226 --> 01:21:18,217
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

1659
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:23,342
I understand it makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

1660
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:26,991
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

1661
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:29,445
and corner me and try
and trick me into lying.

1662
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:30,667
Okay.

1663
01:21:30,906 --> 01:21:34,427
It makes me sad when it’s
so easy to trick you into lying

1664
01:21:34,434 --> 01:21:36,708
because you’re such a lying shitbag.

1665
01:21:36,857 --> 01:21:38,456
That’s not- you can’t do that.
You can’t do that,

1666
01:21:38,471 --> 01:21:40,753
the therapist said you’re
not allowed to judge me.

1667
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:42,710
That’s not a judgment.
That’s just a fact.

1668
01:21:43,558 --> 01:21:44,602
Fair enough.

1669
01:21:44,908 --> 01:21:48,587
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

1670
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,415
But it’s only because I’m scared to death

1671
01:21:51,446 --> 01:21:55,206
of your crazy-assed
illogical overreactions.

1672
01:21:55,246 --> 01:21:56,366
Well…

1673
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:01,577
It hurts me inside and triggers me
when you’re such a dishonest shit

1674
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:04,418
that you’re lending your father
money without telling me,

1675
01:22:04,475 --> 01:22:06,394
while your record company
is going bankrupt

1676
01:22:06,428 --> 01:22:09,863
and we’re on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

1677
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:25,552
What else are you lying about?

1678
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,974
I’ve taken Viagra for two years.

1679
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:34,209
I ate six muffins downstairs a while ago
and my cholesterol level is 305.

1680
01:22:34,374 --> 01:22:36,387
My heart could explode at any second.

1681
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:38,465
These might be my very last words.

1682
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:42,153
Oh! And I gave Charlotte antibiotics
when you weren’t looking.

1683
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:45,808
That’s why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

1684
01:22:47,473 --> 01:22:51,103
Are we even doing what we’re doing?

1685
01:22:51,894 --> 01:22:53,994
This is not making me happy.

1686
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:57,171
You’re not happy. You don’t like me.

1687
01:22:57,345 --> 01:23:01,085
I can feel that. I’m not blind.

1688
01:23:02,069 --> 01:23:06,111
Jesus. We’re like business associates.

1689
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:09,691
We’re like brother and sister.
There’s no passion there.

1690
01:23:09,714 --> 01:23:11,660
We’re not like brother and sister.
You know what we’re like?

1691
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:15,105
We’re like Simon and Garfunkel, and
somehow you turned me into Garfunkel.

1692
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:16,678
I don’t even know what that means!

1693
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:17,756
Art Garfunkel!

1694
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:21,451
What’s wrong with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

1695
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:23,926
He’s got an amazing voice.
He could put a harmony to anything,

1696
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,527
but what I’m saying is that
you turned me into him!

1697
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:27,987
What the hell are you talking about?

1698
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:29,885
What-
– Simon controls him!

1699
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:33,916
That’s because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

1700
01:23:34,216 --> 01:23:35,897
He’s the better one.

1701
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:37,584
You know what? I see
the way you look at our kids.

1702
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,974
You have so much love and
compassion for them.

1703
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:42,302
You never look at me like that. Ever.

1704
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:46,308
Would we even still be together if
I didn’t get pregnant fourteen y-?

1705
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:49,095
You know what? I’m not gonna
go down that road. That-

1706
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,360
Would we?

1707
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:07,811
Okay.

1708
01:24:11,024 --> 01:24:13,639
You know what? I don’t even
wanna have a party here.

1709
01:24:13,726 --> 01:24:15,107
You need to cancel it.

1710
01:24:15,253 --> 01:24:18,961
No, I’m not. I already paid for
the catering, I put down deposits,

1711
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:21,055
and I sure as fuck I’m not
gonna call everybody back

1712
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,278
in two days when you change your mind.

1713
01:24:29,516 --> 01:24:31,883
<i>Your girlfriend is not ugly.</i>

1714
01:24:33,141 --> 01:24:35,045
<i>Actually Larry, she’s not my girlfriend,</i>

1715
01:24:35,061 --> 01:24:37,076
<i>she’s just a-
– It’s cool, buddy.</i>

1716
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:39,081
<i>You don’t have to explain
your girlfriend to me.</i>

1717
01:24:39,113 --> 01:24:39,886
<i>But she’s not-</i>

1718
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:42,911
Can you please stop licking your fingers?

1719
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:47,149
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

1720
01:24:47,385 --> 01:24:49,274
And you’re putting them into your mouth.

1721
01:24:49,746 --> 01:24:51,392
That’s gross. Stop.

1722
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:56,303
Stop it!

1723
01:24:56,389 --> 01:24:57,191
I’m gonna kill you!

1724
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,152
Hey! Sadie! Enough!

1725
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:00,688
Alright, she isn’t hurting anyone.

1726
01:25:00,711 --> 01:25:02,547
You wanna say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

1727
01:25:02,559 --> 01:25:05,556
You have never been nice to her and
now she’s getting aggressive with you.

1728
01:25:05,571 --> 01:25:07,670
I told you this would happen.

1729
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:17,730
I’m sick of everybody fighting.

1730
01:25:57,234 --> 01:26:00,234
What do you think you’re going
to be like when you grow up?

1731
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:04,919
I don’t know. Hum…

1732
01:26:06,527 --> 01:26:07,793
I don’t know.

1733
01:26:08,683 --> 01:26:10,524
Do you think you want kids?

1734
01:26:11,038 --> 01:26:12,258
Mm-hmm. Just one.

1735
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,830
Just one? Why?

1736
01:26:13,899 --> 01:26:19,256
Because if I have two then the
other will fight with the other one.

1737
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,781
Does it make you sad when you fight?

1738
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:25,589
I don’t want anyone to fight.

1739
01:26:32,858 --> 01:26:34,418
I love you.

1740
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,306
Why isn’t anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

1741
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:12,105
It’s the sounds of silence.

1742
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,863
♪I don’t think that I can
really survive…

1743

♪I’m praying for the end of time,
it’s all that I can do

1744

1748
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,213
How many of those are you gonna eat?

1749
01:27:50,503 --> 01:27:51,706
As many as I want.

1750
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:53,914
I’m gonna tell Mom on you.

1751
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:55,999
Try it. See what you get for Christmas.

1752
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,707
Nothing.

1753
01:27:58,582 --> 01:28:00,817
Snitches wind up in ditches.

1754
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:02,976
Remember that.

Hey, Peter.

1756
01:28:09,374 --> 01:28:10,574
– Hi!
– Hi.

1757
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,808
Alright. It’s here.

1758
01:28:17,478 --> 01:28:18,835
Have a good one.

1759
01:28:19,476 --> 01:28:20,596
Peter?

1760
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:22,328
Peter!

1761
01:28:24,062 --> 01:28:24,895
Hi!

1762
01:28:25,036 --> 01:28:26,156
Catherine.

1763
01:28:26,273 --> 01:28:27,614
I’m Joseph’s mother.

1764
01:28:27,673 --> 01:28:29,811
Oh, right. No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

1765
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:32,389
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

1766
01:28:32,429 --> 01:28:33,801
I… Sorry.

1767
01:28:34,169 --> 01:28:35,463
Hello, Joseph.

1768
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:39,799
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

1769
01:28:39,884 --> 01:28:42,625
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son,

1770
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:43,664
and I don’t appreciate it.

1771
01:28:43,716 --> 01:28:44,492
Excuse me?

1772
01:28:44,531 --> 01:28:46,396
She screamed at my son.

1773
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:49,980
Right? She threatened you?
She cursed at him.

1774
01:28:50,187 --> 01:28:51,880
Hey, he’s thirteen years
old for god’s sake.

1775
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:53,512
What the hell is the matter with her?

1776
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:55,950
Hey, you better check her meds
and get them right.

1777
01:28:56,678 --> 01:28:58,950
Okay, you know,
why don’t- why don’t you…

1778
01:28:59,162 --> 01:29:03,043
back the fuck off, because that’s my
lovely, sweet wife you’re talking about.

1779
01:29:03,096 --> 01:29:04,527
– Oh, I need to back off?
– Yeah, you need to back off,

1780
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:07,671
’cause your kid is an animal.
He’s a fucking animal.

1781
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:09,939
Why don’t you put him on a leash?
– Turn around. Turn around, turn around!

1782
01:29:09,994 --> 01:29:10,931
Turn around!

1783
01:29:11,033 --> 01:29:14,124
He insults my daughter again,
I’m gonna hit him with my fucking car.

1784
01:29:14,298 --> 01:29:17,191
Got it? In fact, if you insult my wife
again, you know what I’m gonna do?

1785
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,044
I’m gonna show up at your
house when you’re sleeping,

1786
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:22,029
and I’ll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac,

1787
01:29:22,045 --> 01:29:23,722
and I’ll shove them up your fucking iCunt.

1788
01:29:23,738 --> 01:29:27,009
I’ve got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

1789
01:29:27,044 --> 01:29:30,642
My kid is a fucking angel.
I don’t have time for this shit.

1790
01:29:30,693 --> 01:29:33,940
So I’m keeping it together.
But if I wasn’t at school right now…

1791
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,805
You touched my…
touched me?

1792
01:29:37,964 --> 01:29:40,035
– I didn’t touch you.
– You touched my upper breast!

1793
01:29:40,072 --> 01:29:42,241
I didn’t. I didn’t. I got right
below your shoulder.

1794
01:29:42,296 --> 01:29:45,179
You got right here. You actually-
He hit my nipple!

1795
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:46,061
You what?

1796
01:29:46,234 --> 01:29:47,153
You’re insane!

1797
01:29:47,168 --> 01:29:48,177
Why would you do that?

1798
01:29:48,187 --> 01:29:49,286
Did you just touch my mom’s nipple?

1799
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:51,831
He just touched my nipple!
Why would you do that to me?

1800
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,104
I poked you on the shoulder.

1801
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:54,573
I have very high nipples.

1802
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:55,820
I touched your shirt.

1803
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:57,172
What do you think is under my shirt?

1804
01:29:57,177 --> 01:29:58,609
– I just touched-
– My breasts are under my shirt.

1805
01:29:58,624 --> 01:30:00,504
Your shoulder, your shoulder.
He just touched my breast.

1806
01:30:00,527 --> 01:30:03,470
Well, that’s a funny place
to put a shoulder. On my boob!

1807
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:05,493
Hello! There are children around.

1808
01:30:05,604 --> 01:30:08,604
This isn’t over. This is not over.
You’re gonna be sorry.

1809
01:30:08,672 --> 01:30:10,961
Let’s go. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

1810
01:30:11,089 --> 01:30:13,398
And why the fuck would you believe Desi?

1811
01:30:13,637 --> 01:30:15,437
You just admitted it.

1812
01:30:16,047 --> 01:30:16,930
Did I?

1813
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,897
You stole twelve thousand
dollars from me Jodi,

1814
01:30:19,906 --> 01:30:21,755
and I need you to pay me back.

1815
01:30:21,869 --> 01:30:24,154
Can you at least give me a referral?

1816
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:27,862
You babysat my kids
while you were on Oxycontin.

1817
01:30:27,904 --> 01:30:29,019
Oxycodon.

1818
01:30:29,058 --> 01:30:30,433
Well, Oxycodon.

1819
01:30:30,464 --> 01:30:31,584
Oxyconten.

1820
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:32,734
Oxyconten?

1821
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:33,805
Oxykitten.

1822
01:30:33,919 --> 01:30:35,297
What’s Oxykitten?

1823
01:30:35,673 --> 01:30:36,485
Meow.

1824
01:30:36,693 --> 01:30:40,589
Jodi. You put me in danger.
Me and my family.

1825
01:30:40,748 --> 01:30:42,269
It was a cry for help!

1826
01:30:42,925 --> 01:30:44,045
Help!

1827
01:30:44,425 --> 01:30:45,545
Help.

1828
01:30:45,682 --> 01:30:47,390
Why don’t you help me?

1829
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,679
Why don’t you help me?
Just help.

1830
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:51,514
Just Help.

1831
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:53,771
Just Help.

1832
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:55,967
Why don’t you help me?

1833
01:30:56,162 --> 01:30:57,597
Are you high right now?

1834
01:30:57,714 --> 01:30:59,769
Help me!

1835
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:03,999
Is that about me?

1836
01:31:04,056 --> 01:31:05,195
Is that the cops?

1837
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:06,781
Is this a set-up?

1838
01:31:06,854 --> 01:31:08,414
I need to go.

1839
01:31:08,492 --> 01:31:10,116
Okay, see you later.

1840
01:31:10,864 --> 01:31:12,666
Fuck you, Debbie.

1841
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,885
Fuck. You.

1842
01:31:16,065 --> 01:31:19,242
Joseph was very upset
when I spoke to him about this,

1843
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:22,306
so I thought it was important that we…

1844
01:31:23,067 --> 01:31:24,837
join together and work this through.

1845
01:31:24,923 --> 01:31:26,288
Absolutely.

1846
01:31:26,412 --> 01:31:28,659
Uh, we’re gonna work through it, but

1847
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,186
Debbie, uh told my son that

1848
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:34,366
he looked like Tom Petty,
in a negative way--

1849
01:31:34,435 --> 01:31:35,396
Who’s Tom Petty?

1850
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,245
You know who Tom Petty is.

1851
01:31:37,422 --> 01:31:40,380
And she said that if she had to
come back, that she was going

1852
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:43,854
to “F-up his pussy ass.”

1853
01:31:44,048 --> 01:31:45,817
Which is what she said.

1854
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:49,169
Are you serious? I didn’t.

1855
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:51,700
I would never. To a child?

1856
01:31:52,023 --> 01:31:57,371
Your son has been defiling my daughter’s
Facebook page now for months.

1857
01:31:57,558 --> 01:31:59,036
These people are liars.

1858
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:01,090
He said that my son was an animal,

1859
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:04,729
and that if I didn’t keep him on a leash
that he would hit him with his car.

1860
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:05,928
Did you say that?

1861
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,714
That’s- that’s ridiculous.

1862
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,288
Who talks like that?
– You do.

1863
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:10,210
He didn’t say that.

1864
01:32:10,253 --> 01:32:12,594
– Alright, you know, no, what I said,
– He said it to me!

1865
01:32:12,702 --> 01:32:15,137
was that we need to keep
an extra eye on our kids

1866
01:32:15,147 --> 01:32:17,941
because with all the
technological advances,

1867
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:20,254
they need to learn
to use them responsibly.

1868
01:32:20,277 --> 01:32:22,399
No, No. What he- what he said to me,

1869
01:32:22,408 --> 01:32:23,571
was- he called me an “iCunt.”

1870
01:32:23,588 --> 01:32:25,251
– A what?
– Language, Catherine, language!

1871
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,353
I’m quoting him!

1872
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:30,740
How am I gonna relay what these
two nutballs said to me unless I say it.

1873
01:32:30,758 --> 01:32:32,562
Can you please not talk
like that, Catherine?

1874
01:32:32,563 --> 01:32:34,115
Music Man is rehearsing next door.

1875
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:35,912
Sorry, fucking Music Man.

1876
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:39,817
Maybe if I looked more like
this fake bullshit couple,

1877
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:41,504
looks like they’re in a bank commercial.

1878
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,768
That’s what you look like.

1879
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:45,206
Like you’re a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

1880
01:32:45,356 --> 01:32:47,924
None of this talk is productive.

1881
01:32:47,944 --> 01:32:50,762
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

1882
01:32:50,785 --> 01:32:54,167
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

1883
01:32:54,299 --> 01:32:55,954
You’re just really scaring me.

1884
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,210
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

1885
01:32:58,256 --> 01:33:00,655
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

1886
01:33:00,726 --> 01:33:01,926
I’ll chew through you.

1887
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:03,516
Catherine, you’re better than this.

1888
01:33:03,552 --> 01:33:06,344
Fuck you, Jill. You’re
a horrible fucking woman.

1889
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,941
This is why everybody hates you, Jill.
This kinda shit.

1890
01:33:10,098 --> 01:33:13,410
Ineffective, fucking bullshit hair.

1891
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,127
And I’m glad your husband died.

1892
01:33:16,548 --> 01:33:19,577
Because you’re a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

1893
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:22,405
Okay, Catherine, I think we
know what’s happening now.

1894
01:33:23,132 --> 01:33:25,225
Now you know what we’re dealing with.

1895
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:10,557
I’m not gonna eat that chicken.

1896
01:34:10,805 --> 01:34:12,002
Why not?

1897
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:15,079
Because I feel like
I’m gonna be a vegetarian.

1898
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:16,875
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?

1899
01:34:16,914 --> 01:34:17,563
Huh-huh.

1900
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:20,045
You guys have been reading my texts?

1901
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,451
No, we haven’t.

1902
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,467
Yes, we have.

1903
01:34:22,498 --> 01:34:24,323
We’re supposed to keep an eye on you.

1904
01:34:24,396 --> 01:34:25,636
How did you find out?

1905
01:34:25,683 --> 01:34:28,758
Joseph told me that you
flipped out on him and his mom,

1906
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:30,915
and that you guys are nuts, and I agree.

1907
01:34:30,952 --> 01:34:32,752
Alright. Don’t be disrespectful.

1908
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:36,921
You are the ones who are disrespectful.
Reading my texts is like reading my diary.

1909
01:34:36,959 --> 01:34:40,207
And you were really sweet on your iChat.
We were really proud of you.

1910
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:42,626
Yeah, we were gonna give you
your computer and phone back.

1911
01:34:42,638 --> 01:34:43,860
Fuck you!

1912
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:46,658
Okay, there’s the first
official “Fuck you.”

1913
01:34:46,705 --> 01:34:49,611
Okay, that is not how we talk
to each other in this house.

1914
01:34:49,653 --> 01:34:52,838
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time!

1915
01:34:53,089 --> 01:34:56,649
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

1916
01:34:56,913 --> 01:35:00,793
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

1917
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:02,769
Shut up, Charlotte.

1918
01:35:02,819 --> 01:35:06,808
You guys so desperately want me
to be perfect and to make no mistakes.

1919
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:09,191
Well, you two are fucking insane.

1920
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:10,090
Okay.

1921
01:35:10,143 --> 01:35:13,243
All you do is fight. Or you
don’t fight, which is even worse

1922
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,708
’cause it looks like you
hate each other for weeks.

1923
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:18,198
You obsess over every little thing I do,

1924
01:35:18,215 --> 01:35:22,330
and you don’t trust in me or believe in
me, well I’m fucking sick of it!

1925
01:35:22,628 --> 01:35:24,141
Yeah, I said “fuck.”

1926
01:35:24,332 --> 01:35:25,805
Fuck fuck fuck.

1927
01:35:25,956 --> 01:35:30,391
Ground me forever I don’t care.
I don’t care about anything.

1928
01:35:31,128 --> 01:35:37,227
I hate everything, everyone’s going crazy,
I don’t care if I have no friends.

1929
01:35:37,915 --> 01:35:39,868
Are you still upset about Lost?

1930
01:35:39,963 --> 01:35:41,343
Of course I’m upset about Lost!

1931
01:35:41,354 --> 01:35:45,335
You guys took away my shit before
I could watch the last two episodes!

1932
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,779
Now I don’t know what the fuck happens!

1933
01:35:52,388 --> 01:35:54,565
She’s becoming just like us.

1934
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:59,541
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

1935
01:36:12,401 --> 01:36:14,213
Where did you find these?

1936
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:15,994
I stole them.

1937
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,210
Thank you.

1938
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:25,637
No big deal.

1939
01:36:29,262 --> 01:36:32,541
Our kids are crazy.
And it’s our fault.

1940
01:36:33,225 --> 01:36:36,449
But do you think there’s anything
we can do to turn it around, or…?

1941
01:36:36,482 --> 01:36:39,402
Sadie’s thirteen.
She might be a lost cause.

1942
01:36:39,442 --> 01:36:42,744
I mean, where did she learn that kind
of language? We don’t talk like that.

1943
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,445
I have no fucking idea…

1944
01:36:44,844 --> 01:36:47,664
Do you think Sadie is
this crazy because of us?

1945
01:36:47,744 --> 01:36:50,483
Or is it hormones and Lost.

1946
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:54,524
J. J. Abrams.
He’s ruining our daughter.

1947
01:36:54,571 --> 01:36:55,329
Yeah.

1948
01:36:55,368 --> 01:36:57,048
That fucking geek.

1949
01:36:57,151 --> 01:36:59,758
I feel bad for us!
I feel bad for us.

1950
01:36:59,798 --> 01:37:03,764
All of a sudden we’re like
a magnet for negativity.

1951
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:05,788
Why do people keep attacking us?

1952
01:37:06,341 --> 01:37:09,838
What did we do?
We’re just doing our best.

1953
01:37:10,472 --> 01:37:11,979
Should we talk about our fight?

1954
01:37:12,151 --> 01:37:17,101
I think we’re under enough pressure.
Let’s just let it go this time.

1955
01:37:17,443 --> 01:37:18,643
Yeah.

1956
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,260
We can give each other a break.

1957
01:37:20,302 --> 01:37:22,362
Alright, great. Thank you.

1958
01:37:22,465 --> 01:37:25,573
And I’m sorry about my dad.
You’re right. This is…

1959
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:30,646
I’m sorry that he’s just an endless mooch.

1960
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:36,031
The truth is, this isn’t about us.
It’s about our parents.

1961
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:38,993
We’re not even mad at each other.
We’re mad at them.

1962
01:37:39,008 --> 01:37:40,774
Exactly!
Exactly.

1963
01:37:40,841 --> 01:37:44,346
Let’s just take away our
parents’ power by loving them.

1964
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:45,870
Can we do that?

1965
01:37:46,347 --> 01:37:47,547
Yes.

1966
01:37:48,116 --> 01:37:49,422
Thank God.

1967
01:37:49,606 --> 01:37:52,006
I kind of feel better already, do you?

1968
01:37:52,145 --> 01:37:53,392
Do you?
– I- I do.

1969
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:55,689
– I love you.
– I love you too.

1970
01:38:00,607 --> 01:38:02,482
It’s not us, it’s them.

1971
01:38:02,665 --> 01:38:04,225
Totally.

1972
01:38:15,527 --> 01:38:17,691
What are you doing?
We have to get ready for the party.

1973
01:38:17,722 --> 01:38:20,535
I just watched the last episode of Lost.

1974
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:23,228
Okay.

1975
01:38:23,592 --> 01:38:26,441
You know what? We don’t
have time for this right now.

1976
01:38:26,668 --> 01:38:29,332
We have a lot of people coming over--
– They’re all dead.

1977
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:31,056
What?

1978
01:38:31,451 --> 01:38:33,870
Jack… Kate…

1979
01:38:34,824 --> 01:38:36,284
Sawyer…
– I don’t care

1980
01:38:36,313 --> 01:38:37,279
– about the show
– Jin…

1981
01:38:37,325 --> 01:38:39,092
– right now. Okay?
– Sun…

1982
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:40,280
– I need you to just get in the shower,
– Walt…

1983
01:38:40,298 --> 01:38:42,561
Get dressed. Let’s just put it on hold!
Juliet…

1984
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,405
All those people.

1985
01:38:44,445 --> 01:38:47,708
Don’t think about Lost today.
Tomorrow: Lost. All day.

1986
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:51,139
I can’t wait to hear about it.
Jack? No way. Really?

1987
01:38:51,177 --> 01:38:52,482
Right now, shower.

1988
01:38:52,532 --> 01:38:55,209
I don’t make fun of
your stupid Mad Men!

1989
01:38:55,284 --> 01:38:57,568
First of all, I don’t get
worked up over Mad Men.

1990
01:38:57,594 --> 01:38:59,264
That’s ’cause Mad Men sucks!

1991
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:01,300
What Don Draper has gone through

1992
01:39:01,357 --> 01:39:04,504
beats whatever Jack is running
from on some fucking island.

1993
01:39:04,531 --> 01:39:07,433
A bunch of people smoking
in an office, it’s stupid.

1994
01:39:07,488 --> 01:39:09,509
Wait wait, I’m not-
you’re getting me off topic.

1995
01:39:09,555 --> 01:39:11,407
Just please get dressed.

1996
01:39:16,273 --> 01:39:17,896
Hello!
Hi!

1997
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,551
I am so glad you’re here.
– Yeah.

1998
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:21,436
I need a buffer in case it gets weird.

1999
01:39:21,501 --> 01:39:23,217
Oh! Well, I’m ready to buff.

2000
01:39:23,613 --> 01:39:25,920
– Rіght. Grаb thеѕе nарkіnѕ.
– Lеt’ѕ buff.

2001
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:31,710
So uh, so that’s the
girl who works, uh,

2002
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,105
that’s the girl who works for you.

2003
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,464
– Yeah, that’s her.
– .. works for Debbie.

2004
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:36,622
Seems nice.

2005
01:39:37,197 --> 01:39:39,497
My wife would never let me
have a hot employee like that.

2006
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,591
– Yeah?
– No.

2007
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,644
Every woman that works for us…

2008
01:39:42,793 --> 01:39:45,153
looks like they’ve been in
some kind of horrible accident.

2009
01:39:50,772 --> 01:39:53,772
You’re comfortable with
that around your husband?

2010
01:39:54,302 --> 01:39:56,702
Aw. Pete wouldn’t know
what to do with that.

2011
01:39:57,522 --> 01:39:59,408
You think our wives
are looking at us right now?

2012
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:00,673
– Oh, definitely.
– Yeah.

2013
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:02,890
They look like pedophiles.

2014
01:40:08,656 --> 01:40:09,466
Thank you.

2015
01:40:09,505 --> 01:40:12,065
.. And the girls are so excited.
They’re all outside.

2016
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,963
– Hi. Happy birthday.
– Hi. Oh thank you very much.

2017
01:40:14,003 --> 01:40:15,930
– Hey. How are you, man?
– How are you?

2018
01:40:15,946 --> 01:40:16,969
Good to see you.

2019
01:40:17,001 --> 01:40:20,139
Happy birthday Pete,
how wonderful to see you!

2020
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,988
– Grandma Molly!
– Oh you’re wonderful.

2021
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:24,738
And look at my gorgeous, gorgeous…

2022
01:40:24,839 --> 01:40:25,961
Gorgeous!

2023
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,969
No. I get that, I’m just
wondering why I should-

2024
01:40:28,003 --> 01:40:30,196
Hey, Pete! Pete! Jason’s here.

2025
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:31,495
Peter. Hi.

2026
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:33,398
– Hey, how’s it going, Jason?
– Great, you look well.

2027
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:34,690
– Thank you.
– Yeah.

2028
01:40:34,703 --> 01:40:36,708
How do you like what
I’ve been doing to your girl?

2029
01:40:36,727 --> 01:40:38,451
How do you like Debbie’s after body?

2030
01:40:38,487 --> 01:40:40,016
– It’s nice.
– Come on, show ‘em.

2031
01:40:40,247 --> 01:40:42,010
Look at this.
It’s beautiful.

2032
01:40:42,044 --> 01:40:43,463
Look at that afterass.

2033
01:40:43,518 --> 01:40:45,570
Now it starts here…

2034
01:40:45,818 --> 01:40:47,969
but it used to start here…

2035
01:40:48,012 --> 01:40:49,986
and I brought it up.

2036
01:40:51,018 --> 01:40:52,697
You’re welcome.

2037
01:40:52,723 --> 01:40:55,033
Sir, are- are you a trainer?

2038
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:56,976
– Yes.
– Huh.

2039
01:40:57,046 --> 01:40:59,702
Well. But not just physical.
Spiritual.

2040
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:01,215
I’m sort of a guide.
– Mm-hmm.

2041
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,943
You guys should talk.
I think you’ll-

2042
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,450
– Du- uh…
– you’ll… get along.

2043
01:41:05,698 --> 01:41:07,463
Come here, honey,
I gotta tell you something.

2044
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:08,615
Yeah.

2045
01:41:17,534 --> 01:41:18,737
Who’s that in the pool?

2046
01:41:18,771 --> 01:41:19,971
Mine.

2047
01:41:22,956 --> 01:41:24,062
Hello.

2048
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,711
Hello, Debbie.

2049
01:41:24,742 --> 01:41:25,735
How are you?

2050
01:41:25,736 --> 01:41:26,562
Good

2051
01:41:26,715 --> 01:41:28,515
Remember my husband, Pete?

2052
01:41:28,578 --> 01:41:31,880
Oh right, yes! I- I didn’t
recognize you with the long hair.

2053
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,411
Oh yeah, I- no, I’ve been growing it.

2054
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,283
Happy birthday.

2055
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:37,237
Oh! Thank you so much!

2056
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,479
Very old scotch.

2057
01:41:38,527 --> 01:41:41,837
Oh, wow. You know,
I- I hope it hasn’t expired.

2058
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,892
No, scotch doesn’t expire.

2059
01:41:45,822 --> 01:41:47,229
It improves with age.

2060
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,139
Yeah. No, I know.
Uh, thank you so much.

2061
01:41:52,195 --> 01:41:53,770
Nice.
Come on in!

2062
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:55,014
– Sure.
– Sorry.

2063
01:41:58,585 --> 01:42:01,340
So uh, what do you do in Chino, Oliver?

2064
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:02,255
I am a surgeon.

2065
01:42:02,278 --> 01:42:04,215
– Wow. What kind?
– That’s great.

2066
01:42:04,892 --> 01:42:06,171
Mainly of the spine.

2067
01:42:07,026 --> 01:42:10,225
My specialty is scoliosis surgery.

2068
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:13,989
Now my mom used to talk
to me like I had a scoliosis

2069
01:42:13,997 --> 01:42:17,004
’cause I’m, you know, a little hunchy,
but that’s a different thing.

2070
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:18,896
No, you definitely don’t look right.

2071
01:42:18,943 --> 01:42:20,099
– Hey!
– Hey!

2072
01:42:20,201 --> 01:42:22,185
– Hey!
– Sorry we’re late!

2073
01:42:22,242 --> 01:42:24,403
I was in the lab cloning myself.

2074
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,546
We’re gonna have another
seven more tomorrow.

2075
01:42:26,587 --> 01:42:29,834
We cut their hair different so
we can finally tell who they are!

2076
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:31,866
You like the new haircut, Travis?

2077
01:42:31,912 --> 01:42:33,264
I’m Jack, damn it!

2078
01:42:33,304 --> 01:42:34,958
Oh, of course.

2079
01:42:35,038 --> 01:42:36,838
Larry, this is my father.

2080
01:42:37,174 --> 01:42:38,234
Really?

2081
01:42:38,915 --> 01:42:40,304
How are you?

2082
01:42:40,341 --> 01:42:42,257
– Oliver.
– Oliver? Oh!

2083
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,052
“Can I have some more?”

2084
01:42:44,328 --> 01:42:47,099
“Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel.”

2085
01:42:47,132 --> 01:42:48,317
 I love that movie.

2086
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:50,520
You must get that all the time.

2087
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:51,092
Not really.

2088
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:52,908
My nose itches right here.

2089
01:42:52,934 --> 01:42:55,392
I’m sorry, excuse me. I’m
Claire, and I’m Larry’s wife.

2090
01:42:55,428 --> 01:42:58,136
Very nice to see you, but
I’m gonna go get the kids.

2091
01:42:58,788 --> 01:43:01,082
We won’t see her now for the whole day.

2092
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,074
I’d help honey, but you know, I’ve got
the blood pressure, and I don’t want to.

2093
01:43:05,223 --> 01:43:06,338
Can I get you a drink Dad?

2094
01:43:06,361 --> 01:43:07,127
– Yeah.
– Want something?

2095
01:43:07,146 --> 01:43:08,166
A white wine.

2096
01:43:08,197 --> 01:43:09,025
– White wine?
– Yeah.

2097
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,595
– Oh, heavy stuff.
– Yeah.

2098
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,156
So, who knew that Debbie had a dad!

2099
01:43:14,635 --> 01:43:19,351
Where have you been for fifteen years?
Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, or

2100
01:43:19,407 --> 01:43:22,788
Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out
of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?

2101
01:43:22,869 --> 01:43:24,390
Yeah, my wife’s at home.

2102
01:43:24,423 --> 01:43:25,587
Oh, why- why didn’t she come?

2103
01:43:25,626 --> 01:43:28,108
A construction.
They’re sanding our deck.

2104
01:43:28,257 --> 01:43:29,897
You let the woman sand the deck?

2105
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:32,146
She supervises it, yes.

2106
01:43:32,193 --> 01:43:33,021
Okay.

2107
01:43:33,068 --> 01:43:34,214
Hey, guys.

2108
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:35,924
Hey!

2109
01:43:35,972 --> 01:43:40,361
Look how big the kids are!
Sadie!

2110
01:43:40,787 --> 01:43:41,941
Hi, Larry.

2111
01:43:42,003 --> 01:43:43,269
Hi, Sadie.

2112
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,245
Mom. Who- who’s Oliver?

2113
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:47,821
What do you mean?

2114
01:43:47,904 --> 01:43:48,907
Is he your dad?

2115
01:43:49,064 --> 01:43:51,954
Is he my Da-
He is my biological father.

2116
01:43:52,587 --> 01:43:53,920
What does that mean?

2117
01:43:53,989 --> 01:43:57,752
Hm, it means that my mum, grandma-

2118
01:43:57,954 --> 01:44:01,092
he and my mom had a baby and that was me!

2119
01:44:01,263 --> 01:44:03,063
Oh, so you’re our grandpa.

2120
01:44:03,649 --> 01:44:05,764
Uh, well, why don’t you ask your mother?

2121
01:44:05,928 --> 01:44:06,896
Yeah.

2122
01:44:07,003 --> 01:44:10,032
I guess so then, that would make
him your grandfather, then yes.

2123
01:44:10,129 --> 01:44:11,110
Do you want him to be?

2124
01:44:11,124 --> 01:44:14,124
Yes. Then we get another
grandpa. Come on!

2125
01:44:14,536 --> 01:44:15,656
Wha…?

2126
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:18,651
– Another Grandpa?!
– Trampoline time.

2127
01:44:20,218 --> 01:44:22,653
Yeah that was deeply uncomfortable.

2128
01:44:23,877 --> 01:44:27,859
At least that pretty girl was
here to divert our attention.

2129
01:44:44,242 --> 01:44:47,817
Oh. My gosh, hi. Me or mine,
I did not see you there.

2130
01:44:47,853 --> 01:44:49,452
– Hi.
– I saw you there.

2131
01:44:49,507 --> 01:44:52,428
Did you guys come together?
Are you… a couple?

2132
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:57,114
– No, we didn’t come together.
– No. No. Absolutely not.

2133
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:59,068
I just- I’m sorry, I thought it was a-

2134
01:44:59,187 --> 01:45:00,536
the mustache is a little…

2135
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:02,052
Hmm. That’s fair.

2136
01:45:02,093 --> 01:45:02,981
I just assumed.

2137
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:04,958
This is a straight man mustache.

2138
01:45:05,225 --> 01:45:10,457
What is the different between a gay man’s
mustache and a… straight man’s mustache?

2139
01:45:10,829 --> 01:45:12,105
The smell.

2140
01:45:15,234 --> 01:45:17,034
Ah. Excuse me.

2141
01:45:22,994 --> 01:45:29,787
So, spinal surgery, it just seems to me
to be at the top of the surgery chain.

2142
01:45:30,068 --> 01:45:32,565
Well, we’re not cardio, we’re not neuro…

2143
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:36,165
but I like to think we’re
an important part of the spectrum.

2144
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,665
Do you operate every single day?

2145
01:45:37,697 --> 01:45:38,501
Most days.

2146
01:45:38,626 --> 01:45:39,842
Multiple times a day?

2147
01:45:39,926 --> 01:45:41,655
Three, four times.

2148
01:45:41,757 --> 01:45:45,036
So what’s the price range?
Like if I wanted a--

2149
01:45:45,249 --> 01:45:47,049
– I- I’d rather not say.
– Oh I’m ju--

2150
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:49,911
It’s so big you’re embarrassed to say.

2151
01:45:50,175 --> 01:45:51,821
I wouldn’t say embarrassed.

2152
01:45:52,091 --> 01:45:53,602
Are there hunchbacks today?

2153
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,224
– Of course.
– I’ve never seen one.

2154
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:57,427
Well, that’s because
there are spinal surgeons.

2155
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,637
That’s ’cause of you.

2156
01:45:58,694 --> 01:46:02,653
Each time I don’t see a hunchback,
you’re getting that much richer.

2157
01:46:03,786 --> 01:46:05,221
You like The Beatles, don’t you?

2158
01:46:06,065 --> 01:46:07,244
Who doesn’t like The Beatles?

2159
01:46:07,312 --> 01:46:08,643
– Nobody.
– No. Nobody.

2160
01:46:10,424 --> 01:46:12,380
So funny. He’s so funny.

2161
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:14,040
What is your sun sign?

2162
01:46:14,312 --> 01:46:15,157
Libra.

2163
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,563
– Oh, boy.
– That’s not good.

2164
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:17,313
No, sir.

2165
01:46:17,326 --> 01:46:19,331
That’s not good.
Not for me, that’s not good.

2166
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:21,141
Sexually we are completely incompatible.

2167
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,407
– Absolutely.
– That’s not true.

2168
01:46:22,415 --> 01:46:23,928
– Right?
– That’s such a shame. Yeah.

2169
01:46:23,975 --> 01:46:25,629
No, it’s- I mean, as bad as it gets.

2170
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:27,347
– You don’t know.
– What is yours?

2171
01:46:28,043 --> 01:46:29,603
I’m a Cancer.

2172
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:31,803
– Really?
– Is that good?

2173
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,644
Wow.

2174
01:46:32,682 --> 01:46:34,482
– What does that mean?
– That’s kind of strange. Well,

2175
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:37,832
Taurus and Cancers are sort
of soul mates of the Zodiac.

2176
01:46:37,897 --> 01:46:41,566
We’re like perfectly compatible,
and I balance what you lack,

2177
01:46:41,582 --> 01:46:43,262
and you make up for what I lack.

2178
01:46:43,308 --> 01:46:48,087
And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.

2179
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:51,502
You’re making me embarra-

2180
01:46:51,635 --> 01:46:53,908
Thank you. Thank you.

2181
01:46:55,382 --> 01:46:57,465
Oh! I wanted to make a toast.

2182
01:46:57,848 --> 01:47:00,877
Thank you guys so much for coming,
thank you so much. Um…

2183
01:47:01,169 --> 01:47:02,729
Pete’s turning forty, and…

2184
01:47:02,863 --> 01:47:04,112
– Weird.
– and,

2185
01:47:04,134 --> 01:47:07,951
we’re ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open hearts.

2186
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,529
Ready to just choose joy and…
and forgive everybody.

2187
01:47:12,562 --> 01:47:14,154
So, thank you all for coming.

2188
01:47:14,217 --> 01:47:16,027
– Cheers.
– Wait!

2189
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,730
Forgive who?

2190
01:47:17,833 --> 01:47:21,221
Oh I think she just means
in a general sense. You know, just…

2191
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:23,385
Put the past behind us, and--

2192
01:47:23,426 --> 01:47:24,603
Live without resentments.

2193
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:27,212
But specifically who are you forgiving?

2194
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,410
I just- I just like to know the
details before I make a toast.

2195
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:35,232
Right. You, and…
and my dad and others.

2196
01:47:37,257 --> 01:47:38,412
I see…

2197
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:42,092
Well I know you- I know you
have some issues with me,

2198
01:47:42,105 --> 01:47:44,139
but I’m curious, what’s he in for?

2199
01:47:44,218 --> 01:47:46,583
Before today, nobody even knew he existed.

2200
01:47:46,624 --> 01:47:48,989
Uh well, my parents divorced
when I was really young and

2201
01:47:49,007 --> 01:47:52,007
we don’t spend that much time
together and I’d like to work on that.

2202
01:47:52,074 --> 01:47:55,899
Just like we’d like to work on…

2203
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,592
how you have financial issues.

2204
01:47:59,776 --> 01:48:02,553
She’s talking about all the lending.
And the borrowing--

2205
01:48:02,589 --> 01:48:04,758
I know what- I know what she meant.

2206
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,042
You are a beautiful woman,
but you are not totally maxed out.

2207
01:48:10,162 --> 01:48:12,089
I would say honestly, you’re a six.

2208
01:48:12,105 --> 01:48:12,683
– Oh.
– Ooh.

2209
01:48:12,702 --> 01:48:16,067
A six and- six and a half.
I could make you an eleven.

2210
01:48:16,113 --> 01:48:16,832
Really?

2211
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:18,589
When I found Deb, she was a seven.

2212
01:48:19,113 --> 01:48:20,474
And now she’s a twelve.

2213
01:48:20,508 --> 01:48:22,308
I wanna be a- I wanna be a twelve.

2214
01:48:22,373 --> 01:48:23,248
You can’t be lazy.

2215
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:24,269
I don’t wanna be lazy.

2216
01:48:24,314 --> 01:48:26,620
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.

2217
01:48:26,675 --> 01:48:28,074
I won’t be lazy.

2218
01:48:28,133 --> 01:48:31,044
Do you know how she got her body?
Bodies By Jason.

2219
01:48:31,157 --> 01:48:32,271
– Wow.
– Say it.

2220
01:48:32,334 --> 01:48:33,449
Bodies By Jason.

2221
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:34,363
Say it again.

2222
01:48:34,406 --> 01:48:35,699
Bodies By Jason.

2223
01:48:35,753 --> 01:48:36,675
And now just say Jason.

2224
01:48:36,717 --> 01:48:37,542
Jason.

2225
01:48:37,582 --> 01:48:38,782
– Again?
– Jason.

2226
01:48:38,808 --> 01:48:40,624
That sounds right, doesn’t it?

2227
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:41,900
Yeah.

2228
01:48:43,853 --> 01:48:46,038
What the fuck is happening right now?

2229
01:48:47,203 --> 01:48:49,531
When was the last time you two
saw each other, I’m curious?

2230
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:51,255
Actually, we had lunch together last week.

2231
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:53,068
Uh-huh. And before that?

2232
01:48:53,299 --> 01:48:54,859
It’s been about seven years.

2233
01:48:54,997 --> 01:48:58,734
Seven years? That’s a joke, right?
That’s like two Olympics.

2234
01:48:58,825 --> 01:49:00,213
But I’m the bad guy.

2235
01:49:00,315 --> 01:49:01,158
Right, Dad.

2236
01:49:01,184 --> 01:49:05,604
What Debbie doesn’t understand
is it’s not bad to help out a parent.

2237
01:49:05,761 --> 01:49:09,063
And it’s certainly not bad
for a parent to help out a child.

2238
01:49:09,262 --> 01:49:10,548
I’m sure Oliver would agree.

2239
01:49:10,584 --> 01:49:12,324
– Well, uh--
– Are you really doing this right now?

2240
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:14,417
Am I doing what?
I didn’t start the toast.

2241
01:49:14,449 --> 01:49:16,696
Are you really about to hit up
my dad for money?

2242
01:49:16,738 --> 01:49:18,892
What? He does four operations a day.

2243
01:49:18,937 --> 01:49:21,704
It’s perfect. It helps everybody,
and it relieves his guilt

2244
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:23,579
from all the abandonment issues.

2245
01:49:23,636 --> 01:49:26,126
You can’t buy forgiveness, right Pete?

2246
01:49:26,707 --> 01:49:30,847
I don’t think anyone’s looking for
handouts, I mean now we’d… pay him back.

2247
01:49:31,266 --> 01:49:34,443
If you two are in a bind, I-
I’d be more than happy to- to help.

2248
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,712
No.

2249
01:49:35,844 --> 01:49:41,326
It’s not good to borrow money from family
members because it causes resentment.

2250
01:49:41,513 --> 01:49:42,488
Remember?

2251
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,183
Right- yeah yeah,
yeah, yeah.

2252
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:45,808
What do- what do you want me to do?

2253
01:49:45,878 --> 01:49:47,761
Okay, admit that my life is shit?

2254
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:49,508
Is that what you want me
to say? You happy?

2255
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:53,185
Aren’t I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to have?

2256
01:49:53,716 --> 01:49:56,999
You have never once
stopped asking us for money.

2257
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,234
Family helps family.

2258
01:49:59,313 --> 01:50:01,781
But it’s true. Family helps family.

2259
01:50:01,976 --> 01:50:04,848
Look, I don’t expect you
to fully understand.

2260
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:07,287
You- your dad left.
You’re broken inside.

2261
01:50:07,288 --> 01:50:09,618
It’s not your fault you can’t feel love.

2262
01:50:09,746 --> 01:50:11,439
There’s something that you can’t--

2263
01:50:12,722 --> 01:50:14,522
This is coming out wrong.

2264
01:50:15,217 --> 01:50:17,331
You know what? I would rather have my dad

2265
01:50:17,342 --> 01:50:18,988
– Mm-hmm.
– than your dad,

2266
01:50:19,147 --> 01:50:21,027
because he doesn’t drive me crazy.

2267
01:50:21,138 --> 01:50:23,191
You know the best quality my father has?

2268
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:25,121
Is he asks for nothing.

2269
01:50:26,341 --> 01:50:29,043
I don’t know what the fuck
he’s thinking right now.

2270
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,307
Look at that.
Nothing. Nothing.

2271
01:50:32,431 --> 01:50:37,475
I don’t even know him. And I turned out
perfectly fine without his input. Okay?

2272
01:50:37,584 --> 01:50:41,745
I just figured out what your problem is.

2273
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:43,837
You hate Jews!

2274
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:47,235
Which is so odd because
your children are Jewish.

2275
01:50:47,262 --> 01:50:48,728
Don’t play the Jew card, Larry.

2276
01:50:48,755 --> 01:50:49,853
I’m not playing any Jew card.

2277
01:50:49,874 --> 01:50:51,231
Seriously, it’s used up.

2278
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:54,114
You can’t use up a Jew card.
That’s the whole point of a Jew card.

2279
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:57,010
That’s right. You can’t
use it up, it goes forever.

2280
01:50:57,036 --> 01:50:59,495
Uh, you- you know what? I- I have to go.

2281
01:50:59,544 --> 01:51:01,338
Yeah. Great. What a big surprise.

2282
01:51:01,393 --> 01:51:04,719
Bye Oliver! See you later!
See you in another seven years.

2283
01:51:04,754 --> 01:51:07,259
Make sure to say goodbye to
the grandkids, who you met today.

2284
01:51:07,325 --> 01:51:10,325
You know, nothing I do is right
because of you? Nothing.

2285
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,832
No matter how hard I try, I’m just
the asshole here, but you know what?

2286
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:16,330
You know what I realized?
It’s you. You’re the asshole.

2287
01:51:17,745 --> 01:51:19,242
Good luck working that out.

2288
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:22,102
Happy birthday and go fuck yourself.

2289
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:25,119
Hey! See you when
the Cubs win the Pennant.

2290
01:51:25,962 --> 01:51:28,318
I’m gonna light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

2291
01:51:30,008 --> 01:51:32,716
– Maybe we should try the toast again.
– You know, can you be quiet?

2292
01:51:33,173 --> 01:51:34,626
You just threw me under the bus.

2293
01:51:34,627 --> 01:51:35,446
You just threw me under the bus.
– No. I don’t understa--

2294
01:51:35,454 --> 01:51:38,470
You threw me under the-
You threw me under the bus!

2295
01:51:38,508 --> 01:51:40,623
You know we agreed to
let go and forgive,

2296
01:51:40,638 --> 01:51:43,544
but then you started ripping
into my dad like a crazy person.

2297
01:51:43,628 --> 01:51:45,117
I’m not ripping into your dad!

2298
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:48,805
I’m just saying to him
what you say to me.

2299
01:51:48,829 --> 01:51:50,295
Don’t be such a ball buster.

2300
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,080
I am not a ball buster.

2301
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,939
You make me one! I am a fun girl!

2302
01:51:54,996 --> 01:51:58,454
I am funloving! I am a good time Sally!

2303
01:51:58,591 --> 01:52:03,467
I dance hip-hop! I cannot believe
I have wasted my whole life

2304
01:52:03,526 --> 01:52:06,751
busting the balls of people
who have no balls.

2305
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:09,922
I am the only one here who has any balls!

2306

01:52:57,194 --> 01:52:58,599
Mom?

2311
01:53:01,232 --> 01:53:03,222
Mom! What are you doing?

2312
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:04,222
What?

2313
01:53:04,255 --> 01:53:06,596
You’re smoking?
In- in the front yard?

2314
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:09,442
No! No. They’re Barb’s.

2315

Mom!

2316
01:53:13,134 --> 01:53:15,280
Since when have you been a smoker?

2317
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:16,296
I’m not a smoker.

2318
01:53:16,342 --> 01:53:17,796
I thought you said smokers die.

2319
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:20,263
I’m not smoking.
I wasn’t smoking.

2320
01:53:20,314 --> 01:53:21,311
I saw you!

2321
01:53:21,335 --> 01:53:22,077
No, I wasn’t.

2322
01:53:22,085 --> 01:53:23,718
Mom, you’re smoking?

2323
01:53:23,728 --> 01:53:26,952
Deb, you can’t smoke, you’re pregnant.
You’ve been doing so well.

2324
01:53:26,976 --> 01:53:28,378
You’re pregnant?

2325
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,569
No F-ing way.
I don’t want another sister!

2326
01:53:30,618 --> 01:53:32,468
I don’t want her as a sister.

2327
01:53:32,492 --> 01:53:34,794
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
It just slipped out.

2328
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:36,732
Are you really pregn-
Since when’re you pregnant?

2329
01:53:36,739 --> 01:53:39,924
Since when do you care?
You didn’t want another baby!

2330
01:53:39,935 --> 01:53:41,370
You have no idea what I want.

2331
01:53:41,397 --> 01:53:42,801
I want an Asian baby.

2332
01:53:42,822 --> 01:53:44,332
We’re not gonna have an Asian baby!

2333
01:53:44,347 --> 01:53:45,480
Yes, we are!

2334
01:53:45,493 --> 01:53:46,558
They’re not Asian.

2335
01:53:46,567 --> 01:53:47,928
– Sadie!
– We’ll buy one.

2336
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:48,787
Shut up, Charlotte.

2337
01:53:48,803 --> 01:53:49,420
You shut up!

2338
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:50,443
Shut up, Sadie!

2339
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:51,443
Shut up, Charlotte!

2340
01:53:51,459 --> 01:53:52,926
– Shut up!
– Okay, Sadie. Shut up!

2341
01:53:52,936 --> 01:53:54,278
Shut up, Charlotte!

2342
01:53:54,309 --> 01:53:56,043
– Shut up!
– Okay, stop saying shut up!

2343
01:53:56,077 --> 01:53:58,077
You’re pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2344
01:53:58,116 --> 01:53:59,426
When did you find out?

2345
01:54:01,523 --> 01:54:05,028
Will you stop eating cupcakes, please!

2346
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,979
Stop eating cupcakes!

2347
01:54:07,511 --> 01:54:09,604
Stop eating cupcakes!!

2348
01:54:13,215 --> 01:54:16,814
Hey! We just heard!
You’re having a baby!

2349
01:54:17,442 --> 01:54:19,088
See, it can happen to anybody.

2350
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:20,956
That is so wonderful.

2351
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,636
Let me get the-
oh, it’s fantastic.

2352
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,415
Congratulations.
– Oh, it’s wonderful.

2353
01:54:24,433 --> 01:54:25,907
So happy for you.

2354
01:54:26,814 --> 01:54:28,173
Get the other kid.

2355
01:54:28,423 --> 01:54:29,626
– I thought you have?
– I never have.

2356
01:54:29,713 --> 01:54:31,913
This is too adult for you.
Let’s go outside.

2357
01:54:31,968 --> 01:54:33,788
Congratulations.

2358
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,084
Well, I guess we’re stuck together
then forever, then, right?

2359
01:54:38,115 --> 01:54:39,390
Weren’t we always?

2360
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:40,687
You don’t even want a baby!

2361
01:54:40,727 --> 01:54:42,592
Of course I do. I never said that.

2362
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:45,146
Look, I ju- I didn’t want
one if I could choose.

2363
01:54:45,193 --> 01:54:47,724
I should put that on a Hallmark card.
That’s beautiful.

2364
01:54:47,776 --> 01:54:48,972
Debbie…

2365
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:52,139
Uh, good luck with the pregnancy,
Debbie. But please…

2366
01:54:52,522 --> 01:54:55,668
take care of yourself. It’s a much
riskier pregnancy after forty.

2367
01:54:55,856 --> 01:54:56,838
I’m not forty.

2368
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,392
Of course you are. You
were born on December 5th, 1972.

2369
01:55:00,414 --> 01:55:02,794
I’m not forty! Ho- How do you know?

2370
01:55:02,819 --> 01:55:06,013
I was there! I’m the one who
took your mother to the hospital.

2371
01:55:06,037 --> 01:55:07,417
Well that’s not what she said.

2372
01:55:07,423 --> 01:55:09,913
Yeah, your mom was in labor for
only twenty minutes.

2373
01:55:09,922 --> 01:55:12,922
You cou- so you couldn’t wait
to meet me, can you imagine that?

2374
01:55:12,977 --> 01:55:14,506
I don’t even know you.

2375
01:55:14,632 --> 01:55:18,748
You can’t just come into
my house and reminisce.

2376
01:55:18,764 --> 01:55:22,152
Look, maybe we were just not meant
to be in each other’s lives.

2377
01:55:22,261 --> 01:55:24,777
I’m not sure this was such a great idea.

2378
01:55:28,336 --> 01:55:30,312
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

2379
01:55:30,809 --> 01:55:33,853
You did leave. And you didn’t come back.

2380
01:55:33,898 --> 01:55:37,507
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

2381
01:55:37,533 --> 01:55:40,062
So I ruined your life?
I was eight.

2382
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:43,663
People do better when I stay out of
their lives! That’s what my son tells me.

2383
01:55:43,792 --> 01:55:45,274
You think my life is so perfect?

2384
01:55:45,288 --> 01:55:49,625
I’ve got a- a thirteen-year old who’s a
pot head, I’ve got a wife who’s- who’s-

2385
01:55:50,243 --> 01:55:52,210
who’s keeping Zoloft alive!

2386
01:55:52,368 --> 01:55:53,858
You never said that before.

2387
01:55:53,893 --> 01:55:56,936
You don’t think I wanna talk to you
about this? To share it with you?

2388
01:55:56,967 --> 01:56:00,628
It’s just not our way! We don’t talk to
each other, we don’t know each other.

2389
01:56:00,748 --> 01:56:02,753
And I thought that’s
the way you wanted it.

2390
01:56:02,816 --> 01:56:04,416
How- how- how do I get out of this?

2391
01:56:04,448 --> 01:56:08,486
How do I get you all to just
help me down off the cross?

2392
01:56:10,462 --> 01:56:11,976
You sound just like Sadie.

2393
01:56:12,027 --> 01:56:13,173
Who’s Sadie?

2394
01:56:13,284 --> 01:56:15,970
No. Your daughter. Your younger?

2395
01:56:16,054 --> 01:56:16,837
The big one.

2396
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:20,684
Your older. I know- I know that!
A wonderful girl.

2397
01:56:21,012 --> 01:56:23,994
Hey, guys. Some of us need to leave.

2398
01:56:24,057 --> 01:56:26,501
Would this be a good moment to sneak out?

2399
01:56:30,346 --> 01:56:32,146
Where’s Dad going?

2400
01:56:42,063 --> 01:56:44,390
Best birthday ever!

2401
01:56:51,035 --> 01:56:51,704
Oh shit!

2402
01:56:51,735 --> 01:56:52,946
Bike lane, asshole!

2403
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,689
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

2404
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,828
Your dad’s still here.

2405
01:56:59,764 --> 01:57:02,066
I know. It’s kind of weird.

2406
01:57:02,109 --> 01:57:03,909
Where the hell is Pete?

2407
01:57:05,302 --> 01:57:06,422
Uhm…

2408
01:57:06,838 --> 01:57:09,838
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

2409
01:57:10,163 --> 01:57:11,283
Mm-hmm.

2410
01:57:13,073 --> 01:57:14,398
Hi, Joseph.

2411
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:16,026
Hi.

2412
01:57:16,674 --> 01:57:17,898
Do you want a piece of cake?

2413
01:57:18,016 --> 01:57:18,985
Oh! Yeah sure.

2414
01:57:20,243 --> 01:57:21,733
Thank you. Thanks.

2415
01:57:23,938 --> 01:57:25,404
All right, then.

2416
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:27,123
They are so cute.

2417
01:57:27,124 --> 01:57:28,187
So cute…

2418
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:29,734
He looks exactly like Tom Petty.

2419
01:57:36,326 --> 01:57:37,886
Go around!

2420
01:57:40,735 --> 01:57:42,444
Watch it! Watch it!!

2421
01:57:46,796 --> 01:57:48,950
Hey, Pete. Great party!

2422
01:57:51,567 --> 01:57:52,760
Yeah.

2423
01:57:53,718 --> 01:57:55,041
The best!

2424
01:57:55,822 --> 01:57:57,262
And then you shake it.

2425
01:57:58,051 --> 01:57:59,788
And then a restaurant comes up.

2426
01:58:00,093 --> 01:58:03,520
D- Dad? Excuse me. I’m gonna
go look for Pete right now.

2427
01:58:03,615 --> 01:58:06,754
Would you mind staying
with girls for just a little bit?

2428
01:58:06,891 --> 01:58:08,159
Well, if you want me to.

2429
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:09,894
If you don’t mind.
You don’t have to.

2430
01:58:09,995 --> 01:58:11,115
Sure.

2431
01:58:12,536 --> 01:58:15,065
Can I let Sadie show me
the last episode of Lost?

2432
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:16,690
She asked me if I’d seen it, I haven’t.

2433
01:58:16,714 --> 01:58:18,336
Yeah, that would be nice.

2434
01:58:19,446 --> 01:58:20,787
Thank you.
– Thank you.

2435
01:58:21,827 --> 01:58:23,707
She said we could watch it.
Come on!

2436
01:58:26,056 --> 01:58:27,928
I’m gonna let you watch Lost.

2437
01:58:28,094 --> 01:58:28,897
Come on.

2438
01:58:30,589 --> 01:58:31,969
Is it scary?

2439
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:34,348
I’ll cover your eyes if it gets too scary.

2440
01:59:06,215 --> 01:59:08,399
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

2441
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:10,063
Shh. Larry, please.

2442
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:26,176
Are you fucking kidding me?

2443
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:29,447
Are you fucking kidding me?

2444
01:59:30,494 --> 01:59:32,294
You opened your door on me.

2445
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:35,291
I didn’t open my fucking door
on you. I opened my door!

2446
01:59:35,361 --> 01:59:37,721
Ah! Fuck, I was right there!

2447
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:39,995
You’re supposed to look
before you open your door,

2448
01:59:40,009 --> 01:59:41,425
I was in the fucking bike path.

2449
01:59:41,449 --> 01:59:44,657
That’s a blind spot. There’s no fucking
bike path. This is a residential section.

2450
01:59:44,691 --> 01:59:46,110
Get your head out of your ass.

2451
01:59:46,129 --> 01:59:46,931
Pay attention!

2452
01:59:46,938 --> 01:59:48,845
Open your god damn eyes.
What are you doing, sleepwalking?

2453
01:59:48,861 --> 01:59:52,210
You’re supposed to look
to see if a biker is coming through.

2454
01:59:52,288 --> 01:59:53,249
You’re supposed to look!

2455
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:55,743
It’s not my job to look out for you.
You look out for yourself!

2456
01:59:55,759 --> 01:59:57,726
I don’t look out for you. I don’t see you.

2457
01:59:57,766 --> 01:59:59,883
I don’t know where the fuck
you are and what you’re doing!

2458
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:02,300
No one is ever looking out for me!

2459
02:00:02,449 --> 02:00:04,649
I need your name and number.

2460
02:00:04,798 --> 02:00:05,709
Why?

2461
02:00:05,742 --> 02:00:07,192
’Cause you’re gonna pay for my door.

2462
02:00:07,219 --> 02:00:08,030
Fuck you!

2463
02:00:08,076 --> 02:00:11,753
Why don’t you pay for my bike,
and my face, you fucking prick!

2464
02:00:18,798 --> 02:00:20,213
Don’t disrespect me.

2465
02:00:23,012 --> 02:00:24,603
Are you sure that’s him?

2466
02:00:25,057 --> 02:00:26,644
I don’t think that’s him!

2467
02:00:29,369 --> 02:00:31,523
I’m gonna write down
your license plate.

2468
02:00:36,274 --> 02:00:39,084
“Range Rover of Sunland.”

2469
02:00:42,381 --> 02:00:43,000
What are you doing?

2470
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:44,501
What are you doing?
– Ow.

2471
02:00:51,247 --> 02:00:54,440
I guess the party didn’t
turn out like you planned.

2472
02:00:55,849 --> 02:00:57,768
It wasn’t a good party.

2473
02:00:58,972 --> 02:00:59,987
– Hi.
– Hi.

2474
02:01:00,005 --> 02:01:01,784
I’ll bring you in as soon as
his x-rays are finished.

2475
02:01:01,805 --> 02:01:02,779
– Okay.
– Okay.

2476
02:01:02,824 --> 02:01:03,568
Is he okay?

2477
02:01:03,635 --> 02:01:07,687
Yeah, he has a broken rib and he’s been
crying a little bit, but he’ll be fine.

2478
02:01:10,156 --> 02:01:14,325
You know Pete was never a real fighter.

2479
02:01:15,452 --> 02:01:19,613
But that’s why he married you. That’s why
he loves you. ’Cause you’re the fighter.

2480
02:01:20,512 --> 02:01:24,588
And you need that. One person
in a relationship has got to punch.

2481
02:01:25,347 --> 02:01:26,930
Do you mean that in a good way?

2482
02:01:26,982 --> 02:01:30,008
Oh, it’s a… it’s a high compliment.

2483
02:01:32,281 --> 02:01:33,513
Thanks.

2484
02:01:34,982 --> 02:01:36,995
Listen, I know what you’re worried about.

2485
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:39,261
You think he’s gonna turn into me, but…

2486
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,930
I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

2487
02:01:41,987 --> 02:01:44,813
He’s smarter and
probably a little cuter.

2488
02:01:46,236 --> 02:01:47,620
A little less Jewy.

2489
02:01:48,268 --> 02:01:51,586
Although after fifty, that’s
all gonna change.

2490
02:01:51,618 --> 02:01:54,445
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a a rabbi.

2491
02:01:55,568 --> 02:01:57,722
But the good news is, you know…

2492
02:01:59,142 --> 02:02:02,155
he’ll love you forever.
That’s in our DNA.

2493
02:02:02,645 --> 02:02:04,445
We stick around.

2494
02:02:05,845 --> 02:02:09,538
He worries about you, you know.
It puts a lot of pressure on him.

2495
02:02:09,649 --> 02:02:12,444
I know. I just- I don’t have
anyone else to talk to about it.

2496
02:02:12,469 --> 02:02:13,880
Why don’t you talk to Claire?

2497
02:02:13,933 --> 02:02:15,946
Oh, if I open up to her, she’ll leave me.

2498
02:02:15,974 --> 02:02:17,923
– No, she won’t.
– Hmm.

2499
02:02:17,978 --> 02:02:18,940
Larry, she loves you.

2500
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:22,580
Ι knоw, but thеrе’ѕ а сеrtаіn
роіnt аt whісh yоu јuѕt саn’t ѕtаy.

2501
02:02:27,144 --> 02:02:31,704
I guess it’s hard to forgive somebody
if they don’t formally apologize to you.

2502
02:02:35,536 --> 02:02:37,387
Are you apologizing?

2503
02:02:37,709 --> 02:02:39,732
I’m very close.

2504
02:02:42,042 --> 02:02:43,941
Yes, I’m- I’m- I’m sorry.

2505
02:02:49,494 --> 02:02:51,656
I’m glad everybody’s okay.

2506
02:02:53,686 --> 02:02:55,824
Oh. Thank you.

2507
02:03:02,452 --> 02:03:04,012
Alright. I’m off.

2508
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:05,243
Okay.

2509
02:03:06,978 --> 02:03:08,538
This is awkward.

2510
02:03:09,155 --> 02:03:10,093
What?

2511
02:03:10,269 --> 02:03:12,669
I need forty dollars for a cab.

2512
02:03:13,904 --> 02:03:15,308
That’s funny.

2513
02:03:15,955 --> 02:03:17,151
No, I’m not kidding.

2514
02:03:18,747 --> 02:03:20,994
You drove me. I- I wasn’t prepared.

2515
02:03:21,604 --> 02:03:23,104
I only have a hundred.

2516
02:03:23,135 --> 02:03:24,429
It’s okay.

2517
02:03:24,928 --> 02:03:26,515
I’ll bring you the change.

2518
02:03:27,703 --> 02:03:30,103
All right, give him a kiss for me.

2519
02:03:48,274 --> 02:03:50,732
I- I- I don’t get it.

2520
02:03:51,929 --> 02:03:56,708
See, it’s not sad, it’s happy because they
helped each other achieve their destiny.

2521
02:03:56,731 --> 02:03:57,931
Oh.

2522
02:03:58,181 --> 02:04:02,475
Great. I’m gonna have
some freaky ass nightmares.

2523
02:04:14,436 --> 02:04:15,449
Hi.

2524
02:04:15,623 --> 02:04:16,715
Hi.

2525
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:30,407
I really liked our lives so much better
before we tried to change everything.

2526
02:04:31,203 --> 02:04:32,654
I’m sorry.

2527
02:04:32,951 --> 02:04:34,558
No. I’m sorry.

2528
02:04:34,902 --> 02:04:37,355
I don’t wanna keep anything from you.

2529
02:04:38,231 --> 02:04:39,931
I love you. You’re my wife.

2530
02:04:40,365 --> 02:04:42,098
I just didn’t want to let you down.

2531
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:45,812
Are you mad that I’m pregnant?

2532
02:04:45,972 --> 02:04:48,819
No. I’m not mad. I’m thrilled.

2533
02:04:49,099 --> 02:04:50,452
You don’t feel trapped?

2534
02:04:51,085 --> 02:04:53,151
Sometimes I feel like I trapped you.

2535
02:04:53,188 --> 02:04:54,502
I don’t feel trapped.

2536
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:56,070
– Really?
– No.

2537
02:04:56,544 --> 02:04:58,385
You should, because I’ve trapped you.

2538
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,940
You can’t go anywhere.

2539
02:05:00,653 --> 02:05:03,447
I’m gonna get you pregnant every
ten years for the rest of your life.

2540
02:05:03,455 --> 02:05:05,666
You can never leave me. Ever.

2541
02:05:05,709 --> 02:05:08,488
I never feel trapped by you.
I’m so happy to be with you.

2542
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:13,831
And I love you so much. You’re my
favorite person in the whole world.

2543
02:05:14,366 --> 02:05:19,415
God damn it, why am I crying like this?
Something is wrong with me.

2544
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:20,823
You’re pregnant.

2545
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:22,069
Oh, yeah.

2546
02:05:22,558 --> 02:05:23,678
Shit.

2547
02:05:24,136 --> 02:05:27,416
I was just outside telling
your dad that I liked him.

2548
02:05:27,462 --> 02:05:28,999
What if he thinks I like him now?

2549
02:05:29,028 --> 02:05:30,319
No, he won’t think that.

2550
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:32,437
I don’t want him to think
I like him that much.

2551
02:05:32,476 --> 02:05:34,276
No, it’ll never happen.

2552
02:05:35,026 --> 02:05:38,734
Can you believe it?
This is the craziest thing ever.

2553
02:05:38,766 --> 02:05:41,359
What are we gonna do with a third baby?

2554
02:05:41,388 --> 02:05:44,272
I have no idea.
How are we gonna afford it?

2555
02:05:44,584 --> 02:05:46,046
We’ll sell the house.

2556
02:05:46,259 --> 02:05:47,545
We don’t have to.

2557
02:05:47,577 --> 02:05:49,264
– We kind of do.
– We kind of do.

2558
02:05:49,546 --> 02:05:51,946
We’ll make new memories in a new house.

2559
02:05:52,524 --> 02:05:54,084
I love you.

2560
02:05:55,873 --> 02:05:58,230
Is there anything you
wanna do for your birthday?

2561
02:05:58,761 --> 02:06:00,831
It’s been the worst birthday ever.

2562
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:04,006
There is one thing, but
I don’t think you’ll like it.

2563
02:06:04,118 --> 02:06:05,092
What?

2564
02:06:05,607 --> 02:06:07,667
I wouldn’t mind going to see some music.

2565
02:06:08,013 --> 02:06:09,120
Would you want to do that?

2566
02:06:09,130 --> 02:06:09,972
Yeah.

2567
02:06:10,035 --> 02:06:11,136
– Really?
– Yeah.

2568
02:06:11,253 --> 02:06:14,037
I don’t believe you,
but you’re sweet for saying that.

2569
02:06:14,088 --> 02:06:15,686
How do we break you out of here?

2570
02:06:15,902 --> 02:06:18,772
I can just leave on my own volition.
It’s not a mental institution.

2571
02:06:18,818 --> 02:06:20,261
– Can you?
– Yeah.

2572
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,765
It’s not like One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.

2573
02:06:23,251 --> 02:06:25,039
Please don’t put a pillow over my face.

2574
02:06:27,281 --> 02:06:28,747
Let’s get out of here, McMurphy.

2575
02:06:28,806 --> 02:06:31,302
You got it, Chief.
Will you carry me?

2576
02:06:32,624 --> 02:06:34,957
You’ve been carrying me up all this time.

2577
02:07:14,448 --> 02:07:16,056
I like this song.

2578
02:07:16,625 --> 02:07:17,825
Really?

2579
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:19,994
Why?

2580
02:07:24,745 --> 02:07:26,297
Why don’t you sign him?

2581
02:07:26,418 --> 02:07:28,454
Ryan Adams? No, he’s…

2582
02:07:29,275 --> 02:07:30,614
He wouldn’t sign with me.

2583
02:07:30,648 --> 02:07:32,448
Why not? You’re the best.

2584
02:07:32,815 --> 02:07:34,476
He is in between labels.

2585
02:07:36,409 --> 02:07:38,587
Let’s go try and talk
to him after the show.
