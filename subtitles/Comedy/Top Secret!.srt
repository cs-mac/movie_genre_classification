1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,045
Security has been tightened
throughout the country.

2
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:35,923
All borders have been placed on full alert.

3
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,594
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,933
In addition, we have assurance
from our undercover agents in the West

5
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:49,188
that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

6
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,065
All military leaves have been cancelled,

7
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:55,611
and we have doubled the guard
around Dr Flammond.

8
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:59,574
Finally, all systems are in readiness

9
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:02,576
for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

10
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:07,706
- As you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

11
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,044
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here

12
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:14,756
on their manoeuvres,
and completely vulnerable.

13
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:20,637
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

14
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:25,142
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, Herr General.

15
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:29,397
You should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request,

16
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:33,819
the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

17
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:39,074
Well done, Herr Major.
Then everything has gone to plan?

18
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,077
Well, not exactly, mein General.

19
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:47,707
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

20
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:50,461
They are sending
another performer in his place.

21
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:55,550
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

22
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,679
His name is...Nick Rivers.

23
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,265
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

24
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,727
As long as the world's attention
is fixed on our cultural festival,

25
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,979
no one will know what is about to happen.

26
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,822
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

27
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,076
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

28
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,221
A pen.

29
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:20,058
A table.

30
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:25,523
A table.

31
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,115
The pen is on the table.

32
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:42,583
There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.

33
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,339
Come in.

34
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,349
What did he say?

35
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,059
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

36
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,730
Better have our passports ready.

37
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,192
This is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

38
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,155
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

39
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,992
And above all, we play by their rules.

40
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,911
Martin, I've been practising.
How's this?

41
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,377
- What does that mean?
- Is your daughter 1 8?

42
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:31,469
Your papers, please.

43
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,352
Mr Nick Rivers.

44
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,023
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

45
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:59,832
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

46
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:09,217
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble.

47
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:14,347
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

48
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:19,020
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

49
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,859
Good day.

50
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,327
What the hell did you say to him?

51
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:39,249
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

52
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,254
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

53
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,508
Normally he wouldn't say...

54
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,596
Your attitude is being noted, Mr Rivers.

55
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:05,277
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for trouble.

56
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,246
I want a schnauzer
with my Wiener schnitzel.

57
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:47,804
from all over the world as our guests,

58
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,222
we wish to express our appreciation

59
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,851
by offering to you these keys to our city,

60
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:58,815
which will be presented by our
East German Women's Olympic Team.

61
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:25,593
Tonight, we begin our Festival
at the Concert Hall,

62
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,014
where the distinguished Madam Bergerone
and her ballet company

63
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,433
will perform "The Nutcracker Suite".

64
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:38,900
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

65
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:44,739
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

66
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:53,373
Do you know any good white
basketball players?

67
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,669
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

68
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,505
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

69
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,218
They knew I was on that train.

70
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:08,264
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

71
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:12,226
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

72
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:18,107
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

73
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:25,074
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

74
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,450
Time is running out.

75
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,580
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

76
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:36,210
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

77
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,549
That's very good.

78
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:45,386
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

79
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:48,641
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

80
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:51,476
What are my instructions?

81
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:57,232
Here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

82
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:05,367
Go tonight to the ballet.
Use this ticket.

83
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:09,246
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

84
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,707
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's

85
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,334
on the corner of Der Fuhrer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

86
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,296
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

87
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,133
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog pooh.

88
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,843
What phoney dog pooh?

89
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,890
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

90
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,187
And now we conclude our ceremony

91
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,400
with the singing of our
East German National Anthem.

92
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,863
HAIL, HAIL, EAST GERMANY

93
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,868
LAND OF VINE AND GRAPE,

94
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:50,248
LAND WHERE YOU'LL REGRET

95
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,834
AND TRY TO ESCAPE

96
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,045
NO MATTER IF YOU TUNNEL UNDER

97
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,589
OR TAKE A RUNNING JUMP
AT THE WALL,

98
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,884
THE GUARDS WILL KILL YOU,

99
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,470
IF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE
DOESN'T FIRST.

100
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:15,316
Driver, why are we stopped here?
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

101
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:09,248
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

102
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,835
Ah, yes. Mr Rivers.

103
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:18,258
I have it right here, but we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

104
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:21,720
We will be very happy
to provide you with one.

105
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,805
That'll be fine.

106
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,599
Jurgen.

107
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,228
This way, sir.

108
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,693
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

109
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,157
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

110
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:44,160
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

111
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,455
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

112
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:49,082
But of course, mein General.

113
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,462
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

114
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,383
I will take care of it.

115
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:05,850
Thank you.

116
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,482
Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

117
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,153
I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.

118
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,572
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

119
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,744
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry, Martin.

120
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:27,040
Why don't you get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

121
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:30,376
No. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

122
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:33,004
I got them right here.

123
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,843
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

124
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,180
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

125
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,714
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

126
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,052
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

127
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,179
Have you heard from Cedric?

128
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:23,934
He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

129
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,145
This letter has to be in New York
by T uesday.

130
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,065
Now, go! Quickly!

131
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:10,316
I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

132
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,574
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

133
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,019
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

134
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,568
Excuse me, this lady is with me.

135
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:55,197
Mr Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

136
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:59,452
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

137
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:03,539
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

138
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:11,923
- That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,801
I was looking for someone to dance with.

140
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:18,097
- You're an American.
- That's right.

141
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:21,350
- My uncle was born in America.
- Really?

142
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:24,354
But he was one of the lucky ones.

143
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:29,526
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

144
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,571
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

145
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:37,074
He would tell me about
the large houses and expensive cars.

146
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,622
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll.

147
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,583
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

148
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,211
"M*A*S*H" was OK
and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

149
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:51,590
It just seems like young people
of America take freedom for granted.

150
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,801
Wait. I don't think you're being fair.

151
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:57,346
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

152
00:19:57,514 --> 00:20:02,018
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

153
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:07,273
but still don't know
what it's like to have to fight for it.

154
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:30,048
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

155
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,676
I am grateful for what you did back there.

156
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,512
You'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell,

157
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,558
Disneyland on both coasts.
It's happening.

158
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:42,603
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

159
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,315
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

160
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:53,866
What do you recommend?

161
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,951
I recommend the pork bellies

162
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:58,787
marinated in diced pig entrails

163
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,624
or the roast swine knuckles

164
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:06,170
poached with flaming hog balls.

165
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,924
Anything's fine.

166
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:16,973
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

167
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,851
That's an unusual name.

168
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:25,482
It's German. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

169
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,405
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

170
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:34,367
Nick, what does that mean?

171
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,703
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

172
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,421
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

173
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:49,258
Some things are better left unsaid.

174
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:51,802
Like what?

175
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:58,602
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse.

176
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:05,025
Then you reach for your lipstick, your hand
gushes into it, and it goes all over...

177
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,777
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

178
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,784
Thank you very much.

179
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,037
Ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:22,667
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent

181
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:27,090
is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

182
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:30,093
He truly has the gift of song.

183
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,303
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

184
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,348
Is there something wrong?

185
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,767
I was afraid this might happen.

186
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:42,814
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer,

187
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:46,318
and owns a complete set of his works.

188
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:49,823
He is a very shy and gentle man,

189
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,035
but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

190
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:56,371
Shall we ask him?

191
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,922
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

192
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,980
Thank you, sir.

193
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,569
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

194
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,112
Oh, my God.

195
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,677
Your hog balls, sir.

196
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,987
Cedric!

197
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,087
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

198
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:23,883
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

199
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,096
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

200
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:29,806
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

201
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:32,184
But what are we going to do?

202
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:33,519
I was...

203
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:38,316
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight,

204
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,152
to meet a man called "The Torch".

205
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,946
Thank you.

206
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:46,741
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

207
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:50,662
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

208
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:53,623
I must! He'll be tortured.

209
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,794
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

210
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,171
Where is the ticket?

211
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:01,674
In the glove compartment.

212
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:03,551
Can you reach it from the inside?

213
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:09,431
How about the other hand?

214
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,022
No, that's not it. Let me try.

215
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,696
Here it is.

216
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:21,697
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

217
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:26,203
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

218
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:34,253
In here.

219
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,139
We can get out this way.

220
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:49,144
- Wait. First you can explain.
- I'm not sure I can.

221
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:57,611
I only know I have put you in great danger.

222
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:59,781
Trust me. You must come with me.

223
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:03,451
I don't know what trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

224
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,454
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

225
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,207
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

226
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:14,421
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

227
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:45,454
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

228
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,377
Nick, I've tried everything.

229
00:30:51,544 --> 00:30:54,797
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

230
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:59,093
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

231
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,347
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

232
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:07,018
That's a shame, Martin.

233
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,438
Have you tried one of these?

234
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:16,570
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

235
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:23,578
I'm getting worried about this place.
I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

236
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:27,040
All I know is, after you left the cafe
last night, I met a girl.

237
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:29,584
Later at the ballet she was alone.

238
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:32,462
Then I see this guy with a gun at her head.

239
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:36,800
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and might have if I hadn't stepped in.

240
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:41,305
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this mess out.

241
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:45,601
I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

242
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:48,437
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

243
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:53,151
Just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

244
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:40,660
Amen.

245
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:51,714
We wish to impress upon you, Mr Rivers,

246
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:55,509
that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

247
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:59,931
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

248
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:03,559
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

249
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:09,315
Might I remind you, Mr Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

250
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:13,570
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

251
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,536
It is the hospital, mein General.

252
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:24,582
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

253
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:30,797
I see. Let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

254
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,258
He is dead.

255
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:42,309
You leave me no alternative,
but to introduce two of my associates.

256
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,481
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

257
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:53,112
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

258
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,365
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness

259
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:58,618
however long they may work on him.

260
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,621
You don't scare me.

261
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,748
My manager is on his way
to the American Consulate.

262
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:06,919
Do not be so sure, Mr Rivers.

263
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,129
Evidently, your friend did not realise

264
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:12,925
that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

265
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,472
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

266
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,681
Our surgeons did what they could

267
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:24,646
but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

268
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,403
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

269
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:45,042
Make sure they leave no marks.

270
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:12,113
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

271
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,491
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

272
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,203
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

273
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:24,334
No, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

274
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:27,547
I can't believe I'm back in school.

275
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,552
Thank God.

276
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,059
Well?

277
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:42,395
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

278
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:44,815
They've tried everything.

279
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:47,693
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

280
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,989
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

281
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,283
We'll break him tomorrow.

282
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:16,204
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

283
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,957
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

284
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:25,964
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you.

285
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:29,592
A year ago, I was close to perfecting

286
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,097
the first magnetic desalinisation process.

287
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:37,185
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt

288
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:40,812
from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

289
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:45,110
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

290
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:49,948
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

291
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:53,869
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

292
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:57,247
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

293
00:37:57,414 --> 00:38:00,084
and brought me to this dungeon.

294
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:01,794
That sucks!

295
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,672
For the first time in my life,

296
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:09,176
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

297
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:13,223
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

298
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,768
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

299
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:19,772
But they are holding my daughter.

300
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:24,235
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

301
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,738
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

302
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,825
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

303
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,369
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

304
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:35,663
Is this the Polaris mine?

305
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,668
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

306
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:44,172
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine

307
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,802
so powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

308
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:52,599
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

309
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:03,693
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

310
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,071
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

311
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,042
Right away.

312
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:21,003
- Von Horst!
- Ja, mein General.

313
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,048
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

314
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:26,884
Mr Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

315
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:29,721
He is to be executed this very minute.

316
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:34,059
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
- Ja, mein General.

317
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,106
Those bikes!

318
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:29,373
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

319
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,221
They're in the Eastern sector.

320
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,681
I want the whole area sealed off!

321
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,661
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

322
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,455
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

323
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:11,169
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

324
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:15,797
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

325
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:19,051
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

326
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:24,224
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

327
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,185
at the University of Blaupunkt.

328
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:32,733
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

329
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,153
I've been trying to find him ever since.

330
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:39,907
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

331
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,743
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

332
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,162
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

333
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,790
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

334
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:51,043
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

335
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,672
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

336
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:39,261
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

337
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:00,660
May I help you?

338
00:47:01,744 --> 00:47:03,955
My father is Dr. Paul Flammond

339
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:08,001
I'm sorry. I don't know a Dr. Flammond.

340
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:13,049
He told me you may have a book of
Swedish poems by Von Brieson.

341
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,887
So you are Hillary Flammond!

342
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:25,477
What can I do for you?

343
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,523
We must speak with "The Torch".

344
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,816
That will be very difficult.

345
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,703
But I will try to arrange it.

346
00:47:42,704 --> 00:47:44,998
Can we leave tonight?

347
00:47:49,044 --> 00:47:51,797
It is too dangerous to travel at night.

348
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,596
You will be taken in the morning
to a potato farm.

349
00:47:57,763 --> 00:48:00,139
Where can we stay tonight?

350
00:48:00,306 --> 00:48:01,974
There is a loft upstairs.

351
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:04,645
You can use that fire pole.

352
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:24,374
That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

353
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:26,584
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

354
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:29,754
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

355
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:34,259
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

356
00:48:34,426 --> 00:48:36,970
Can you believe they print this trash?

357
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:40,766
Don't worry about it. You were going
to tell me something about your childhood.

358
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:45,646
When I was a young girl,

359
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:48,275
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

360
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,444
But there was a terrible storm

361
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,905
and the boat sank.

362
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:55,532
I managed to swim to a deserted island

363
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,993
with a young boy, named Nigel.

364
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,704
Together we had to learn to survive.

365
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,210
Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

366
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:09,213
which Nigel would catch every day.

367
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,425
Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

368
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:17,222
from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

369
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:21,142
We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

370
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:23,729
with dried seaweed and snot.

371
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:27,065
This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

372
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:30,069
but sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

373
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:32,988
which would periodically
ravage the island.

374
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:35,867
The years passed and as we grew up,

375
00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:40,538
we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

376
00:49:40,705 --> 00:49:43,165
There was no one around to explain this.

377
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:46,086
We had to learn by ourselves.

378
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:18,328
Then one day he went fishing.

379
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,958
That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

380
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:25,086
I spent months by myself on that island,

381
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:28,715
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

382
00:50:28,882 --> 00:50:31,468
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

383
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:33,678
You can't imagine what it's like

384
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:35,889
to be separated from your family

385
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,099
at such a young age.

386
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:40,018
I think I can.

387
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:48,318
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

388
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:53,032
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

389
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:55,660
They tried to page her,

390
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:58,871
but the PA system was on the fritz.

391
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:02,959
I never saw my momma again.

392
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,838
Some people
from the cosmetics department

393
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:08,257
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

394
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:10,467
Days stretched into weeks.

395
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,762
One February they got jammed up

396
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:15,598
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

397
00:51:15,723 --> 00:51:18,226
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

398
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:23,106
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

399
00:51:23,272 --> 00:51:26,317
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

400
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:30,072
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

401
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,368
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

402
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:37,037
It went something like this.

403
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,868
Oh, Nick.

404
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:40,001
All right, this is it.

405
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:42,338
I must leave you here.

406
00:53:43,672 --> 00:53:45,967
Go now, quickly.

407
00:53:48,802 --> 00:53:52,015
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

408
00:53:52,182 --> 00:53:54,267
He's just a little hoarse.

409
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:56,478
Giddy-up, Mario.

410
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:11,411
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

411
00:54:11,578 --> 00:54:15,874
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

412
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:19,126
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

413
00:54:23,256 --> 00:54:24,966
Come this way.

414
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:55,582
- What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

415
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:58,627
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

416
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:04,425
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

417
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:07,262
We shall see.

418
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,195
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

419
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:33,748
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

420
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,710
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

421
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:41,590
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

422
00:55:41,757 --> 00:55:45,009
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

423
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:48,890
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

424
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:52,018
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

425
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:56,313
Forgive us, Mr Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

426
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,237
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

427
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:06,116
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

428
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:07,993
Very well.

429
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:15,042
This is Chevalier, Montage, Detente,

430
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:19,672
Avant Garde, and Deja Vu.

431
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:23,218
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

432
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:26,012
I don't think so.

433
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,269
Over there...

434
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:37,358
Croissant, Souffle, Escargot,

435
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,944
and Chocolate Mousse.

436
00:56:45,992 --> 00:56:49,412
Now, Mr Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

437
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:52,707
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

438
00:56:52,874 --> 00:56:56,544
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

439
00:56:57,755 --> 00:56:58,922
Sacrebleu.

440
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,510
We'll have to move out tonight.

441
00:57:02,677 --> 00:57:04,719
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

442
00:57:04,886 --> 00:57:07,097
Prepare the gear for the jump.

443
00:57:07,264 --> 00:57:09,017
Cordon bleu. Zut!

444
00:57:09,183 --> 00:57:12,102
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

445
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:15,648
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

446
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:18,902
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

447
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:22,406
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

448
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,993
who, 1 5 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

449
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,413
It all sounds like some bad movie.

450
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:41,676
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

451
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:46,014
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

452
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,435
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

453
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:55,066
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

454
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,925
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

455
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:23,388
Life is filled with its little miseries.

456
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:27,558
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

457
00:58:27,725 --> 00:58:30,561
in a mature and adult fashion.

458
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,994
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

459
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,664
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

460
00:58:53,294 --> 00:58:57,298
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

461
00:58:57,465 --> 00:58:59,926
He seems a good chap, really.

462
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:02,554
How wonderful you've returned to me,

463
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,224
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

464
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:10,061
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

465
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:14,776
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

466
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:17,361
And by all rights I should be.

467
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:20,073
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

468
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,409
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

469
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:26,329
I tried to get them to save you too.

470
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,249
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

471
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:34,546
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

472
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:37,841
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

473
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:43,765
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

474
00:59:49,688 --> 00:59:51,564
Latrine!

475
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:58,530
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

476
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,533
We never had a chance.

477
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:02,534
It was a slaughter.

478
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:05,746
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

479
01:00:05,913 --> 01:00:09,208
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

480
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:14,380
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

481
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:29,647
Take this.

482
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,760
Grenade.

483
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:52,276
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

484
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:54,487
We'll have to make a break for it.

485
01:01:54,653 --> 01:01:57,156
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

486
01:01:57,323 --> 01:01:58,407
Wait!

487
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,428
Nice shooting.

488
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:18,680
My man!

489
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:46,877
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

490
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:50,254
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1 :00 am.

491
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:52,299
What about the American?

492
01:02:52,466 --> 01:02:55,218
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

493
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:58,263
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

494
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:02,309
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

495
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:10,109
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

496
01:03:10,276 --> 01:03:13,029
how do you say, indispensable?

497
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:14,989
Indispensable.

498
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,493
That's what I thought.

499
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,580
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

500
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:25,166
I got a truck to meet.

501
01:03:28,128 --> 01:03:32,008
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

502
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:36,304
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

503
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:38,515
I know how you feel about me.

504
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:41,768
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

505
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:45,396
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

506
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:48,650
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

507
01:03:48,817 --> 01:03:50,903
That's exactly what I mean.

508
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:56,117
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

509
01:03:56,284 --> 01:03:58,619
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

510
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,707
Latrine.

511
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:07,880
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

512
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:11,007
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

513
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:13,010
Not the bird, you fool!

514
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:17,139
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

515
01:04:17,306 --> 01:04:19,808
Look, a message.

516
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:25,605
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

517
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:30,361
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

518
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:41,457
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

519
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,085
No, I'm not.

520
01:04:45,252 --> 01:04:48,380
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

521
01:04:48,547 --> 01:04:51,383
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

522
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:54,970
I'm Mel Torme.

523
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:01,645
That was close.

524
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:05,648
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

525
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:09,737
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

526
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:14,033
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

527
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,745
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

528
01:05:17,912 --> 01:05:20,081
He came to us with no credentials.

529
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:24,377
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

530
01:05:24,544 --> 01:05:27,047
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

531
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,924
Nigel, what are you saying?

532
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:34,638
How do we know
he's not Mel Torme?

533
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,113
Look, he's at the jukebox.

534
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:55,956
This is not Mel Torme.

535
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,821
Oh, Nick.

536
01:08:29,283 --> 01:08:30,743
Yes?

537
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:34,538
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

538
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:39,252
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

539
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:42,130
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

540
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:44,382
You must know that when we were
together last night,

541
01:08:44,549 --> 01:08:47,218
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

542
01:08:47,343 --> 01:08:49,721
And now that you know?

543
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:54,643
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

544
01:08:54,809 --> 01:09:00,066
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

545
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:04,571
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

546
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:08,324
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

547
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:15,707
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

548
01:10:02,215 --> 01:10:04,384
I've spotted the herd.

549
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:07,053
They're the key to the whole plan.

550
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,015
Now, we're here.

551
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:13,936
Every morning at 7:1 5

552
01:10:14,102 --> 01:10:17,439
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

553
01:10:17,606 --> 01:10:20,318
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

554
01:10:20,485 --> 01:10:24,280
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

555
01:10:24,448 --> 01:10:29,410
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

556
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:32,039
Then we'll break away from the other cows

557
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:34,415
and enter the generator building here.

558
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:39,212
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

559
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:43,509
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

560
01:10:43,675 --> 01:10:46,137
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

561
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:49,682
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

562
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:52,936
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

563
01:10:53,102 --> 01:10:55,814
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

564
01:11:09,286 --> 01:11:12,165
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

565
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,375
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

566
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:18,170
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

567
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:21,550
All right, be an asshole.

568
01:11:31,435 --> 01:11:34,355
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

569
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:43,447
All right, let's go. Double time.

570
01:11:52,624 --> 01:11:56,754
We only have five minutes to get
to the circuit box and throw the switch.

571
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:59,840
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

572
01:12:00,006 --> 01:12:03,511
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

573
01:12:03,678 --> 01:12:06,472
I can only see one.

574
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:09,100
There girl, move along.

575
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:19,319
Stay behind the guards.

576
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:23,073
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

577
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,242
OK, now!

578
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:28,829
I think we did it.

579
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:37,047
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

580
01:12:37,214 --> 01:12:39,924
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

581
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:42,803
Mon Dieu!

582
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:51,312
Nigel, you OK?

583
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:53,230
Oh, yeah.

584
01:12:53,397 --> 01:12:55,233
Let's go.

585
01:12:55,398 --> 01:13:00,113
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

586
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:03,491
I just wanted to take a...rest.

587
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:25,556
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

588
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:28,393
Three more minutes.

589
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,770
Then we can cut the wire.

590
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:57,549
There it is.

591
01:14:46,642 --> 01:14:47,936
Lovely.

592
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:05,788
You're all right now. I'm here.

593
01:15:06,706 --> 01:15:08,625
It's all right.

594
01:15:15,048 --> 01:15:16,508
Hey.

595
01:15:35,862 --> 01:15:36,904
Here, here.

596
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,373
Vive la France!

597
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:03,475
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

598
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:06,102
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

599
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:10,398
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

600
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:13,277
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

601
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,282
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

602
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:23,371
So, it is you who is the traitor!

603
01:16:38,596 --> 01:16:43,018
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

604
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:46,103
Now, get over there and...

605
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:54,821
- Dr Flammond.
- Nick!

606
01:16:54,988 --> 01:16:57,532
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

607
01:16:57,698 --> 01:17:00,160
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

608
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:02,997
Thank God, but how ironic.

609
01:17:03,163 --> 01:17:07,293
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

610
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,718
Nice work.

611
01:17:39,703 --> 01:17:40,912
Nigel.

612
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:43,080
Very clever, my darling.

613
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,917
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

614
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:49,546
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

615
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:53,550
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

616
01:17:53,717 --> 01:17:56,887
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

617
01:17:57,054 --> 01:18:00,182
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

618
01:18:00,349 --> 01:18:02,351
Comrades?

619
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:06,355
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

620
01:18:06,522 --> 01:18:09,902
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

621
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:14,114
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

622
01:18:14,281 --> 01:18:16,408
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

623
01:18:16,574 --> 01:18:20,371
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.

624
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:47,232
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

625
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:49,444
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

626
01:18:57,243 --> 01:18:59,287
What happened?

627
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:04,126
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

628
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:07,004
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

629
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:11,342
And what does he want us to do now?

630
01:19:11,509 --> 01:19:14,261
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

631
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,334
Latrine!

632
01:19:46,504 --> 01:19:50,467
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

633
01:19:50,634 --> 01:19:53,553
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

634
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,307
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

635
01:19:57,474 --> 01:19:59,561
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

636
01:19:59,726 --> 01:20:03,355
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 1 8:00.

637
01:20:03,522 --> 01:20:06,901
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

638
01:20:07,067 --> 01:20:09,278
especially at this time of year.

639
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:12,198
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

640
01:20:12,365 --> 01:20:13,908
Good luck.

641
01:20:22,834 --> 01:20:27,089
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

642
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,666
Goodbye.

643
01:23:28,365 --> 01:23:31,243
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

644
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:33,454
I will not leave without my daughter.

645
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:36,500
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn

646
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:40,169
and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

647
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:42,464
There they are!

648
01:23:47,136 --> 01:23:50,305
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

649
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:53,434
How I feared I would never see you again.

650
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,936
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

651
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:59,732
There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

652
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:02,986
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

653
01:24:03,153 --> 01:24:07,824
I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower

654
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:10,035
under the iron fist of oppression,

655
01:24:10,202 --> 01:24:12,245
as long as a child cries out in the night,

656
01:24:12,412 --> 01:24:16,708
or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

657
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:18,168
No, Hillary.

658
01:24:18,335 --> 01:24:21,255
It is too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

659
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:24,466
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

660
01:24:24,633 --> 01:24:27,304
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

661
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,557
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

662
01:24:31,724 --> 01:24:35,895
And as long as we do,
we know we are not alone in our fight.

663
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:39,650
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

664
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:43,070
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything will be fine.

665
01:24:43,237 --> 01:24:49,035
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

666
01:24:49,202 --> 01:24:51,079
I want you to be with me.

667
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:55,166
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

668
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:59,462
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say it now.

669
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:04,759
Want!
Want more than anything!

670
01:25:04,926 --> 01:25:07,930
Take me. Take me with you!

671
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:25,490
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

672
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:29,495
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

673
01:25:30,913 --> 01:25:34,833
Goodbye, Deja Vu.
I will always remember you.

674
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,879
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.
