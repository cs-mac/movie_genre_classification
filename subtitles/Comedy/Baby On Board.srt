Hey!

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,007
Sweetie, you give
it back to him now!

49
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,734
Okay.

50
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,537
Listen. Nope.

51
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,339
Give it to him!

52
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,413
Stop it!

53
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:17,506
Stop it!
Give him the gun! Now!

54
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:35,128
Meghan, you have a million toys!
Give him the gun!

55
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:36,269
Give me it!

56
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:36,801
No!

57
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:40,236
Meghan, sit still so I can
put your sweater on. Stop it!

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,671
Stop fighting with your brother!
Come on! Meghan!

59
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,405
Meghan! Stop!
Give your brother the gun!

60
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,172
No!

61
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,475
Hey, Sylvie, are 3-year-olds
supposed to have dart guns?

62
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:52,014
It's the only thing
that gets him to stop wailing.

63
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,882
You know, I'm so sorry, but Danny
was supposed to pick up the car.

64
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:55,682
Give me it!

65
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:56,380
Meghan!

66
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,457
No!
- Give it back to him right now!

67
00:02:58,558 --> 00:02:59,252
No!

68
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:00,654
Do you want Mommy
to put you on medication?

69
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:03,028
Is that what you want?
Like your friend Jenny?

70
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,756
No!
- No!

71
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,479
Danny, stop staring.

72
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,775
- Look at it.
- No.

73
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,578
- Look.
- No.

74
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:25,912
Just look at it.

75
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,891
Aren't you supposed to pick up
Sylvie's car today?

76
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,462
Shit.

77
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:37,587
Yeah.

78
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:40,230
- All right, Feel Good.
- Some girls would powder my balls.

79
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,698
We'll get out of here.

80
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:45,063
- Hi, Counselor.
- Oh, Candy!

81
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,832
Who is your gorgeous friend?

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,374
You think he's gorgeous,
you ought to see his wife.

83
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,171
Is his wife as understanding
as yours is?

84
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:54,873
<i>Uh, she's understanding.
Not that understanding.</i>

85
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,148
You a lawyer too?

86
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,513
Yeah, yes.
Danny and I are partners.

87
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,580
Well, Mr. Lawyer.

88
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:05,347
I'm a relaxation therapist.

89
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,589
So, if you get as stressed
as your friend Danny,

90
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:09,793
come and see me.

91
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:12,328
Mmm.

92
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:16,326
That's so you don't forget me.

93
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,505
Nobody's forgetting you, honey.

94
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,964
What exactly
am I supposed to do with this?

95
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,168
Frame it.
I don't give a shit.

96
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,801
I've got, like, seven of them.

97
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:34,811
Maybe I'll get lucky,

98
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,513
and Danny will have a heart attack
doing arm squats or whatever.

99
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,785
Look, you're gonna
have a great day today.

100
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,361
- Call me when it's over, okay?
- Okay, I will.

101
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,257
Say bye to your Auntie Angela.

102
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:44,330
Bye!

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Ryan Scott Chambers!

104
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,782
How come old guys got to walk
around the locker room naked?

105
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,846
You cheating on Sylvie?

106
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,615
No!

107
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,489
I paid Candy for her service.

108
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:15,855
Candy could do a lot better,
you know.

109
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,190
Hey, when we got married,
Sylvie looked like Angela,

110
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,733
I looked like you,
then the kids came along.

111
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,495
We want to have kids eventually.

112
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,730
Nothing wrong with a little
side action now and then.

113
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:27,632
Oh, well, then,
I guess you wouldn't mind

114
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:30,005
if Sylvie got "a little side action
now and then. "

115
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:34,507
You be as judgmental as you want.
You're gonna be here one day.

116
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,951
And we'll both be there one day.

117
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,055
That balls?

118
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,786
Incredible.

119
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,253
Do you think he's okay?

120
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:52,860
Fuck!

121
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:54,799
Hello.

122
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,131
Yes, I need you to get the samples
to the conference room in an hour.

123
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,137
Don't even worry about it, Angela.
I'm so on it.

124
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,002
I'm just running a little bit late.

125
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,233
You hung up on me!

126
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,276
Ooh, I love that lipstick.
What is that? Pink Flush?

127
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,004
You can't borrow it.

128
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,803
Wait a minute.

129
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,110
Did I tell you I'm in love?

130
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,081
- No, you're not in love.
- Yes, I am.

131
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,716
- No, you're not.
- Angie, my heart is full.

132
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,589
Oh, my God.
It's a big day for me.

133
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,629
Hey, Angie.

134
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,229
Okay. Who is the lucky lover?

135
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,026
Well, I can't say anything yet,

136
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,762
except that he is everything
a woman would ever want in a man,

137
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,201
except he's gay.

138
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,273
Ms. Black, you still have not
answered my question.

139
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,451
Do you truly believe that you
deserve more of my client's money?

140
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,117
It says explicitly in the contract.

141
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:51,949
Contract?

142
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,618
How about the contract you signed
when you said "I do"?

143
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,661
I tend to remember an important
clause in that contract,

144
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:58,592
"for better or for worse. "

145
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,029
Does that ring a bell?

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,894
Objection!

147
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,567
Speaks to character, Your Honor.

148
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,468
I'll allow it.

149
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,470
<i>He cheated on me.</i>

150
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Circumstantial!

151
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,801
There's not one piece
of physical evidence

152
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,571
that proves my client strayed.

153
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:13,974
What about the text messages?

154
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,247
The photos?

155
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:18,517
What about that filthy video
on YouTube?

156
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,346
Circumstantial.

157
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,348
Your Honor...

158
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:23,021
Tread carefully, Counselor.

159
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,918
You never see my client's face
in any of them.

160
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,356
Ms. Black, you still have not
answered my question.

161
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,523
My client has graciously
given you and your children

162
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,566
the family home with an estimated
value of 4 million dollars.

163
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,962
That's 4.5.

164
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,271
4.5 million dollars.

165
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:42,466
Do you really believe
that you deserve more than that?

166
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,173
He signed a contract.

167
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:51,049
"He signed the contract. "

168
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,846
Does that sound heartfelt,
Your Honor?

169
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:53,646
Does that sound like someone

170
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,082
who truly believes
that they deserve more money?

171
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,918
- Does that...?
- Objection, Your Honor.

172
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,289
Is my client going to be asked
a question in the foreseeable future?

173
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,121
I have nothing further. I couldn't
have answered it better myself.

174
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,464
No fist-bumping in court.

175
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,983
Nice suit, John.

176
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,248
That tie...

177
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,966
Good morning, Mary!

178
00:08:55,648 --> 00:09:00,881
Okay. For the woman
about to start a family,

179
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:06,048
we present the allure
of "Baby on Board" perfume

180
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,649
to keep Daddy interested,

181
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:13,857
the only fragrance especially made
for the pregnant woman in love.

182
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:20,102
And here is the bottle prototype.

183
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,433
Do you think someone
could possibly pass me the bottle

184
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:30,412
of this soon-to-be
best-selling scent?

185
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,487
I'm sorry.
Nervous stomach.

186
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,759
What is in this bottle?

187
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,965
Perfume.

188
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,136
For who?
The walking dead?

189
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,799
I'm sorry. It's me.

190
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,105
I just...
I ate something bad.

191
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:39,242
I have a 4:10 meeting
with the reps from Saks,

192
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,615
and I just hope for your sake
this doesn't cling to me.

193
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,716
For the rest of you, I suggest you
open some windows for ventilation.

194
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,454
Try not to jump out.

195
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,661
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,878
So? What did they say?

197
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,972
Oh, sweet Jesus!

198
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,743
Honey, did something
crawl up your ass and die?

199
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,216
I blew it!

200
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,182
Yes, yes. "Blew it" are
the operative words, all right.

201
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,448
- I'm sick.
- Oh, God!

202
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,559
No, no, honey. Sick is like,
"Poop, poop!" "Tee-hee!"

203
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,525
Oh, God.
That is demonic.

204
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,027
You are not helping.

205
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,654
The power of Christ compels you!
The power of Christ compels you!

206
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,333
Raphy, I have to get her
to approve this stuff.

207
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,732
Honey, I know.
She will, okay? She will.

208
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>Angela Marks,
are you still there?</i>

209
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes, I'm still here.

210
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,869
<i>Mary would like
to see you in her office.</i>

211
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:42,505
- I'll be right there.
- Jesus! That was fast.

212
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,922
Seriously, that was great.

213
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,615
I thought I'd never get out
of that pre-nup.

214
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:52,986
Honey, come here and meet Curtis.

215
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,156
I told you he'd do it.

216
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,852
This is my ex-wife's cousin.
Worth every penny.

217
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,124
Come on.

218
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,665
Let's go buy a sex swing.

219
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,995
Okay, Uncle Phil.

220
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,223
- You are amazing.
- Excuse me?

221
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:28,316
I'm sorry.
My name is Arlene Jenkins.

222
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:31,659
Everyone says the same thing
about you, "There's none better,"

223
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,890
but I had to see it for myself.

224
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:38,470
Oh, my. I grew faint just the way
you pounded away at that woman.

225
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,104
What can I do for you, Mrs. Jenkins?

226
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,172
<i>There's a lot you can do to me.</i>

227
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,038
Okay.

228
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,240
It's my husband.
He's a liar.

229
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,439
But I'm sad to say
I see a lot of that.

230
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:50,948
The son of a bitch
told me he was dying,

231
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,051
and that's the only reason
I married him.

232
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,183
So, he is...?

233
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,720
97.

234
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:56,186
Oh.

235
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,224
Have you ever had
a 97-year-old man on top of you?

236
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,388
It's like fucking a beanbag chair.

237
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:04,390
I didn't need to hear that.

238
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,691
We just got his medical report.

239
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,562
Besides the fact that he's on an
oxygen tank, he's healthy as a hog.

240
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,067
He'll probably outlive me.

241
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,898
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

242
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,632
This is my pre-nup.
I need a way out.

243
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,540
Sure you want to leave with...?

244
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,201
With as much as I can carry.

245
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,246
Ms. Jenkins, I shouldn't be looking
at this material.

246
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,110
- Mr. Marks.
- Curtis.

247
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:26,913
Curtis.

248
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,418
<i>I need you.</i>

249
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:37,362
Okay, I will take a look at this,
and my office will be in touch.

250
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,757
Thank you...

251
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:42,232
...Curtis.

252
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,246
You can sit...

253
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,255
...unless sitting makes
your problem worse.

254
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,423
I'm really sorry about that.
I think I'm okay now.

255
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:13,992
Is this your family?

256
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,867
- Wow, your daughter is so...
- No. It came with the frame.

257
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:22,299
92.1% of men prefer to deal
with a woman who has a family.

258
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:26,171
<i>You know how many men want
to hire a woman that has a family?</i>

259
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:28,380
8.1%.

260
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,177
Which just proves conclusively
that men are stupid.

261
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:38,486
Now, speaking of stupid,

262
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,658
for the woman
who is about to start a family,

263
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,227
I should have thrown you
out of that conference room

264
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,195
for suggesting something
so Sesame Street,

265
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,732
but unfortunately I have a board
that I have to answer to,

266
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:51,166
and they have voted.

267
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,296
You're approved.

268
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,333
Now, listen to me.
Listen to me really good.

269
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,504
You screw this up,
it is your ass on the line.

270
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:09,084
Now, I expect a budget and marketing
analysis on my desk in one week.

271
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,377
Get out.

272
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,393
- Wow! What's that for?
- I missed you today.

273
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,126
Me too. Guess what?

274
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,895
Tell me, how did it go?

275
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,732
Mary said yes.

276
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,396
- She said yes?
- Yes! She said yes!

277
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:01,530
Fist-pound.

278
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,337
Angela, I don't believe this.
This is... This is amazing.

279
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,502
You are gonna have
your own perfume line.

280
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,203
I know. I mean,
this is put up or shut up time.

281
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,010
All those years
in college and business school

282
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,812
and then months
slaving away as an intern.

283
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:13,850
Can you believe this?

284
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,080
Vice-president of one
of the biggest cosmetic companies

285
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,086
in all of the world!

286
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,180
This is huge!
This is my everything!

287
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,782
Everything?

288
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,450
Well, present company excluded.

289
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,289
Mm.

290
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,556
Um, Angela,

291
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,598
since this "Baby on Board" thing
is such a big deal,

292
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,602
maybe you and I should start trying.

293
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,537
Trying?

294
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,637
Trying to make a baby.

295
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:40,940
You know, lose the condoms.

296
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,742
Ahh...

297
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,447
You okay?

298
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,376
Hmm.

299
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:51,680
Here we are.

300
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,130
- Why would we want to do that?
- For research.

301
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,664
We'll get you pregnant,
and then you'll know exactly...

302
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,668
Sorry.

303
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,006
Sorry about that.

304
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:15,740
Here you go.

305
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,259
You're certainly eating a lot.

306
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,927
Before you get mad,
I don't mean that in a fat-people way.

307
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:36,490
I just mean that you're consuming
more food than usual.

308
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,627
Well, it emptied me out,
and now I got to fill me back up.

309
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,639
Are you listening to me?

310
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,207
No one's listening to you,
you big lush.

311
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:50,077
Look. All I'm saying is
guys like the chase.

312
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,715
You take a guy, he gets married,

313
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,048
and it's like, it's like putting
a wolf in a cage, all right?

314
00:17:55,221 --> 00:18:00,124
Every chick that walks by,
it's like a fresh, tasty rib-eye.

315
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,317
Danny, come on.

316
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,395
Maybe we should
get a breath of fresh air.

317
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,794
What? I'm just trying
to make a point.

318
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,124
And that would be what?

319
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,095
Tell them.

320
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:10,797
- Me?
- Yeah, you tell them.

321
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:16,637
Uh, well, we're all aware of the fact
that wealthy men pay for sex.

322
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,138
Oh, we are? Are we?

323
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,573
- I think it's disgusting.
- Good.

324
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,875
Are you having sex with prostitutes?

325
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,878
No.

326
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,622
Wait, Sylvie. Did I tell you
about my meeting today with Mary?

327
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,195
Danny, did I tell you
about the new client that we got?

328
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,795
Look, all I'm saying is
there are some guys out there

329
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:46,133
who get a little gash on the side,
and they have to pay for it.

330
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,172
It's the only way
they can get it, all right?

331
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,707
And I don't have that problem,

332
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,806
'cause I got the looks,
and I got the money.

333
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,607
I got it all, baby! High-five!

334
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,011
You know, women are looking
for a lot more in a relationship

335
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,518
than looks and money.

336
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,315
You're so drunk.

337
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,616
I'm not that drunk.

338
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,692
Um, you know what? Why don't we
actually just get out of here?

339
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,489
That makes you feel special?

340
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:12,996
Going out four nights a week,
getting drunk, paying for sex?

341
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:13,996
You be my guest.

342
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,799
But why don't we put the shoe
on the other foot, Danny?

343
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,469
<i>Why don't you
raise the kids for a while</i>

344
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,540
while I go out and find every possible
excuse to stay away from the house?

345
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,470
Then you can spend all day
with the carpools, and the play dates,

346
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,306
and the vomit, and the laundry,
and the groceries,

347
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,347
and shoveling the goddamn snow
in the fucking driveway.

348
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,209
Why don't you do all those things,

349
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:34,275
and then you can pay whoever
the hell you want to fuck you!

350
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,486
Okay.

351
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,261
You think that I don't bust my ass
every goddamn day

352
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:44,590
for you and those kids, huh?

353
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,358
You want to talk about stress?

354
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,660
Maybe I should go visit
a Korean hand-job parlor

355
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,462
like the rest of the guys
in the office do.

356
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,630
Fuck it.
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

357
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,701
You know what?
Maybe I will join them.

358
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,911
Honey, nobody wants to fuck you.

359
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,482
Well, wait, Sylvie, um...

360
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,213
Sylvie! Sylvie!

361
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:12,223
That was awkward.

362
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:22,129
Oh, baby, baby! Oh, my God!
I'm almost there! Don't stop!

363
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,498
Yeah, I know. Me too.
It's knocking at the door.

364
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,834
- Please let me take the condom off.
- Oh, baby, no!

365
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,566
I can't get pregnant now.
Are you nuts?

366
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:32,405
Please...
Oh... Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

367
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:37,778
That, uh, makes it a moot point now.

368
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:41,819
- Was that good for you?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,822
Sorry about that.

370
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:48,287
Baby?

371
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:49,292
Mm-hmm.

372
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:50,885
Do you still think that I'm beautiful?

373
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:54,124
Of course
I think that you're beautiful.

374
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,497
I just lasted three minutes
with two condoms on.

375
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,002
I wish you were a little more fat
or a little more ugly.

376
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,799
I might last a little longer.

377
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,606
Do you think that I've gained weight?

378
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,903
I don't care if you've gained weight.

379
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,443
So you think I'm fat?

380
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,705
I'm in hell.

381
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:13,746
Baby, I just, I saw Danny and Sylvie
tonight, and I got scared.

382
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:16,680
Angie, I married you for you.

383
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,780
And if that means
that at some point down the road

384
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:22,850
you get a little spare tire,
maybe some thunder thighs,

385
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:25,962
varicose veins, arm fat, triple chin,

386
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:28,725
I did say
"for better or for worse," right?

387
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,629
But how about we keep it
on the "better" side

388
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,294
for at least a little while?

389
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:33,803
Well, what if one day
I'm not good enough?

390
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:37,842
Honey, come on.
You'll always be good enough.

391
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,836
Good night.

392
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:47,245
<i>I mean, better than good enough.
I mean, fantastic.</i>

393
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,945
Good night, Curtis.

394
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,454
Wonderful...

395
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,698
Marvelous...

396
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,030
Oh, yeah!
Let me fuck your titties.

397
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,070
Oh, yeah. Fuck you.

398
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,639
Fucking... Come on!

399
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,534
Come on!

400
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:19,914
You're pathetic.

401
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,812
Hey, this is my house.

402
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:26,584
If I want to knock one out
of the park now and then, I can do it.

403
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:27,716
Really?

404
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,428
Yeah, really.

405
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,194
Get out.

406
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,395
What?

407
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,133
I want you to move out of this house

408
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:39,261
before I actually catch you
fucking some whore.

409
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:41,729
I don't fuck whores.

410
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,238
I'm so tired, Danny.

411
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,369
I'm tired of your staying out
all night, your drinking,

412
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,504
the lipstick on your underpants...

413
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,479
- What lipstick on...?
... cheap perfume.

414
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,448
I want you out of my life!

415
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,020
Fine, then.

416
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,315
Fine, then?

417
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,423
Fine, then. I'll move out.

418
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:04,992
Fine, then.
Then, move out.

419
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:07,497
Move out.

420
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,430
This is my house!

421
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:14,529
If I want to whack off all over
the thread pillows, then I will,

422
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,471
fuck you very much!

423
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,545
Who is she?

424
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,115
What's her name?
How long has this been going on?

425
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,116
- Hey!
- And why are you leaving me?

426
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,618
Hey! What is...?
What is wrong with you, Angela?

427
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,283
I know!

428
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,988
You know what?

429
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:21,792
For you, she... I know...
I saw that bitch in the kitchen!

430
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:26,658
Okay, Angela.
You were dreaming.

431
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,097
It was a dream.
It was your dream.

432
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:32,565
But not my dream, because I've
been here, right here the whole time,

433
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,330
trying to sleep,

434
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:37,204
while you've been snoring,
belching, and farting, Angela,

435
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:40,240
bad, smelly farts.

436
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:42,575
So you're not cheating on me
with a model chick?

437
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:43,680
What model chick?

438
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:49,986
What did she look like?

439
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,486
A little Elle Macpherson action?

440
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:07,138
- I got your jacket.
- Thank you.

441
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,706
Do you got everything?

442
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,272
Sure do.

443
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,444
I'm gonna be a little late
tonight, honey,

444
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,483
so don't wait for me for dinner.

445
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,280
I don't think I could
even if I wanted to.

446
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:26,551
Kick Mary's ass today. I want
to hear all about it when I get back.

447
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,587
Love you, too.

448
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:37,094
Hey, honey.

449
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:37,827
Hey!

450
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,130
I'm so starving!

451
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,501
Angela, no.
No, you made me promise you.

452
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,005
- No more bad food.
- I'm letting you out of the promise.

453
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,769
- You said you'd say that.
- This is the last time.

454
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:48,573
- You said you'd say that, too.
- Give me a fuckin' bite!

455
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,746
- Here, you can have the fries.
- Thanks.

456
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,780
Angela? Angela!

457
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,556
Mm, talk about choking the chicken.

458
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:04,928
Anyway, just...
Numbers are looking really good.

459
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:08,598
Mm, mm, the prelims
are coming in nicely.

460
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,735
We really got to wow
these money people.

461
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,732
Plenty of time
to reach wow status.

462
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,000
Really, I think everything
is gonna be fine.

463
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,007
I think it is gonna be
better than fine,

464
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,010
even though the Japanese
have upped their deadline to June,

465
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:20,869
I think we'll be fine.

466
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,173
June?

467
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,975
You need wow by June?

468
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:27,142
No problem.

469
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:30,616
This is your baby.
Don't fuck it up.

470
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:38,293
Mm, mm, mm.

471
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:39,830
Hello.

472
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,899
Sweetie, you give it
back to him now.

473
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,398
Hey!

474
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,901
Oh, hey. I'm so glad you could come.
Have you eaten?

475
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,197
- Uh, just a little lunch.
- You know what?

476
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:47,999
You two go over there,
and you shoot each other.

477
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,574
That's right. Go over.
You have my permission.

478
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:51,573
What's going on?

479
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:55,612
Well, I just needed to see you.
I'm so tired.

480
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:04,145
Cock-sucker, piece-of-shit footballs!

481
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:05,416
You seem tense.

482
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,351
I kicked Danny out last night.

483
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,122
Oh, my God, Sylvie!
What happened?

484
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:16,723
Yeah, but I probably would have
been okay with it, the cheating,

485
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:21,462
if he'd had the decency
to at least try to hide it from me.

486
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,835
You really would have been
okay with that?

487
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,375
I'm not stupid!

488
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,672
Danny has always been a wild pig.

489
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,077
I mean, hell, that's what attracted me
to his fat ass in the first place.

490
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:34,585
And I know I don't look the same.
I know.

491
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,212
I used to be so hot.

492
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,019
- And now I'm just...
- You are hot.

493
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:42,286
I'm not hot.

494
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,425
I will never be
that skinny ever again.

495
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,895
You... You are skinny.
You are.

496
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,260
I turned around the other day,

497
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:51,267
and my left tit
knocked over a toaster.

498
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:53,303
You have great tits.
Your tits are beautiful.

499
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,067
- They're not! They're saggy!
- No, they're not!

500
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,640
And after Ryan,

501
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:01,234
Jesus Christ, you could have
smuggled Mexicans over the border

502
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:02,244
in my vagina.

503
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,037
Enormous!

504
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,309
You have a great vagina.

505
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,817
Any man would be lucky
to be in your vagina.

506
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,917
You should see
the way he looks at me.

507
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:13,582
It is like I stole
something from him.

508
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,154
Of course I'm not okay
with the cheating,

509
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,390
but if that's what it took
to keep him, I would...

510
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:24,561
But at some point he just...
He just stopped caring.

511
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:27,463
And I can deal with a lot of things,
but I can't deal with that.

512
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,403
I wish I were a lesbian.

513
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,075
Hold on one second, okay?

514
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:53,524
Girl, I am not a doctor,
but you have got a bug or something.

515
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:03,169
So, how is my girl?

516
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,430
Not so hot.

517
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,974
Well, you look pretty hot to me.

518
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,943
What's, uh, what's going on
inside of you?

519
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,809
I can't keep anything down.

520
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,678
Really?

521
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,719
Have you experienced
morning sickness?

522
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,379
No way!
I mean, I threw up this morning,

523
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,481
but it's not morning sickness.

524
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,125
Gas?

525
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,923
What are we talking about?

526
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,702
Look at this.

527
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,374
Angela...

528
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:45,880
...you're pregnant.

529
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,555
No way!
Curtis wears protection.

530
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:54,921
Well, one little guy snuck in,
and it only takes one.

531
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,218
This can't be.

532
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,660
Damn him!

533
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,924
Angela, do you know how many
women who can't get pregnant

534
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,728
would love to be
in your shoes right now?

535
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:06,268
I can't fit into my shoes.

536
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:09,968
I have so much going on right now.
This is the wrong time!

537
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,373
Angela, as your friend,
I need to tell you this.

538
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:15,844
It's never the right time.
I see women in here all day long,

539
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,075
and even when they think they're
not able to handle this, they are.

540
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:26,587
Hey, you may not think you're ready,
but your body is telling you it is.

541
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,556
You feel better?

542
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,851
No!

543
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,558
Thank you.

544
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,861
Mrs. Jenkins, I've got it.

545
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,195
I bet you do.

546
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,837
Would you say
that your husband treats you well?

547
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,031
He gives me everything I want.

548
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,541
Okay, okay.
Is it good enough?

549
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:46,836
Oh.

550
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,345
Your pre-nup,
Section 14, Article 3A,

551
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,744
hinges on your standard of living,

552
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,610
which Mr. Jenkins
is obligated to provide.

553
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:56,346
If he does not,
your pre-nup is null and void.

554
00:32:56,454 --> 00:33:00,413
So, I'm going to ask you again,
Mrs. Jenkins,

555
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,022
is it good enough?

556
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,726
I'm not pregnant.
I'm not pregnant.

557
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:13,769
I'm not pregnant, okay?

558
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:15,533
I don't want to be pregnant.
I don't feel pregnant.

559
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,335
And you know what?
I'm never having sex again.

560
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,376
He lied to me.
He said that Chucky was covered,

561
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,411
little Chucky with two raincoats.

562
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,208
Yeah, well, I got to go, lady.

563
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,509
Be glad you're not a woman.

564
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:25,947
Okay. Thank you.

565
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:43,157
I have never been
so turned on in all of my life.

566
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,400
Mrs. Jenkins! Mrs. Jenkins!

567
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,627
Mm, Mr. Marks!

568
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,580
Oh, Mr. Marks!

569
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,382
Mrs. Jenkins,
Mrs. Jenkins, Mrs. Jenkins.

570
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:06,184
Please, Mrs. Jenkins.
Mrs. Jenkins, stop it!

571
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,986
Mrs. Jenkins, get off of me!
Come on!

572
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:10,561
I'm sorry.
You're just so, so devious.

573
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,688
Yes, I... I took two classes
on the subject at Harvard.

574
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:14,856
I hated them both.

575
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,000
Mrs. Jenkins, please, please,
get my thumb...

576
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,501
You can't do that to my thumb.

577
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,570
Son of a bitch!

578
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,911
He was making out with her
in front of the whole restaurant.

579
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,677
That son of a bitch.

580
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,680
Sylvie?

581
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:37,982
<i>Yeah?</i>

582
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,990
I'm pregnant.

583
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,950
Son of a bitch.

584
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:45,656
What do I do?

585
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:47,464
Oh, honey. I'm gonna
come right over right now.

586
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:48,463
I'll be right over.

587
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,891
- Hello.
- Oh, I'll call you back. He's here.

588
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,560
You call me right back!

589
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:56,440
Hi.

590
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:58,699
Hey.

591
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:04,848
Oh, okay.

592
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,382
What's up?

593
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,951
You know what's up.

594
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:09,519
Really?
You're gonna have to tell me,

595
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,714
because I have no idea what
you're trying to pull me into here.

596
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:14,051
- It's not a what. It's a who.
- A who? What who?

597
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,127
What who? You who!
That's what, who.

598
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,988
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Dr. Seuss.

599
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:19,723
Come on, Ang.
What's going on?

600
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:23,062
Nothing is going on here,
and nothing will go on here.

601
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,799
Okay. Well, then, this fight
that we aren't really having is over.

602
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,006
- No.
- No?

603
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,164
- Stop it!
- Stop what?

604
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,569
Answering with a question.

605
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:34,306
Angela, something's wrong.
I don't know what it is.

606
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,073
Did something happen
at work today?

607
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,771
- Don't change the subject!
- What subject?

608
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,314
I'm pregnant.

609
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,519
You're pregnant?

610
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:50,422
Angela, that...
That's amazing.

611
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,725
That's... That's wonderful.
It's, it's...

612
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:57,063
- No, it's not.
- Yes. Angie, Ang.

613
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:01,400
I know we didn't plan for this,
but we're gonna make it work, okay?

614
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,297
What is wrong with you?

615
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:06,206
I know plenty of women who
would be jumping for joy right now.

616
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:09,405
Oh, you know plenty of women?
How many women do you know?

617
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:14,343
Okay. Angela,
we're gonna be parents.

618
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,248
Let's just calm down
and be happy about this.

619
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,151
Oh, how can I be happy
when the father of my child

620
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,748
isn't who I thought he would be?

621
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:32,634
She's cheating on you.

622
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,666
Don't be ridiculous.

623
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:37,866
You said it yourself.
She's hiding something, right?

624
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,838
"The father isn't who I thought
he was. " What's that bullshit?

625
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:44,142
She's probably banging
some 7-foot-tall black brother.

626
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,643
You always use two skins.
You always double-bag it, right?

627
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,749
- Yes.
- All right. Look here.

628
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:52,345
Look. It says right here,
97% effective.

629
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:56,518
Now, I'm no math wizard,
but 97 times 2,

630
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,654
that's like, you know,
infinite protection.

631
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,826
I can't believe she would do this.

632
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:05,096
Don't be a putz.
We see this shit all the time.

633
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,738
This shit paid
for our houses, all right?

634
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,775
Just 'cause it's happening to you...
no different.

635
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:15,003
Oh, look at that.

636
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,071
Curtis, I'd tear that ass up.

637
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,547
Be like Roberto Duran
on a speed bag

638
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,084
with my nuts flying off her ass,

639
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:23,210
dah-duh-duh, dah-duh-duh,
dah-duh-duh, dah.

640
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,888
Are you moving in with your whore?

641
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,096
Whose baby is that?

642
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,630
What did you say?

643
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,731
Fuck you, asshole!

644
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:14,970
Excuse me?

645
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,104
You're the one who cheated here.

646
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,603
Why is this my fault?

647
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:21,711
Why is everything my fault?

648
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:24,008
Don't throw this on me.
Take some responsibility.

649
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,806
Don't push this on me.

650
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,051
Get out!

651
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,257
Fine.

652
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:35,517
Good.

653
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:56,005
Tell me what happened.

654
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,344
I'm a mess.
He just stormed out.

655
00:38:58,449 --> 00:38:59,438
Say something.

656
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:05,752
Statistically, women live five years
longer than men.

657
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:08,553
<i>Keep going.</i>

658
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,821
Women use their brains
a lot more than men.

659
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,159
It's not working.
I'm still crying.

660
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:16,560
There's a handbag sale at Macy's.

661
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:20,836
He's gone.

662
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:21,867
I'm coming over.

663
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,400
What about the kids?

664
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,703
They're fine.

665
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:30,842
They're fine.

666
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:34,308
You know, I'll come to you because
I have to get out of this house.

667
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:09,483
Just look.
Just look and learn.

668
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,689
Oh, this is Curtis, girls.

669
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,787
I'm paying you per the hip thrust.
Shake a leg!

670
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,158
Sit down, my man.

671
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,635
You should have seen Angela's face
when we were arguing.

672
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,263
She was definitely
hiding something,

673
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,671
the way she wasn't saying anything

674
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,300
and kept backing me in a corner,
like I was the one who was cheating.

675
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:38,314
Oh, yeah. Sylvie used to do
that shit to me all the time.

676
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:39,777
<i>But you were cheating.</i>

677
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:43,543
Yeah, yeah, but she was still
very good at it.

678
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,816
Look, I've got these girls
for, like, 19 more minutes.

679
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,753
What do you say we get out of here
and go to the Korean after that, huh?

680
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:56,322
Korean parlor?
Can't trust women.

681
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,892
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

682
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,472
Here it comes.

683
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,507
Ooh!

684
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,100
I don't know, Danny.
I still love her.

685
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,439
She's my world, you know.

686
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,505
Yeah, your world
was banging another dude.

687
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,242
Smell her right there.

688
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:16,582
You wouldn't even know about it
if she didn't get knocked up.

689
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,348
Maybe you should think about that.

690
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,356
- You're right.
- You're right I'm right.

691
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,220
You got screwed.

692
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,551
You're right. I'm done.

693
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,094
No, I, I'm...
With my marriage, I'm done.

694
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:30,130
Hey, she's sleeping
at your house.

695
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,134
Probably got some jizz monkey
over there right now.

696
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,727
- She wouldn't.
- Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

697
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,773
'Cause you know her so well.

698
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:39,843
Mm, look at this.

699
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:44,210
Hey, honey, I got more cash
back in the boudoir.

700
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,213
<i>Oui, oui!</i>

701
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,413
How are you doing?
I'm... I'm Curtis.

702
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:56,322
Nice to meet you.

703
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,296
Um...

704
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:02,298
Um, do you go to school
around here or something?

705
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:09,800
Thanks.

706
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,067
What am I supposed to do?

707
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:12,642
What I did with Danny...

708
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:17,238
Get him to confess and then
kick his ass out on the street.

709
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:21,412
Well, I can't do that.
I love him.

710
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:23,886
And I love Danny,
but, honey, let's face it.

711
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,388
Our husbands are lying
and cheating bastards

712
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,051
who deserve to have their balls
Zip-locked and stored in a freezer.

713
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:33,324
You and I don't deserve that,
and neither does your baby.

714
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:37,527
Sweetie, it's not just
about you and Curtis anymore.

715
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:39,730
Mom, I'm hungry!

716
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:41,901
Eat your brother.

717
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,265
Yes!

718
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,768
I got to go fix her something.

719
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,472
Do you want some broccoli?

720
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,140
What do you want?

721
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:14,127
My baby.

722
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,342
Hey, Ryan, what's the matter?

723
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:33,221
I peed.

724
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:37,457
Of course.

725
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,189
Ah, ah!

726
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:41,731
Oh, even after I've given it
to you, I'm giving it to you.

727
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:42,491
Mm.

728
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,124
Here comes the magic sock!
- Oh, please!

729
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:45,759
Here comes the sock.

730
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,337
Here it comes. Oh!

731
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:49,372
Uh, really,
I'm, really, I'm okay.

732
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:51,668
I just got out of a relationship.

733
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:55,644
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
No. I'm sorry. Not you...

734
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,418
That was fast.

735
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,214
Whew. Yeah,
it was good for you, huh?

736
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:07,257
Best two seconds of my life.
Let's go, Delilah!

737
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:11,717
Thank you, girls.

738
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:16,027
Ooh! Whoo!

739
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,033
Two hundred bucks
for that piece of ass.

740
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:19,067
Terrific.

741
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,401
That means it cost $100 a second.

742
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,940
Yeah, just kidding.
I couldn't get it up.

743
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,806
- What? I heard you.
- Faked it.

744
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:31,871
Every time I looked
at her snatch, I saw Sylvie.

745
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,951
Hey, Danny, do you
really think it's possible

746
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:38,784
that somebody's
with Angela right now?

747
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,052
Yeah. I do.

748
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,223
Round 2, buddy.

749
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,696
Whoo!

750
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,016
I'm not leaving.

751
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:18,388
I'm staying right here in my house.

752
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:22,050
You want to leave and go stay
at your man's place, feel free.

753
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,896
I'm sure he'd love to have his
whole family under the same roof.

754
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,915
Mature. Real mature.

755
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:53,455
I'm not leaving.

756
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,252
Great. I'm sure my mom
would really like to talk to you

757
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,792
when she comes over.

758
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:59,055
- Your mom is coming?
- Yeah. In an hour.

759
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:04,961
Hi, Mom!

760
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:08,527
Don't you "hey, Mom" me!
I want kisses!

761
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:10,569
Oh, mm, mm, mm.

762
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:12,141
Oh, my gosh.
It's only been a week.

763
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,676
Oh, my baby, baby girl.

764
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,507
Yeah, a week ago I didn't know
you were giving me a grandchild.

765
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:18,809
Oh, baby, look at that belly.
Oh, my God!

766
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,850
I remember when you were in me!

767
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,919
- Gross!
- It's nature, sweetie.

768
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,716
Ooh! Feels like a boy.
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a boy.

769
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:28,291
It is too soon.
You cannot tell that now.

770
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:31,361
Angela, I know.
Mothers always know.

771
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,056
So, where's Curtis?

772
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,461
Tea.

773
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:39,900
It can't be that bad.

774
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:48,505
Mom, how did you know
when Dad was...?

775
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:50,079
Was what, dear?

776
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,975
Was cheating on you?

777
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:56,913
That son of a bitch.

778
00:47:57,021 --> 00:47:58,989
With the baby coming.
Where is he?

779
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:01,580
He's not here. Just calm down, okay?
Because I want to run this by you.

780
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,353
I just want to make sure
that I'm not crazy.

781
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,951
How did you know?

782
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:08,961
It was little things.

783
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:11,432
All of a sudden he was
working all kinds of hours,

784
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:13,560
he was preoccupied with work.

785
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:17,368
He... Well, you know,
he didn't want to...

786
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:19,207
Sex?

787
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,902
Mmm...

788
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:26,940
I didn't know for sure
until I snuck into his office.

789
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:28,643
Remember that room?
It was always such a mess.

790
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,481
And I looked at the phone bill.

791
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,614
You don't call Suzie Edelstein
14 times in a week

792
00:48:33,724 --> 00:48:36,591
because of her
sparkling conversation.

793
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:38,921
Ugh.

794
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:41,259
God, I hated him
for what he did to you.

795
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:46,932
It's in the past.

796
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:52,507
Honey, do you really think Curtis is?

797
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:56,068
Yeah. I do.

798
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,450
I don't know what I did wrong.

799
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:04,544
I know I work hard,
but I really try to make him happy.

800
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:05,986
I blow him, like,
three times a week.

801
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:10,456
Okay. All right.
Details are not necessary.

802
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:17,965
I think I have to leave him.

803
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:23,571
That's a big decision, honey.
Maybe now is not the time.

804
00:49:23,674 --> 00:49:26,541
Well, I promised myself that I would
never sit home and wonder,

805
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:27,872
and that's what I'm doing.

806
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,175
Well, then, I'll tell you what to do.
Don't leave.

807
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:36,219
Stand your ground and make Curtis
realize what he's throwing away.

808
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,584
By the time you're done with him,
he'll be begging for forgiveness.

809
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:42,352
Did you try that with Dad?

810
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:44,158
No.

811
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:49,663
But Curtis isn't your father,
and you're not me.

812
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,999
Try to keep this family
from breaking up

813
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,830
before it even has a chance to start.

814
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,432
Tough love!

815
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,338
- Tough love?
- Tough love.

816
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:02,377
You're gonna want to fold.

817
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,710
You're gonna want to say
something nice and sweet.

818
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:06,475
Don't.

819
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,413
The second you do,

820
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:11,978
it's a license for her to gobble other
men's cocks for the rest of your life.

821
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:13,384
No matter how long.

822
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:15,855
Even if it takes a year.

823
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:18,723
A year?
Don't talk to him for a whole year?

824
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:20,794
He'll fold long before then, honey.
Trust me.

825
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:22,365
He's not the manly type.

826
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:23,691
Not manly?

827
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,929
Hey, you're a quarter queer.
We all knew that back in law school.

828
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,969
But this is your opportunity
for greatness, pal.

829
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:32,108
This is ridiculous.
I'm getting love advice from a man

830
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:35,269
who just paid $200
to fake-fuck a stripper.

831
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,380
You want to get Angela back or not?

832
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:39,946
Then do not talk to him.

833
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,641
He's the father of my child!

834
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:43,615
I know.

835
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:47,179
That's the only thing that's keeping
me from killing him, sweetie.

836
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:21,023
For this agreement
to be valid and enforceable,

837
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,320
it must be based
on a full mutual disclosure

838
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:27,488
of each party's financial status
to the other party... Uh...

839
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,256
...of the other...

840
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,798
Mr. Jenkins, I am so sorry.

841
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:33,658
See you, guys, in a little while,
okay? I love you.

842
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:36,028
- I love you, too.
- Have fun with your daddy, okay?

843
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,498
Hey! Give me some love!

844
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,796
Daddy!

845
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:40,597
Come here!

846
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:43,099
Aw!

847
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:09,065
All right, ladies.
That's it. Breathe.

848
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,296
Very nice.

849
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:13,801
They're right there.
Right there.

850
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,771
Hi, baby!

851
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:32,680
There we are.

852
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:38,513
Counselor Marks?

853
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:41,885
- It's good to see you.
- Mr. Rohe and, uh...

854
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,321
Oh, she doesn't speak English.

855
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:45,118
She's Russian.

856
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:46,294
Mail-order.

857
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,091
You bring them over
for, like, two grand,

858
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,358
and they fuck
like their life depends on it,

859
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:52,196
because it does.

860
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:57,103
Um, don't you, uh...
Don't you have to marry them?

861
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,797
Oh, no, no.

862
00:54:57,908 --> 00:55:00,433
<i>All you have to do is say
you're gonna marry them.</i>

863
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:03,402
Uh, Mr. Rohe,
I have a very busy day.

864
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,105
- What can I do for you?
- Curtis...

865
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:08,813
What do they say about you?
There's none better.

866
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,547
Well, I need you, buddy.
I need the best.

867
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:15,755
Okay. Uh... I've already
gotten you out of alimony.

868
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:20,262
The fucking money pit.

869
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:23,057
Writing that mortgage check
every month is like a living hell.

870
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:25,793
I want a motorcycle
and penile implants.

871
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,532
I want out of this.

872
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,301
- What about your wife?
- Ex-wife.

873
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,569
- What about your kids?
- Ex-kids.

874
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:36,445
I don't think it works that way,
Mr. Rohe.

875
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:40,340
I see you've been to another lawyer.
A few lawyers.

876
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:43,042
I admit it, I was trying
to find someone cheaper,

877
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:46,452
but those guys all turned me down
on moral grounds.

878
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,487
Can you believe that shit,
moral grounds?

879
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:51,354
That's when I knew if you want
the best, you got to pay for it.

880
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,291
You.

881
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:55,431
So, what do you say?

882
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:58,899
Oops. I "breaked" the "vater. "

883
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:12,143
Now, remember,

884
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,444
don't start the video conference
until I'm sitting.

885
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:18,451
Mm-hmm.
You know, Mary is a woman, too.

886
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:19,487
Kind of.

887
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:24,322
<i>She might actually understand
that you are with parasite.</i>

888
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:26,122
Mm-unh.

889
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:28,390
I'm not losing my job
because Curtis' sperm

890
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:29,692
didn't know what to do
when they hit rubber.

891
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,461
Listen, you just
have to stop treating Mary

892
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:33,661
like she's some kind of supervillain.

893
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,940
You were saying?

894
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:40,703
Hi, Mary!

895
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:41,741
How's Japan treating you?

896
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,540
<i>Okay, well, you can
just drop the pleasantries.</i>

897
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:48,846
<i>Am I crazy, or is it just the camera,
or does it look like you put on a few?</i>

898
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,152
It's, um...

899
00:56:54,157 --> 00:56:55,249
It's glandular?

900
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:57,518
<i>All right.
Let's just take a look.</i>

901
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,587
You didn't get the graphs
that I e-mailed you?

902
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:09,599
<i>Raphy! Raphy! Uh...</i>

903
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:14,299
Hmm.

904
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:18,336
These rolly chairs are so fun.
I love them.

905
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:23,684
Because my back is really...

906
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,319
Doo-dee-doo-doo!

907
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:30,358
<i>Angela...</i>

908
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:31,386
Yes.

909
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:33,356
<i>I think I know what's going on.</i>

910
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:35,722
You do?

911
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:39,358
<i>Yes. I think I do, and it is okay.</i>

912
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:40,601
It is?

913
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:42,133
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

914
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,175
<i>Believe it or not,
I used to do a lot of drugs.</i>

915
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:52,144
<i>There was a night back in '89
where I did so much PCP,</i>

916
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:55,685
<i>I could have choked an antelope.
But I got over it.</i>

917
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:59,347
<i>I overcame it, and so can you.</i>

918
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:00,682
You think I'm on drugs?

919
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:02,348
<i>Nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

920
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:08,557
<i>The first step is to stand up
and admit that you have a problem.</i>

921
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:12,065
Mary, I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I'm not on drugs.

922
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:13,193
I'm...

923
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:16,265
I'm pregnant.

924
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:19,534
Unh-unh, Vice-President.

925
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:25,909
Why don't you just tell your boss
you're pregnant?

926
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:27,984
- Because she'll fire me.
- Let her!

927
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,279
Then Curtis can sue them
for discrimination.

928
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:34,380
He might be an asshole,
but he is an excellent lawyer.

929
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:36,322
How do I look?

930
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:43,861
Do you want the real answer
or the girlfriend answer?

931
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:47,733
Um... Girlfriend first
and then real.

932
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:49,271
You look beautiful.

933
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:53,365
You can't, can't even tell
you're pregnant. You can't tell.

934
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:55,372
Okay. Now real.

935
00:58:55,478 --> 00:58:57,912
You look like a fat candy cane.

936
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:59,641
Shit.

937
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:02,744
Oh!

938
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:07,154
I give up.

939
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:09,383
Nothing fits.

940
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:14,858
Jesus!
Your head is enormous.

941
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,933
You know, I can't hide it
from my boss anymore.

942
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,398
She's gonna know.

943
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:20,128
- Ow!
- Hold on to the bench!

944
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,000
You're pulling my hair.
You're pulling my hair!

945
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:24,232
Ugh!

946
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:26,569
What does Curtis say?

947
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:28,911
He hasn't said a word to me.

948
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:32,113
And he probably never will.

949
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,546
Fucking hormones, I tell ya.

950
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:35,810
Is everything all right?

951
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:39,183
Yeah. She's pregnant,
and her husband is cheating on her.

952
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:46,289
You know what?

953
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:51,527
I think you need to step it up.

954
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:04,945
Oh, Curtis!

955
01:00:06,149 --> 01:00:07,275
Can I ask you a question?

956
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:09,352
Yes, I do believe
that two filet mignons

957
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:11,943
and three scoops of mint chocolate
chip is too much for breakfast.

958
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:13,822
Are you through
with the food jokes?

959
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:14,786
No.

960
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:18,451
Okay. Now I'm through.

961
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:24,559
Do you think that I look fat
in this dress?

962
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,064
I think you look terrific, Angela.

963
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:31,106
Better than ever.

964
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,536
You actually look
like you're getting ready for a...

965
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,315
A date!

966
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:42,885
Oh.

967
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:45,648
I got to go.

968
01:00:46,022 --> 01:00:47,922
I have...
I have people that I can call.

969
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:49,958
I have... I have friends, too.

970
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:00,802
Doctor Bob?

971
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:02,394
Oh, come on!

972
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:09,410
Okay. Fine.

973
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,918
Are you sure you're all right
with me drinking wine?

974
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:17,452
Oh, I don't mind.

975
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:18,543
You'd be surprised.

976
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:21,021
It's a common fight
husbands and wives have.

977
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:22,091
Over wine?

978
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:23,323
Mm-hmm.

979
01:01:23,426 --> 01:01:25,417
Well, the husband keeps drinking it.
The wife can't.

980
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,497
She takes it as a sign
he won't be changing his life.

981
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:31,062
Sparks ensue.

982
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:32,734
Well, that's dumb.

983
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,830
Yeah.

984
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:38,931
And I could never see you getting
involved in a dumb tug of war.

985
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:46,411
Angela, I'm here for you.
But this has gotten out of hand.

986
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:51,813
You love each other.
Just stop with the games.

987
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,887
You're right. I just...
I don't know how we got here.

988
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:02,897
Tomorrow I'm gonna sit down, and
I'm gonna talk to him like an adult.

989
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:05,859
What?

990
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:07,766
Oh, hell!

991
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,931
Oh, bastard!

992
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:17,143
- Who are those people?
- It's my wife and her lover.

993
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:19,414
He's trying to make me jealous.

994
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,718
- She's fat!
- She's pregnant!

995
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:25,010
Isn't that what we're doing?

996
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:27,555
We are now!

997
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:34,124
You're so funny!

998
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:38,260
On three, laugh.
One, two, three.

999
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:43,171
Come here.

1000
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,180
Well, it took you long enough.

1001
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:53,474
I'll tell you a secret.

1002
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,346
I thought you might
make a move tonight,

1003
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:59,184
so I shaved it into a "C,"
just in case.

1004
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,889
For "Curtis. "

1005
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,822
Okay, why don't we stop talking?

1006
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,035
Come on, Angie.

1007
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:21,473
Hey! Hey!

1008
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:23,673
Stop her!

1009
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,179
Yeah. Come on.

1010
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:25,713
Hey!

1011
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:27,077
Hey!

1012
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,676
Right here. Right here.

1013
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:30,409
Oh, yeah.

1014
01:03:35,058 --> 01:03:36,184
Just what's going on here?

1015
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:38,988
If you don't like it, Dr. Bob,
why don't you and Angela leave?

1016
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:39,493
Morris?!

1017
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:40,362
Morris?

1018
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,495
My husband!

1019
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:47,467
- That's my bitch, bitch!
- Is this guy serious?

1020
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:48,662
As a heart attack!

1021
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:50,037
Oh!

1022
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,704
Curtis!

1023
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,677
Morris!

1024
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:01,676
Oh, sweetie, honey, baby pie!

1025
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,078
Thanks, Morris!

1026
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:05,415
Ah!

1027
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:14,926
That's gonna hurt more tomorrow.

1028
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:18,462
That's good to know.

1029
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:20,502
You can have the bed if you want,
and I can just go to...

1030
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:23,800
Dr. Bob's?
Go ahead. Be my guest.

1031
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:26,935
Curtis.

1032
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:31,274
How long have you been seeing her?

1033
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,575
Again?

1034
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,515
You keep turning this around on me.

1035
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:37,452
Don't I get a coma reprieve?

1036
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:42,321
Why don't you just go see your
doctor friend and leave me alone?

1037
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:52,759
Okay. You win.
I can't do this anymore.

1038
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,778
Did you step it up?

1039
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:08,851
Is he eating out
of the palm of your hand?

1040
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:15,187
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

1041
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:17,916
Come on.
Let's go inside.

1042
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:42,076
Raphy! Raphy, Raphy!
Oh, where is she?

1043
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:43,583
Uh, who? Angela?

1044
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,678
Oh, I don't know.
She's not in her office?

1045
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:48,222
I thought she was in her office,
because if she's not,

1046
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,655
then I don't really know, Mary.

1047
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:52,555
Oh, there she is!

1048
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:55,130
Angela, I really, I really, really
need you to listen to me.

1049
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:56,596
The Japanese love us.

1050
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:59,894
The head of Nakashima Distribution
is going to be here in a few hours.

1051
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:02,697
And I want you to present it to him
and his team.

1052
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:04,739
I thought you already did that.

1053
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,865
Angela, I'm thinking
maybe you should take

1054
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:09,706
a little less time
at the refrigerator

1055
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,677
and start focusing on your work.

1056
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,612
Where's my coffee?

1057
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:14,750
That's his secondary team.

1058
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:19,117
Mr. Nakashima never goes
to the initial first-pitch meeting.

1059
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:22,623
Oh, no. He just flies halfway
around the world to do that.

1060
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:28,263
He's on his way to Hawaii
for the re-enactment of Pearl Harbor,

1061
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:32,231
and he is blessing us
with a few hours of his precious time.

1062
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:35,699
Now, have you taken care
of your glandular problem?

1063
01:06:36,072 --> 01:06:37,403
'Cause I've got to tell you something,

1064
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:40,474
the Japanese, they're not
too wowed by fat women.

1065
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:44,412
Uh, don't worry. I'll lose 20 pounds
by the time they get here.

1066
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,878
Today, 4:00...

1067
01:06:46,983 --> 01:06:48,974
...wow time.

1068
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:55,447
Well, that was some fancy footwork
for a fat woman.

1069
01:06:55,558 --> 01:06:56,820
What?

1070
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,694
Hello, asshole.

1071
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:08,270
Is Asshole Number Two here?

1072
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:09,969
He's in his room.

1073
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:13,142
What are you?
The gatekeeper now for his fat ass?

1074
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:14,573
How's Angela doing?

1075
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,473
She's just fine.

1076
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,144
Good.

1077
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,449
You look like shit.

1078
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:23,145
I feel worse.

1079
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,310
Well, that's a start.

1080
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:27,852
Curtis, why did you
have to go and fuck up

1081
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:30,016
the best thing in your life?

1082
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:36,626
I didn't know I did
until after I did it.

1083
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:39,331
Guess nothing I did
was good enough.

1084
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:40,594
Oh, what you did
was good enough.

1085
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:43,171
It worked. She's gone.
What did you expect?

1086
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:45,797
You just cannot take responsibility,
either of you.

1087
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:49,342
You're just boys.
You're both just boys!

1088
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:51,709
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

1089
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:55,713
What does that mean?

1090
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:27,882
What the fuck is that?

1091
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:31,117
Nothing. You scared me.

1092
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:34,019
Oh, you're making it official now.

1093
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:38,457
It's been months. We either
have to shit or get off the pot.

1094
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:48,762
You look good.

1095
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:51,167
Stop fucking around.

1096
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:54,004
I'm not fucking around.
You look good.

1097
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,839
I didn't lose a single pound.

1098
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:59,979
Well, you look pretty.

1099
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,780
Where's Curtis?

1100
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:09,449
He said something about
"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. "

1101
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,193
He said that?

1102
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:15,264
Yeah. Something like that.

1103
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,331
What's wrong?

1104
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:21,568
Hey! Voicemail.

1105
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,238
- Where are we going?
- Come with me.

1106
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,566
- Where are we going?
- Follow me!

1107
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:25,766
Where are you taking me?

1108
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,399
- Just look.
- Where are we going?

1109
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,239
In a whorehouse.

1110
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:38,478
Okay, let's get started.

1111
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:40,912
Mr. Nakashima and company,

1112
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:44,721
on behalf of my staff and colleagues,

1113
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:50,356
we are more than happy to welcome
you to Chateau Cosmetics.

1114
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:57,601
Ahh! Ahh!

1115
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:58,696
You okay?

1116
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,174
Is it the...?

1117
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:04,804
Oh! Jesus! Okay, uh,
we have to get you to a hospital.

1118
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,575
Now, Mr. Nakashima, I'm sure
your team has informed you

1119
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:11,084
we've been working
on something very special.

1120
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,281
Raphy, in the last nine months,

1121
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:21,091
I've lost my husband,
my dignity, and my life.

1122
01:10:21,264 --> 01:10:23,960
I'm not losing this project.

1123
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:27,125
Extremely special
that is going to take this company

1124
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:28,328
to new heights.

1125
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:30,062
Angela!

1126
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,707
I can do it.

1127
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:36,335
to introduce you
to the woman that's going to...

1128
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:38,380
...Angela Marks.

1129
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:51,993
Don't forget, this is your baby.

1130
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:59,028
First of all, I would like
to welcome you to America.

1131
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:02,602
And secondly, I would like
to thank my boss, Mary Radcliff,

1132
01:11:02,772 --> 01:11:06,401
and my valued colleague, Raphy,
for bringing this project to fruition.

1133
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:21,121
Excuse me.

1134
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:25,387
I would like to introduce you
to a revolutionary new concept

1135
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:27,586
in women's fragrances:

1136
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:29,131
Baby on Board.

1137
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,912
Wow!

1138
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:49,380
A real Korean hand-job joint.

1139
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:52,579
You really know
how to make a girl feel special.

1140
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:53,882
Oh, Mister Danny!

1141
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,685
- Oh, is so good to see you again!
- Ay.

1142
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,760
Why I not see you in so long?
It's been months, Mr. Danny.

1143
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,329
Oh, you have pee-pee disease, mm?

1144
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,625
- Oh, you need more Niagara, huh?
- I'll be right back.

1145
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,201
Mr. Danny, you don't go...
You're not supposed to go back there!

1146
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:12,534
I know exactly how you feel.

1147
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,036
Oh, oh, oh.

1148
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:23,409
Ah, ah, ah.

1149
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,689
- Huh?
- Sorry.

1150
01:12:32,428 --> 01:12:35,488
Ah, I think I'm in love.

1151
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:38,893
Hey, Maureen!
I'm just looking for my, uh...

1152
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:40,534
Dude.

1153
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,466
Sorry.

1154
01:12:42,938 --> 01:12:44,803
Easy.

1155
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,476
- Candy?
- Danny?

1156
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,244
Curtis?!

1157
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:54,609
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't roll over.

1158
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:56,651
Don't roll over, whatever you do.

1159
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,084
If you roll over right now,
Candy is going to jerk you off,

1160
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,383
and that's gonna be the biggest
mistake you could ever make.

1161
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,218
Curtis, I know I talked a mean game.
Hell, I played a mean game.

1162
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,693
Half the stains on this ceiling
have come from me.

1163
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:11,492
A hand-job's just like jerking off.
It's all the same in the end.

1164
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,432
Truthfully, I give myself
a hell of a great hand-job.

1165
01:13:15,204 --> 01:13:16,728
But, look, forget about that.

1166
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:20,398
I know I said the only honest
relationship a man can have

1167
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:22,534
is with somebody
he's paying, all right?

1168
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,135
But that's not true.
It's bullshit.

1169
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:27,043
Man, your wife's a real pain
in the ass. They all are.

1170
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,843
But, fuck, dude, she knows you
better than anyone,

1171
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:31,044
and she still puts up with you.

1172
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:33,644
And that, that's the most
beautiful thing

1173
01:13:33,756 --> 01:13:34,848
you're ever gonna have in your life.

1174
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,153
And I know
you want to blow that load,

1175
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:39,989
but I'm talking to you
as a friend and a man.

1176
01:13:40,096 --> 01:13:43,088
Don't blow that load!

1177
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,227
My God. You are so right.

1178
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,371
Thank you, mysterious stranger.

1179
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:28,702
Okay, thank you.
All right. Thank you.

1180
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,435
That was beautiful, man.

1181
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:33,981
Just thank you.

1182
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:37,177
Beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful.

1183
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:57,805
Did you mean all that?

1184
01:14:57,907 --> 01:14:59,602
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

1185
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,107
It didn't help Curt.

1186
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,734
Danny.

1187
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,679
Curt?

1188
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:09,149
Danny. That was a real
touching speech, man.

1189
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:10,283
Am I too late?

1190
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,377
No, no. I chickened out.

1191
01:15:12,488 --> 01:15:14,251
I've been hiding out
in the bathroom the last 40 minutes.

1192
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:16,324
Thank God you're a quarter queer.

1193
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,555
- I'm such an idiot.
- Yes, you are.

1194
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:22,324
I really screwed things up.

1195
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:24,126
Me too.

1196
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:27,132
I need to fix this.

1197
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:29,167
You bet your ass
you need to fix this.

1198
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:32,339
I need to fix everything.

1199
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,841
I'm sorry.

1200
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:40,775
Hey, sorry.
Can you give me a ride?

1201
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:45,444
As you can see, the 4th Quarter
projections for the U.S. alone

1202
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:48,648
are 14% higher
than Chanel's latest line.

1203
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:53,994
As we move
into publicity and advertising...

1204
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:24,250
And now, as we move
into publicity and advertising...

1205
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,698
Go get her!

1206
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:31,458
Angela!

1207
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:33,659
Curtis, she locked me
out of my own house!

1208
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,804
I want my magazines,
and I want my swordfish,

1209
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:38,897
<i>and I want you out of here now!</i>

1210
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,972
Oh, this is good.
She's gonna call her lawyer now.

1211
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:42,475
Listen, just talk to her

1212
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,843
and say some of that fancy lawyer
jargon that I pay you so much for

1213
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:47,074
and make her leave, will you?

1214
01:16:47,182 --> 01:16:49,616
Bill, put her on the phone.

1215
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:53,814
<i>Oh, my lawyer
wants to talk to you now.</i>

1216
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:57,086
<i>Oh, really?
'Cause I'd love to talk to him, too.</i>

1217
01:16:57,192 --> 01:16:59,422
Here you are.

1218
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,464
The house?!
He wants the house now?

1219
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:05,859
<i>- How do you sleep at night?
- Ms. Black, please.</i>

1220
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:07,830
This is a crock of shit!

1221
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,598
Agh!

1222
01:17:10,472 --> 01:17:13,839
The law protects assholes like him
instead of punishing him.

1223
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:16,273
- Ms. Black, you are right.
- What?

1224
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:19,107
Tell your lawyer if he's looking
for any frivolous expenses

1225
01:17:19,214 --> 01:17:20,806
<i>to look into
your ex-husband's accounts</i>

1226
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,315
<i>for any monies
that may have been transferred</i>

1227
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:24,386
<i>into banks based in Russia.</i>

1228
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:26,919
He cannot touch the house.

1229
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:30,754
Why are you telling me this?

1230
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,860
Today is your lucky day.

1231
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:42,631
Damn, Counselor, you are fast.

1232
01:17:42,805 --> 01:17:44,204
My brother, what's up?

1233
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:48,503
- What the hell?
- Here you are.

1234
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:54,180
Wait.

1235
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:57,080
Wait a minute.

1236
01:17:57,252 --> 01:18:00,585
Oh, Curtis.
You, you slimy bastard!

1237
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:04,250
I am gonna hit you
with a lawsuit so huge!

1238
01:18:04,426 --> 01:18:05,415
You want to try?
Come and get me.

1239
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,961
You'll be spending the rest of your
miserable life in a courthouse

1240
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:11,260
<i>balancing requests for
interrogatories, unnecessary motions.</i>

1241
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:14,402
I will depose every person
you've ever been in contact with

1242
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:15,993
since the beginning of time!

1243
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:25,408
Wow! You've got a great lawyer.

1244
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:27,538
There's none better.

1245
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:38,288
Medical Emergency!
Doctor coming through!

1246
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:41,186
Let's go.

1247
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:47,861
And, uh... And, uh...

1248
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:49,935
Just keep it together.

1249
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:54,665
Uh, let me open up
the floor to questions.

1250
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:57,206
Angela! Angela!

1251
01:18:57,312 --> 01:18:58,643
- Yah!
- Oh! Oh!

1252
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:00,375
Curtis!

1253
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,016
Angela, take me back.

1254
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:06,381
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1255
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:09,581
I was a moron.
I was a... I was a stupid moron.

1256
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:11,055
I don't care.

1257
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:12,693
I don't care if that baby isn't mine.

1258
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,022
I don't care if you had relations
with your doctor.

1259
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:16,626
I don't care about any of that.

1260
01:19:16,799 --> 01:19:18,892
I only care about you.

1261
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:20,829
Oh! Oh!

1262
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:22,937
Is that a good scream
or a bad scream?

1263
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:24,934
What are you trying to say?

1264
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,002
I'm having a baby!

1265
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,869
You're pregnant?

1266
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,306
Of course she's pregnant!

1267
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:31,844
You're pregnant?!

1268
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:33,014
Oh!

1269
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:34,347
Come on. Come on.

1270
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:39,720
She told me
it was a glandular thing.

1271
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:40,919
Angela.

1272
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:41,918
You!

1273
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,146
She's mine, Dr. Bob.

1274
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:44,656
If you want her, you're gonna
have to go through me!

1275
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,920
<i>This is like Days of our Lives!</i>

1276
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:49,224
Curtis, I know
this has gotten out of hand.

1277
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:50,296
No. I was stupid to ever let her go.

1278
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:51,058
You can't have her!

1279
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,098
I don't want her!

1280
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:53,029
What?

1281
01:19:53,202 --> 01:19:54,328
She's always been yours.

1282
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:56,129
Well, then, what are you doing here?

1283
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:58,433
Hey, hey! I called him. I'm sorry.

1284
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,007
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

1285
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,277
I know. I think
I'm out of my league, too.

1286
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:07,176
So, you two are a couple?
That... I'm okay with that.

1287
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:08,977
Oh, let's go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1288
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:11,279
Baby, baby, baby.
- Let's go. Here we go.

1289
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:15,379
Fuckin' douchebag doctor...
Oh, hey!

1290
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:16,287
Is it time?

1291
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:18,282
Can't leave! Have to finish!

1292
01:20:19,394 --> 01:20:21,828
- We need to get you out of here.
- Angela, listen to the doctor!

1293
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:24,223
Angela!

1294
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,796
Take that back.

1295
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:34,074
Ooh.

1296
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:34,971
Excuse me?

1297
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:39,344
I said, "Take that back. "

1298
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:44,645
That woman has been talking to you
for 30 minutes while she is in labor.

1299
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:48,312
You want to talk about tough?
It doesn't get tougher than that.

1300
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:49,718
I don't care about your money.

1301
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,519
I don't care
about your Y chromosome.

1302
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,021
I don't care about your snarky jokes.

1303
01:20:56,698 --> 01:20:58,791
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

1304
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:09,870
Okay, just breathe.
All right. This way, this way.

1305
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:11,672
Ah, your jacket.

1306
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,745
What? What?

1307
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:19,280
The whore with the lipstick!

1308
01:21:19,454 --> 01:21:21,149
Hold her!

1309
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:22,915
What? What?

1310
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:28,485
The business card!

1311
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,663
Oh, her! Her!

1312
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,233
Oh, no, no, no.
She wasn't a whore.

1313
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:34,268
She was a relaxation therapist.

1314
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:35,028
That's right.

1315
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:38,937
You slept with her!

1316
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,701
No, no, no. I didn't sleep with her.
Danny slept with her. It was Danny.

1317
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,244
- You bastard!
- No, no, no, no.

1318
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:48,305
It was a fuckin' hand-job, and it
was after you kicked my ass out!

1319
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:52,084
Oh, I love you, baby!

1320
01:21:52,588 --> 01:21:54,818
Oh, Curtis!

1321
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:55,979
Here we go.

1322
01:21:56,091 --> 01:21:57,786
Okay.

1323
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:01,088
I'll drive.

1324
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:25,486
I hate you!
You did this to me!

1325
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:27,020
I'll grab a wheelchair.
You got her?

1326
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:28,589
Yeah. We're all good.

1327
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:31,384
Just hurry, Doctor! Hurry!

1328
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:32,892
Do your breathing. That's it.

1329
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:34,690
Who was that bitch
at the restaurant?!

1330
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:37,026
What bitch at the restaurant?

1331
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:38,793
Ah!

1332
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:41,766
What'd I miss?

1333
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,933
The bitch that you kissed
at the restaurant!

1334
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,234
Wow, good timing for me.

1335
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,366
She's a client.
Mrs. Jenkins.

1336
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:49,532
She's married?

1337
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:50,976
Ow!

1338
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:53,774
Ow! Ow!
Fuck me in the ass!

1339
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,477
Tourette's.

1340
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:58,018
She's getting a divorce.

1341
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,644
She kissed me when I told her

1342
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:00,983
of a way she could
get out of her pre-nup

1343
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:02,386
and screw her husband
out of millions!

1344
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:04,982
We have to split up now.

1345
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:07,391
Can I go with her?

1346
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:09,293
Curtis, a nurse will come
and get you in a minute.

1347
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:11,525
Just let me get her hooked up first.

1348
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:13,291
Are you sure
that it didn't mean anything?

1349
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,435
It meant nothing.

1350
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:18,028
It meant as much to me as your kiss
with gay Doctor Bob meant to you.

1351
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:19,400
Thanks a lot.

1352
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:20,700
Really?

1353
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:22,536
Really.

1354
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:24,809
Okay.

1355
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:29,114
I can have this baby now.

1356
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:30,880
I'll be right in.

1357
01:23:53,942 --> 01:23:59,244
You know, I knew
you wouldn't hurt my little girl.

1358
01:23:59,348 --> 01:24:01,543
Thank you, Mom.

1359
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:03,083
But just for the record,

1360
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:05,619
if you did...

1361
01:24:05,721 --> 01:24:09,213
Jesus Almighty himself couldn't
protect you or your genitalia from me.

1362
01:24:09,324 --> 01:24:11,019
<i>And finally,
here in the States,</i>

1363
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:16,120
<i>the Viking Pharmaceutical Company,

1370
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:36,812
Talk about a class-action suit.

1371
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:40,284
Super Vikings?

1372
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:44,188
Mr. Marks?

1373
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:56,064
Good, Angie!
Presenting beautifully.

1374
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:59,197
I'm right here, Angela.
I'm right here. How we doing, Doc?

1375
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:00,705
She is doing fine.

1376
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,277
Okay, push, Angela.
Push. Push.

1377
01:25:03,378 --> 01:25:05,903
Just remember your breathing.

1378
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:09,047
How do you know what to do?

1379
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,878
I went to all your Lamaze classes.

1380
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:11,984
I wouldn't have
missed them for the world.

1381
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:13,076
Now, push, Angela.

1382
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:13,777
Push.

1383
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,850
Here he comes.

1384
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:17,684
He...?

1385
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:20,955
Push, Angela.

1386
01:25:21,062 --> 01:25:22,154
Here he comes!

1387
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:29,035
Hey.

1388
01:25:29,137 --> 01:25:30,866
Welcome
to the world, little one.

1389
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:33,569
He's perfect!

1390
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:42,915
Nice going, Mom.

1391
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:49,420
Here we go. Here we go.

1392
01:25:57,933 --> 01:25:59,366
Hey, baby.

1393
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:01,527
I'm your daddy.

1394
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:13,647
Oh, baby. Hi.
Nice to meet you.

1395
01:26:16,084 --> 01:26:18,552
You're so beautiful.

1396
01:26:19,921 --> 01:26:20,819
Hi!

1397
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:22,548
I hope I'm late.

1398
01:26:23,758 --> 01:26:25,316
Oh, what is it?

1399
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,822
It's a boy.

1400
01:26:26,995 --> 01:26:29,293
Hello, little Mr. Marks.

1401
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:32,867
Hey, wait till you
get to know your parents.

1402
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:35,266
You're gonna love 'em.

1403
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:36,632
Nice work, Bobby.

1404
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:37,635
Thanks.

1405
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,634
Where's my grandson?

1406
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:42,939
Let me see him.

1407
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:45,207
Oh! Hi, sweetie!

1408
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:46,439
Hi.

1409
01:26:46,548 --> 01:26:48,482
Hello!

1410
01:26:48,984 --> 01:26:53,080
He's so handsome.
Oh, look at you!

1411
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:54,821
Look at you!

1412
01:26:57,058 --> 01:27:00,255
Oh, my God!

1413
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:01,795
Hello!

1414
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:04,358
Oh, hello, sweet baby.

1415
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:09,863
Oh, I forgot how cute they are
when they first come out.

1416
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,507
Curtis, he has your ears.

1417
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,378
Mary, those are beautiful flowers.

1418
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,551
Please. I expensed it
to Mr. Nakashima's account.

1419
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:28,687
Well, um...

1420
01:27:28,857 --> 01:27:30,757
...I'm gonna go.

1421
01:27:30,859 --> 01:27:32,417
Hospitals aren't really my thing,

1422
01:27:32,594 --> 01:27:36,530
but, um, I did want to say,
take as much time as you need.

1423
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:38,859
Your job will be waiting for you
when you're ready.

1424
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:40,228
Are you sure?

1425
01:27:40,402 --> 01:27:43,894
Never ask a woman if she's
sure about her vice-president.

1426
01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:46,336
Oh, my God.

1427
01:27:48,276 --> 01:27:49,573
Thank you, Mary.

1428
01:27:56,484 --> 01:27:57,473
Wow.

1429
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:01,152
Okay, everyone.

1430
01:28:01,256 --> 01:28:04,020
What say we give the family
a moment alone?

1431
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,990
Love you.

1432
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:09,196
Hey!

1433
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:13,034
Bye, sweetie.

1434
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:15,364
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1435
01:28:19,808 --> 01:28:22,777
Just the immediate family
for right now...

1436
01:28:22,877 --> 01:28:24,868
I am immediate.
I'm the grandma.

1437
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,307
And what
a lucky little boy he is.

1438
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:30,313
You can come back in a little while.

1439
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:40,621
Ta-dah!

1440
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:46,790
There are gonna be pregnant women
all over the world craving your scent.

1441
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:49,897
Thank you for everything.

1442
01:28:50,005 --> 01:28:51,666
Mm-hmm.

1443
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:08,618
- He's so perfect.
- There's none better.

1444
01:29:17,932 --> 01:29:19,559
Hi.

1445
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:24,465
He's tired.

1446
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:26,506
It's been a long nine months.

1447
01:29:26,608 --> 01:29:29,076
I know how he feels.

1448
01:29:31,212 --> 01:29:32,873
I love you.

1449
01:29:32,981 --> 01:29:35,279
I love you, too.

1450
01:29:44,526 --> 01:29:45,652
Was that you?

1451
01:29:45,827 --> 01:29:47,658
I thought that was you.

1452
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,826
What have
you been eating, baby?

1453
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,058
Aw...

1454
01:29:55,036 --> 01:29:59,234
He's got your intestinal tract.

1455
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,132
Oh, my God.

1456
01:30:28,236 --> 01:30:31,569
Come on!

1457
01:30:31,673 --> 01:30:34,267
All right, time!

1458
01:30:48,723 --> 01:30:49,212
Oh, that's low!

1459
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:50,882
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

1460
01:31:00,068 --> 01:31:02,866
Look at that. Look at that.

1461
01:31:03,171 --> 01:31:04,069
Oh, look at that.

1462
01:31:04,172 --> 01:31:06,163
Oh, look at that!

1463
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:11,310
You get that butt up in the air,
get those ass cheeks flapping,

1464
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:13,573
your balls will be ricocheting
back and forth

1465
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:16,844
like Hector "Macho" Camacho
fucking in his speed bag...

1466
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:19,681
da-da-duh, da-da-duh,
da-da-duh, da-da-duh, aah!

1467
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:22,222
I really need you
to listen to me now.

1468
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:24,518
The Japanese love us.

1469
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:27,595
The head of whatever the fuck it is,

1470
01:31:27,695 --> 01:31:28,889
what is it?

1471
01:31:28,997 --> 01:31:31,158
The head
of "Nakshma" Distribution...

1472
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:34,495
Go fuck yourselves.

1473
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:38,231
Are you taking care of your
glandular prob... can't say that word.

1474
01:31:38,706 --> 01:31:41,334
Your "glandurer,"
your "glandurer" problem.

1475
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:46,804
Are you taking care
of that little "glandurer" problem?

1476
01:31:49,984 --> 01:31:53,420
How's that "glandurer" problem going?
You taking care of that?

1477
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:58,322
'Cause I got to tell you, the Japanese
aren't real wowed by fat men.

1478
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:02,391
Take a bite again.
Yeah, you could do it.

1479
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:04,692
Yeah. Look at me, now.

1480
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:07,058
Dive in. Aargh!

1481
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,463
You're gonna be here one day.

1482
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,714
Did you ever do that?

1483
01:32:26,821 --> 01:32:28,516
No. It was just...

1484
01:32:28,623 --> 01:32:29,521
This is over!

1485
01:32:29,624 --> 01:32:32,115
<i>You don't have to lick my ass.
Just give me more per diem.</i>

1486
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,399
It's better
when they don't talk.

1487
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:44,404
This is Curtis, girls.

1488
01:32:44,505 --> 01:32:46,439
I'm paying you per hip thrust,
so shake a leg.

1489
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:47,701
You know what? I'm so sorry.
I dropped my money.

1490
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:48,741
Oh, you did?

1491
01:32:48,843 --> 01:32:50,105
You have a great vagina.

1492
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:54,375
I think any man would be lucky
to be in your vagina.

1493
01:32:54,482 --> 01:32:56,177
But my boobs. They're just...

1494
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:04,482
You need wow by June?

1495
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,194
Hello.

1496
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:08,284
Hello?

1497
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:11,022
Mmm.

1498
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:14,101
Oh, look at that pussy.

1499
01:33:14,202 --> 01:33:17,228
And cut! Come on!

1500
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:17,929
That was directing.

1501
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:20,337
Don't be a putz.

1502
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,216
First of all,
I'd like to welcome you to Japan.

1503
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:32,548
I mean, to America.
I'm sorry.

1504
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:34,849
On behalf
of my staff and colleagues,

1505
01:33:34,956 --> 01:33:37,186
I would more...

1506
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:39,487
See, now, she put the jinx on it.
Hold on.

1507
01:33:39,594 --> 01:33:41,789
I need to fix everything.

1508
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:47,690
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

1509
01:33:47,802 --> 01:33:49,770
Guys, can I get a ride?

1510
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:51,168
No.

1511
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,065
Oh!

1512
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,642
You broke the first rule of improv!

1513
01:33:55,743 --> 01:33:57,438
You really think it's possible
that Angela has somebody

1514
01:33:57,545 --> 01:33:58,477
over there right now?

1515
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:00,547
Yeah. I would if I was her.

1516
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:02,309
After I spent an hour
twisting my tits.

1517
01:34:11,392 --> 01:34:12,290
Cut!

1518
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:15,128
Took classes on the...
What are you doing, Mrs. Jenkins?!

1519
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:16,924
Oh, you like that?
Like that? Want a bite?

1520
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:17,963
No!

1521
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:21,534
What are you...?
Stop it, Mrs. Jenkins!
