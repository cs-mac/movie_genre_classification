5
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,011

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,735

14
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,415

15
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,976

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,614

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,300
- Who is she?
- Get into the kitchen!

22
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,379
- Adulterer!
- You're a monster!

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,175
Swine! Who is she?

24
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,537
Anna! I have told you never
to bother me here at work!

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,696
Who is she?

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,335
We have been through all that.
Get into the kitchen!

27
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,615
- Why didn't you come home?
- Leave me alone, I'm trying to work.

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,096
- Is she prettier than me?
- Is she prettier than you?

29
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,292
- I am prettier than you!
- Oh! No!

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,936
- Lipstick on your shirt!
- Well, nobody's perfect.

31
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,609
- I know she's not the first!
-

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,971
I hate you!

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,375
I hate you!

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,055
I've hated you from the moment
I first married you.

35
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,253
- You're a grotesque!
- Lascivious adulterer!

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,453
Don't you dare call me that again
until I have looked it up!

37
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,048
Adulterer! Adulterer!

38
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,136
Lascivious adulterer!

39
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,093
Silence when you're shouting at me!

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,290
Lascivious adulterer. Lasciv...

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,538
"Lascivious adulterer is a man
that is a lascivious adulterer."

42
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,450
What kind of book is that? You are
a monster and a monster, in that order.

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,209
Fritz plays around with the floozies!

44
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,696
Swine! Get out of my office!

45
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,094
I'll break every bone in your ox's body.

46
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,370
Vermin!

47
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,139
Do you realise I could slay you
any moment I like?

48
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,651
- Pig!
- Using the great Burt's judo method.

49
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,736
Argh... Agh.

50
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,858
- Ooh!
- Argh!

51
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,249
Get out of here.
We'll finish this later.

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,578
Don't be a bit surprised if I take
the children and leave for good.

53
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,655
That great, rotten, stinking hulk of...

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,816
Rotten, rotten, rotten pig!

55
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,171
Fat, great, stinking rotten... I hate you!

56
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,815
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,974
Good afternoon. Am I late?

58
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,296
No, as a matter of fact
you are just on time.

59
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,539
Come, come. Make yourself
nice and comfortable. We will begin.

60
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,048
Women have always been
a big problem to me, Dr Fassbender.

61
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,090
- Are you listening, Doctor?
- Yes, yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.

62
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,738
The first woman I had a crush on
was my schoolteacher.

63
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,138
- Miss Marks.
- That's a perfectly normal occurrence.

64
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,335
Did you read the essay I wrote
on my summer holidays?

65
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,739
Yes, I did. I thought it was
the most moving piece I'd ever read.

66
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,536
I hope you noticed
I dedicated it to you, Miss Marks.

67
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,730
Call me Tandalaya.

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,928
Oh, Michael, this can't work.
I'm 34 and you're 12.

69
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,051
Don't be negative.

70
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,855
Oh, Michael.
Michael, what's to become of us?

71
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,733
And what did become?

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,648
She lost her licence and I failed English.

73
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,409
Can I tell you what
I once did in a Latvian brothel?

74
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,735
- Later.
- Oh.

75
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,935
My second experience with a woman
was no picnic either. It was at high school.

76
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,133
What did I do? What did I do? What
did I do? Someone tell me what I did.

77
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,490
What did I do? Tell me what I did.

78
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,499
Jenny! Will you tell me what I did?
Will you tell me, please, what I did?

79
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,817
What am I supposed to have done?
What have I done?

80
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,411
It's no use looking like the Day
of Judgment unless you tell me. Tell me!

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,213
- And did you do it?
- I was untutored in these matters.

82
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,128
And women have always
overcome my basic shyness.

83
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,730
But you had a perfectly normal
sexual life at college?

84
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,454
Normal? It was frightening.

85
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,333
I was captain of the debating team,
do you see?

86
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,692
I was competing for the interscholastic
championship by debating a Miss Pringle

87
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,256
on the effects of socialised medicine
on the British economy.

88
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,338
- And what happened?
- I convinced her.

89
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,177
Love is not to be found,

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,530
is not to be taken.

91
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,776
It is to be given.

92
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,530
You may despise simple faith.
But what is simple faith but healing?

93
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,697
Abandon notions of socialised medicine.
What is it?

94
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,859
Medicine does not belong
to the Hypocritic oath... Oh!

95
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,332
And when did all this come to an end?

96
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,248
It didn't come to an end.
That's the point.

97
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,009
My job is a lecher's dream.

98
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,332
Feature editor for
a big fashion magazine in Paris.

99
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,534
<i>The receptionist is beautiful.</i>

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,571
- Good morning, Mr James.
- Good morning.

101
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,656
<i>The copywriters are beautiful.</i>

102
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,532
<i> Bonjour, Monsieur James.</i>

103
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,969
<i>- Bonjour, Monsieur James.</i>
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

104
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,934
<i>The secretaries are beautiful.</i>
<i>And the models!</i>

105
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,574
- <i> What about the models?</i>
- <i>Oh, my gawd.</i>

106
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,739
- Good morning, Mr James.
- Good morning.

107
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,010
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr James.

108
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,096
Oh, hello, Gladys.

109
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,612
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like</i>
<i>to be in close contact every day</i>

110
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,130
<i>with the worid's most gorgeous women?</i>
<i>And what can I do?</i>

111
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,251
I can't say no.

112
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,769
And why should I say no?
I love it, do you hear?

113
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,653
I love every second of it.

114
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,058
That's how it's always been with me.
A little pleasure, a little pain,

115
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,536
but always back to the ladies.

116
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,458
So what is your problem?

117
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,811
Carole. I met her at a language school.

118
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,536
She wants to get married
and I'm afraid to commit myself.

119
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,779
- Do you love her?
- Oh, surely.

120
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,049
Mm.

121
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,016
But you are afraid to marry her because
you are not ready to give up other women.

122
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,654
Quite right.

123
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,136
Then why don't you marry her and cheat?

124
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,297
That's exactly what I want to avoid.
That's why I came to you.

125
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,651
I respect her too much
to do anything like that.

126
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,739
I think that, with you, sex is a sport,<i>ja?</i>

127
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,899
Oh, yes. I love the... the smell of perfume,

128
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,696
and the thrill of the chase
and the moment of conquest.

129
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,291
- I like thighs. Do you like thighs?
- Mm.

130
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,132
Look, I know you'll
think this is crazy, but...

131
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,890
when the light hits me
in a certain direction, I'm... handsome.

132
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,373
Oh.

133
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,690
Listen, I'll see you next Friday.
I've got phone calls to make.

134
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,776
I've only been here 15 minutes.

135
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,256
I can't take more than 15 minutes
of your sex life at one time.

136
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,134
Look, why don't you come
to some of my group analysis meetings?

137
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,697
Maybe if there's other people around
it's going to be easier for both of us.

138
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,211
Hello, Zsa Zsa? This is Fritz.
How are you, my little flesh pudding?

139
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,013
Hold on.
Listen, you'll like this group analysis.

140
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,291
It's a real freak show.
If it gets dull, we sing songs.

141
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,138
Oh.

142
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,252
Do you think it'll help?
I'll do anything to achieve Carole.

143
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,215
Well, if it fails we will try something else.
I use all kinds of unorthodox methods.

144
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,049
For example, I have had great success
shutting people in dark closets.

145
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,374
Really?

146
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,016
See you at the next meeting.
Bring with you 500 francs.

147
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,656
Hello, my little laxative.
This is baby Fritzy here.

148
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,657
He must be a genius.

149
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,534
Victor!

150
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,457
Oh, Victor!

151
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,856
- Michael James, Tempest O'Brien.
- How do you do?

152
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,814
- She adores me.
- He's cheating because I won last night.

153
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,536
Strip chess. She had me down to
my shorts and I fainted from tensión.

154
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,810
I want a drink.

155
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,618
- Absinthe.
- Coffee.

156
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,049
Mineral water.

157
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,936
- How's Carole?
- Did you find a job?

158
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,493
I got something at the striptease.
I help the giris dress and undress.

159
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,576
- Nice job.
- 20 francs a week.

160
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,454
- Not very much.
- It's all I can afford.

161
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,368
How's Carole?

162
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,052
It's funny. When the light hits you
a certain way you're so handsome.

163
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,738
<i>#</i> I was born in Boston city...

164
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,294
- Michael?
- Hello, pussycat.

165
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,490
Pussycat, I love you.

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,858
Thank you for another pot of flowers.

167
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,851
Shall I get dressed?

168
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,335
Or is it foreign-movie time?

169
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,020
Foreign-movie time.

170
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,372
You're a monster.

171
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,809
- Me? I'm not a monster.
- Yes, you are.

172
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,057
I'm your nice warm lover.

173
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,172
- What did you do today?
- Nothing. I slept.

174
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,656
Do you know that people
sleep away a third of their lives?

175
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,216
If a man lives to be 75
it means he sleeps for 25 years.

176
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,535
You know what it means
to sleep for 25 years?

177
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,050
It means you wake up
with a shocking headache.

178
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,569
Michael?
I have to have a talk with you.

179
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,612
- What about?
- Us.

180
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,970
- Us?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,491
That's a very touchy topic.
Because you get personal and start to hit.

182
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,692
There's no reason why
two people can't discuss marriage

183
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,856
without turning it into a Third Worid War!

184
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,895
We've discussed it a thousand times
and you know my view. I'm a fascist.

185
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,332
- Now, I have to go home and change.
- But, pussycat, you live upstairs!

186
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,329
I have to open your door, climb a flight
of stairs, open my door. It all takes time.

187
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,329
My parents are coming next week. They
want to know when we're getting married.

188
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,735
My mother writes every week and asks.

189
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,772
Hemingway began as a journalist
and he broke away.

190
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,293
- I want to get serious, plan a real future.
- I hoped this job would be temporary.

191
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,536
My friends are married.
They seem happy.

192
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,017
- I know there's a novel in me.
- No one's sure. It's time to decide.

193
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,019
Even if it's a bad novel.
I've got to make a start.

194
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,256
If you're not sure now, you'll never be.

195
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,770
The worst curse in the worid
is to be mediocre.

196
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,688
- You're not listening to me!
- I am listening indeed!

197
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,177
Now, listen to me, pussycat.
Times are hard... and I'm in a hurry.

198
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,178
- You...!
- I have an appointment.

199
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,690
If you can't be more definite,
then we should stop seeing each other.

200
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,769
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- But how can you say you love me?

201
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,575
Because I do.

202
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,618
It wouldn't be fair to marry you now,
do you see?

203
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,292
I've got a lot of wildness and fun
to get out of my system.

204
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,854
You know, when we marry,
we give up fun.

205
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,689
- You always have an excuse.
- Ah, pussycat.

206
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,495
We're children, you and I.
Now's the time to live and experiment.

207
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,088
Marriage is for life.
It's like cement.

208
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,415
But at that rate it would drift on forever.

209
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,692
We had this conversation six months ago
and I don't see anything changed.

210
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,699
When are you old enough to assume
the responsibility of marriage? At 25?

211
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,288
26? 28? 32?

212
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,413
- 65? 89? 90? 97? 103?
- You're hysterical!

213
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,930
- Every time I don't agree I'm hysterical.
- Pull yourself together.

214
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,778
No.

215
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,412
- Give me the keys. Give me the keys.
- No, take a cab.

216
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,089
I don't wish to take a key.
I want my car cabs.

217
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,336
I need the keys... uh, the car.

218
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,530
- You've made up your horrid mind?
- Yes.

219
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,458
I shall walk!
It's better for the heart anyway. Taxi!

220
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,539
All right. But don't...
Don't say I didn't warn you.

221
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,456
Scotch.

222
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,772
Oh, excuse me.
Haven't you seen me somewhere before?

223
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,017
I know the name
but I can't remember the face.

224
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,290
- Oh, California sometime.
-

225
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,378
- Give my regards to whatshername.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,376
Pussycat?

227
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,252
Mr James!

228
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,256
What are you, uh, doing here?

229
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,895
- I'm paid to come here.
- You're paid to come here?

230
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,899
- Yes, m-m-my magazine, you see.
- Yes, yes.

231
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,048
- And what are you doing here?
- What... am... I... doing... here?

232
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,135
Um...

233
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,775
I am here as, uh...
I'm here as a scientist, you know?

234
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,892
- Aha.
- I'm here as a scientist.

235
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,693
Plumbing the depths of the soul.

236
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,095
Doing a bit of plumbing?

237
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,609
Yes, yes. I, uh...

238
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,173
Oh!

239
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,970
- Ah!
- Oh!

240
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,777
I was so interested,
you know, in your case.

241
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,020
Intrigued me immensely, those things
that you told me about, what happens.

242
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,017
I, uh...

243
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,656
Well, I freely admit it,
I, uh, decided to follow you here.

244
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,213
If you followed me here, how did you
contrive to be here before me?

245
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,611
I followed you... very fast.

246
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,809
Ah.

247
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,250
Look, a point I've noticed, scientifically,

248
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,009
is that stripping is not sexy.

249
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,335
No, not in the slightest.

250
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,928
I can speak with a certain authority on this

251
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,895
because I've seen this show
a hundred times.

252
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,857
- You've seen this a hundred times?
- Mm.

253
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,895
Then admit it, Mr James. Admit you
come here merely searching for love.

254
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,217
- I admit it.
- Well, I'm glad you admitted it.

255
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,289
Otherwise I'd have had to lock you
in a dark closet, you naughty man.

256
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,496
Oh, that's beautiful.

257
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,571
Victor, give me a hand
with my armour, will you, please?

258
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,459
That's the back, you fool! Ooh! Oh!

259
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,933
Sorry.

260
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,096
Did I hurt you?

261
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,176
Yes, I am, I'm going.

262
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,259
I have tickets Saturday night
to a Lautrec exhibition.

263
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,611
Toulouse-Lautrec.
One of my favourite small men.

264
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,300
- Where's my robe?
- He's one of my favourite painters.

265
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,888
- This is the back.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,057
You would appreciate Lautrec.
He has a very sensitive line.

267
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,570
Used colour very sparingly
but made a point with line.

268
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,611
The helmet.

269
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,892
Victor, Victor, will you help me
with my veil, please?

270
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,853
Saturday night, I have tickets
to a Lautrec exhibition.

271
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,053
- He was a marvellous painter.
- I'm busy Saturday night. Hurry up.

272
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,889
- Do you like Lautrec at all?
- You've put it the wrong way around.

273
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,329
- He's short, but fun.
- Let me do it alone.

274
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,735
I'm sorry, they're all boys in my family.

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,809

303
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,859
- What is that?
- I dunno. Probably just a short.

304
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,130
What is it?

305
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,377
I don't know, but I don't want
to be here when it gets hungry.

306
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,378
- Victor, I'm scared.
- Don't panic, it may be nothing.

307
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,049
- You can panic now.
- Let's get out of here, quick.

308
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,293
My wife, I'll kill her!
I'll kill my wife!

309
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,934
Pardon me, drunk,
but you can't come in here.

310
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,815
She makes a fool of me,
she makes a fool... I kill her! I kill him!

311
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,699
Why don't you go home and sleep it off?

312
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,050
She cheats with him.

313
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,091
I kill him! I kill him!

314
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,575
- But who is he?
- Everybody!

315
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,773
She cheats with everybody!
I kill everybody! Everybody... everybody.

316
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,572
Poor man.

317
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,851
Why does everyone have
so much trouble with being in love?

318
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,532
It never seems to work. You love me
and I love... I love Michael and...

319
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,809
Oh, Victor, I'm so mixed up.

320
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,650
<i>#</i> I feel... marvellous

321
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,055
<i>#</i> I feel... marvellous...

322
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,375
- I adore the way you dance.
- And I adore the way you look tonight.

323
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,696
- I've only got vodka.
- Oh, vodka. Vodka's fine.

324
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,015
When it comes to liquor, I'm a health nut.

325
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,089
I drink a lot of gin and wheat germ.
Regular vodka and gluten.

326
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,940
- Please don't.
- Why not?

327
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,336
- You came here to hear my poems.
- I did?

328
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,488
Oh, I did! Yes, surely.
But you've been so affectionate, pussycat.

329
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,253
- You're on my foot!
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

330
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,417
- It's all right.
- But I want to hear your poems.

331
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,735
Oh, all right. But behave.

332
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,977
Yes, sure. I love erotic poems.

333
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,455
Oh, it's not erotic, it's political.

334
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,536
- Is it?
- Mm-hm.

335
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,489
Oh, yeah.

336
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,738
I wrote this at Hillside Hospital,
just after my fourth nervous breakdown.

337
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,294
Two, three, four.

338
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,888
"Who killed Charlie Parker?"

339
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,500
"You did. You... rat."

340
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,056
I dedicate this next poem...

341
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,740
Well, it's been an interesting evening...

342
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,977
Please... don't go.

343
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,374
No?

344
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,130
I'm beginning to grow
extremely fond of you.

345
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,058
I get attached to people very quickly.

346
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,650
I'm a woman who can experience things
really deeply for the first time.

347
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,499
Well, I don't fall in love easily either.

348
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,011
I believe in adventure
and experimentation and no attachments.

349
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,257
- Oh, I love that in a man.
- Ah. Well...

350
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,330
I'm one for marriage, though. But I believe
only after two people have lived together...

351
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,417
Intimacy before final involvement.

352
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,213
Yes, how true. How true.

353
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,377
Why are we reading all the poems?
I know a poem too.

354
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,535
Mm?

355
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,810
"Had we but worid enough, and time,

356
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,979
This coyness, Lady, were no crime."

357
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,294
Ah.

358
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,014
One more poem...

359
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,098
and you can do with me what you want.

360
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,338
- Victor, can I have a drink?
- Sure, what would you like?

361
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,295
A triple Scotch on the rocks.
Sometimes a drink will loosen me up.

362
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,814
- You have got something to eat?
- Some, uh, some Fig Newtons.

363
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,172
And some Hershey bars
and... some cough drops.

364
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,289
- You got any tuna fish?
- Tuna fish... tuna fish...

365
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,177
Uh...

366
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,578
I have...
I have some salmon salad left.

367
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,214
What do you mean, "left"?
When did you make it?

368
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,013
In April, but if you smother it
with pepper it's fine.

369
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,098
- What about an egg?
- An egg... Wait.

370
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,136
Uh, yes, I have...

371
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,371
Oh!

372
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,809
You look... you look beautiful.

373
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm beginning to feel warm already.

374
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,616
Thank you.

375
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,651
Mm. Mm.

376
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,940
Gee, I need a cigarette.

377
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,535
I think there's something sexy about
the way some men smoke cigarettes.

378
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,735
Oh! I just burnt my finger.

379
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,412
I'm going to go in the bathroom
and scream. I'll be out in a minute.

380
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,096
My finger!

381
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,211
- Victor!
- Forgive me, I...

382
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,059
I saw your lips standing there.

383
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,139
Why don't I go into the bedroom?
I wait for you in bed.

384
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,337
<i># Here I am</i>

385
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,213
<i># Here I stay</i>

386
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,170
<i># All of my life I'll be what you</i>

387
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,134
<i># Want me to be</i>

388
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,852
<i># All that I ask</i>

389
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,733
<i># Is that you just keep loving me</i>

390
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,294
Here I come, dear.

391
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,530
I'm all shaven.

392
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,094
Everything's off.

393
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,135
I'm here. Uh... I'm up here.

394
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,650
Dear? Uh, fragrance?

395
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,330
Dear, are you OK? Is it...?
I'm going to get into the bed now.

396
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,577
Dear! Come on, dear.
Let's go! Here I am!

397
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,576
Um...

398
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,655
What?

399
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,577
Sweetheart?

400
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,133
Here...

401
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,091
Carole?

402
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,778
Um...

403
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,617
Are... are you asleep?

404
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,016
You're crumpled on the floor, right?

405
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,215
All right. Good night!

406
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,335
Listen, we're strangers, fella.
Take it easy.

407
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,453
Take...? I was sitting there quietly
and you jumped on top...

408
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,368
- How'd you like my poems?
- They're very beautiful and quite moving.

409
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,654
Did you like the one about peaceful
coexistence, <i>Ode To A Pacifist Junkie?</i>

410
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,011
- Yes. I thought it was very sexy.
- Oh.

411
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,292
Actually, the poem wasn't about sex,
it was a plea for better housing.

412
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,376
Now, look...

413
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,769
I've got a sexual block.
It's a thing with me.

414
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,289
I don't wish to cause you any conflict.

415
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,619
No, no, you're perfectly right.
I must face up to the problem.

416
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,937
I can't go on the rest of my life
being a semi-virgin.

417
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,736
What, in the name of all that's gracious,
is a semi-virgin?

418
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,249
Here, I'm a virgin.
In America, I'm not.

419
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,736
What do they do?
Stamp it on your passport?

420
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,534
- Now, listen to me.
- Uh-oh.

421
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,935
I feel faint.
Excuse me for a minute.

422
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,178
I'm going into the bathroom
to take an overdose of sleeping pills.

423
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,772
I like you.
You're a nice, stable girl.

424
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,020
She'll be all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

425
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,452
I thought she was joking. It was all poems
and "Don't touch me". She's weird.

426
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,573
They're only phenobarbital.
She only had a couple.

427
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,089
She came out of the bathroom
and looked very odd

428
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,849
and I gave her a little...
nibble on the neck.

429
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,414
Like that, you see?
Then she fell on the floor.

430
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,496
- A nibble?
- A nibble.

431
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,775
- How are you?
- Sorry about that. I got panicky.

432
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,808
Mademoiselle Belmont
will stay overnight, OK?

433
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,977
Oh, surely. Have a good night's pill.

434
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,256
Pussycat?

435
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,216
Pussycat?

436
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,816
Carole?

437
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,096
Miss Werner!

438
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,416
Carole!

439
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,217
Please repeat after me.
"The pen is blue."

440
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,331
The pen is blue.

441
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,935
I go, she goes, we go, they go.

442
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,973
I go, she goes, we go, they go.

443
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,898
Where were you last night?
That's all I want to know!

444
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,411
- I told you not to visit when I'm at work.
- You didn't sleep in your room!

445
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,532
Unless you're ready to get serious,
it's not your business.

446
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,730
All right, we disagree.
Let's discuss it.

447
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,057
- There is nothing to discuss!
- There is nothing to discuss.

448
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,298
- There is plenty to discuss.
- There is plenty to discuss.

449
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,173
I am serious and you are not.
Don't feel obligated.

450
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,088
- I love you, pussycat!
- I love you, pussycat.

451
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,417
You've got a funny idea of love.
How do you treat people you hate?

452
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,896
- It's different for a girl.
- It is not! It is not different!

453
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,976
If you can run around, so can I.

454
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,409
- You love me!
- You love me.

455
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,008
I am tired of waiting.
I've got my own life to live.

456
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,928
Oh, yes? OK, OK, you'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry.

457
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,016
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

458
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,098
- You'll see, you'll be sorry.
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!

459
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,016
Goodbye!

460
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,859
All right!
Sleep where you want, see if I care.

461
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,529
- I sure as hell will!
- I sure as hell will!

462
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,891
Oh! You bunch of parrots!

463
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,775
Life is a strumpet

464
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,494
stained with wine.

465
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,056
"Go to, I'll no more on't;
it hath made me mad."

466
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,696
"I say, we will have
no more marriages!"

467
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,175
Isn't that Schiller?

468
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,053
- Shakespeare.
- Mm?

469
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,496
That man there

470
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,499
is the finest man that ever breathed.

471
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,895
- Who is?
- He is.

472
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,454
He is? Who's he?

473
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,092
- Who's he?
- Mm.

474
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,098
I'll soon show you who he is.

475
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,815
Hey! You must not strike me,
you naughty boy!

476
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,376
You're my patient, that's who you are!

477
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:54,019
And, anyway, I can lick any Freudian
psychoanalyst that's in this house.

478
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,132
An analyst? Then I need help.

479
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,855
- <i>Encore, la même chose.</i>
- And for me, please.

480
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,618
Carole. Carole.

481
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,810
I love her. She's beautiful.

482
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:10,651
She wasn't in her apartment and I've tried
everything you said and it doesn't work.

483
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,577
- Liz.
- Mm, Liz?

484
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,375
She's a stripper. She's beautiful.

485
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,413
And she's here on a bongo scholarship.

486
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,610
Why don't you introduce me to her?

487
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,335
I could be the man that sees
no one touches her for you.

488
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,248
No, no, no. I need help. Help.

489
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,850
Don't mention that word to me - "help".

490
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,574
That is what <i>I</i> need. Help!

491
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,056
Oh, God, how I need that thing.

492
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,377
Do you know that
I am in love with a patient?

493
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,856
I am in love with a patient!
You got a minute?

494
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,892
- Surely.
- Let me tell you my story.

495
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,976
Let me sit down.

496
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,173
Carole is like a rose petal.

497
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,291
She's so innocent.

498
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,618
Can I tell you what happened
in my dream last night?

499
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,892
I shall sell matches
on the street corner.

500
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,413
And I shall be
the first to buy them from you.

501
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,496
Very civil.

502
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,095
Miss Lefebvre.

503
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,256
Miss Lefebvre!

504
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,736
Every time she sees me she screams

505
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,818
because every time
she sees me I attack her.

506
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,491
No. You must not attack her.

507
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,180
You must woo her.

508
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,130
- Woo her?
- Woo her.

509
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,458
<i>#</i> Woo her...

510
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,016
<i>#</i> In Vienna.

511
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,692
You must stand underneath her window.
And I shall pretend to be you.

512
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,414
And I shall pour your heart out.

513
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,614
Oh!

514
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,130
We shall halloo her name

515
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,933
to the reverberant hills.

516
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,732
Lefebvre!

517
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,448
Lefebvre!

518
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,331
You are, without doubt,

519
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,738
one of the finest men
what ever breathed.

520
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,411
Who is?

521
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,059
Who is?

522
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,217
I'll soon show you...

523
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,296
who is.

524
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,928
<i>#</i> Dear old pals

525
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,975
<i>#</i> Jolly old pals

526
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,649
<i>#</i> Always together

527

<i>#</i> In all kinds of weather

528
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,089
<i>Eins, zwei, drei.</i>

529
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,259
That's the one.
The third one, up there. That one.

530
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,531
We must attract her attention.

531
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,568
Direct hit!

532
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,930
Who's there?

533
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,531
"But, soft! What light from
yonder window breaks?"

534
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,178
Psst! "My darling, your face
is like the pale autumn moon."

535
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,497
- You're joking?
- I'm not joking.

536
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,498
- I can't say that!
- Why can't you say that?

537
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,612
- It's ghastly!
- Did someone call me?

538
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:40,134
I did! Your Apollo, god of the sun,
is calling his aphrodisiac.

539
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,979
- I'm going to be sick.
- But who's there?

540
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,979
My darling, your face
is like the pale autumn moon.

541
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,773
My face is what? Now, who are you?

542
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,689
- Help me. I love that woman!
- No wonder she thinks you're such a twit.

543
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,458
Who are you?

544
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,936
Not addressing you, sir.
Would you kindly leave the <i>étage?</i>

545
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,418
My darling, your face is like
the pale autumn moon. Your face...

546
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,373
- Thank you!
- What did you say my face was?

547
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,415
Your face is like the pale autumn moon!
Are you deaf?

548
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,249
Don't speak to her
like what you done, you rude man.

549
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,940
Give her the nice things!

550
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,737
What's going on there?

551
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,648
- He's saying your face is like the moon.
- My face?

552
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,332
Not your face, you idiot. The face
on the lady what's in the top tower!

553
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,372
Will you shut up?
Come back to bed!

554
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,095
Listen, whoever you are,
you are dull and I'm going in.

555
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,451
- She's going in! Quick!
- We can't get any sleep!

556
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,140
Will you please shut up and go away!

557
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,933
- Go home!
- And you, too! Shut up!

558
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,617
Right! Everybody, inside!

559
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,573
Trickle back to your truckle beds.

560
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,533
Everybody, <i>faites vos jeux.</i>

561
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,730
Ooh! Ah!

562
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,579
Give her something romantic!
Say romantic things to her!

563
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,097
Your name... is like a bell
that hangs in my heart.

564
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,372
May it ring... and swing.

565
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,658
Lefebvre!

566
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,335
Lefebvre!

567
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:31,256
Miss Lefebvre! Miss Lefebvre!
It's me, baby Fritz, and I love you!

568
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,058
Police!

569
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,738
Help, help!

570
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,215
Police!

571
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,495
And now, group, whose emotional
problems shall we discuss today?

572
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,054
- Me, me, me, me.
- No, mine. Mine. Mine.

573
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,056
Me, me, me, me!

574
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,810
I've been coming here ten months and
we haven't discussed my problem once.

575
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,330
Perhaps if you'd be kind enough
to tell us what your problem is

576
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,293
then we could all have a go
at discussing it or something.

577
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,139
I can't. It's dirty.

578
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,093
Weren't we discussing, last week,

579
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,893
Mr Durrell's relationship with his father?

580
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,411
Actually, we were discussing the dream
about the train entering the tunnel.

581
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,976
Oh,<i>ja, ja.</i> The train in the tunnel.
That was a good one.

582
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,814
By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we
have with us a new member of our group.

583
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,455
He's a young man who has got
certain emotional problems.

584
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,255
All your life you should have such
problems as this young man has got.

585
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,894
He's the editor
of a well-known fashion magazine.

586
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,138
I'm referring to
none other than Mr Michael James.

587
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,215
Ahem.

588
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,900
I haven't been sleeping very well

589
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,411
and if I... if I go without it
I find that, um, quite often,

590
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,929
I, um, fall asleep.

591
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,335
Carole is my girlfriend.
She's part of the whole... perishing thing.

592
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,931
She, um, lies... puts me on the bed.
She... on the bed...

593
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,449
and sometimes she misses
and I go under the bed,

594
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,858
but this is what we describe
as a pot shot and it doesn't count.

595
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,655
Argh! Argh!

596
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,658
- Argh! Argh!
- Quills!

597
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,092
Control your knees immediately
or they'll be shaved within the hour.

598
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,731
Mr Quills! Have you no shame?

599
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,809
Why do you keep attacking new members
in this way, you great fat Moby Dick?

600
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,138
<i>#</i> When it's springtime in Vienna

601
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,774
Quills is a paranoiac.
He sleeps with the light on.

602
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,379
- Pansy!
- Nail biter!

603
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,776
- I prefer the sickness to the cure.
- Early days, Mr James.

604
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,688
- Didn't you mention a dark closet?
- Good idea. I've got one over here.

605
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,573
- Goody, another free-for-all!
-

606
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,658
It's a raid! Run for your lives!

607
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,179
Miss Lefebvre. You look
positively ravishing in that face.

608
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,213
Thank you, Herr Professor.
Group, listen.

609
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,379
I've some marvellous fresh
emotional experiences to tell you about.

610
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,775
You see, the other day...

611
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,334
He told me any time I had trouble
controlling myself to blow this.

612
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,089
You have... trouble controlling yourself?

613
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,017
Only with men. I have an intense need
to be loved by many men many times.

614
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,096
Really?

615
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,098
- A little wine, would you care for?
- Yes.

616
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,609
You'd never know by your placid exterior

617
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,528
that underneath that ice-cold facade
beats the heart of a savage...

618
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,538
lustful... passionate animal.

619
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,175
What will you have
for breakfast tomorrow?

620
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,814
Orange juice, tea and toast.

621
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,614
I have to call someone
and tell them I will not be home tonight.

622
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,972
The phone's down by the bed,
next to my prayer shawl.

623
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,494
Agh!

624
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,180
- I'm sorry about the fight.
- What?

625
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,417
- I decided you were right.
- What, what, what, what?

626
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,294
- About some things.
- What... what did you decide?

627
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,888
- I'm moving in with you.
- You're moving in?

628
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,092
Yes. What the hell's the matter with you?

629
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,450
You now... moving in?
You... in... moving?

630
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,652
Yes, yes.
I am sick of wasting any more time.

631
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,374
You're now moving in...?
You... you've decided...?

632
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,255
Yes. Darling, listen. If we were
living together like husband and wife

633
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,258
maybe you'd see
it wasn't all horrible after all.

634
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,577
- Oh, but it is. It's horrible.
- Michael!

635
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,855
Go downstairs, pussycat, and I'll join you
in a while and we'll have a nice fight.

636
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,858
You don't want me here for a reason.
You're covering up.

637
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,335
I want the moment to be right!

638
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,933
- I want it to be a special occasión.
- Oh, well...

639
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,496
Listen to me. You said your mother
and father are coming next week.

640
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,851
Do you want us to celebrate
us two living out of wedlock?

641
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,930
- I don't think they'd appreciate it.
- Well, look, let's discuss it later.

642
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,697
Something's wrong... someplace.

643
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,169
Well, look what's sleeping in your bed.

644
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,371
As a man's life goes down the drain,
you are there.

645
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,419
Oh dear, all this work I've got to do.

646
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,249
Wash the dishes,
polish the furniture, do this, do that.

647
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,019
I say, I do earn my pay.

648
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,770
Here we go, cock, spotless we must be.

649
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,373
Ah.

650
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,015
Uh, pussycat. I can please explain.

651
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,610
Michael! I had to see you.

652
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,972
You haven't called me
since that last fantastic night.

653
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,739
You hyperthyroid.

654
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,772
Carole! Look, I love you!
I love you, Carole!

655
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,336
It's not what it seems!
I'm opening up a seminary!

656
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,809
Begging your pardon,
I'm going to find the john.

657
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,052
Mm. Ah!

658
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,455
There it is, fine. Good.

659
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,256
Oh, my...

660
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,056
Another overdose...

661
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,136
Um... Um...

662
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,738
Uh, hello, help? Succour?
Um, emergency ward, yes.

663
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,011
My name is Michael James.
<i>Je suis</i> Michael James.

664
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,736
There is an <i>étrange...</i> uh...
bird <i>ici...</i> Uh... she...

665
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,452
- Ooh!
- Oh!

666
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,176
Just relax. That's fine.

667
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,097
Take it easy, now.

668
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,892
I'm sorry.

669
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,578
May I ask what is your relationship
to this girl? Are you her fiancé?

670
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,533
No, I'm just a friend.

671
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,209
It's a pretty rocky friendship you've got.

672
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,456
Pussycat?

673
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,056
Pussycat?

674
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,295
Do you think you could love a short man?
I mean, if he had very attractive red hair?

675
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,809
Victor, I adore you.

676
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,419
<i>Collected Poems of Shelley.</i>
I always wanted to read...

677
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,897
- Sorry, I saw Shelley first.
- You did not! I saw it first!

678
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,454
Like hell you did. It's mine.

679
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,334
Victor! You're not going
to let him take that book?

680
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,893
- Actually, she did see the book first.
- Beat it.

681
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,215
Oh! Victor.

682
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,934
Thrash him. Come on. Go!

683
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,816
What is...? Go on!

684
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,579
Uh...

685
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,656
I have a bad head cold...

686
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,979
Victor, you always said
you'd go through hell for me. Go on!

687
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,136
You see his knuckles? They're huge!

688
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,058
You're not going to
let that man insult your woman?

689
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,129
You're Michael's woman. Why don't I
get him? He could be here in five minutes.

690
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,412
If you have any hopes for winning me,
now is the moment to prove it. Go on.

691
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,496
Go on! Go on!

692
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,491
Come on, Victor!

693
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,929
Kick him! Kick him!

694
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,494
- Give it...!
- Hand me that book.

695
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,930
- No.
- Give me that book.

696
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,176
Go on! Victor!

697
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,532
Victor, show him! Kick him now!

698
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,538
- Will you give me that book?
- No! You are not a gentleman.

699
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,538
- I am a gentleman!
- No, you are not.

700
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,617
Victor, show him!
Get him! Kick him! Hit him!

701
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,211
Victor, you're so brave, I'm shocked.

702
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,649
Victor...

703
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,419
I must have Carole.

704
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,100
I need her. I love her.

705
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,132
She's the whole worid to me,
and she's mine.

706
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,698
The only way anyone could take
her away from me... is by killing me.

707
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,129
I've decided what I'm going to do.

708
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,138
I've been seeing the best
psychoanalyst in Paris.

709
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,493
He's a genius. And he wants me
to go to his group analysis courses.

710
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:09,889
Well, I've been going. I'm going to
keep on going. And I'm going to fight!

711
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,171
And I'm going to win... because I love her.

712
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:21,331
Ah, that's better. Ah, a little gentle steam.
Does one the worid of good.

713
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,049
Ahh.

714
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,331
We must have physical health
as well as mental health.

715
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,973
Oh, I'm kinky for steam.

716
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,378
<i>#</i> I was born in Boston city, boys

717
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,968
<i>#</i> The place you all know well

718
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,375
- Are you well, Victor?
-

719
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:45,132
<i>#</i> Brought up by honest parents
and the truth to you I'll tell

720
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,173
- <i>#</i> Brought up by honest parents...
-

721
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,416
Let me outta here!

722
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,969
I can't open it!

723
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,733
Then, Doctor, when I was 15 years old, I
had to tell my parents they were adopted.

724
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,932
We fought,
I stopped coming home and moved out.

725
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,850
So you turned promiscuous?
Well, I love that in a woman. Love it.

726
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,813
I can't help it,
I'm a physical woman.

727
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,094
I feel guilty about it but I come from
a family of acute nymphomaniacs.

728
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,654
That includes my father
and my two brothers.

729
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,930
Why don't we all undress?
It's so modern...

730
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,779
For instance, Doctor...

731
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,659
I find myself extremely
attracted... to Mr James.

732
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,412
And the fact that he's in love with
someone else excites me even more.

733
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,452
What is it that you see in him
that you don't see in me?

734
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,095
I don't know.
But there is something about his face.

735
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,934
When the light hits him a certain way,
he's almost handsome.

736
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,530
You're lovely but I'm here to get rid
of problems, not to acquire them.

737
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,415
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
who is the handsomest of them all?

738
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,292
- I am.
- I am!

739
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,456
I am!

740
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,170
Group, in Britain
we have a national therapy.

741
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,131
We call it...

742
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,932
cricket.

743
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:14,896
Unlike other sports, there's no anxiety
or pressure. It's leisurely and lyrical.

744
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,059
It's the song of willow on leather.

745
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,930
- Is there any sex in it?
- Oh, no.

746
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,338
This is a game for gentlemen,
played by gentlemen.

747
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,416
It's sick. Sick!

748
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,972
Miss Lefebvre,
tell me something about yourself.

749
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:39,015
He's really elegant, isn't he?
Do something for me, Doctor.

750
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,536
Couldn't you throw those giris away?
I don't like those giris around him.

751
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,696
Lay here and watch your...

752
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,940
watch your champion
from a good... here... vantage point.

753
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,699
There, now, on my shoulder.
Can you see him better?

754
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:03,690
Can't you feel him better? Feel all those
lovely... ooh... strokes he's pulling?

755
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,057
- Couldn't you arrange something for me?
- What would you like?

756
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,569
To have a sessión, just the three of us.

757
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,010
A little bowling and a little batting?
Something like that?

758
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,574
No, a more intimate game, you know?

759
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,931
I mean, when are they going to finish?
I'm getting very nervous.

760
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,858
Isn't this game scintillating and exciting?

761
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,370
I'd like the game to be over.
I'd like to play something else.

762
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,776
Other games?
Well, that's interesting, too.

763
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,059
Can you see the bowler? Don't look at
the batsman, the bowler's interesting.

764
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,536
- I love the batsman better.
- Yeah, batsmen are all right.

765
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,130
I always have liked
a little bit of bowler, myself.

766
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,768
<i>#</i>... Raised most tenderly

767
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,812
<i>#</i> Till I became a sporting blade...

768
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,579
- I thought you'd never get here.
- What the hell...?

769
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,773
- I've been waiting for you to telephone.
- What are you doing here?

770
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,973
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I think you're right.

771
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,730
The only way two people can really get
to know one another is by living together.

772
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,895
- Oh... What?
- Mm-hm.

773
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,535
- So I'm moving in here.
- You're moving in here?

774
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,212
Ah!

775
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,457
You've taken leave of your senses!
You're a weird lady!

776
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,777
Even though we've known each other
for such a few hours,

777
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:28,497
I feel that we were meant for one another.
Do you believe in kismet?

778
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,497
Please, go home.

779
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,417
I'm hungry.

780
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,100
Don't you just love sin?

781
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,175
Just a bloody minute. Sit down.

782
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,212
- Sit down. Sit!
- Sit. Fine.

783
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,015
Now, you and I are going to have
a little talk, get things straightened out.

784
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,975
- God, I love it when you're domineering.
- Really? Oh.

785
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,173
Now, while I think
that you're a smashing young lady,

786
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,497
I am not in love with you,
do you understand?

787
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,180
I am not in love with you.

788
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,852
- She's been upset lately.
- I'm so sorry.

789
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,892
Mademoiselle, the boys
of emergency suicide ward

790
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,296
voted you this gold watch
for unusual devotion.

791
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,899
Oh...

792
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,976
Thank you.

793
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,456
</i>

794
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,334
<i># What's new, pussycat?</i>
<i>Whoa-o-o</i>

795
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,731
<i># What's new, pussycat?</i>
<i>Whoa-o-o</i>

796
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,738
Michael, remember me?
You loved me in your office.

797
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,816
Indeed I do.

798
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,695
Remember the night in the hospital bed?

799
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,890
Unforgettable.

800
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,171
- My mother's crypt.
- Oh, poor mummy.

801
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,896
On top of the Eiffel Tower.

802
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,976
Very chilly.

803
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,456
You could have had me, Michael.

804
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:18,260
Michael, I need you. I've telephoned you
several times. Why haven't you called?

805
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,258
I've phoned you I don't know
how many times, maybe six.

806
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,816
I know it's neurotic,
but I want you, Michael.

807
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,851
- Michael.
- Michael.

808
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,170
- Michael.
- Michael.

809
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,212
Excuse me, I...
Oh! Hello, there.

810
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,934
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

811
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,097
Michael, I've tried
to telephone you for several...

812
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,814
- Michael. I've tried to teleph...
- Michael?

813
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,693
- Michael!
- Michael!

814
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,450
Right! I want all you cats to shape up!

815
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,851
"But I, that am not shap'd
for sportive tricks,

816
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,289
Nor made to court
an amorous looking glass;

817
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,250
<i>I, that am rudely stamp'd,</i>
<i>and want love's majesty to strut..."</i>

818
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,692
"Why, I, in this weak piping
time of peace..."

819
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,929
Dr Fassbender!

820
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,372
"Can I do all this,
and yet cannot get a crown?"

821
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,732
"Tut! Were it further off,
I'll pluck it down."

822
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,614
Dr Fassbender!
Dr Fassbender! Dr Fassbender.

823
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,615
I must see Dr Fassbender immediately.

824
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,016
It's not possible. He's in with a patient.
I daren't disturb him.

825
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,612
Couldn't you make an exception in this
one instance? It's very important to me.

826
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:46,894
Well, in this case,
I think maybe it's possible. He's in there.

827
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,570
Hello. Good morning.

828
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,134
- Michael James!
- Can't you knock?

829
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,696
- Knock? I'm in dire need!
- So am I! What do you think I am, human?

830
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:04,770
Bring it up at the next group analysis
meeting, something like that. Not now!

831
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,930
I hope you don't get the wrong idea
about what happened just now.

832
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,939
Not at all. It was quite simple.
You attacked me.

833
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:18,612
Well, if you feel like that about it
you may as well have your whistle back.

834
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:24,337
Thank God you came when you did. He
was talking. Next thing you know - bang!

835
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,533
Just because I speak frankly about my
problems doesn't mean I'm a pushover.

836
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,729
No.

837
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,057
There is more to love
than just physical excitement.

838
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,536
- Respect, for instance, is very important.
- Oh, very important.

839
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,051
Don't think I don't appreciate those things.
Like finesse, atmosphere...

840
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,135
Atmosphere.

841
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,854
- You agree it is important?
- Very important.

842
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,735
Two people in a romantic setting,
soft light, music, champagne.

843
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,535
- Perhaps even incense burning.
- Oh, incense is beautiful.

844
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,299
This is all very important to me.

845
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,172
Only then can I give myself.

846
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,256
But not before.

847
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,091
Who would have
ever thought... in an elevator?

848
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,450
It's the safest place in the worid,

849
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:36,291
provided the combined weight of the
two people does not exceed 1400 pounds.

850
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,377
It was hell, but we'll be fine.

851
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,858
Thank you, we'll be fine.
Very kind. We'll be absolutely fine.

852
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,374
Ah.

853
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,968
Come away with me
for the weekend.

854
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,375
- Where?
- Chateau Chantelle.

855
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,858
Oh, how lovely. We could fish
and hunt and ride and swim and...

856
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,414
And all in my room.

857
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,856


858
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,936
<i># Here I stay...</i>

859
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,452
<i># I'll be what you want me to be</i>

860
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:32,450
<i># All that I ask is that</i>
<i>you just keep loving me</i>

861
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,209
Michael! Carole wasn't in
so we thought we would try here.

862
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:46,128
- O-o-oh, Mr and Mrs Werner.
- Didn't Carole tell you we were coming?

863
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,811
O- oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Marole mumming... C-Carole coming.

864
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,896
Call me Mother.

865
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,979
Miss Lefebvre!
I can stand it no longer!

866
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,695
For the love of you, I die.

867
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,970
Ah!

868
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,889
- Do you have any salt?
- What was that you said?

869
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,932
- Do you have any salt?
- Have I got any salt?

870
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,419
I got a boat, I got kerosene,
matches, firecrackers,

871
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:57,818
two swords <i>und</i> this flag,
but I ain't got no salt!

872
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,093
- Do you always eat here?
- Once a year. On my birthday.

873
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,893
- Your birthday tonight, huh?
- Yeah, I'm 29 today.

874
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,772
29?

875
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:12,413
What a night I should pick. Look.

876
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,818
I've got something I wish to do in private
without people looking. Would you mind?

877
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,376
Go ahead. I'm just gonna sit here,
grab a bite, and run.

878
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:24,778
I can't go ahead while you're hanging
round eating food, you naughty thing.

879
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,496
- Just do whatever you have to do.
- You're a selfish gourmet.

880
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,579
What are you doing over there?

881
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,851
What is that? What's that? A flare?

882
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,972
What are you doing here?
What's going on? What's going on here?

883
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,174
Why don't you shut up, you cretin?
I'm trying to commit suicide.

884
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,971
Set fire to my beautiful
psychoanalyst body

885
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,331
<i>und</i> sail out to sea, ablaze like a Viking!

886
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,609
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a doctor of the mind.

887
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,575
Really? I have terrible emotional
problems. Could you help me?

888
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,454
You certainly picked a very odd time
to ask, just in the middle of a suicide.

889
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,970
All right. But you'll have to lay down
cos I can't do it standing up.

890
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,456
- Lay down? This is a rented tuxedo.
- I don't care what it is. Lay down.

891
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:29,096
I can't do it standing up. Get in there.
Lay right flat out in the boat.

892
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,895
There's Carole.

893
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,456
- Hello.
- Ah, it's Mr Overactive Glands.

894
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,332
- Listen...
- Get off me.

895
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,453
I have got my own life to lead, and I
told you I never wanted to see you again.

896
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,970
Stay in your own apartment and lead
your own life and let me live mine!

897
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,568
Darling! Guess who's here?
Mother and Father!

898
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,057
Mother! Dad! When did you get here?

899
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,173
The roads were clear, we got in a little
early. Michael has been entertaining us.

900
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,578
- Yes, yes, he's a marvellous host. I just...
- Let's not go into that now.

901
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,136
Let's go out. The night's young,
your parents have to leave tomorrow.

902
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,014
Yes, let's celebrate.
I adore this city, it's magnificent.

903
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,817
I don't remember when you two
said you were going to get married.

904
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,295
- We didn't give you a date, Mama.
- Oh.

905
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,730
I could've sworn you wrote
it will be next month.

906
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,057
- Didn't she write that?
- I didn't remember any date.

907
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:54,013
We really are taking steps
to facilitate proceedings

908
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,415
in a mature and deliberate way.

909
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:00,328
- Did you get a blood test?
- When we are ready we'll let you know.

910
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,929
I'm in love with a girl and she doesn't
love me, she loves some other guy.

911
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,178
- And I'm just in the way.
- Oh. Oh, I see. Yes, yes.

912
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,497
What do you think I ought to do?

913
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,454
- Well, why don't you buy a sports car?
- A sports car?

914
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,971
Yeah, a nice little two-seater. French,
German, Italian thing. Goes "vroom".

915
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,331
You know, they love it.
Sign of man's virility.

916
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,089
- Perhaps you ought to get two, maybe.
- I can't drive.

917
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,495
Ah, well, you knock a few people down.

918
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,532
The main thing is you get the girl.
That's all that matters.

919
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,538
You know, for a doctor,
you sound terribly unethical.

920
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,855
Unethical?

921
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,211
What do I give a damn about ethics? Huh?

922
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,969
My father, the most beloved
gynaecologist in Vienna,

923
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,332
as they took him away for indecent
exposure at the State Opera House,

924
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,416
said, and I quote:

925
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,613
"Please do not take me away,
I will not do it again."

926
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,652
- Brilliant quote.
- He was a brilliant pervert.

927
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,499
- Listen, it's my birthday.
- You told me that.

928
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,293
- Can we get back to it?
- What about my funeral?

929
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,173
Let's do your funeral first,
then my birthday.

930
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,609
It's a bargain.
You any good at wrapping?

931
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,208
Yeah, I used to work
at a department store. Why?

932
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,856
Maybe you could help me
get wrapped up in that flag there.

933
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,089
- Grab one end.
- You know how to do this?

934
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,053
It's a cinch. I used to wrap packages.

935
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,968
- All right. Wait a minute, wait a second.
- Got it? Try and get it now.

936
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,614
Go ahead. All right?

937
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,537
- No, no, no.
- Hm.

938
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,094
- Again.
- Uh...

939
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,654
I don't want to be a Viking.

940
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,897
- Why don't we get something to eat?
- Good idea.

941
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,615
Are you upset cos you're a sissy?
A haircut, a gym, you'll be great.

942
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,298
Nothing to do with the haircut!

943
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,015
We've had a wonderful time!
We'll go to our hotel and get some sleep.

944
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,734
- Bye, Daddy!
- Thank you for everything.

945
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,532
- Bye, Mama.
- Goodbye.

946
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,049
- Come on, Mother.
- Thank you.

947
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,694
We're leaving noon tomorrow. Today!

948
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,859
- Remember, you will get married.
- Yes. Goodbye, Mother.

949
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:28,258
We are going away for
the weekend. Our second honeymoon!

950
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,735
Drive carefully.

951
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,213
Bye.

952
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,934
- Goodbye, now.
- Goodbye!

953
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,652
Goodbye.

954
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,693
Bye.

955
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,018
- Tonight was fun.
- Yes.

956
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,416
I haven't felt so relaxed for a long time.

957
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,814
- You were marvellous with my parents.
- Oh, I like them.

958
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,334
- They adore you.
- Really?

959
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,252
Well...

960
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,737
It was nice seeing you again.

961
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,816
- Carole...
- Yes?

962
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,256
Let's get married.

963
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:54,696
- You are... drunk.
- No, I'm sober.

964
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,893
I mean it. Let's get married.

965
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,773
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

966
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:07,737
I can't tell you anything
but, suddenly, I'm sure.

967
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:13,252
- Suddenly you're sure?
- Suddenly I'm very sure.

968
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,336
Will you marry me?

969
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,299
- Like when?
- This week?

970
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,411
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...?

971
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,054
Oh, you want me to pick a date?

972
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,176
I adore you.

973
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,769
I'm positive. Certain.

974
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,256
I want you

975
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,531
more than anything in the worid,

976
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,218
pussycat.

977
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,972
Pussycat.

978
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,096
How about Monday?

979
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,494
Monday.

980
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,338
Absolutely!

981
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,532
Oh, what a fool I've been.

982
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,936
I've searched and searched
and sampled every girl I could find.

983
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:10,056
<i>Author's message:</i>
Now I see that fulfilment does not come
from short, physical, random adventures,

984
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:15,573
<i>Author's message:</i>
But from a deep relationship which
is quite often under one's very nose.

985
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,931
I love you, love you, love you, love you.

986
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:22,416
- Pussycat.
- Let's make it early Monday.

987
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:29,733
- Oh, I've wasted so much time.
- I can't believe that I've finally caught you!

988
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,296
You have my word as an inveterate cheat.

989
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,774
I'm the happiest woman in the worid.

990
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,016
- Second happiest.
- Oh?

991
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,096
Your mother.

992
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:02,777
Renée? Hello, pussycat.

993
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,333
Um...

994
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,416
I can't make it.

995
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:13,054
I have an assignment somewhere else,
do you see? And it's an emergency.

996
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,056
Goodbye, pussycat.

997
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,175
Gradual disengagement.

998
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,579
Pussycat?

999
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,170
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

1000
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,770
Have fun.
You sure you're not meeting some dolly?

1001
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:36,371
Trust, my darling, trust. That's the basis
of any marriage. Do you want to come?

1002
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,129
No. I have too much to do
in view of recent developments.

1003
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,855
I'll be back tomorrow. If I'm not
back tomorrow, send for the police.

1004
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,893
If they're not back tomorrow,
send my clothes.

1005
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,772
I love you.

1006
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,652
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1007
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,213
Philippe? It's Renée.

1008
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:04,053
Listen, what about
that weekend we talked about?

1009
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:08,810
Yes, I'm suddenly free. And I have a
reservation for two at Chateau Chantelle.

1010
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,854
Hello?

1011
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,416
I wish to speak with Miss Lefebvre please.

1012
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,855
- Mademoiselle Lefebvre.
- Yes?

1013
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,019
Mademoiselle Lefebvre, there is
a Dr Fassbender on the telephone for you.

1014
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:27,294
Tell him I've gone to South America.
But I'm going to Chateau Chantelle.

1015
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,172
Oh, oh, yes.

1016
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,613
I understand. Of course, of course.
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.

1017
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,652
Anna!

1018
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,132
Anna!

1019
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:47,175
I have to go to Chateau Chantelle for the
weekend. There's an analyst's convention.

1020
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,098
But the convention was last week,
Fritz, at Arles.

1021
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,417
That was the Freudian convention,
this is the Jungian one.

1022
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,499
Anyway, didn't you tell me
you had a Women's Auxiliary singsong?

1023
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,214
But I wanted you to listen
to my lines and cue me.

1024
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,138
Cue yourself. What am I,
an automatic cueing machine?

1025
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,931
Get away from me! I hate you!

1026
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,770
I hate all of you. I'll kill you the next time
you come near me saying things like that.

1027
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,779
- Where are you going?
- I'm going away. Don't forget to wash.

1028
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,536
Bye.

1029
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,090
Ah, hello, Victor, you're late.
Rehearsal is over.

1030
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,417
How would you like to love
a very attractive short man?

1031
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,293
Certainly not. Bye.

1032
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,572
It's too bad because...
I have a sports car now.

1033
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,737
- You have what?
- A red sports car.

1034
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,169
- Oh, that's great.
- Wanna go for a drive?

1035
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,531
- I would love to. Come on, hurry.
- Where we gonna go?

1036
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,493
I know a nice little place
called Chateau Chantelle.

1037
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,333
- Yes?
- Michael...

1038
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,451
- Can I help you?
- Are you the maid?

1039
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,298
- In a way.
- Is Michael in?

1040
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:30,330
No. He is at Chateau Chantelle
for the weekend.

1041
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,928
Chateau Chantelle?

1042
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,096
May I ask...

1043
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,211
who are you?

1044
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,813
- I'm his fiancée.
- His what?

1045
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,490
I'm his fianc-ée.

1046
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,377
We're going away next week.
We're going to be married.

1047
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,252

1048
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,094
<i># Here I am</i>

1049
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,852
<i># Here I stay</i>

1050
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,698
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1051
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,058
- Might I ask where you came from?
- I fell from the sky!

1052
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:31,256
I'm a parachutist and I missed my mark.

1053
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:35,690
- Where are you going?
- Chateau Chantelle.

1054
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,859
- May I use your telephone?
- By all means.

1055
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,173
Usually I'm fantastic at hitting my target.

1056
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,497
<i>Bonjour?</i> My name is Michael James.

1057
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:16,815
- Oh, yes, sir.
- And I'm from <i>Chic.</i>

1058
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,809
Room La du Barry. Upstairs and all
the way down, the far end of the hall.

1059
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,534
I'd like this washed and pressed.

1060
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,299
No starch.

1061
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,809
- No starch.
- No starch.

1062
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,691
Fell out the sky, mate.

1063
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:40,859
Parachuting's a funny recreation for a girl.
Now, if you were a fella...

1064
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:52,499
I can understand pottery or flower
arrangement or needlework or knitting.

1065
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:56,249
It helps sublimate my sexual tensions.

1066
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:59,656
It's either that or promiscuity.

1067
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,735
Ah. La la-la.

1068
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,532
Make your phone call.

1069
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:07,131
I'm sure the club is anxious to know
the whereabouts of their little lost sheep.

1070
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,216
Geronimo.

1071
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,694
It's not fair.

1072
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,256
Can't I tell you about
my experience in free-falling?

1073
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:21,500
No, because I am here on a job and,
also, I'm going to marry the girl I love.

1074
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,772
So, put that away, powder your nose
and make your phone call

1075
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,336
and I shall go for a brisk six-mile trot.

1076
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:39,530
Please send up some champagne
and five dozen oysters.

1077
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:44,094
Philippe? Did you get the feeling
that we were followed on the road?

1078
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:47,656
- So what?
- We'll take two separate rooms.

1079
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,578
I'll meet you in yours. Prepare.

1080
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,089
- Michael!
- Hello.

1081
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,849
- What are you doing here?
- Me? Doing here... me...

1082
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:22,417
- Looking for you.
- But I thought you couldn't make it.

1083
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:26,089
Oh, I couldn't make it...
and then I could make it.

1084
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:31,817
And I, um, telephoned your house
and you weren't there... were you?

1085
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,053
No. I decided to come alone.

1086
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:40,937
That's exactly what I thought, and now
we can be together, uh, like we planned.

1087
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,931
Yes, we can. We can be together.

1088
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:49,099
Why don't I go up to my room, freshen up,
and we can meet here again for a drink.

1089
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,257
Right. And I'll freshen up
and we can meet in the bar

1090
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,133
all fresh and washed and rinsed.

1091
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,938
- In ten minutes?
- Roger and out.

1092
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,216
Oh, my God.

1093
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,570
- How many gallons?
- Five gallons.

1094
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:35,818
Do you know what's going on
at Chateau Chantelle?

1095
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,658
- Orgy.
- Orgy?

1096
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:39,054
Hey!

1097
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:45,012
My readers will be fascinated
to learn about this place.

1098
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,974
Now, all the rooms are
named after famous lovers?

1099
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,660
Is there any goings-on going on?

1100
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:56,171
I wouldn't mention any names but could
you tell me about your typical clientele?

1101
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,530
- My typical clientele?
- Typical clientele.

1102
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,572
All the people that are here now
are typical clientele.

1103
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,133
Really?

1104
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:08,095
There is a man cheating
on his wife in room Lola Montez.

1105
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,969
Oh.

1106
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:14,571
There is a woman cheating
on her two husbands in Carlota.

1107
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,977
Two lovers, of indeterminate sex,
in Reine Margot.

1108
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,853
And two men cheating in Don Juan.

1109
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,012
One might say that
the joint was, uh, jumping.

1110
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,608
Yes, sir. <i>Allô?</i>

1111
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:38,052
We make more money
in the off season than any other time.

1112
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:43,015
And now you, monsieur, with a woman
parachutist. For us, is the first time.

1113
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,449
Yes, but I'm as innocent
as a newborn babe.

1114
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,255
Etienne, the gentleman
in Marquis De Sade

1115
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:54,534
asks for 12 loaves of bread
and one Boy Scout's uniform.

1116
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,975
<i>Allô.</i>

1117
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:05,456
I want to speak with my wife. My wife.

1118
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,539
<i>Ma femme! Une femme,</i>
<i>ma femme! Oh! Ma femme!</i>

1119
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,089
<i>Ma femme!</i>

1120
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,895
Philippe? Oh! Michael!

1121
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,774
Oh, it's you!
I beg your body... Forgive me!

1122
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,688
My husband has followed me here.
If he catches me he'll cut your throat.

1123
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,254
My throat...? My... b...? Your what?

1124
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:06,009
My husband. I didn't bring it up
because I thought it would complicate...

1125
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,133
Listen. You must help me. My future
in-laws are here and they think I'm alone.

1126
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,855
And this lady fell from the sky
and she's gorgeous and you're gorgeous.

1127
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,529
And they'll tell Carole.
Cos her mother's a killer, she's a shark.

1128
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,936
We're getting married next week
and she's... nibbling my ear...

1129
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,016
Oh, my gawd.

1130
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,860
It's a shame.
But you must leave immediately!

1131
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,619
It's all right.
I'm due back at the asylum.

1132
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,015
- Oh! He's coming!
- Who's coming!

1133
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,290
- My husband! Quick, in the hamper!
- What?

1134
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,376
The hamper!

1135
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:23,376
- Are you all right?
- Of course.

1136
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:27,698
- Sorry about the way things turned out.
- 1955. A good year for brain concussions.

1137
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:32,689
I shall be cheerfully refunded if you'll
excuse my bellicose pomposity...

1138
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,019
I'm glad you're back, I think he's coming
to. Would you help me with my zipper?

1139
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,210
- My zipper!
- Oh, surely.

1140
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,173
Listen. I do not wish
to be involved in your marriages.

1141
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,576
If you're afraid...
Oh, look at the state... call the police.

1142
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,089
They have a very firm policy
towards murderers.

1143
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:04,896
Now, thank you, good night,
and all good things come to an end.

1144
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,976
What is going on?

1145
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,572
Michael!

1146
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,011
Michael, please come back.

1147
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,732
Oh! Oh, uh...

1148
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,532
- Herr Professor.
- Miss Lefebvre.

1149
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:23,491
What are you doing here?

1150
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,660
Guess what I've got on?

1151
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,931
- My hat.
- You're right.

1152
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,139
- And what else?
- I don't know.

1153
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,531
- Nothing.
- That's nice.

1154
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,779
Pussycat from the sky.

1155
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,538
I can't resist you.

1156
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,493
Don't resist me.

1157
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,576
Capitulate.

1158
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,334
- Please, let me in.
- No.

1159
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:13,099
- Please let me in, Miss Lefebvre.
- No.

1160
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,495
Let me in! Let me in! Or I'll scream!

1161
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,578
- I won't.
- What do you think I'm gonna do to you?

1162
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:22,056
You have a strange look in your eyes
and I'm late for an appointment.

1163
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,535
I only want to talk.
What's so awful in that?

1164
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:28,539
- Later. I've got to go someplace.
- No, now! I'm fed up with being put off!

1165
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,890
Argh!

1166
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,056
Shh.

1167
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,134
Five minutes of your time!

1168
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,573
One drink is all I ask. Otherwise I'll hold
my breath till the life goes out of my body!

1169
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,780
Doctor! Doctor!

1170
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:49,939
All right, then.
A quick, fast drink and I must really go.

1171
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,173
Try to think of me as a kindly old man
who has only your best interests at heart.

1172
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,449
All right.

1173
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:05,097
- Your oysters and champagne, <i>madame.</i>
- Oysters and champagne?

1174
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:08,257
- I thought you looked a little tired.
- Little tired?

1175
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:11,656
I'm out of my mind.
What am I doing here?

1176
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:14,374
I'm spoken for. I'm promised forth.

1177
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:20,450
Now, look! Don't open that bottle,
and close up those oysters and get out.

1178
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:24,218
- Come back to bed immediately.
- Now, look here.

1179
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:29,460
I've had a lot of experience fondling...
handling giris like you and it's got to stop.

1180
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,808
Oh!

1181
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:33,818
I'm going to try not to come back.

1182
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:41,330
Michael James, you were gravely tempted
and you came through it unspotted.

1183
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,694
I've been in there twice.

1184
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:00,330
Oh, Michael! There you are!

1185
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,655
I followed you up here and checked in.

1186
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,453
- How did you know I was here?
- Please don't hate me!

1187
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,495
Oh, no! I don't hate you.
Now, don't swallow anything!

1188
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:12,258
I'm so upset...

1189
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,258
Listen to me a minute.
I must pull myself together.

1190
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,690
- I'm fine. I'm rational.
- I want to do something terrible!

1191
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:23,018
I'm in a tight situation. I shall
behave in a mature and rational way.

1192
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:28,897
- Sometimes I wanna kill myself.
- First I shall gag you. Then I'll bind you.

1193
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,497
You're hurting me.

1194
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,259
My wife, the creature
that ate Europe, is here.

1195
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,133
- You're breaking my wrist!
- I'm a doctor, I'll fix it!

1196
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,296
Let me go!

1197
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:53,009
Fritz! Where are you?

1198
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,975
I am being chased by a maniac.
Could you help?

1199
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,898
- Quick! Get in the closet.
- In the closet.

1200
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,976
Thank you very much.

1201
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,819
Oh, Victor. I can't let you make love to me
with a person in the closet.

1202
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:40,694
Why, how many people
in the closet do you need?

1203
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,580
Please help me!

1204
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:54,538
- My wife is coming. I've got to hide!
- Quick, get in the closet!

1205
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,010
Argh! Help!

1206
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,574
That man was the maniac!

1207
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,249
A little misunderstanding, nothing more.

1208
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,018
Hey, that's some closet
you've got there.

1209
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,736
Fritz!

1210
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,739
Please, where is he now?
I've just been tied up.

1211
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,897
I know. There is a maniac loose.
Come with me.

1212
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,976
- Fritz!
- Argh!

1213
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,856
Let us in!

1214
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,091
Hello. The police?

1215
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,336
I need help.

1216
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:31,613
- The orgy's in here!
- We're the first ones!

1217
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,379
- What a lovely way to start.
- Hi! Wait for me!

1218
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,539
You are horrible people!
Get away from me! Michael!

1219
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:41,891
Wait! Wait! You! Stop!

1220
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:44,488
- Who is that woman?
- Is she dead?

1221
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:48,056
Dead? Sure, she's dead.
But she did not die in vain.

1222
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:53,732
Because of her, thousands of Frenchmen
will be free someday. For France I do this!

1223
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,339
Oh!

1224
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,815
Smoking is forbidden.

1225
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,656
Oh!

1226
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,778
You've got to help.
There are lots of dreadful men after me.

1227
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:15,579
This is no place for a working girl.
Come on!

1228
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,815
Goody goody!

1229
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:21,330
There's one in there. One in there.
Another one there. I'm off!

1230
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,738
- Michael! There you are!
- Hello, there.

1231
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:32,011
- Who is your fiancée?
- Welcome to Chateau Chantelle.

1232
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:36,497
A girl called. She said she was meeting
you here and she was your fiancée.

1233
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,453
That's absurd. You're my fiancée
and I don't know any...

1234
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:43,289
- Let's go to your room and have a talk.
- My room?

1235
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:46,093
How about a nice drive in the country?
It's so pretty.

1236
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:49,815
I've been driving all day.
I want to sit down and speak to you.

1237
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:52,500
Let's go into the bar.
We can have a nice drink.

1238
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:56,408
I'd like to do it in private because
I may have to scream and throw things.

1239
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:00,135
- I feel we should be alone for that.
- Oh, a sense of humour.

1240
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,970
Michael! I've been looking all over for you!
You're the only one that can help me.

1241
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,056
- Our Father...
- Who is that woman?

1242
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,535
Never mind who I am,
but you're in great danger.

1243
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,730
Never mind? I demand an explanation!

1244
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:16,172
- Don't lose your temper!
- I will... lose... it!

1245
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,734
Calm yourself.

1246
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:22,091
Listen. In the first place,
I haven't got another fiancée.

1247
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:26,498
In the second place,
you don't trust me in the first place.

1248
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,936
Fritz!

1249
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:36,969
Before you use that spear, may I explain
that what you see is merely an illusión.

1250
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,456
- An illusión?
- An illusión! Shut the door, count three.

1251
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:44,971
Four if you like, but close the door
and you'll see it's just an illusión.

1252
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,456
One. Two. Three.

1253
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:50,650
Foiled by a cheap cinematic trick.

1254
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:55,774
- If you insist, you can see my room.
- You've got some tall explaining to do.

1255
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,778
I have never seen
that woman before in my life.

1256
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,175
I thought you were here
for a quiet bit of work.

1257
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,939
Of course I am. It's a charming little spot.

1258
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,733
- No one ever comes here.
- How much work have you done?

1259
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:09,420
- I've only just got here!
- Can I see your room?

1260
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,816
Certainly. It's over there.
It's a perfectly ordinary room.

1261
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,896
- Is it?
- Listen, pussycat.

1262
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,739
- I don't think so.
- Listen! It is!

1263
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,454
I won't spend my whole life
waiting around for you.

1264
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,536
Nothing like a hard day's work, huh?

1265
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:31,094
Look. I came here alone.
This crowd showed up.

1266
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:35,611
It's been a tremendous mistake.
I know, because I made it.

1267
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:40,414
Oh, Michael, darling.
Please... don't let them take me.

1268
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:44,897
A perfect stranger.
Lucky guess about the name.

1269
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,092
Oh, Michael. Everybody's insane.
Take me away from this place.

1270
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:51,337
- Who is that woman?
- She's only 12 and she's an orphan.

1271
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:55,453
- Once a year I take her out.
- Help me! They're after me! I did nothing.

1272
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,458
Put that in the shower!

1273
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,492
- Here I am, you French hunk of pie...
- Stay back!

1274
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,339
Stick it in the tub
and drown it, you twit!

1275
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,020
Not in here, you fool. I'm hiding.

1276
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,098
Oh, Michael! This hotel
has the strangest people.

1277
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,337
- Why did you abandon me?
- She has a PhD.

1278
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,416
- In what?
-

1279
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:19,656
You fool. Just when I was
trying to give up smoking.

1280
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:26,694
- Oh, Michael. What a pleasant surprise.
- My compliments to the chef.

1281
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,489
- Who are you?
- I'm delighted.

1282
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,456
I kill him! I kill everybody!

1283
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:53,571
You don't understand.
There are people in here trying to sleep.

1284
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:59,175
- Who is that thing?
- That is no thing, this is my wife.

1285
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,258
- This is a personal friend of James Bond.
- How dare you!

1286
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:06,817
Listen, pussycat. I do assure you. Take all
the pussycats, stand them all in a row...

1287
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:11,855
- Who are these people?
...you stand above them like a mountain...

1288
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,414
- Carole!
- Mother, Dad! Come over here.

1289
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,895
- Did you set the date yet?
- We're about to.

1290
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,614
What's the matter, dear? You look sick.

1291
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,374
The police!

1292
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,894
Oy vey.

1293
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:51,773
Anna! Up the front.

1294
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,576
Form up, everyone.

1295
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:02,575
Charge!

1296
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:27,129
There lies our only conceivable
way of escape. To it, pell-mell!

1297
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:52,137
Away you go!

1298
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,610
- Hey!
- Aaah!

1299
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,492
Carole!

1300
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,939
Michael James,
upon this solemn occasión,

1301
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:01,132
do you take this woman
to be your lawful married wife?

1302
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,898
I do.

1303
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:05,329
Do you, Carole Hildegarde Werner,

1304
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,896
take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

1305
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:11,295
I do.

1306
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,490
Best man, have you the ring?

1307
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:17,016
I do.

1308
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,370
We live in perilous times.

1309
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,458
Look after it, it belongs to my wife.

1310
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:38,415
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1311
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:49,890
- <i>Merci, Monsieur le maire.</i>
- <i>Madame.</i>

1312
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,376
Thank you for everything you did for him.

1313
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:03,890
Well, Mayor, there's gratitude for you.
You raise a patient, treat him like a son,

1314
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:07,649
slave all day over a hot analyst's couch.
What do you get in return?

1315
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:10,010
They don't even invite you
on the honeymoon.

1316
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,013
What is your full name, please?

1317
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:19,418
Michael Voltaire James, pussycat.

1318
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:22,816
And yours, <i>madame?</i>

1319
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:26,455
- Carole Hildegarde Werner.
- Were you snapping then?

1320
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:30,368
- Why did you call her pussycat?
- I was being courteous. I was being civil.

1321
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,094
We're married 30 seconds
and you look at other women.

1322
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:36,895
She was talking to me. I looked in
the direction the sound was coming from.

1323
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,659
- You can go on the honeymoon alone.
- Darling...

1324
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:44,499
I'm the witness, also the best man.

1325
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,054
My name is Fritz Wolfgang...

1326
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,650
Sigismund... Fassbender.

1327
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:53,374
What's the matter, darling?
You look worried.

1328
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:56,094
I can't spell Sigismund.

1329
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:01,812
I think you have a little sexual block
over the spelling of that naughty name.

1330
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:04,738
Allow me to help you.
I'm a psychoanalyst.

1331
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:10,571
Oh, Michael, you didn't change at all. All
this good doctor's work has been in vain.

1332
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:15,658
Perhaps I haven't lost a son.
Maybe I've gained another patient.

1333
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:17,771
Now, look...

1334
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,255
<i># Pussycat, pussycat, you're so thrilling</i>

1335
