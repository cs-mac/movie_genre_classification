1
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,822
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

2
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:52,080
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt.

3
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:54,623
Well, thanks, sara.
I like your CHiPs T-shirt.

4
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,057
-Thanks.
-Fun party, huh?

5
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:59,788
Yeah. Except for Arnie shankman
being here.

6
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,127
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

7
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,996
I feel bad for him with his sister
losing her mind and all.

8
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:11,400
Whatever.

9
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,740
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.

10
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,311
-You want to?
-Sure.

11
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:20,246
Okay, I'll go first. Truth or dare?

12
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:21,774
Truth.

13
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,250
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

14
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,014
-Well, l...
-Family doesn't count.

15
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:30,160
-Maybe I'll take dare.
-Okay.

16
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:32,326
I dare you to kiss me.

17
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:34,490
Right here?

18
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,466
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

19
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:08,162
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank,
butt-lick?

20
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,403
-David Buznik.
-I just landed in St. Louis.

21
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,107
-I hope you wrote my speech.
-I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

22
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,285
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to st. Louis.

23
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,217
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip...

24
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,517
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

25
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:39,458
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

26
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,620
Terrific.

27
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:43,892
-He hung up on you again, didn't he?
-Yes. Yes, he did.

28
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:47,730
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the Husky Cat clothing line.

29
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,704
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

30
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,901
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so....

31
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,241
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

32
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:59,542
I know. I'll figure something out.

33
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,846
I gotta go. Sorry.

34
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:05,922
I'm gonna miss you.

35
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,754
That guy's looking at us.

36
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,589
You know I don't like it when people
watch me kiss.

37
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:12,889
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:15,427
Take care.

39
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,628
Okay. Bye.

40
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:21,427
Dave....

41
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,775
-Have a good flight.
-Okay.

42
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:35,778
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:45,962
I think you're in my seat.

44
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:50,461
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

45
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:53,896
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

46
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:57,041
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

47
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:02,836
Excuse me. This seat's available.

48
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:08,408
Okay. Thank you.

49
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,177
You're very welcome.

50
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,787
No air.

51
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,351
That's too bad, huh?

52
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,038
You're on my side of the armrest.

53
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,371
We're not gonna have problems,
are we?

54
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:36,035
No.

55
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,081
I'm wetting my Jockeys here.

56
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,147
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

57
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,156
I mean, you like comedies?

58
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:26,730
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some....

59
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,563
Look at this actress here.

60
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:40,408
What is your position
on breast implants?

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,269
This guy.

62
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,973
I can just watch the movie with you.

63
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,107
Excuse me.

64
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,481
-Could I get a headset?
-Certainly.

65
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:51,880
Thank you.

66
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:59,361
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

67
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,864
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.

68
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,094
Miss?

69
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,336
I'll be right there, sir.

70
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,233
Where's your headset?

71
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:15,778
She's busy right now, but it's coming.

72
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:20,680
For crying out loud. You're missing
important plot points.

73
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:25,215
Ma'am?

74
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,481
Could you give me a second, sir?

75
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,196
Excuse me.

76
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,731
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

77
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:45,501
-Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
-I wasn't raising my voice.

78
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:46,734
Just calm down.

79
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,776
I am calm. I just want my headset.

80
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,574
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

81
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,273
If you won't cooperate...

82
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:56,510
I don't know where a headset
ties into patriotism.

83
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:58,711
Is there a problem here, sir?

84
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,951
I don't think so.

85
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,094
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

86
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:06,355
A talk about what? There's not a
problem.

87
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,159
-The stewardess just keeps...
-Flight attendant.

88
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,731
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when...

89
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:12,927
Calm down.

90
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,072
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

91
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,868
"You people"?

92
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,640
Now wait a minute.

93
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,404
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

94
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,412
I will not tolerate any racist
behavior on the plane.

95
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:26,743
This is a difficult time
for our country.

96
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

97
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:33,349
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

98
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:34,582
I'm calm!

99
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,566
All rise.

100
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:49,736
-What do you think?
-Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

101
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:56,403
Mr. Buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

102
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:58,307
...I find you guilty.

103
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:03,982
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

104
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,315
Thank God you're okay.

105
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,323
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

106
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:13,590
...this court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

107
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,424
Anger management?

108
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:30,612
Oh, my goodness. Bobby Knight.

109
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,781
-You're in this group?
-Oh, yeah. This is my first day.

110
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:37,409
-It's my first day also.
-I hope this class cures me.

111
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,249
Working on the anger problem?

112
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:42,657
Anger? Isn't this
sexaholics Anonymous?

113
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:47,053
No. I think that's down the hall.

114
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,394
Well, the hell with this!
I'm going home!

115
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:15,086
Dr. Rydell?

116
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,689
You don't remember me, do you?

117
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:25,363
-I sat next to you on the plane.
-Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

118
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,628
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you too.

119
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,034
That was a crazy flight.

120
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,836
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

121
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:35,171
Really?

122
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,846
Wow.

123
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,539
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

124
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:42,709
...and tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

125
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:46,947
I can't just sign your papers.

126
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,319
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that.

127
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,188
All right.

128
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:54,993
How's this?

129
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,599
Just hang for one session...

130
00:09:56,767 --> 00:10:00,362
...so I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

131
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:03,530
-Then I'll sign your papers.
-Okay.

132
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:07,603
-shall we?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

133
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:07,945
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

134
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:11,745
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

135
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,180
And I was like, you know,
"Don't go there."

136
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:18,115
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

137
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:22,020
And I said, "Look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

138
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,626
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

139
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,196
...and then I just blacked out.

140
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,526
I blacked out.

141
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,295
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

142
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:38,204
"l told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

143
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:42,342
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

144
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:45,239
Not as well as I could've.

145
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:50,683
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

146
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,353
Now, Fury Fighters, let's say hello
to someone...

147
00:10:56,527 --> 00:11:00,691
...who's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

148
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,958
-Dave.
-Hi, Dave.

149
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,123
Hi.

150
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:08,498
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

151
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:10,265
...and he's feeling much better.

152
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:16,313
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

153
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,505
...because I'm only here
for one session.

154
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:22,949
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

155
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:26,519
-Nice.
-I bet you beat her good.

156
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:30,154
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

157
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,352
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a woman beater.

158
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,397
You can't admit it because you're
a piece of garbage.

159
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:39,969
I don't know about all that,
but now I understand why you're here.

160
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:44,036
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbor.

161
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,676
And I took a dump on his porch.

162
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:50,605
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

163
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,408
You're superior. He's superior.

164
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,576
-Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
-You're not ready. Hear what he said?

165
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:59,255
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

166
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:02,256
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

167
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:06,226
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

168
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:07,830
We always do.

169
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,401
-Come on, Dave. Join us.
-Okay.

170
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:17,335
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

171
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:18,668
And we're lovers.

172
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,812
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy Melo...

173
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,039
-...which was cool, it was in the script.
-Sure.

174
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,707
And then I asked Melo
back to the house with us...

175
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:31,321
...which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

176
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,212
Variety's good.

177
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:36,017
So anyway, in the middle
of our session...

178
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:39,162
...I look up and I see Gina
kissing Melo on the mouth...

179
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,891
...which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

180
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,399
-stacy bit my toe off.
-Then Melo freaks out...

181
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:49,103
-...and calls me a crazy skank.
-Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

182
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:51,468
-so I stapled his lips shut.
-Here we are.

183
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:55,668
Well, we've all been there.

184
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,915
-I like him.
-Yeah, he's funny.

185
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:01,549
Not as funny as you.

186
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,683
I like that.

187
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:11,216
-All right, girls.
-Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

188
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:12,684
Walk it off.

189
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,529
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

190
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:23,195
Don't worry, Dr. B, it's just a regular
season game. Not important.

191
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,103
He missed the lay-up!

192
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:28,574
See? Iverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, sixers lose.

193
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,213
Who gives a crap, huh?

194
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,645
I mean, it's just a silly game, anyways.

195
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:40,380
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

196
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,315
You gotta dunk that shit!

197
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,654
You gotta dunk that shit!

198
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:46,694
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

199
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,829
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

200
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,229
Goosfraba.

201
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,267
Goos blah blah.

202
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,928
Not "blah blah," Nate.

203
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,639
Goosfraba.

204
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,403
Goosfraba.

205
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,308
That's good. Slower.

206
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,211
Goosfraba.

207
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,544
How do you feel?

208
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,142
Better.

209
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:14,413
Good job, Nate.

210
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,254
That sound is a derivation
of an old Eskimo word...

211
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,794
...that mothers used to calm
their children.

212
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,023
-I see.
-Eskimos seem nice.

213
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,997
-They do.
-I think Eskimos are smug.

214
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:26,602
Hold that thought, Chuck.

215
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:28,796
So, Dave...

216
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:30,806
...tell us about yourself.

217
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:31,964
Who are you?

218
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:35,344
Well, I am an executive assistant...

219
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,844
...at a major pet products company.

220
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:42,983
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

221
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,088
All right.

222
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,287
I'm a pretty good guy.

223
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,352
I like playing tennis on occasion....

224
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,792
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

225
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,489
Tell us who you are.

226
00:14:57,768 --> 00:14:59,133
I just....

227
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:04,501
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

228
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:05,801
What did you say?

229
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,277
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

230
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,209
No, I just....

231
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,452
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

232
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,881
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

233
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,426
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

234
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:26,927
I want to know...

235
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,859
-...who you are.
-What the hell do you want me to say?

236
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:39,631
I mean, I'm sorry. I just....
I want to answer your question.

237
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,904
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

238
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,880
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

239
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:49,986
-Let's move on.
-Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

240
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,315
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

241
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:56,084
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little spanish fruit topping.

242
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:59,126
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

243
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,931
What are you laughing at, Dave?

244
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:09,768
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

245
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,137
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

246
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,476
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

247
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,215
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

248
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,443
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

249
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,345
Then we'll see who's laughing.

250
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:28,958
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

251
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:33,390
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

252
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:39,165
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

253
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,567
-so he's laughing at you.
-I'm not laughing at him.

254
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,043
Goosfraba.

255
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,151
-Goosfraba.
-Okay.

256
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:59,948
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

257
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,160
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

258
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,593
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

259
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,526
I haven't been to the Actors studio
in quite some time.

260
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,598
-I'm sure your audition will go well.
-Thanks. I hope so.

261
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:11,962
-Good night.
-All right.

262
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:13,398
-Thanks, Buddy.
-Bye-bye.

263
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,765
That was a little bit insane.

264
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,203
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

265
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,365
Here you go.

266
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:23,512
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

267
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:24,939
I agree.

268
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:28,674
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

269
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:30,514
What do you mean?

270
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,245
Let me explain something.

271
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:36,218
There are two kinds of angry people:
Explosive and implosive.

272
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,427
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

273
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,462
...for not taking their coupons.

274
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:47,396
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

275
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:51,062
...and finally shoots everyone
in the store.

276
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,833
You're the cashier.

277
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,945
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialing 911, I swear.

278
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,240
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...

279
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,942
...to help calm you down
when you're losing it.

280
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,209
Chuck.

281
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:07,218
Not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight,
or the porno girls.

282
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:09,188
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

283
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:10,983
-Yes.
-Here's my number.

284
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,720
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

285
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,793
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to Geraldo Rivera.

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,558
-I see.
-My bad. Here.

287
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:21,134
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

288
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,701
Dave and Chuck...

289
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:30,175
...working together as a team.

290
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:34,878
-It's a win-win situation.
-Yeah, feels it.

291
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,883
Dave's particulars.

292
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:38,944
I'll see you soon.

293
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,724
The Yanks are great this season.

294
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,333
Dave thinks they could beat seattle's
win record.

295
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,901
Remember at Brown when we
saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?

296
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,902
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.

297
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:58,233
We could've been too.

298
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:01,707
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

299
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,973
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet
anyone as good as you.

300
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:07,842
You will. She'll be a very lucky lady.

301
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,612
Thanks for being my best friend.

302
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:13,683
Linda.

303
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,018
-Hey, Dave.
-Andrew.

304
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,784
Good to see you guys hugging.

305
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,563
How was the doctor?

306
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:22,731
Psychotic.

307
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:26,527
Well, did you get any good
promotion news from Mr. Head?

308
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:29,638
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

309
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,971
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

310
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:38,274
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just Brown alumni.

311
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:40,780
Where'd you go to college again?

312
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,646
Trenton Community College.

313
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:48,052
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

314
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:49,951
Later, Andrew.

315
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,288
... once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

316
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:56,398
...it'll help you to create a realistic
and a erratic....

317
00:19:58,902 --> 00:19:59,994
Hey, Dave.

318
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:03,900
-Hey. Andrew, what's up?
-Not much.

319
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,674
You always try to simulate live bait.

320
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,404
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

321
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:13,776
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

322
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:16,348
Be aware of your presentation...

323
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,251
...and make sure that,
as you work it along....

324
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:21,750
Oh, yeah.

325
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:25,993
Congratulations.

326
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,859
Now that is a big one, folks.

327
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,703
Always a blast being with your friends.

328
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,340
It was a great night.

329
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,499
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

330
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,837
Yeah, you like those foot-long
hot dogs, don't you?

331
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:49,782
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal.

332
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,619
Saw his...

333
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,484
-...thing.
-You were looking?

334
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:56,454
Yeah, unfortunately.

335
00:20:56,693 --> 00:21:01,187
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

336
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,089
What are you talking about?

337
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:07,670
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it used to scare you?

338
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:08,827
I never saw it.

339
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:10,831
You never saw it?

340
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:14,600
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?

341
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,008
No. No. No. No.

342
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:20,672
It's actually quite petite.

343
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,885
I felt bad for him.

344
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:26,720
It looked like it belonged on a baby
and it had a funny color.

345
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,552
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

346
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:32,728
Like, "What the hell's that thing?"

347
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:36,229
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

348
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,201
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 1 8.

349
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,973
-Which isn't bad.
-You're doing really good.

350
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,472
Thanks.

351
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:53,047
-Who's that?
-I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

352
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:57,879
-Hello?
-Dave, it's me, Chuck.

353
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,618
-Who's Chuck?
-Your anger ally.

354
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,656
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

355
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:04,258
A very bad mood.

356
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,955
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more Fudgeicles.

357
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:10,897
-What's an anger ally?
-Who's that?

358
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:12,292
She making fun of me?

359
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:15,598
No. That's my girlfriend.

360
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:19,902
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

361
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:22,308
We're a little busy right now.

362
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:24,571
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

363
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:28,406
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

364
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:41,462
After I got kicked out of the Army,
I went through a real bad time:

365
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:46,193
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

366
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,370
Finally, my parents said l
had to move out.

367
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:53,438
I'm guessing that's when you decided
to shack up with your aunt.

368
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:55,741
Don't get cute, wiseass!

369
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,470
But, yes.

370
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:01,174
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

371
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:06,220
We ordered the drinks 1 5 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

372
00:23:06,923 --> 00:23:08,390
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

373
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:11,390
Is this slow And stupid Waitress Day?

374
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,654
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

375
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,295
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

376
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:20,368
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

377
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,559
Settle.

378
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:26,198
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.

379
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:31,379
Wake up to the sound
of kids screaming.

380
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,545
Explosions everywhere.

381
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:36,750
Never know when your number's up.

382
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:38,682
Vietnam, huh?

383
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,790
-Grenada, man.
-Grenada?

384
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,891
Wasn't that like 1 2 hours long?

385
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,689
Did you see that?

386
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:55,968
-see what?
-That guy. He just gave me a look.

387
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:58,971
He didn't give you a look.

388
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:03,145
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-semitic remark.

389
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:05,609
Are you Jewish?

390
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:09,548
I could be. But, no. Half lrish,
half ltalian, half Mexican.

391
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,279
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

392
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:16,449
Well, the guy on the left is blind,
Chuck.

393
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:18,455
I hear you.

394
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:19,884
He's yours.

395
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,060
No. That's not what I was saying.

396
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,624
-Hey.
-What the hell?

397
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,462
Got something against guys
with hair?

398
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:27,625
What's going on?

399
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,436
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

400
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:37,739
Stop! Goosfraba!

401
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:38,903
You piece of shit!

402
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,824
Stop it! Stop it!

403
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,263
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

404
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:58,562
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

405
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:02,627
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

406
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,932
Flight attendant, Your Honor.

407
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:08,234
I didn't hit her on purpose,
Your Honor.

408
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:10,470
I was being attacked by someone...

409
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,274
...and while I was
trying to take away his....

410
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:14,916
His....

411
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:17,780
Trying to take away my cane,
Your Honor.

412
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,087
You cracked a waitress in the face...

413
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,954
...while attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

414
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:29,125
Your Honor, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

415
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:37,666
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

416
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:40,101
Happy now, ass-wipe?

417
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:43,708
Mr. Buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

418
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:45,608
Maybe you don't know either...

419
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:50,809
...but I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

420
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:53,488
-isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
-No!

421
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:55,146
Okay.

422
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:02,291
-May I approach, Your Honor?
-By all means, Dr. Rydell.

423
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:03,489
Thank you.

424
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:15,137
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

425
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,974
-You look marvelous, Brenda.
-Thank you.

426
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,843
-And how are the boys?
-Fantastic.

427
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:22,917
James made the basketball team,
Raheem landed the lead...

428
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:24,576
...in Fiddler on the Roof.

429
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:28,349
Raheem will make
a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.

430
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,893
So do you have a take
on this Buznik guy?

431
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:34,825
Is this good or bad?

432
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:37,992
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

433
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:39,828
...but it's good that....

434
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:43,833
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

435
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:47,732
-You think you can help him?
-I think so, Your Honor.

436
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:53,005
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

437
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:01,881
Mr. Buznik...

438
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:05,550
...because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

439
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:08,698
...I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management program...

440
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,196
...for 30 days.

441
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,627
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his program...

442
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:17,739
...you will spend the next year
in state prison.

443
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:33,512
-Buddy?
-Good evening. Ready to get it on?

444
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,317
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

445
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:36,925
Well, well, well.

446
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,458
The lair of the rage rhino.

447
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:41,597
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

448
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,993
-Where should we put my stuff?
-What stuff?

449
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,892
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

450
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:49,663
My approach dictates
intense observation.

451
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:52,739
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

452
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:55,637
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

453
00:27:55,845 --> 00:28:01,078
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

454
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:02,477
Sit down, Dave.

455
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,821
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

456
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:09,284
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

457
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,824
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

458
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:15,089
...is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

459
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,323
...in your behavior.

460
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:18,625
Now we can do it here
or Rikers island.

461
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:21,133
-Anything else, Dr. B?
-No thanks, Dan.

462
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:23,669
We'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.

463
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:24,862
Wiretaps?

464
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:27,542
-ls this your CD collection?
-Yes.

465
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,707
Oh, my.

466
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,172
What are you doing?

467
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:36,546
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

468
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,517
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean....

469
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,180
Don't be naive, Dave.

470
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:44,516
"Close to You."
"We've Only Just Begun."

471
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:47,458
songs of madness and obsession.

472
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:50,461
Who's going to pay for that?

473
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:55,627
Retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

474
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,837
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.

475
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,036
Good.

476
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:04,874
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

477
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:09,810
My girlfriend got me that.

478
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:14,952
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

479
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,558
...and vulgar hand gestures.

480
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,490
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances...

481
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:23,393
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine...

482
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,194
...slippy-Flippies, Jelly stingers,
Trick sticks...

483
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:28,166
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.

484
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:31,067
-How about Fiddle Faddles?
-Under my supervision.

485
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,271
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

486
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:37,902
...please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

487
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:41,743
...depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

488
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:45,409
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

489
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,556
...and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

490
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,624
...at how much fun we can have.

491
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:54,162
Jeez, without slippy-Flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

492
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,528
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

493
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,300
Dave, I got this for you.

494
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,063
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

495
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:07,072
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

496
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:10,608
I'm feeling very angry right now...

497
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,874
...because I only have one bed
and no couch.

498
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,448
Not a problem.

499
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:23,223
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

500
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,893
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

501
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:30,563
By the way....

502
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:38,399
I like to sleep in the nude.

503
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,571
You hear that frog?

504
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,269
Nope.

505
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:37,121
What do you want?

506
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,131
I'm just recording your demeanor
upon awakening.

507
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:44,306
Good to see you got your underwear
back on.

508
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,066
6:30?

509
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,174
I don't gotta be up till 7.

510
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,141
You've got to make my breakfast.

511
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:54,477
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

512
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:58,385
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

513
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,920
...wheat toast, dry, and please...

514
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,751
...tell me you've got ketchup.

515
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:05,017
There's a Denny's down the street.

516
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:06,593
Not only do they have ketchup...

517
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,323
...but they got the angriest waitresses
I've seen.

518
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:12,832
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

519
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,193
Lame-o.

520
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:37,484
Your eggs.

521
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:50,032
-Holy shit!
-I said over easy!!

522
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:56,776
Now, why did I do that?

523
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,372
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

524
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:06,119
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

525
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:08,952
Alpha-Bits.

526
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:13,491
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

527
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,257
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

528
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

529
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:23,235
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

530
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,241
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'll,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

531
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:31,937
Well, I have to join you at work.

532
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,410
Full contact.

533
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,442
That will make me look nuts, Buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

534
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,951
...you whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

535
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:44,182
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

536
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:45,952
It's not a weakness.

537
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,698
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

538
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,960
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed.

539
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:57,129
The Talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

540
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:00,132
...there's something to be seen."

541
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,307
Look, Dave.

542
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,491
-What exactly was that all about?
-What?

543
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,323
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

544
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:25,331
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

545
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:26,924
Flustered?

546
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,974
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

547
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:37,144
-Holy shit! What are you doing?
-I need you to unfluster.

548
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,911
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

549
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,450
We will proceed when you
are centered.

550
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,984
I'm centered, I'm centered.

551
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:47,987
There's 1 0,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

552
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:53,220
What is that? Is that good?

553
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,221
We're going to sing a song.

554
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:59,499
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to.... I've gotta go.

555
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:00,828
Here we go.

556
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:04,734
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and stephen sondheim's...

557
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:07,535
... West Side Story.

558
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,770
"l Feel Pretty."

559
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:14,179
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

560
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,910
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

561
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:18,581
Wow. Sorry.

562
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:18,145
Move your ass, dipshit!

563
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,118
Burn in hell!

564
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:46,568
Yes!

565
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:52,314
You feel stunning.

566
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,312
And entrancing.

567
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:14,432
You're late.

568
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:18,073
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie up on the bridge.

569
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:21,233
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

570
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,846
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

571
00:37:25,014 --> 00:37:26,242
May I interject?

572
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:30,074
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

573
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:32,244
We mustn't absorb and repress.

574
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:36,221
-Who's this?
-I'm his anger management therapist.

575
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,657
You're in anger management?

576
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,596
Temporarily, yeah.

577
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:45,992
Do you remember the flight
to st. Louis...

578
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:49,467
...that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

579
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,437
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

580
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,098
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

581
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:56,541
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

582
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:01,740
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

583
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:06,411
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

584
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:09,251
You said your apartment caught fire.

585
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,622
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

586
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:17,391
Might I have your first name,
Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.

587
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,797
-It's Frank.
-Fran.

588
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:24,801
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

589
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:27,233
What went on on that flight?

590
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,578
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I....

591
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:33,179
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

592
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,840
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

593
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:39,317
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

594
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,183
-I didn't.
-You broke her nose.

595
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:43,416
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

596
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:47,522
I mean, I accidentally did that.

597
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:49,722
Dave, you have a disease.

598
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:53,665
Would you apologize if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

599
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:57,932
Why do you feel you have to apologize
because you're suffering from T.A.s.?

600
00:38:59,008 --> 00:38:59,997
T.A.s.?

601
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:01,871
Toxic Anger syndrome.

602
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:04,711
I don't have T.A.s.

603
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,008
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

604
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:09,708
His name is Frank!

605
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:16,290
No. I'm sorry.

606
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:31,231
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

607
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:35,070
...but there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

608
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:38,179
...who might feel a little
self-conscious...

609
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:40,440
...about how they look
in certain outfits.

610
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:43,881
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

611
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:46,886
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

612
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:51,049
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...

613
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:53,559
...and away goes the chin.

614
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:55,458
I'm so handsome.

615
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:02,434
-Hey, Dave. This is your office?
-Andrew.

616
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:05,199
-What are you doing here?
-I played golf with Frank.

617
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:08,873
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

618
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:12,070
Really? I've been wanting to play golf
with him a long time.

619
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:14,216
-ls it awesome there?
-It's nice.

620
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:22,251
So, anyway, Dave, how's
anger management going?

621
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,624
Who told you about that?

622
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:27,388
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

623
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:31,192
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

624
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:34,267
No. I mean, I like to consider myself
her best friend...

625
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:39,271
...but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

626
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:42,570
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

627
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,137
I gotta go. Bye.

628
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:51,651
Well, well, well.

629
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:54,184
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

630
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,483
Really? I didn't notice that.

631
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,317
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

632
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,057
...who looks as though he could satisfy
a blue whale?

633
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:07,559
Well, it's....
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

634
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,371
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

635
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:13,400
What's up?

636
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:17,471
-This is your young lady?
-That's my Linda.

637
00:41:17,646 --> 00:41:19,739
My, oh, my.

638
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:24,252
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

639
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,786
...because of the kitty-cat clothes,
so forth.

640
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,950
What does she do?

641
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:33,326
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

642
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:35,493
I love poetry.

643
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:40,330
Oh, my, my, my. It's....

644
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:43,498
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

645
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:50,508
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

646
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,510
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

647
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:55,241
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

648
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:56,441
Or a genius.

649
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:02,080
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
Audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

650
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,816
...I'll arrange a hearing.

651
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:08,159
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

652
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,433
Hi, Nancy.

653
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,506
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

654
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:24,273
Sorry. I just heard you guys
got cleaner seats than us.

655
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,939
Not after I get through with them.

656
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:34,179
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

657
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:38,417
-I've been very patient with you.
-Beware the fury of the patient man.

658
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:41,188
-I'm serious!
-Too serious.

659
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:42,887
Get undressed.

660
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:45,126
What did you say?

661
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:47,627
Take off your clothes.

662
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:50,363
I've got a stress-reduction technique
to show you.

663
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:53,474
-It'll be good for you.
-Take off my clothes?

664
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,872
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?

665
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,975
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

666
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:05,314
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

667
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:09,289
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

668
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:24,734
-What's up, baby?
-Why are we here?

669
00:43:24,907 --> 00:43:26,272
I'm not a homophobe.

670
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:29,206
My lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.

671
00:43:29,378 --> 00:43:31,869
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

672
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:34,373
Looking for company, baby?

673
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,381
No. We're not. Thank you.

674
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:38,213
It's worth 50 bucks...

675
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:43,154
...if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

676
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:45,054
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.

677
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:48,891
Oh, boy, here we go.

678
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:54,561
-Hello.
-Hey. Good to see you.

679
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:58,630
-What's your name, baby?
-Melvin.

680
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,401
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

681
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,978
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

682
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:08,480
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.

683
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:09,981
Great.

684
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:13,383
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

685
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:14,647
Brooklyn.

686
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:18,217
What part of Germany
do you hail from?

687
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:22,990
I'm from a little Bavarian village
called Lickin Zee Dickin.

688
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:24,189
Care to visit?

689
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,864
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

690
00:44:29,038 --> 00:44:31,438
...in Girls Without Wieners-ville.

691
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,774
I'm more comfortable there.

692
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:39,106
He's just not used to male intimacy.

693
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:42,578
Well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.

694
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,284
Oops, no, I'm not.

695
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:45,477
Whoa! There it is.

696
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:49,220
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

697
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,015
Oh, my God.

698
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:55,290
What does this have to do
with anger management?

699
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:59,059
-Oh, are you an angry boy?
-No.

700
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:00,792
Do you need some discipline?

701
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:02,197
No, thank you very...

702
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,464
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

703
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:07,972
Listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!

704
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:11,271
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

705
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,938
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

706
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:16,710
Your services are no longer required.

707
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,382
You know what?

708
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:21,483
You guys are freaks.

709
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:25,784
Give me the tape recorder.

710
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:29,557
Come on.

711
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,734
Patient number 1 35, David Buznik...

712
00:45:34,903 --> 00:45:38,669
...has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

713
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:43,369
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my program.

714
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,979
Great. Can I go throw up now?

715
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,784
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

716
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:56,686
-Whoa, there it is.
-I feel like dancing.

717
00:45:56,925 --> 00:46:00,088
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John...

718
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:04,096
...if she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

719
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:06,928
But Buddy didn't order you
to have sex.

720
00:46:07,102 --> 00:46:08,933
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.

721
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,769
-Hello?
-Is Buddy there?

722
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:14,601
No, he's in the shower right now.

723
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,437
This is Becky, his assistant.

724
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:18,773
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

725
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:21,973
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

726
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:27,350
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
County Hospital for the next two days.

727
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:43,831
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

728
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:46,201
...and brushing my teeth
at the same time.

729
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,774
It looks really good.

730
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:52,903
What's the matter?

731
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:56,877
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, Buddy.

732
00:46:57,486 --> 00:46:58,953
What's wrong with my mother?

733
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:02,022
She's having surgery.

734
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,249
I'm sorry.

735
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:07,088
-ls it serious?
-When is surgery not serious?

736
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,795
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

737
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:12,933
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

738
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:16,093
...see what's going on up there.

739
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:19,729
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

740
00:47:20,108 --> 00:47:23,043
Spend some quality time. I'll stay here.

741
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:24,839
It'll be good for you guys.

742
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:26,446
Oh, God.

743
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,217
You're all I got, Mom.
Please don't leave me.

744
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:43,694
No more clam chowder.

745
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:47,123
Buddy...

746
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,792
...it was a joke.

747
00:47:49,404 --> 00:47:51,998
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

748
00:47:53,976 --> 00:47:55,910
-A joke?
-Yeah.

749
00:47:56,144 --> 00:47:57,736
Oh, boy.

750
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,676
A joke. A jo... l....

751
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:03,215
I can't believe that I fell for that one.

752
00:48:05,387 --> 00:48:08,117
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

753
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,025
I'm going to get you back for that one.

754
00:48:16,064 --> 00:48:19,227
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

755
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,265
I thought you said you were joking.

756
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:26,600
No, the serious part was the joke.

757
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:30,141
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

758
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,480
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

759
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:37,846
...see what's really going on up there.

760
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,615
Why don't you... ? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

761
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:46,816
What?

762
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:50,824
-I can't believe he's making me go.
-How come you guys aren't flying?

763
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:55,060
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

764
00:48:55,237 --> 00:48:57,933
Meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass
about that catalog.

765
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:00,870
I've got to get it done with nut-boy
in Boston.

766
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:03,100
Why can't Head write his own catalog?

767
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:05,712
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

768
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,782
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his...

769
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,852
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

770
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,114
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

771
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,453
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any Jelly stingers.

772
00:49:18,627 --> 00:49:20,595
Well, that's going to be tough!

773
00:49:31,306 --> 00:49:33,365
Oh, God. There he is.

774
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,476
-That's him?
-Yes.

775
00:49:38,547 --> 00:49:41,141
What? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

776
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,539
My...

777
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:44,379
The quiet warmth

778
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:49,286
Smoldering beneath the rituals
Of hope for familiarity

779
00:49:49,558 --> 00:49:52,254
A coursing underground river

780
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:55,794
Pregnant with the chance currents
Of knowledge and love

781
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:59,297
-What?
-That's my poem! I wrote that.

782
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:00,730
I know.

783
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:03,234
That is your poem. I love that poem.

784
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:05,999
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

785
00:50:06,174 --> 00:50:08,267
...on the floor of David's bedroom.

786
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:14,072
-shades of early Emily Dickinson.
-Who was great on Police Woman.

787
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:18,752
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

788
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:22,418
I think I better get going.

789
00:50:23,425 --> 00:50:26,724
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

790
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:28,760
-How about a kiss?
-I'd love a kiss.

791
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,694
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

792
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:34,267
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

793
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:35,528
Got it.

794
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:38,468
Thank you. And, take care.

795
00:50:38,707 --> 00:50:40,766
Have a great trip, you guys.

796
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:42,204
Oh, we will.

797
00:50:42,377 --> 00:50:43,639
Bye.

798
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:50,909
What?

799
00:50:51,086 --> 00:50:54,419
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

800
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:56,090
Good. Then we can't go.

801
00:50:56,258 --> 00:50:57,816
No, I can get out.

802
00:50:58,093 --> 00:51:00,960
-Get in.
-I don't know how you'll get out.

803
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:05,160
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

804
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:11,665
What's he doing?

805
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:23,311
Well, you're batting a thousand...

806
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,247
...in craziness.

807
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,987
Now we're bumping into cars.

808
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:32,820
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

809
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:34,962
If I had lost my temper...

810
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,462
...would I have had
the presence of mind...

811
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:40,601
...to leave my card
and my insurance information?

812
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:44,364
Whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-
A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-...

813
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,063
...While-swinging-The-Bat Guy.

814
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:56,447
I think you've got room to back up.

815
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:11,995
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

816
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:13,566
Think you can do better?

817
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:16,966
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

818
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:20,165
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

819
00:52:20,342 --> 00:52:21,832
Procrastination, Dave.

820
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,443
I'm not procrastinating.

821
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:26,046
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

822
00:52:26,214 --> 00:52:29,809
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.

823
00:52:29,985 --> 00:52:33,819
What's your plan,
ask her at a Yankee game?

824
00:52:35,056 --> 00:52:36,921
Actually, yes. How did you know?

825
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:39,424
I said the corniest thing
I could think of.

826
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:42,597
If you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

827
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:45,460
Putting up a "Marry me, please"
on the scoreboard...

828
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:48,967
...proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

829
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:53,732
As you seem to have noticed, I'm
a little bit jumpy with public affection.

830
00:52:54,476 --> 00:52:56,944
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

831
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:01,042
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

832
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,934
A five-hour trip to find out Mommy
had a jelly bean...

833
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:22,194
...removed from her nose.

834
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,770
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

835
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:45,059
You could have her, you know.

836
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:50,125
I'm sure she'd love to hang out
with a goofy secretary...

837
00:53:50,298 --> 00:53:52,858
...whose only talent
is nostril wiggling.

838
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:55,967
-Girls love that.
-Dave...

839
00:53:56,137 --> 00:54:00,005
...you've got a lot more going for you
than wiggly nostrils.

840
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,972
I want you to go over there
and ask that woman out.

841
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:04,873
No, I got a girlfriend.

842
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:10,217
I'm not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.

843
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:13,354
Flirting is cheating's ugly cousin,
Buddy.

844
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:15,249
I'm not a cheater.

845
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,117
Is it cheating if you're passed around
the cell block like a peace pipe?

846
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:24,459
Because that is what's on the docket
for you if you don't go and ask her out.

847
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:25,827
Okay, Dave?

848
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:27,995
Oh, God.

849
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,068
That's my boy.

850
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,371
Excuse me.

851
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:45,247
I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink. I see that you have a drink...

852
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,787
...but I could get you another
when you're through with that one.

853
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:51,992
Bite me.

854
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:56,055
Nice meeting you. Okay.

855
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:02,695
Can you guess why she rejected you?

856
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:07,137
She wanted to be like the 2000 other
girls who said that to me growing up?

857
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,869
No. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.

858
00:55:10,378 --> 00:55:14,041
Confidence is the key
to winning a young lady's attention.

859
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,884
Now, listen to me very carefully.

860
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:19,646
-Approach Miss Thing again.
-No.

861
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:20,912
With confidence.

862
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:23,216
And if she says no this time...

863
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,724
...I will admit that I am a failure
as a therapist...

864
00:55:26,895 --> 00:55:29,056
...and release you from my program.

865
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:31,594
You'll release me from your program?

866
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:43,309
Just go over there
and repeat the following...

867
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:45,209
...verbatim:

868
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:47,981
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

869
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:51,516
...but it's difficult for me
to express myself...

870
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:55,645
...when I'm on the verge of exploding
in my pants.

871
00:55:59,728 --> 00:56:01,958
-Get out of here.
-Trust me, Dave.

872
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:05,698
If you are calm as well as witty,
she will respond.

873
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:09,268
Witty went out the window with
the pants explosion thing, thanks.

874
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:11,704
My offer stands.

875
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:18,145
So if I repeat that crazy shit...

876
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:22,474
...you probably stole from
a porno flick, you sick bastard...

877
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:24,748
...and get rejected...

878
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:26,977
...you'll release me from the program?

879
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:28,644
Exactly.

880
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:30,882
Here we go.

881
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:35,820
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.

882
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:05,949
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

883
00:57:07,295 --> 00:57:12,631
...but it's difficult for me...

884
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:17,266
...to express myself...

885
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:33,911
...when I am on the verge...

886
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:39,756
...of exploding in my pants.

887
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:46,225
You are too cute.

888
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:48,401
Get the fuck out of here.

889
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,130
-I'm Kendra.
-I'm Dave.

890
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:54,602
Let me buy you a drink.

891
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:57,942
Can I get a cosmopolitan?

892
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:08,316
I couldn't take it anymore...

893
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:11,822
...so finally I just tell my boss:

894
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,087
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you,
I'll squeeze your head."

895
00:58:16,598 --> 00:58:20,432
-I didn't say that, but I should have.
-You are so funny.

896
00:58:20,635 --> 00:58:23,604
Too bad you're leaving town.
We could have fun together.

897
00:58:24,973 --> 00:58:27,635
Unfortunately, I am leaving
in the morning.

898
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,141
In fact, I think I gotta get back
to my friend.

899
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:39,477
What's the matter?

900
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:42,983
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What's wrong?

901
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:45,056
My friend took off on me.

902
00:58:45,293 --> 00:58:47,124
I can give you a ride.

903
00:58:47,395 --> 00:58:49,226
I don't even know where the guy lives.

904
00:58:49,397 --> 00:58:52,423
We can hang out at my place until you
get in touch with him.

905
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,536
I bet there's like 50 Rydells in here.

906
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:05,110
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.

907
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:07,040
What? You're not fat.

908
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:09,979
My clothes hide it, but I'm
getting gooey right here.

909
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,684
I don't see any goo.

910
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,411
You want to see goo,
I'll show you my ass.

911
00:59:14,756 --> 00:59:17,657
Well, I see it,
and I didn't five years ago.

912
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:20,692
I went out with this guy,
and he wouldn't sleep with me.

913
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:24,855
And I asked him why, and he said that
when he saw me without my clothes...

914
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,462
...that I look like a porker.

915
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:31,264
He was probably just nervous
because you're beautiful and....

916
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:34,632
Anyways, you're not a porker.
You're the un-porker.

917
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:36,674
You're sizzlean.

918
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:43,006
-You're so sweet, Dave.
-Well, you're sweet, Kendra.

919
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:47,244
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.

920
00:59:47,522 --> 00:59:48,921
Rose.

921
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:53,258
Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.

922
00:59:53,428 --> 00:59:55,623
Rose Rydell! I got it!

923
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:01,257
Kendra...

924
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:05,533
...even though I'd love to see you
take that bra off...

925
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:10,073
...because it represents a team
I've hated my entire life...

926
01:00:10,478 --> 01:00:12,537
...I think you gotta keep it on.

927
01:00:12,714 --> 01:00:13,806
Why?

928
01:00:14,716 --> 01:00:17,116
Because I got a girlfriend.

929
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:21,881
I'm not a child, Dave.

930
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,423
If you think I'm a porker, then just
come right out and say it.

931
01:00:25,627 --> 01:00:27,322
No. I don't think you're a porker.

932
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:30,293
Then why when the idea of sleeping
with me comes up...

933
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,763
...do you all of a sudden
have a "girlfriend"?

934
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:35,494
Because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.

935
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,570
Said the liar to the beached whale!

936
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,172
You're not a beached whale.

937
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,706
If anything, you could even
gain a few pounds.

938
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,210
So now I'm too skinny for you?

939
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,777
No. I didn't mean that.

940
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:49,973
-ls this what you want, Dave?
-No.

941
01:00:50,218 --> 01:00:51,776
If I put on a few pounds...

942
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:55,753
...will you be able to stifle your vomit
long enough to have sex with me?!

943
01:00:56,124 --> 01:00:57,455
Holy shit.

944
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:01,025
Are you such a hot stud
that you'll break me in two?!

945
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:04,426
You're angry right now. Wanna sing?
Do you know "l Feel Pretty"?

946
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,931
-Get out! Get out!
-Stop!

947
01:01:08,169 --> 01:01:09,295
Get out!

948
01:01:09,504 --> 01:01:11,267
Get out!!

949
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:13,171
Porker!

950
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:14,363
Fatty!

951
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,200
No!!

952
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,717
How did it go, pal?

953
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:34,986
-Why'd you ditch me?
-What are you talking about?

954
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:36,721
You gave me the signal.

955
01:01:36,998 --> 01:01:39,023
I didn't give you the signal to leave.

956
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,795
I gave you the signal to say your
gross pickup line actually worked.

957
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,904
Well, of course it did.

958
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:48,742
So did Little Davey need
some anger management?

959
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,276
-That chick was killer.
-Serial killer.

960
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:53,914
She tried to chocolate me to death.

961
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:56,141
Anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.

962
01:01:57,185 --> 01:02:00,621
-speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
-Oh, yeah?

963
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:04,187
She seemed a little bit
bent out of shape.

964
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:07,725
-About what?
-Your being out with another woman.

965
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:10,955
-How would she know that?
-I told her.

966
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:13,464
-What else could I do?
-What else could you do?

967
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:18,128
You could've told her something else.
I was at the bank. I was at the store.

968
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:21,241
I ate bad guacamole
and I couldn't stop shitting!

969
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,240
Any of those would have been fine!

970
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:26,475
Well, I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't lie
for my patients.

971
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:30,174
You want to leave your friend and
run off and chase some hot babe...

972
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,419
...you can't expect me to cover for you.

973
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:35,249
I did what you told me to do,
you sick, demented man.

974
01:02:38,893 --> 01:02:40,383
What are you laughing at?

975
01:02:41,462 --> 01:02:42,952
What's so funny?

976
01:02:44,632 --> 01:02:49,399
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine,
an actress. Pretty good one too.

977
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:54,064
I arranged for her to be in the bar
and for you to pick her up.

978
01:02:57,912 --> 01:02:59,174
You were messing with me?

979
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:02,077
Yeah. You know, just a joke
between friends...

980
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,617
...like the one you pulled on me
about my dying mother.

981
01:03:05,787 --> 01:03:08,085
I told you I'd get you back for that.

982
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,279
All right.

983
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:16,023
So you really didn't talk to Linda.

984
01:03:16,397 --> 01:03:19,798
Of course I did.
That's what made it so funny.

985
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:24,000
Where's your phone?

986
01:03:24,238 --> 01:03:28,470
She's not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.

987
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:31,244
She doesn't know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?

988
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:36,109
Yeah, that's it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.

989
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,841
"The testicle with legs." Great!!

990
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,649
Now wait a minute. Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.

991
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:45,759
Maybe just hum a little "l Feel Pretty."

992
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:49,485
No!! How about you hum
the "I'm a Crazy Asshole" song?

993
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:52,394
And take me home, you
psychotic piece of wacko.

994
01:03:53,301 --> 01:03:55,792
I never thought you'd take it like this.

995
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:10,342
So, what, we're not going to talk at all?

996
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,116
Would you forgive me if I told you
I called Linda last night...

997
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:20,952
...after our little fracas
and explained that it was my fault?

998
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:22,318
What did she say?

999
01:04:22,563 --> 01:04:27,830
Well, she's not mad at you anymore,
but she let me have it pretty good.

1000
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:30,128
You deserved it. I did nothing wrong.

1001
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:31,965
I know. I know.

1002
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:34,797
Friends?

1003
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:40,539
-Take a little nap.
-I am tired.

1004
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:42,546
Well, you had a rough night.

1005
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,888
Stop with the cupcake!

1006
01:04:59,367 --> 01:05:02,336
Rise and shine, sir snoozola.

1007
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,138
What's going on? Where are we?

1008
01:05:05,306 --> 01:05:08,104
Well, at a great deal of expense
and effort...

1009
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:11,871
...we have managed to locate
your grade school bête noire...

1010
01:05:12,046 --> 01:05:13,035
...Arnie shankman.

1011
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:16,411
We do desire a confrontation with him,
do we not?

1012
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:20,415
What? Do you mean the kid
who bullied me in fifth grade?

1013
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:24,581
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you
to confront your childhood nemesis.

1014
01:05:24,926 --> 01:05:28,453
Remember, for 22 more days,
you are mine.

1015
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:32,061
This is where Arnie shankman lives?

1016
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,364
You're kidding me. You're going to
make me confront a monk.

1017
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,868
Great.

1018
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:50,615
Are you ashamed that you
never stood up to him?

1019
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:52,616
No. He was just a kid lashing out...

1020
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:55,312
...because his sister got sent
to an insane asylum.

1021
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:58,049
I'm surprised your research
didn't tell you that.

1022
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,559
This doesn't look like him.

1023
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:05,724
Excuse me, Arnie shankman?

1024
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:09,630
Sorry about waking you up.

1025
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:12,804
My name is Pana Kamanana...

1026
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:16,435
...but, yes, I was once known
as Arnie shankman.

1027
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:17,971
Arnie....

1028
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,636
Pana Kamanana...

1029
01:06:21,082 --> 01:06:23,277
...Dave Buznik
from elementary school.

1030
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,686
David Buznik.

1031
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:29,957
This is the last place I thought
I'd find you, a monastery.

1032
01:06:30,124 --> 01:06:33,719
You could say I've gone through
a rather dramatic transformation.

1033
01:06:33,894 --> 01:06:36,124
Could you excuse him for a second,
Peanuts?

1034
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:40,395
His name's not Peanuts.
It's Pana Manapia.

1035
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:44,004
You want me to fight a monk?
He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

1036
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:47,607
For Pete's sake, this is the monk
that twisted your tits!

1037
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:50,209
Confront him or you're going to prison!

1038
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:52,969
All right. All right. All right.

1039
01:06:58,586 --> 01:07:01,749
Anyways, what I wanted to say to you
was...

1040
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:06,287
...when we were kids, you kind of
bullied me around a little bit...

1041
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:10,863
...and I never really did anything
to deserve that kind of treatment.

1042
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,566
Of course not. I was a real cretin then.

1043
01:07:13,801 --> 01:07:16,201
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.

1044
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,635
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.

1045
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:22,637
You pulled my gym shorts down
in front of sara Plowman.

1046
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:26,805
That actually was pretty funny.

1047
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,475
Jeez, I don't think that it was.

1048
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:32,914
Now, come, David.
Humor is the spice of life.

1049
01:07:33,154 --> 01:07:35,122
The look on your face was priceless.

1050
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:38,181
"Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!"

1051
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,888
so Pena likes the spicy humor.

1052
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:46,089
Maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper
you told me about the great Buddha.

1053
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:47,825
What did you say about Buddha?

1054
01:07:48,002 --> 01:07:51,631
Dave said, "How does a guy
who weighs over 600 pounds...

1055
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,934
...have the balls to teach people
about self-discipline?"

1056
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,941
Let's not make fun of my God, here.

1057
01:07:58,112 --> 01:08:01,673
You know what else Dave finds
particularly piquant?

1058
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:05,477
Recalling your nut-job sister
struggling with her underpants...

1059
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:06,711
...in a straitjacket.

1060
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:08,218
You think that's funny?

1061
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,482
Dave used to con her
into getting naked...

1062
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:13,422
...by saying that her clothes
had ghosts in them.

1063
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,822
That never happened.

1064
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:17,088
Then he'd pull out his winkie
and tell her...

1065
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,926
...it was a strawberry ice-cream cone.

1066
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:23,731
Is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1067
01:08:23,904 --> 01:08:26,771
Did you expose yourself...

1068
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:28,268
...to my sister?

1069
01:08:30,244 --> 01:08:34,578
-And don't shove me again.
-It's shower-room humiliation again.

1070
01:08:34,748 --> 01:08:38,240
He's giving you a wet willie and
making you chew on his jockstrap...

1071
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,353
...and fart blossom and all this.

1072
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:45,492
Answer me, Buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?

1073
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:49,252
Over and over again.

1074
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,600
And she moaned like a wildebeest.

1075
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:55,735
Wildebeest.

1076
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:00,907
Whoo! Now, that felt good!

1077
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:03,168
I wasn't expecting that
from a Buddhist.

1078
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:07,970
-I'm a little pissed off right now.
-You all right? You're all right.

1079
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,547
David! David! No, David!

1080
01:09:15,723 --> 01:09:17,350
Easy, boy!

1081
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:18,890
Sorry.

1082
01:09:19,994 --> 01:09:21,154
Help me, brother.

1083
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:23,922
-Help me.
-Okay. Come on. Come on.

1084
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:26,893
Okay, we're even. We're even now.

1085
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:29,693
-I went crazy. I'm so sorry.
-I started it.

1086
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,394
-I started it.
-It's all right.

1087
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:33,335
And I'm gonna finish it!

1088
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:36,576
Now we're even, butt-lick!

1089
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:38,935
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

1090
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:42,844
"What's that, Auntie Em?
It's a twister!"

1091
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:44,641
My nipples!

1092
01:09:44,818 --> 01:09:47,446
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.

1093
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:50,021
I got Casper in my clothes!

1094
01:09:52,193 --> 01:09:54,525
-Pretty good.
-Thanks, baby.

1095
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:55,684
I'll kill you!

1096
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,564
You want that rake?

1097
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:01,360
You can't get that rake from me!

1098
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:03,002
Look, everybody!

1099
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,138
Pana Banana's got a heinie.

1100
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,636
-He's got a heinie!
-I give!

1101
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:09,503
-I give!
-All right. I'm sorry.

1102
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,141
-Friends?
-You suck!

1103
01:10:16,217 --> 01:10:17,206
Shankman!

1104
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,875
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

1105
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:22,180
-I've seen enough.
-Hold it right there.

1106
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:24,586
This party's by invitation only.

1107
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:30,759
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

1108
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:39,128
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1109
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,372
Hold it back there! Come on, come on.

1110
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:48,606
Start the car!

1111
01:10:48,782 --> 01:10:50,875
Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!

1112
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:53,144
Now! Now! Now! Now!

1113
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,287
Oh, boy!

1114
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:03,293
We were like Butch and sundance!

1115
01:11:03,464 --> 01:11:06,922
Oh, my God! I thought you
were going to shoot somebody!

1116
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:14,065
You really threw me some curves
back there, kid.

1117
01:11:14,241 --> 01:11:16,971
I never expected it to go that way.

1118
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:20,141
But you kicked some serious
monk ass there, baby.

1119
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:22,009
You're damn right, baby!

1120
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:25,741
-How did it feel?
-I feel good! I feel incredible!

1121
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:30,082
I feel bad about molesting his sister
all those times, but it's all right!

1122
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:34,860
-You really molested a crazy girl?
-No. Got you.

1123
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:40,598
Congratulations, keed,
you've reached level three.

1124
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:47,503
I would never have done anything
with that girl.

1125
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:52,203
Don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained
everything to me, and I get it.

1126
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:57,442
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting
fact about me being a procrastinator...

1127
01:11:57,618 --> 01:12:00,849
...and I was going to wait
for a Yankee game to do this...

1128
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:02,215
...but....

1129
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:06,449
I don't know. I.... It's something
I wanted to say to you...

1130
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,391
...and I'm having a hard time saying it
for some reason. But....

1131
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:16,794
It's just that monks, they talk shit...

1132
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,767
...but they can't back it up.

1133
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:24,444
That's what was so hard
to say to me?

1134
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:34,487
You know, when I was on the phone
with Buddy, he gave me some advice.

1135
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:38,591
That's great.
His advice is a little cuckoo...

1136
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:40,726
...but somehow it works.

1137
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:44,057
Well, then I guess I'll just do
what he suggested.

1138
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:50,704
I don't think that we should
see each other for a while.

1139
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:55,770
Buddy thinks that a trial separation
will ultimately...

1140
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,005
...strengthen our relationship.

1141
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,146
Now, Fury Fighters...

1142
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:10,552
...what keys do we need to possess
before we can...?

1143
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:12,089
Dave. You're late.

1144
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:15,194
-Can I talk to you alone, please?
-Sure you can...

1145
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:27,202
You told Linda we should have
a trial separation?

1146
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:28,705
-Yes.
-Yes?!

1147
01:13:28,942 --> 01:13:30,068
Yes!

1148
01:13:30,344 --> 01:13:33,973
Separating from Linda
is a crucial part of our strategy.

1149
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,378
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.

1150
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:39,813
All right. Strictly as a friend.

1151
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:43,050
Linda's been thinking about
leaving you for some time.

1152
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:46,890
She loves you, but she
recognizes you're a neurotic mess.

1153
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:48,150
You're jealous...

1154
01:13:48,328 --> 01:13:52,526
...self-loathing, resentful, insecure
and a premature ejaculator.

1155
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,130
She told you I was
a premature ejaculator?

1156
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:56,667
That part I was assuming.

1157
01:13:57,304 --> 01:13:59,602
I haven't done that in,
like, eight months.

1158
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:05,234
Anyway, a trial separation will make
you both gain a deeper appreciation...

1159
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:07,572
...for David Buznik.

1160
01:14:08,148 --> 01:14:12,244
After she dates a couple of losers,
she'll be begging you to take her back.

1161
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:21,527
So I've been thinking about it,
Linda...

1162
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:26,323
...and a trial separation is exactly
what we need.

1163
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:29,593
And if you want to start seeing...

1164
01:14:29,837 --> 01:14:32,533
...other penises... People...

1165
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,070
...I want you to feel free.

1166
01:14:37,277 --> 01:14:39,245
You sound upset. Are you all right?

1167
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:46,417
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.

1168
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,520
And don't hold back, okay?

1169
01:14:48,755 --> 01:14:52,919
Because there's a lot of nice guys
out there and I'm cool with it.

1170
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:54,684
I'll be strong.

1171
01:14:58,065 --> 01:15:01,159
So the guy asked me for change.
I laughed. He cursed.

1172
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:02,393
I whizzed on him.

1173
01:15:03,036 --> 01:15:06,233
-What else could I do, huh?
-You should've tossed a rock at him.

1174
01:15:06,473 --> 01:15:09,704
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

1175
01:15:09,943 --> 01:15:11,706
Let him be. Set your anger free.

1176
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:16,114
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. B.

1177
01:15:16,283 --> 01:15:18,217
-We all have.
-Hey, fellas.

1178
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:20,878
Could you bring it down a little bit?

1179
01:15:21,054 --> 01:15:23,887
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

1180
01:15:24,057 --> 01:15:26,821
-This is a free country!
-What's going on with you?!

1181
01:15:27,094 --> 01:15:29,255
-Are you crazy?!
-Go in! Just go in.

1182
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:33,266
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!

1183
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:36,493
Goosfraba.

1184
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,295
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

1185
01:15:39,506 --> 01:15:41,804
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.

1186
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:44,637
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

1187
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:49,271
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

1188
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:52,917
Those are her keys to my apartment.

1189
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:55,316
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

1190
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,318
-Why?
-I heard her on her cell phone...

1191
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:00,187
...talking to a guy...

1192
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:03,959
-...making a date.
-I'm so sorry, Dave.

1193
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:05,797
Andrew.

1194
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:07,227
I'll kill that guy.

1195
01:16:08,802 --> 01:16:12,135
She ain't cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

1196
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:15,798
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

1197
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:17,365
Sorry.

1198
01:16:17,644 --> 01:16:20,408
She's meeting the Andrew at Mort's
on 86th street now...

1199
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:21,843
...if you want to go watch.

1200
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,182
No. No, I can't do that.

1201
01:16:31,825 --> 01:16:32,814
We're here.

1202
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:36,590
-Both of you showed up?
-You like stacy better or something?

1203
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:40,927
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

1204
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:43,262
...so I really only needed
one of you guys.

1205
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:45,437
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

1206
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:48,766
-so do you know the guy she's with?
-I think I might.

1207
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:50,239
Let me ask you something.

1208
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:54,608
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

1209
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:59,115
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

1210
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:02,153
This is where Gina and l
always get into a heated debate.

1211
01:17:02,322 --> 01:17:04,153
I like them when they're really big.

1212
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:07,020
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

1213
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:15,500
Good evening.

1214
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:17,796
Table for three?

1215
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:20,838
-May we take your coats?
-No. We're okay.

1216
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,340
The girls are gonna
take their coats off.

1217
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,671
Would you like a boobs... ? Booth?

1218
01:17:29,282 --> 01:17:33,480
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

1219
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,622
-sure. Right this way.
-Thank you.

1220
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:42,385
Oh, my God. It's stacy and Gina.

1221
01:17:42,562 --> 01:17:43,961
Who?

1222
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:45,655
Nobody.

1223
01:17:45,866 --> 01:17:48,096
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

1224
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:49,925
Yummy. Yummy.

1225
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:53,763
-Let's get wasted tonight.
-Definitely.

1226
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:57,103
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.

1227
01:17:59,312 --> 01:18:01,212
What?

1228
01:18:03,216 --> 01:18:04,911
I can't believe this.

1229
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:06,416
Excuse me.

1230
01:18:06,586 --> 01:18:11,250
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

1231
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:13,892
I guess not. Are those your friends?

1232
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:17,827
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

1233
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:25,827
Gina, can you stop sucking
on stacy's finger for one second?

1234
01:18:26,006 --> 01:18:28,167
I want to introduce you to somebody.

1235
01:18:28,742 --> 01:18:32,075
-stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
-Nice to meet you.

1236
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:35,007
And I'd like you to meet my date.

1237
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:38,346
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.

1238
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:41,615
-Look, Dave, it's Buddy.
-I see.

1239
01:18:41,788 --> 01:18:44,723
-You know stacy and Gina?
-Yes, yes, I do.

1240
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:47,621
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury Fighters!

1241
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,823
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your Rémy, Linda.

1242
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,966
This is a bit awkward.

1243
01:18:54,134 --> 01:18:55,692
I mean, group members...

1244
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:58,303
...are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

1245
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:01,407
-Yeah! I agree with that.
-You know that.

1246
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:04,669
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

1247
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:08,576
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

1248
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:10,410
Of course. Excuse me...

1249
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:12,976
What?

1250
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,422
-Two of the usual, Duke.
-Coming right up, Dr. B.

1251
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:20,458
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

1252
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,588
What are you saying?

1253
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,993
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

1254
01:19:25,165 --> 01:19:27,793
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

1255
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:30,333
My job is trying to prevent
Mr. Andrew...

1256
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:33,439
...from unleashing the Whopper
with Cheese.

1257
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,636
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

1258
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:39,506
...Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

1259
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,272
...trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.

1260
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,317
-How would you know?
-You think I only tapped your phone?

1261
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,987
What was she saying?

1262
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:51,954
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

1263
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,958
Now the situation is contained.

1264
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,119
You and I control the game.

1265
01:19:57,364 --> 01:19:58,353
How?

1266
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:01,865
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

1267
01:20:02,035 --> 01:20:05,971
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

1268
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:09,139
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

1269
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:12,972
...then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

1270
01:20:16,883 --> 01:20:20,319
-You swear to me this will work?
-The ball's already up in the air.

1271
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:23,487
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

1272
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:27,149
Very strong. Come on.

1273
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:30,023
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

1274
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:35,066
That's 25 dollars, pal.

1275
01:20:35,302 --> 01:20:36,997
We don't....

1276
01:21:11,104 --> 01:21:12,935
Where were you? It's 1 :00.

1277
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:17,303
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

1278
01:21:17,477 --> 01:21:19,604
-Better be good. Give it to me.
-Okay.

1279
01:21:19,779 --> 01:21:22,839
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus...

1280
01:21:23,016 --> 01:21:25,576
The bus? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

1281
01:21:25,752 --> 01:21:27,379
I was way too smashed to drive.

1282
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:32,787
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

1283
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,350
Okay. I like that.

1284
01:21:35,528 --> 01:21:37,689
So we get to her house...

1285
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:41,194
...we have some kind of a weird
argument...

1286
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:44,701
...about the number of syllables
in a haiku.

1287
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:46,236
Poetry garbage.

1288
01:21:46,506 --> 01:21:49,805
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

1289
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:53,677
Now, you say you kissed?

1290
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,542
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

1291
01:21:56,716 --> 01:21:58,206
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1292
01:21:58,451 --> 01:22:00,942
You're having this horrible evening.

1293
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:04,557
-How do you end up kissing, again?
-I wish I knew, keed.

1294
01:22:04,724 --> 01:22:07,318
We were both pretty geezed up.

1295
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,394
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

1296
01:22:11,631 --> 01:22:13,963
...and then just a quick
1 0-second kiss.

1297
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:16,602
I thought that you said five seconds.

1298
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,431
First it was a five-second one...

1299
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:21,972
...and then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

1300
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:25,107
She's cute.
And then a 1 0-second Frencher.

1301
01:22:26,246 --> 01:22:30,478
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

1302
01:22:32,185 --> 01:22:35,018
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

1303
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:38,052
Dr. B, let it bip.

1304
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:40,818
Well, hello.

1305
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:44,993
I shouldn't really talk right now.

1306
01:22:45,665 --> 01:22:48,327
Well, I suppose you're right.

1307
01:22:49,736 --> 01:22:51,567
It's got to be done.

1308
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,401
Who was that? Linda?

1309
01:22:58,578 --> 01:23:02,674
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

1310
01:23:02,849 --> 01:23:04,680
First, the good news.

1311
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:07,513
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

1312
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:09,917
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

1313
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:14,583
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

1314
01:23:14,761 --> 01:23:16,194
Pretty hard too.

1315
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:19,589
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

1316
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:21,597
I didn't intend for this to happen.

1317
01:23:21,768 --> 01:23:24,532
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just...

1318
01:23:24,704 --> 01:23:26,262
Wait a minute.

1319
01:23:30,377 --> 01:23:32,311
I figured this out.

1320
01:23:39,285 --> 01:23:40,718
You're messing with me.

1321
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:43,116
I wish I were, Dave.

1322
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:48,458
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

1323
01:23:48,628 --> 01:23:53,565
...because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

1324
01:23:54,134 --> 01:23:56,967
Is it all right if I date your ex?

1325
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,966
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

1326
01:24:03,143 --> 01:24:05,805
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

1327
01:24:05,979 --> 01:24:09,380
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

1328
01:24:09,549 --> 01:24:13,508
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks
from today for attempted murder.

1329
01:24:13,686 --> 01:24:17,452
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

1330
01:24:17,624 --> 01:24:20,957
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

1331
01:24:21,127 --> 01:24:23,493
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

1332
01:24:23,663 --> 01:24:25,392
Court is adjourned.

1333
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,146
Coming, Peaches.

1334
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,456
Are you kidding me?

1335
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:05,261
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog
for my Fat Cat clothing line?

1336
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:06,905
I said I'd have it by 3.

1337
01:25:08,508 --> 01:25:10,738
-Okay.
-Get in gear.

1338
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,813
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1339
01:25:15,982 --> 01:25:18,644
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

1340
01:25:18,818 --> 01:25:21,912
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

1341
01:25:22,188 --> 01:25:23,621
Don't worry about him.

1342
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,691
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

1343
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,158
It's good stuff.

1344
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:37,903
That's a good picture, I think.

1345
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:41,070
What the hell is this?!

1346
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:44,301
You keep telling everybody you
created the Husky Cat line.

1347
01:25:44,544 --> 01:25:46,978
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

1348
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,445
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

1349
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:52,244
If friends come over, I want them
to feel comfortable.

1350
01:25:52,418 --> 01:25:53,476
What office?

1351
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:58,022
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

1352
01:25:59,926 --> 01:26:02,895
-You gave him the job that I wanted?
-He earned it.

1353
01:26:03,062 --> 01:26:05,530
Why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

1354
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:08,562
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

1355
01:26:08,735 --> 01:26:11,226
She dumped you 1 5 years ago.
Get over it.

1356
01:26:11,404 --> 01:26:12,803
I wouldn't worry about me.

1357
01:26:12,972 --> 01:26:16,169
It's your pal Buddy who's taking her
to the Yankee game tonight.

1358
01:26:16,943 --> 01:26:18,376
Yankee game.

1359
01:26:19,646 --> 01:26:21,807
Did he steal my proposal idea?

1360
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:25,110
Buznik, your behavior
is unacceptable.

1361
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:28,150
Unacceptable?

1362
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:33,815
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

1363
01:26:33,993 --> 01:26:36,120
When a good position
actually opens up...

1364
01:26:36,362 --> 01:26:38,762
...you give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

1365
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:42,868
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

1366
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:46,899
Now, when I started here...

1367
01:26:47,106 --> 01:26:50,075
...I was promised advancement
opportunities.

1368
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:53,404
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

1369
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:58,309
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

1370
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:02,783
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

1371
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:07,723
...I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

1372
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:10,692
-Okay.
-Great.

1373
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:13,024
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.

1374
01:27:15,668 --> 01:27:19,229
By the way, his name is not
Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...

1375
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:22,067
...and he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

1376
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:31,916
-You starting to get excited?
-Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

1377
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:33,746
This is going to be some night.

1378
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:38,318
Come on. Come on.

1379
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:51,364
-Dr. B, how's it going?
-Very well, thank you.

1380
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:54,031
Always a thrill. Right this way.

1381
01:27:57,176 --> 01:27:59,337
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

1382
01:28:00,647 --> 01:28:01,739
Whoa! Watch it, man!

1383
01:28:01,914 --> 01:28:02,081
Your attention, please.

1384
01:28:02,082 --> 01:28:03,514
Your attention, please.

1385
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:05,514
Before tonight's National Anthem...

1386
01:28:05,685 --> 01:28:08,745
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert
Merrill...

1387
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:13,688
...will present a special moment
for two special people.

1388
01:28:13,926 --> 01:28:15,917
I love when they do this.

1389
01:28:16,929 --> 01:28:20,626
-Good.
-Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.

1390
01:28:35,682 --> 01:28:37,673
Linda?! Linda!

1391
01:28:55,868 --> 01:28:58,769
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1392
01:28:59,706 --> 01:29:01,196
Wait, don't I know you?

1393
01:29:01,374 --> 01:29:03,308
-Come on.
-Where's your German accent?

1394
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:09,912
You have me confused
with somebody...

1395
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,745
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.

1396
01:29:12,919 --> 01:29:15,547
-There's no fans allowed on that field.
-Galaxia.

1397
01:29:16,622 --> 01:29:17,611
It's Gary.

1398
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:21,453
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

1399
01:29:22,962 --> 01:29:26,056
-Hebrew Melvin's in love.
-Very much.

1400
01:29:27,633 --> 01:29:29,726
I can't stop love.

1401
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:31,732
-Go.
-Thank you.

1402
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:36,504
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks by the way.

1403
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:41,444
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to Yankee Stadium.

1404
01:29:43,683 --> 01:29:46,015
Oh, my God, it's Dave.

1405
01:29:46,519 --> 01:29:48,316
What the heck are you doing here?

1406
01:29:48,554 --> 01:29:50,988
-I wanna borrow this for a second.
-That's my mike!

1407
01:29:51,157 --> 01:29:52,647
Linda? Where are you?

1408
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:54,656
Don't move.

1409
01:29:55,094 --> 01:29:57,585
Linda? Are you out there, honey?

1410
01:29:59,165 --> 01:30:01,190
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

1411
01:30:04,437 --> 01:30:05,597
Oh, shit.

1412
01:30:08,174 --> 01:30:10,199
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

1413
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:14,346
Davey's going crazy!

1414
01:30:14,514 --> 01:30:17,278
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

1415
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:19,543
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

1416
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:21,118
How was that supposed to work?

1417
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:24,021
I guess I never really
thought it through.

1418
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:28,189
I gotta tell you something personal!

1419
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:30,954
This kid lost his marbles.

1420
01:30:32,932 --> 01:30:34,422
I'm over here!

1421
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:39,369
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

1422
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:43,533
Sweet tackle. Wow!

1423
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:45,643
Dave just got leveled!

1424
01:30:46,712 --> 01:30:50,307
-Nobody messes with my microphone.
-I'm sorry.

1425
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:51,914
Bob?

1426
01:30:53,052 --> 01:30:55,316
-Everything all right, Buddy?
-Oh, yeah.

1427
01:30:55,488 --> 01:30:57,251
I've never seen you so excited.

1428
01:30:57,423 --> 01:31:00,187
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

1429
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:01,883
...to the woman he loves.

1430
01:31:02,061 --> 01:31:04,894
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

1431
01:31:05,064 --> 01:31:08,898
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

1432
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:11,229
I won't let you do this to us!

1433
01:31:12,672 --> 01:31:14,537
Don't marry him!

1434
01:31:14,874 --> 01:31:16,341
Don't marry him!

1435
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:19,474
Wait!

1436
01:31:20,313 --> 01:31:22,941
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

1437
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,078
Let the man back in.

1438
01:31:25,251 --> 01:31:28,516
-Who was that guy?
-I think it's Regis Philbin.

1439
01:31:31,057 --> 01:31:34,220
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

1440
01:31:36,028 --> 01:31:38,963
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

1441
01:31:39,131 --> 01:31:41,622
Chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.

1442
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:43,166
Goosfraba.

1443
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,904
Goosfraba.

1444
01:31:48,741 --> 01:31:52,575
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

1445
01:31:52,945 --> 01:31:55,436
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

1446
01:31:55,948 --> 01:31:58,280
But he was right about one thing.

1447
01:31:59,585 --> 01:32:01,576
I was an angry guy.

1448
01:32:02,121 --> 01:32:04,282
Mainly angry at myself...

1449
01:32:04,457 --> 01:32:07,517
...for letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

1450
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,451
But I don't want to be that angry guy
anymore.

1451
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,029
I wanna change.

1452
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:13,696
If you give me a chance...

1453
01:32:13,866 --> 01:32:17,700
...I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

1454
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:19,462
And I believe in us, Linda.

1455
01:32:19,739 --> 01:32:23,903
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

1456
01:32:24,777 --> 01:32:26,438
I should be your husband...

1457
01:32:27,013 --> 01:32:28,776
...not that weirdo.

1458
01:32:30,249 --> 01:32:35,084
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

1459
01:32:35,254 --> 01:32:38,087
Kids who have your eyes...

1460
01:32:38,257 --> 01:32:39,656
...and your lips...

1461
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:41,590
...and my...

1462
01:32:42,328 --> 01:32:44,455
...last name.
That's all I wish on them.

1463
01:32:46,632 --> 01:32:49,066
Please marry me, Linda.

1464
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,276
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

1465
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:05,144
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

1466
01:33:11,123 --> 01:33:13,023
You can do it, David!

1467
01:33:14,994 --> 01:33:17,189
Give her a five-second Frencher!

1468
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,364
Kiss her, David.

1469
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:25,965
Kiss her, David.

1470
01:33:27,873 --> 01:33:29,704
Kiss her, David!

1471
01:33:30,676 --> 01:33:32,769
Kiss her, David.

1472
01:33:40,353 --> 01:33:42,412
Go Yankees!

1473
01:33:59,772 --> 01:34:01,967
Dave's a dirty boy.

1474
01:34:04,143 --> 01:34:05,735
That wasn't so bad, was it?

1475
01:34:06,245 --> 01:34:10,614
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

1476
01:34:10,783 --> 01:34:13,149
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

1477
01:34:18,557 --> 01:34:21,754
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

1478
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:47,010
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

1479
01:34:47,186 --> 01:34:48,710
Don't change the subject.

1480
01:34:48,888 --> 01:34:53,757
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

1481
01:34:53,959 --> 01:34:55,187
Well....

1482
01:34:55,594 --> 01:34:56,583
Yeah.

1483
01:34:56,929 --> 01:34:59,056
I met with Buddy
after reading his book...

1484
01:34:59,231 --> 01:35:02,598
...and I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

1485
01:35:02,802 --> 01:35:07,762
...and how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

1486
01:35:09,442 --> 01:35:12,707
He said that he thought he could help,
but it would be tough.

1487
01:35:12,945 --> 01:35:14,936
So how much of this thing was a
setup?

1488
01:35:15,181 --> 01:35:19,481
Well, the guy in your seat on the
plane, the flight attendant, the judge...

1489
01:35:19,652 --> 01:35:21,643
...they're all friends of Buddy's.

1490
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:25,188
What about the air marshal
who tasered me? Was he in on it?

1491
01:35:25,357 --> 01:35:27,188
No, he was just having a bad day.

1492
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:29,953
Son of a bitch.

1493
01:35:41,674 --> 01:35:43,904
Skipper, how you doing?

1494
01:35:45,911 --> 01:35:48,971
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.

1495
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,615
I was just doing my job.
I never doubted you for a minute.

1496
01:35:52,952 --> 01:35:55,318
Except when Galaxia
had ahold of you.

1497
01:35:57,223 --> 01:35:59,555
Did you just call that guy
Buddy Rydell?

1498
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,793
A guy named Buddy Rydell
left this card...

1499
01:36:03,963 --> 01:36:05,590
...on what's left of my Lexus!

1500
01:36:05,765 --> 01:36:08,359
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.

1501
01:36:08,534 --> 01:36:10,468
Your insurance was canceled!

1502
01:36:12,805 --> 01:36:14,636
Grenada!

1503
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:18,841
Don't point that gun at Buddy.
I'm the one who smashed your car up.

1504
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,137
-Dave?!
-No!

1505
01:36:20,346 --> 01:36:21,938
I'm sick of guys like this.

1506
01:36:22,114 --> 01:36:24,446
You wanna mess with my friends,
shoot me first.

1507
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:25,845
-Don't!
-Are you crazy?

1508
01:36:26,185 --> 01:36:27,345
Settle down.

1509
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,182
Butt out! Tough guy's
going to learn a lesson.

1510
01:36:31,524 --> 01:36:34,891
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me
not to be afraid of anybody.

1511
01:36:37,363 --> 01:36:39,524
Can I ask you a question, though?

1512
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,867
Got you!

1513
01:36:53,879 --> 01:36:56,871
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!

1514
01:36:57,082 --> 01:36:59,414
And how does that
make you feel, Lou?

1515
01:37:11,564 --> 01:37:13,429
Chuck.

1516
01:37:13,599 --> 01:37:16,067
We were just doing a joke.
That's my friend.

1517
01:37:16,268 --> 01:37:17,667
Are you okay?

1518
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,008
He feels stunning.
