1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Georgia.

2
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,720
Sister Abernathy is singing
three times as loud as you...

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,120
and she just had her tonsils out, sugar.

4
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
- How you gonna account for that?
- I'm sorry, Reverend, I thought I was.

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,960
Now, as an incentive for us all
to be in full voice...

7
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,600
on Sunday, our very own
Senator Dillings will be here...

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,120
to help us kick off our Community
Redevelopment Program. Amen.

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
Amen!

10
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
Hi, ma'am.

11
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Okay.

12
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
Okay, here we go.
Domino, Lean Cuisine.

13
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,080
You take the paper towel, right?
Oh, and mayonnaise.

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
That's it.

15
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,560
- That's it?
- Yes.

16
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,920
- Hey, little mama, that pretty.
- Check it out, man. Yeah.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,880
Let me holla at you for a sec.
Don't you got no time for nobody?

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
Hey, Miss Byrd.

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,400
Hey. Any problems with the car today?

20
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,920
Some gunshots.
Nobody mess with the car, though.

21
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Okay, Darius, so you come by
in exactly 75 minutes and I'll be ready.

22
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

23
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,280
<i>Yeah! Welcome back!</i>
<i>Welcome back to</i> Emeril Live!

24
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
<i>Emeril Lagasse here. We're</i>
<i>making chicken four ways tonight.</i>

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,960
<i>Wait till you see this dish</i>
<i>that I got coming up right now for you.</i>

26
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,280
Poulet Tchoupitoulas.

27
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
<i>Poulet Tchoupitoulas.</i>

28
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
<i>Oh, yeah, baby!</i>

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
<i>You can't see this at home,</i>
<i>but he is happy, this chicken.</i>

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,760
<i>He's clapping for Doc Gibbs</i>
<i>and the Emeril Live Band!</i>

31
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>He's just... Oh, yeah.</i>

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
<i>You gotta split him in half...</i>

33
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,000
<i>and then we're gonna make</i>
<i>what I call a paste.</i>

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,040
<i>This chicken, skin</i>- <i>side down...</i>

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
Skin-side down.

36
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,160
<i>Now, for this</i> Poulet Tchoupitoulas...

37
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>maybe some of this fumé blanc</i>
<i>would work.</i>

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>So, a little splash like this. Okay?</i>

39
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,200
<i>Or a big splash!</i>

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
<i>Like that!</i>

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,680
<i>Bread pudding with onions,</i>
<i>with sweet corn, and andouille sausage.</i>

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,200
<i>Okay? Oh, yeah.</i>

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,360
<i>'Cause the</i> Poulet Tchoupitoulas <i>with</i>
<i>the bread pudding.</i>

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,480
<i>Bam!</i>

45
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,320
Look at that! That's looking good!

46
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't suppose you're gonna have any?

47
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,560
Lord, no.
I don't eat nothing but my Lean Cuisine.

48
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
What is that book, anyway?

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
- How do you like them greens?
- Oh, man, it's the bomb!

50
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,360
Well, good.
I mixed them this time, you know.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
Collard greens...

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,480
and of course, your favorite,
turnip greens.

53
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,760
- And I got plenty for your grandpa.
- Cool, thanks.

54
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Sugar!

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
I just got these pants.

56
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
Always doing this.

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,320
Darius, what are you doing?

58
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
That is my private property.

59
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
- I was just looking. What is it?
- It's nothing.

60
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,560
It's just what it says, just possibilities.

61
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Just things I'm interested in.

62
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Including this guy?

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
- He your boyfriend?
- No.

64
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
He's just an idea.

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
I mean, he's a real guy...

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,400
Why are you snooping around
my stuff, anyway?

67
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,160
So, what's his name?

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,760
Who?

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,480
None of your business.

70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,440
I'll tell you what his name is.
His name is lucky mother...

71
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,560
What?

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,720
I know you might as well
go ahead leave my house now...

73
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
if you're gonna be using
that kind of language.

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm sorry,
but short of you telling me his name...

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
I don't know anything better to call him.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,240
His name is Sean.

77
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
- Sean Williams.
- Sean Williams, huh?

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
And you better not say anything
to anybody.

79
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
I ain't.

80
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,880
There he is, there he is.
Okay, I'm not gonna say anything.

81
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,480
- You just talk to him.
- No, I'm not going to talk to him.

82
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
...just to say hello. All right?

83
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,400
Go and talk to him. Stop him.

84
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,640
- Good morning, Miss Byrd.
- Mr. Williams.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,480
What was that? Was that power flirting?

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
I don't know.

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,600
Oh, my, my, my.
You could crack a walnut with that ass.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Girl, stop!

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,400
Don't you have somewhere to be?

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
You know what we need to do?

91
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
We need to get you out of these
frumpy clothes and into something...

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,960
- that shows off the real estate a little bit.
- No. Rochelle! This is a workplace.

93
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,520
Seriously. Then you need
to go down there...

94
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,880
and you need to talk to Mr. Big Stuff...

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
and you need to tell him
what you want for Christmas.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,160
- You just sit in his lap...
- Hey! Rochelle, come on, now.

97
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
What? No...
What are you worried about?

98
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,080
That they're going to fire you
in this place?

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Take your coffee and go!

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,760
You're the best damn worker they got
in this whole damn place.

101
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,840
They're not gonna fire you.
You're just scared.

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,560
You're scared of some man
getting a hold of all that booty of yours!

103
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Would you stop?

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
He could hold my booty.

105
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,520
Sean!

106
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

107
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,800
<i>stop in our health clinic</i>
<i>on the second floor...</i>

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,840
<i>to make sure your holidays...</i>

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
Right. This piece goes here.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,920
There we go.

111
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,040
It's still crooked, but, yeah, that's good.

112
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
- It's good, huh?
- No, no, no.

113
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,760
"Lip of shelf to fit
between grill bottom and leg brace."

114
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,760
That was supposed to be put on last,
but that's all right.

115
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Thank you.

116
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,240
- Miss Byrd.
- Georgia.

117
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,840
You had some light bulbs to change
or something, remember?

118
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, light bulbs.

119
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,920
Light bulbs.
You know, they be relying on me...

120
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,960
Hey, I'll see you later.

121
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

122
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,960
Is there something I can help you with?

123
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
That's quite a nice grill.

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,480
- Stainless steel, huh?
- Yeah. Durable.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- Easy to clean?
- You just hose it down.

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Just hose it down, huh?

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,880
- Are you on your break?
- Yes.

128
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
Well, that's why I'm here.
I wanted to ask you something.

129
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
Ask me what?

130
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,200
Do you think I'll get my store discount
if I buy this thing?

131
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,480
Well, of course.
Of course you get your store discount.

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
But I just sold you a grill last week,
remember?

133
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah. But that was a hibachi.
That was for traveling.

134
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,200
I think somebody should've told you
when you got this thing...

135
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,760
that you're supposed to have a lawn
or a backyard or something.

136
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,640
Okay, how about a little more lifting
and a little less talking?

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,640
That looks good. Smells good, too.

138
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,520
All right, there you have it.

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
A simple Creole roasted duck hash
<i>en croûte.</i>

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,800
Now, what you can do with this here...

141
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
is you can take a little bit
of the parsley...

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,920
and onion if you like,
if that's what you like.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
But here's what I like to do.
Now, this is only for the brave ones.

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,280
For those
who don't get a lot of heartburn.

145
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
I like to kick some of that hot sauce
on there, spice it up something.

146
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Please, come on and enjoy some.

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,680
Excuse me.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Now, I made this special for you.

149
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,640
I left the pine nuts out...

150
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,080
'cause I know they get up
under your bridgework sometimes.

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Aren't you sweet?

152
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

153
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,560
Are you bucking for General
of the Salvation Army or what?

154
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,320
Stop feeding the moochers.

155
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,840
We always have...

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,320
our Wednesday morning
sales demonstration, Mr. Adamian.

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,600
No, no.
That's exactly the kind of thinking...

158
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,040
that put this store in Chapter 11
in the first place.

159
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,240
Now, Mr. Kragen, he's trying
to change the culture around here.

160
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
And by culture, I mean money.

161
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
Now, if you care about
your future here...

162
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,640
I suggest
you get with the program, Miss Byrd.

163
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Have you read this? Kragen's awesome.

164
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,080
- Everybody got one.
- Read it again.

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,640
Yeah. Yup?

166
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,240
Yup. Yup.

167
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,480
Well, then, hire another Santa.
Of course, he has to be fat.

168
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,800
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

169
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,440
<i>today's pre</i>- <i>Christmas sales</i>
<i>are on the second level.</i>

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Georgia. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

171
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,840
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

172
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,880
No. I'm sorry.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm kind of in my own little world
up here.

174
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,080
What brings you to cookware?

175
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,800
It's that smell, to tell you the truth.
I can't help it.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,040
It wafts down the escalator,
usually I can resist, but...

177
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Oh.

178
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
Oh, well, please have some.

179
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,560
I'll probably get fired over this.

180
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,280
This smells like my mama's house.

182
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
Thank you.

183
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,840
That's incredible. Incredible.

184
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,520
You know,
I'm just trying to sell the cookware.

185
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Where did you become a chef?

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
France, or someplace European
or something?

187
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

188
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
I ain't never been further north
than Mobile, Alabama.

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,800
You know, it's just a hobby.
Something I really enjoy doing.

190
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,840
- A hobby, huh?
- I never trained or anything.

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
- You gonna train?
- I don't know.

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Someday. Maybe.

193
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,760
Look. I was wondering,
sometime, if you're free...

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,320
I thought maybe we could...

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

196
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,240
You got...

197
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh... Georgia!

198
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,200
Whoa! What happened? Is she okay?

199
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
She hit her head.

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,280
- Give me a hand, please.
- So what? It's just a bump.

201
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,560
Watch her head.
Don't hit her head again.

202
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Miss Byrd, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Miss Byrd?

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
Can you hear the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

204
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,880
How many fingers am I holding up?

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,680
Is it one, two, or more?

206
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,400
- What's going on here?
- Georgia, are you okay? Georgia?

207
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,800
Oh, man.

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,360
I think we should do a CAT scan.

209
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
What?
That's a big ticket number, isn't it?

210
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,960
I didn't think we did that kind of thing
around here.

211
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
Well, we got a new machine.
Used, but new to us.

212
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, I don't know.

213
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
Sir, there could be
a huge workman's comp payout...

214
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
if we don't follow procedure.

215
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,080
All right,
only if it's absolutely necessary.

216
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,960
I knew you'd understand.
Paperwork. Follow me.

217
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,080
- Are you okay, Miss Byrd?
- Kind of nice to be off my feet.

218
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
Here we go.

219
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,960
<i>Now, don't worry now, Miss Byrd.</i>
<i>Everything will be just fine.</i>

220
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
What?

221
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
No, this can't be right.

222
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,680
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,280
Oh, my God.

224
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,280
<i>We're just going to try</i>
<i>one more time, Miss Byrd.</i>

225
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
This is not good.

226
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
This is not good at all.

227
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,320
What are we looking at?

228
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Well, we're looking at the results
of a virus you have, ma'am.

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
- Virus?
- I believe it to be Lampington's disease.

230
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,960
It's very rare and it's very harmless,
in most cases.

231
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,480
- In most cases?
- Yes.

232
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
What about my case?

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Well, I thought I'd misread
the first scan, so I did the second scan.

234
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,560
But that just confirmed it, you see?

235
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,880
- Okay, so I have Lampington's?
- Yes.

236
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,120
Well, which one do I have
if not the harmless one?

237
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
Ma'am, I'm very sorry to tell you...

238
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,800
But I...

239
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,880
You see,
in my opinion it's the kind that...

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,320
Ma'am, please! This is very, very
difficult for me. I'm just...

241
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,840
Oh, dear.

242
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,240
I need to lie down.

243
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
You see this area here?

244
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,640
- This is your mass.
- My mass?

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
Your tumor.

246
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,480
And this, and this, and this.

247
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm sorry, Georgia,
but the virus has caused...

248
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,840
a very advanced case
of Lampington's lesions.

249
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,880
Okay, well, exactly what
does that mean, Lampington's lesions?

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
And Dr. Gupta hasn't told you anything
about this, right?

251
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,440
Well, I tried.

252
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,920
Thanks.

253
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,480
Without treatment, it's terminal.

254
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,240
What? Like I'm gonna die?

255
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm very, very sorry.

256
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,280
But I feel fine.

257
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,280
I feel great.
I just finished a Fat Flush and...

258
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,640
No dizziness or fainting?

259
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,520
No. I got a tiny bump on my head,
that's all.

260
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,640
It's diabolical. Such a sneaky disease.

261
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm afraid, in your condition,
you've got about three weeks to live.

262
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,040
What? I got three weeks to live?

263
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,840
Are you shitting me?

264
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Four on the outside. I'm sorry.

265
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,200
You're sorry? Well, I'm sorry.
I can't accept that.

266
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,000
Then I think you should see
Katherine Lenz.

267
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,880
Okay. Fine.

268
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,640
That's what I'm talking about.
Katherine Lenz, okay.

269
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,320
- Is that the brain specialist?
- No.

270
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
She's your HMO administrator.

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
Let me just save you some time here,
Miss Byrd.

272
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,240
We won't cover you for this operation.

273
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
Well, what do you mean,
you won't cover me?

274
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm covered through my HMO.

275
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,640
If you feel you're being treated unfairly,
these are our appeals procedures...

276
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,120
which you have every legal right
to pursue.

277
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,080
Well, what if I pay for it myself?
How much would that cost me?

278
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,080
The cost
of a median cranial debulking surgery...

279
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,840
is around $340,000.

280
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,960
That's without anesthesia.

281
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,160
You'll want that.

282
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,640
Check again,
make sure I'm not covered.

283
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,320
You wait and you wait
for something big to happen...

284
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,840
and then you find out you're gonna die.

285
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,280
I really wanted to meet you.

286
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,480
And I should've ate that.

287
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,200
I should've ate all that stuff.

288
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Especially this.

289
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,760
Put my foot in that. Darius loved that.

290
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Now I'll never get to Karlovy Vary.

291
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,720
Chef Didier.

292
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,320
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

293
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Hiya, sis!
I was just getting ready to call you.

294
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
You know, there's this guy
that I met in this club...

295
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,720
<i>and he said he's gonna introduce me</i>
<i>to some of his friends in Nashville...</i>

296
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,760
I just need you
to take care of the kids for three days.

297
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,280
What you gonna do in Nashville?

298
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,280
Girl, I am finally going to be
a country western singer.

299
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,880
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,120
Tanya, ain't no such thing
as a black country singer.

301
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,760
<i>You know, I am not asking you to</i>
<i>comment on the validity of my dreams.</i>

302
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,720
Now can you...
Hold on. Anton, would you stop it?

303
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,880
- <i>This child is going to kill himself!</i>
- Listen, that's why I'm calling you...

304
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,640
What are you doing? Why can't you
watch the kids? What are you...

305
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,600
- <i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>
- But, I'm...

306
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,800
<i>I told you to stop jumping.</i>
<i>Do it again and see what happens.</i>

307
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>You think I'm playing?</i>

308
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,840
Georgia, where have you been?
Adamian's been looking for you.

309
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,360
Good, 'cause I'm looking for him, too.

310
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
- Why?
- I'm gonna take your advice.

311
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,240
Huh?

312
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,280
Look, remember when you said
life was too short to live the way I do?

313
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,320
- Oh, I say a lot of things.
- Yeah, well, you were right.

314
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,320
What? What did I say?
What are you gonna do?

315
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
Georgia?

316
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,400
What did I say?

317
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,680
You don't knock?

318
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,280
You better have a hell of an excuse
for where you've been, Ms. Byrd.

319
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,600
I do, I do.

320
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,520
You see, Mr. Adamian...

321
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,840
Excuse me, would you mind?
This is very important.

322
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,760
- Actually, it's a matter of life and...
- What?

323
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,680
Just turn it off.

324
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Yeah.

325
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
You're killing me
with the potato peelers.

326
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Move them
or I'll shove them down your throat.

327
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,040
You got a problem?

328
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,440
Yes, I do.

329
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
That's a $400 phone.

330
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,200
Now I feel better.

331
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
That's company property.

332
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,800
That's going to come out
of your paycheck.

333
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,040
Take it. Take the whole thing, okay?
It's worth it.

334
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,560
This is not about you, okay?
It's not about me.

335
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
It's about business.

336
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,880
- It's about the company.
- Mr. Adamian.

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,880
I want you to hear this.
This man lives his philosophy.

338
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,360
<i>Rule One:</i>
<i>Life is not a popularity contest...</i>

339
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>but it is a contest.</i>

340
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,600
<i>Boo</i>- <i>hoo, they don't like me.</i>

341
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,880
<i>Rule Two: You grab</i>
<i>that scared little loser inside you...</i>

342
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
<i>and beat the living crap out of him!</i>

343
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,560
<i>Rule three: When is enough, enough?</i>
<i>Enough is never enough.</i>

344
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,760
Enough is enough right now,
Mr. Adamian!

345
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm trying to talk to you!

346
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm trying to tell you what's...

347
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
Why am I even wasting my time
trying to talk to you?

348
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,400
You know what? I quit.

349
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,160
- You what?
- I quit.

350
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,800
- You can't.
- Why can't I?

351
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,080
Fourth quarter sales are in the toilet
in this store...

352
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,040
and all the other stores, too,
for that matter.

353
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,400
Your department has
the highest profit record in the place.

354
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
I just... I can't afford to lose you.

355
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,640
How come
you never told me this before?

356
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
I didn't want you to do
what you're doing right now.

357
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,280
Holding me up for more money.

358
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,680
Which I'm happy to pay.
As God is my witness.

359
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,160
As God is your witness, huh?
As God is your witness?

360
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,720
All right. I'm prepared to offer you
50 cents more an hour!

361
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,280
75 cents more an hour. 75.

362
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,680
<i>Ms. Byrd, $1 more an hour. $1.50.</i>

363
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey, Georgia. Your shift done already?

364
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,080
Yeah, I'm done.

365
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
Listen, I feel terrible
about what happened the other day.

366
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,120
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- It wasn't your fault.

367
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,680
Well, anyway...

368
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,360
Hey, I have a pair of tickets
to the Hornets game.

369
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
Now, the game
is a couple of weeks away...

370
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,240
but I know you're a busy woman,
so I wanted to put my bid in early.

371
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Sean, there is nothing I would rather do
than to go to that game with you.

372
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,080
Yeah? That's great.

373
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,640
Well, look, I figured we'll go
to dinner early, then after the game...

374
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
I can't go, Sean.

375
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,800
I mean, it's not like I don't want to. I...

376
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,320
I can't.

377
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,680
You have to be somewhere else.

378
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Yeah.

379
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,840
Hey, well, Georgia. Georgia!

380
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,440
Look.

381
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
I already paid for the ticket, so...

382
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
maybe your plans might change, huh?

383
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
Brothers and Sisters...

384
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm sad to announce that...

385
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,720
Senator Dillings will not be gracing
our flock this morning as planned.

386
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,720
Pressing business
in our nation's capital has kept him.

387
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,960
But I'd like to take a moment of prayer
for the Senator.

388
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,440
He toils so hard
toting the burden of our welfare.

389
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,560
And I ask the good Lord
to guide his hand...

390
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,200
in his important good works. Amen.

391
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,000
- Amen.
- Amen.

392
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
Oh, why me?

393
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,240
- Oh, dear Lord, why me?
- Georgia?

394
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,880
Why me, Lord? Why me, Lord?

395
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,280
- Oh, dear Lord! Lord, why me?
- Bless the Lord.

396
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,520
Oh, Lord, no!

397
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,680
Oh, no, no.

398
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,000
Lord! Lord, come on!

399
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Come on, Lord, why?

400
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,800
I don't understand!

401
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

402
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,080
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

403
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

404
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

405
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>I never slept around</i>
<i>even though my sister did!</i>

406
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,640
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

407
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,400
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

408
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,680
<i>I never cussed my boss</i>
<i>or nothing like that!</i>

409
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,640
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

410
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

411
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,880
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

412
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,240
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

413
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

414
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

415
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,160
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

416
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,160
<i>Come on, now, somebody tell me why!</i>

417
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,360
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

418
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,400
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

419
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,400
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

420
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,440
- <i>Why, please?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

421
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,480
<i>I got to know</i>

422
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,360
<i>I got to know, God!</i>

423
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
<i>Why me?</i>

424
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,440
<i>Why? Oh, why?</i>

425
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,080
<i>Why, Lord? Why? Oh, come on</i>

426
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,960
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

427
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,320
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

428
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,800
You're sure you want to liquidate
the entire IRA? All of it?

429
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,800
Yeah, and the bonds my mama left me.

430
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,080
Well, I'm sure a disciplined woman
such as yourself...

431
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
has a very useful purpose
for this money.

432
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes, I do.

433
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm just gonna blow it.

434
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,640
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we want to thank you...</i>

435
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,360
<i>for flying with us on Christmas Day.</i>

436
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,480
<i>We're going to make your trip</i>
<i>as comforyable as possible.</i>

437
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
Stewardess...

438
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,400
this person behind me
is giving me a hard time.

439
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay, sure, sir.

440
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,760
Ma'am, would you mind
lowering your knees...

441
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,960
so the gentleman in front of you
can put his seat back down?

442
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,400
Actually, I very much would mind.

443
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,720
Am I going to have to
call the Air Marshal, ma'am?

444
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,040
People been calling me ma'am
a lot lately...

445
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,400
and, you know,
I'm hardly older than you.

446
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,680
Do people call you ma'am?

447
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,240
No... No, they don't.

448
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,960
Is there a problem here?

449
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes. Yes, there is.

450
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
I'm gonna tell you what the problem is.

451
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,440
This greedy airline put all these seats
so close together...

452
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,080
just so they can make more money.

453
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,880
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

454
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
All right?

455
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,440
Now, I'm not flying
all the way to Prague...

456
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,320
with some stranger in my lap.

457
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,240
I know that's right.

458
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,520
That's a big boy.
That's a big old man right there.

459
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,840
I can't... Look at him.

460
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,560
Had you chosen to fly first class...

461
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Ma'am? Hi.

462
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
Had you chosen to fly first class
instead of economy...

463
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,720
you would have had plenty of room
in one of our cocoons.

464
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,920
- How much is it?
- Beg your pardon?

465
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
How much for the damn cocoon?

466
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
- Work it!
- I like that.

467
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,000
- All right.
- Hear, hear.

468
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,680
For our first class clients
flying with us during the holidays...

469
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,040
we thought we would do
something special.

470
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,840
Thank you. Wait, don't go.
Just leave that right here.

471
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Look at that taxi line.

472
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,840
Oh, this is gonna take forever.

473
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,240
That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,120
Who is that?

475
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,160
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure, Congressman.

476
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,960
Who is that?

477
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter...

478
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,600
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

479
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Wow.

480
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,800
Hello. Welcome!

481
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,560
- Thank you.
- Welcoming.

482
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,160
- You are here for retreat of the health?
- I guess you could say that.

483
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,200
How are you?

484
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,120
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

485
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,160
- Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
- Great, great.

486
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,760
Oh, you are from Louisiana?

487
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,600
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

488
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,680
- Senator Dillings is here skiing?
- Yes.

489
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,680
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

490
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,320
- Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
- Okay.

491
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,680
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

492
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,880
- Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
- <i>Madame</i> Byrd?

493
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,680
Welcome to Grandhotel Pupp.

494
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,200
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

495
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

496
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,040
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

497
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,760
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

498
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,240
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

499
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,880
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

500
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,720
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

501
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Don't y'all have anything available now?

502
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll check it.

503
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,680
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

504
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
I've never noticed, madam.

505
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Only the presidential suite.

506
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,640
It's C3,000 a night.

507
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,840
About $4,000 a night.

508
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,520
Did you see me blink?

509
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,920
Madam Byrd, welcome.

510
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,920
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

511
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,400
- Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
- Yes.

512
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,040
- Matthew Kragen.
- You know Mr. Kragen?

513
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,920
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

514
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,280
- You playing with me, right?
- Pardon me?

515
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,960
- Oh, not you, Him.
- Excuse me.

516
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,680
Is the spelling okay?

517
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,720
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

518
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,280
- Thank you.
- Mr. Kragen, sir.

519
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,840
- I hope everything's okay.
- Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

520
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,400
- And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
- Well, not this trip, Arturo.

521
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,880
This is strictly business.

522
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,320
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

523
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
- Well, I won't, but she will.
- Lf I need you, I'll call you.

524
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,800
Excellent.

525
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,400
Can you believe that?

526
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,680
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything...

527
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,160
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

528
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,720
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

529
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,160
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

530
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Okay.

531
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,920
Matthew, Miss Burns.

532
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,640
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

533
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,440
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

534
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,240
Congressman!

535
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,920
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

536
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,920
Who is that?

537
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,320
Oh, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.

538
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,840
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have...

539
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,000
a very important meeting together.

540
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,200
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

541
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,000
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

542
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,320
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

543
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,800
No, madam.

544
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,680
Now, more reasonable.

545
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,440
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

546
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
What world was I living in?

547
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,440
Make me international.

548
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,960
We could try.

549
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,880
Give me my money.

550
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,600
I can't wear this.

551
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

552
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,560
You think anybody'd call me ma'am
in this outfit?

553
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,720
- No.
- Definitely not.

554
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,960
- Table for one, please.
- Yes, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

555
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,960
Please.

556
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,960
May I take your pashmina?

557
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,920
Oh, is that what this thing is?

558
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Sure.

559
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,800
Hello, sister.

560
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,040
Who the hell is she?

561
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,320
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- Thank you.

562
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,120
Her name is Georgia Byrd.

563
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,800
She's loaded and she's an old crony
of Dillings from Louisiana.

564
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,840
I...

565
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm sorry.

566
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,320
No. It's okay, it's okay.

567
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,840
Water. Flat. No ice.

568
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,640
- Please, serve everyone.
- Of course.

569
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,160
Matthew, what are the chances
of our meeting Chef Didier?

570
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,840
Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

571
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,800
Is that right? Arturo!

572
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,400
Yes, sir.

573
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Make sure Didier comes and says hello
to the table.

574
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,000
And fire that guy.

575
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,960
For the specialties <i>de maison,</i>
we have the cassoulet.

576
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,120
We have risotto Barolo with truffles.

577
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,800
The rouget citrus <i>beurre blanc</i>
with capers.

578
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,880
Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

579
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,040
And a braised lamb shank
with blood orange relish.

580
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Blood orange relish.

581
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,000
Now, that all sounds so good.

582
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

583
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,000
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

584
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,600
Well, I guess I better try them all
tonight then.

585
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,160
<i>Tout?</i> All?

586
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,560
<i>Tout,</i> baby! <i>Tout de suite.</i>

587
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,560
Do you think he would do a risotto
without the dairy?

588
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,560
I think I'm going to have
the rouget citrus without the potatoes...

589
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,160
and the <i>blanc</i> without the <i>beurre.</i>

590
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,840
No butter, no cream, no wheat,
no dairy, no fat!

591
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,280
<i>Merde!</i> Why do they bother to eat?

592
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,600
Next time, stick this in my neck!

593
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,360
And no substitutions?

594
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,960
I will do it myself.

595
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,480
She has got them eating
right out of her hand.

596
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,320
Well, she's sure not watching
her cholesterol.

597
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,840
I wish I could command
attention like that.

598
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,280
Is that the lamb?

599
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,440
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- Oh, look at that!

600
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,160
Looks so good!
Everything looks so good.

601
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,080
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

602
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,200
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

603
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Amen.

604
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,960
I was thinking maybe we could get Bob
up to speed tomorrow at lunchtime.

605
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,360
Yes, Matthew. I'd like to know more
about this merger.

606
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,600
Here he is!

607
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,400
How do you find everything,
<i>mademoiselle?</i>

608
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,240
- Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,640
I think he'll be by.

610
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm sure he'll be right over, sir.

611
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,720
- I'll be up there, on top of the mountain.
- Okay. Will Margaret join us?

612
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
Because we do need to talk
some business.

613
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,920
Okay, what time?

614
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,440
Depends on Kragen's schedule.

615
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,400
You know, where I come from...

616
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,800
we do a barbecue quail
with an andouille pudding.

617
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,320
I think you would just love it.

618
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,560
And, you know, call me crazy...

619
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,400
but am I tasting rendered lards
of pork belly here?

620
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,480
<i>Oui?</i>

621
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,040
Pork belly?

622
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,480
Oink, oink.

623
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,960
Very sensitive palate.

624
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,840
Half clarified butter and half pork fat.

625
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,920
- I knew it.
- No? But you keep it to yourself.

626
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,200
You know how some people are
about pork's fat.

627
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,840
Yeah.

628
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
They don't like the pork...

629
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,120
Chef Didier, you're crazy!

630
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,000
Matthew, you seem to know everybody.
Who is she?

631
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,560
I was gonna ask the Senator
the same question.

632
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,720
- I don't know her.
- Really? You sure about that?

633
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,640
Well, for your information,
I don't know everyone who's black.

634
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,880
Well, apparently she knows you
from New Orleans?

635
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,200
Really? Maybe it was last year's
Entrepreneurs of Diversity.

636
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,200
Well, whoever she is, I'd sure like
to have her ordering 10 plates...

637
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,520
at a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser.

638
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,160
Why, Bob?
Haven't I've been contributing enough?

639
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,760
No, Matthew, I didn't mean it that way.

640
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,440
You've been very generous
and it's much appreciated.

641
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,160
Dr. Gupta.

642
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,480
Dr. Gupta.

643
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,400
Sir, if this is a medical question,
I'm still on my break...

644
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,720
for two and a half more minutes.

645
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,640
Well, actually, excuse me,
it's not about me.

646
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,640
It's about Georgia Byrd.
Remember the lady who hit her head?

647
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,120
Sir, why do you think
I'm so desperately trying to relax?

648
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
Well, she's been acting
really strange lately.

649
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,680
She up and quit her job.
Nobody's seen her.

650
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,120
And I was wondering if you had said
anything that might have upset her?

651
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,280
- Or if you know something...
- I'm sorry.

652
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,520
Patient privacy prevents me
from commenting, I'm very sorry...

653
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,200
- You're gonna tell me!
- Okay, okay.

654
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,680
- Sir?
- Tell me!

655
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,200
Georgia Byrd is going to die.

656
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,040
- What?
- I'm very sorry.

657
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
- What?
- I'm very sorry, sir.

658
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,640
No, this can't be.

659
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
My break is over. We can talk about it.
Come, put me down.

660
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,880
That's nice.

661
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,760
I do it with love.

662
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Okay.

663
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,560
And the gonging, flushing
negative energy.

664
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,920
Wait. I gotta use the bathroom.

665
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,760
They say these waters
have curative powers...

666
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,800
let you live to be 100.

667
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,760
Yeah, well, I hope they work fast.

668
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,560
Clarence Dillings.
Senator Clarence Dillings.

669
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,160
- I know who you are.
- Oh, so, we have met.

670
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,520
Entrepreneurs of Diversity?

671
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,240
- No, afraid not.
- Washington?

672
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,960
They do know each other.

673
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Well.

674
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,440
Church?

675
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,960
- But I didn't go to church last Sunday.
- That's right.

676
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,240
You know, you left a whole lot
of church folk disappointed, Senator.

677
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,240
People who voted for you.

678
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,960
I hope you'll communicate
my sincerest regrets.

679
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,880
I don't wanna have nothing
to do with your regrets.

680
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,880
I got my hands full of my own.

681
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,520
I got a gut feeling about that woman.
She's trouble.

682
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,560
You know, Matthew,
who was it who said:

683
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,960
"Adversity is the stone
on which I sharpen my blade"?

684
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,200
Me.

685
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,800
Excuse me.

686
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,440
Ms. Byrd, is it?
We've not been introduced.

687
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,120
- My name...
- There's no need.

688
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,080
Everybody knows Matthew Kragen.

689
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,800
The man for whom
"enough is never enough."

690
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,360
I mean, who is she?

691
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,000
How do I know she's not part of some...

692
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,800
consumer watchdog group
or something?

693
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
Well, it's not like there's some law...

694
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,440
against being at the same hotel
with a congressman and a senator.

695
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,920
Actually, there is,
if they're on my plane and my dime.

696
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,520
Well, watchdogs don't stay
in $4,000-a-night hotel suites, okay?

697
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,160
So, how about you and I
just forget all about...

698
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,520
retail empire building...

699
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,560
and let's just take a little bath? Yeah?

700
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,720
I'll take a bath, all right.

701
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,320
A $500-million bath
if these mergers don't go through.

702
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,400
You just keep your eyes open
and remember why we're here.

703
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,320
Are you all right, Madam Byrd?

704
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,560
Yeah. I just... I just love these sheets.

705
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,560
I love them. I was just taking them
for a little ride around the block.

706
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,120
I am Gunther. Floor valet.

707
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,720
Oh, that was you
that put my clothes away.

708
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,920
- Yeah.
- Okay.

709
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,840
Well, Miss Gunther,
what do you do for fun around here?

710
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,200
What do I do for fun, madam?

711
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,360
I shine the guests' shoes
when they leave them out in the hall.

712
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,120
If that will be all.

713
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,720
No, actually, that won't, Miss Gunther.

714
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,280
I'm gonna be wanting to have
one of these snowboarding lessons.

715
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,920
- Very good. Will that be all?
- No, no.

716
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,720
No, it won't.

717
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,640
I want some more
of these spa services. Like maybe...

718
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,480
Maybe this algae flotation wrap
and the reflexology massage.

719
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,200
No anti-aging treatment?

720
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,560
- No, I ain't worried about aging.
- So, that will be all?

721
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,320
Yes! The colon irrigation treatment.

722
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,080
That's my gift to you.
Sort of like a "let's be friends" gesture.

723
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,200
Now, you think of me
when you're having it!

724
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,920
Oh.

725
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,280
I've been waiting my whole life
to do something like this.

726
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,960
- All right then, let's go.
- Okay.

727
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,000
- Just lean forward. Lean forward.
- Lean forward.

728
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,800
Left leg, that's it. And go!

729
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,480
Go, that's it. Just go! Yeah!
You got it, lean forward! Balance!

730
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,640
Yeah! That's it. Lean...

731
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
Are you all right?

732
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,800
Let's go.

733
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,240
- Let's turn.
- Oh, man.

734
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,000
- You feel the rhythm?
- I feel the rhythm.

735
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,720
- Yeah. Feel the rhythm.
- That's good.

736
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,880
- That's it. Right. You got it?
- I think I got it.

737
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,640
So, go! Just lean forward.
Lean forward and go!

738
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,840
Lean forward. Lean forward.
Lean forward.

739
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,760
- Lean forward.
- Yeah, that's it, that's great.

740
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,200
- Oh, Lord.
- That's great. No, no, no.

741
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,560
Slow down. Slow down a bit.
No. Slow down!

742
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,600
Turn the board sideways!
Slow, slow down!

743
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Stop!

744
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,720
<i>Scusi!</i> Watch out!
Get out of my way! Watch it!

745
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
What?

746
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,080
It's steep here, Matthew.

747
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,520
Hey, Matthew, this is
a Black Diamond run.

748
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,120
Yeah, you're looking good.

749
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,920
- Look at her go!
- Matthew?

750
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,240
- Look at her go!
- Matthew?

751
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,240
Matthew!

752
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,200
- Enjoying yourself?
- Not really.

753
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,360
Please, don't do that.

754
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,040
I guess you don't believe in turning?

755
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,040
I believe in it,
I just don't know how to do...

756
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,480
Oh, hold me, hold me! Please!

757
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,560
- Please get off of my skis!
- Okay, I think I've got it.

758
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
Let me go.

759
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,720
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

760
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,000
Damn you!

761
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,320
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

762
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,200
Watch your mouth!

763
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,080
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

764
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,400
Watch out!

765
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,120
Get over here, you!

766
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,560
They should get you off this mountain!
You figure...

767
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,960
You... You ski like that...

768
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,600
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

769
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,640
That's fine with me, baby.

770
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, my God.

771
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,440
And we are going to leave you now...

772
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,840
- to relax and meditate.
- Thank you.

773
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,800
Why, Lord?

774
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,080
I don't want to die.

775
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,880
I want to live.

776
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,840
What are you trying to do to me, huh?

777
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,840
You have big knot in neck.

778
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,520
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

779
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,000
Excuse me? Are you suggesting that I...

780
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,600
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

781
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,760
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up...

782
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,280
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

783
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,520
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

784
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,880
Excuse me.

785
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,040
Hey. Hey!

786
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,680
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

787
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,480
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

788
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,960
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

789
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,600
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

790
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,520
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

791
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,960
And he's a married man.

792
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,400
At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

793
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,280
Don't take it out on Brigitta.

794
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,120
Thank you.

795
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,240
Anyway, enjoy your massage.

796
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,520
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

797
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,000
Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

798
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,840
I knew it.

799
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,960
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

800
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,720
I'm marked by this.

801
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,320
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

802
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,200
Well, I wouldn't lose too much sleep
over what other people think.

803
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,760
Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

804
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,400
I've been at the company six years.

805
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,360
I've worked really hard, you know?

806
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,640
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

807
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,920
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

808
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,120
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

809
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,800
Look, I know this whole story.

810
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,000
My sister was seeing a married man.

811
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,240
Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

812
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,360
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

813
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,920
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope...

814
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,640
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

815
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,960
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

816
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,480
They ain't leaving their wives.

817
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,240
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

818
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,600
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

819
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,640
What am I going to do?
I didn't finish school.

820
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,080
Well, then you go back to school.

821
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,400
There now, we solved it.

822
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,160
Let's tackle something heavy,
like world hunger.

823
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,960
Well, did you at least find out
what she's doing here?

824
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,120
She's just here enjoying herself.
Unlike us.

825
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,520
How can I enjoy myself?

826
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,520
Dillings is suddenly telling me
that his committee...

827
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,120
has problems with my acquisitions.

828
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,800
Matthew, what does that
have to do with Georgia?

829
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,560
Oh, Georgia, is it now?
Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

830
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,240
I don't know, Matthew.
She said she worked in retail.

831
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,120
Did I mention to you how she told me...

832
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,360
you were gonna have
a shitty fourth quarter?

833
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,040
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

834
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,600
I barely know about our fourth quarter.

835
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,440
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

836
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,920
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you...

837
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,880
triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

838
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,600
You know what? That's it. That's it!

839
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,480
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

840
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,920
If I don't have their support,
my bill is dead on the floor.

841
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,360
That's what's gonna happen, see?
I need to relax, that's what I need to do.

842
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,040
Oh, God, my blood pressure is...

843
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,960
You know what?
I need to just do something to relax.

844
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,600
- Come here...
- Take a cold plunge, Matthew.

845
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,120
What?

846
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,040
Georgia?

847
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,920
- You guys seen Georgia?
- I ain't seen her in a while.

848
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,240
No.

849
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,200
Hey, what are you doing,
casing the place?

850
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,480
- Where's Georgia?
- Hey, you're that guy.

851
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
You're the Possibilities man.
The guy in the book.

852
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,760
What? What book?
What are you talking about?

853
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,160
- Where's Georgia?
- Hold on.

854
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,000
- What?
- Hold on.

855
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,120
Here, I found this in her garbage can.

856
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,120
That's my employee of the month photo.

857
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,840
- Did she say anything about me?
- No.

858
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,000
Why? You like her, right?

859
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,880
Easy, killer.
Did she say where she was going?

860
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,000
A place with healing waters
or something.

861
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,720
Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

862
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,000
Maybe it's in here somewhere.

863
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,680
I know she told me before she left.

864
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,680
I think this is it.
Calamari Vary, I think the name is.

865
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,640
- Karlovy Vary?
- Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

866
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,200
- Oh, good evening, Georgia.
- Hi.

867
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,680
- How are you this evening?
- Good, thanks.

868
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,840
Why don't you join us?

869
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,800
We got plenty of room at our table,
don't we, Matthew?

870
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,920
- Sure, yeah, why not?
- No, please. Please, come join us.

871
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,520
- Yes, come, it's decided.
- Good evening, Ms. Byrd.

872
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,720
Chef Didier has reserved a special table
for you. If you'd like to come with me.

873
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,600
Well, thank you,
but why don't you join me?

874
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,440
It seems I have a special table.

875
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,120
- Thanks so much for having us.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

876
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,920
You really look beautiful.

877
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,560
- Yes, you do.
- Thank you.

878
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,360
- You really do.
- Thank you.

879
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,480
Pull up a chair, Matthew.

880
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,800
Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

881
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,800
Could you maybe just... A little room.

882
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,120
It...

883
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,400
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

884
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,280
No, you are my preferred guest...

885
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,920
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

886
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,040
But I will make no substitutions.

887
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,240
Don't worry.

888
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,440
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

889
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,520
No substitutions?

890
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,320
No substitutions.

891
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,360
That was delicious.

892
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,360
- Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
- Thank you.

893
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,120
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

894
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,400
I was.

895
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

896
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,440
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

897
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,160
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

898
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,960
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

899
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,280
You sold all of your bonds?

900
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,400
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee...

901
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,280
I'm always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself...

902
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,800
operate the market.

903
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,560
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you...

904
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,160
pessimistic about the future?

905
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,320
- Well, Congressman...
- Bob, please. Bob.

906
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,760
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

907
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,560
Oh, come on, Georgia.

908
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,120
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

909
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,960
I would very much like to continue this...

910
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,640
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

911
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,120
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

912
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,400
Moser? What's that?

913
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,200
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

914
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,720
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

915
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,360
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

916
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,800
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

917
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,960
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

918
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,400
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

919
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,520
Oh, that is amazing.

920
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,680
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

921
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,960
It sounds like fun! Let's do that.

922
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,440
That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

923
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,680
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

924
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,360
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

925
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,440
Yes.

926
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,640
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current...

927
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,480
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

928
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,080
So, we don't want that, okay?

929
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,920
- So, are you ready?
- Yes, I am.

930
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,840
- Go get them, Matthew!
- Come on!

931
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Damn.

932
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,640
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

933
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,200
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

934
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,040
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

935
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,040
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

936
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,200
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

937
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,960
He may have met his match in Georgia.

938
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,200
Camcorder!

939
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,960
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

940
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,240
- We're rolling! Go ahead!
- Okay!

941
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,720
Oh, oh. He's gonna... There we go.
He's going over the rail.

942
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,480
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

943
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,200
Oh, my God.

944
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,360
Oh, come on.

945
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,560
All right, here we go.

946
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,360
Okay. Look.

947
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,160
I have told you before...

948
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,600
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

949
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,560
- What, like people died?
- Yeah.

950
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,360
- Sugar.
- Which one first?

951
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,360
Ladies first.

952
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,760
Ladies first. Okay.

953
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,240
Ready?

954
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,680
- Three...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

955
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,880
- Okay. All right.
- Three, two, one, go!

956
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,200
Perfect.

957
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,880
Whoa, baby!

958
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,320
Okay.

959
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,240
Three, two, one, go!

960
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,400
Is there a problem?

961
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,800
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

962
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,240
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

963
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,040
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

964
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,560
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

965
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,200
Here I come. Watch it now!

966
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,720
Oh, hold it now!

967
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,280
I can't jump!

968
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,480
Canopy not connected to rigging!

969
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,040
- Mechanical difficulties!
- It's all right.

970
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,320
- I don't know why this happens!
- It's all right.

971
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,320
- What are you doing?
- Klaus, just shut up!

972
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,360
Oh, man.

973
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,080
- It's so...
- Disappointing.

974
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,040
Really?

975
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,280
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

976
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh, yeah.

977
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,080
She lives on the edge.

978
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,200
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

979
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,040
True existentialist.

980
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,560
Hero worship, bought with a kiss
and an extravagant tip.

981
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,360
She's a fraud, I tell you.

982
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,480
Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, <i>Fräulein</i> Gunther.

983
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,520
- Mr. Kragen.
- How are you?

984
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Good.

985
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,160
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd...

986
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,120
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

987
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,920
- Quietly.
- Of course, Mr. Kragen.

988
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,880
Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

989
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,160
A prince? A real prince?

990
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,040
They have a charity dinner in town...

991
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,320
where everybody gets to feel generous.

992
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,800
I tell you, these people are all alike.

993
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,800
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

994
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,600
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

995
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,320
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

996
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,800
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting...

997
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,320
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

998
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,280
You know...

999
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,080
you and I, we know the secret of life.

1000
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,080
Well, what is that?

1001
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,360
The secret of life is butter.

1002
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,960
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

1003
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,600
- Butter, huh?
- Butter, yes!

1004
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,720
Three cases of <i>écrevisses.</i>

1005
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,720
Hotel.

1006
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,000
- Georgia, there you are.
- We were worried you checked out.

1007
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,080
- No, not quite yet.
- Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

1008
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,160
- Kragen's got it all arranged.
- No, I don't think so.

1009
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,200
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

1010
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,160
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

1011
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,960
Look, I just think I want to...

1012
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,080
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

1013
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,840
You probably just wanna take it easy.

1014
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,120
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

1015
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,560
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

1016
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,160
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

1017
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,800
- It's gonna be great.
- Great time. Great time.

1018
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,400
Great time had by all.

1019
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,320
- Fine, fine.
- Good, it's settled then.

1020
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,600
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

1021
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,200
Just take a little nap.

1022
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,080
<i>If you're reading this letter,</i>
<i>my disease has run its course.</i>

1023
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,000
<i>Enclosed is some money for my burial.</i>

1024
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,320
<i>I would like to be cremated.</i>

1025
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,040
<i>Spent my whole life in a box.</i>

1026
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,160
<i>I don't want to be buried in one.</i>

1027
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>because of turbulence...</i>

1028
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,720
<i>the captain has turned on</i>
<i>the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

1029
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,760
Excuse me.

1030
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,800
<i>Please return to your seats</i>
<i>and remain seated...</i>

1031
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,000
<i>with your seat belt fastened</i>
<i>while the sign is illuminated.</i>

1032
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,280
Scared of flying?

1033
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,320
- Do I look scared to you?
- I used to be scared, too.

1034
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,400
It helps if you color.

1035
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,040
Georgia, whatever you got,
give me some.

1036
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,760
Believe me, you don't want it.

1037
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,440
Place your bets.

1038
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,720
Don't know where to go.

1039
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,280
I'm following you wherever you go.

1040
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,480
That's a lunatic bet.
That's just a lunatic bet right there.

1041
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,640
Georgia, that's a lot of money.

1042
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,800
I know, huh?

1043
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,080
- You always bet on black, baby.
- Yeah?

1044
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,640
- Yes.
- All right. I'll give that a try.

1045
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,480
- No more bets.
- Matthew, Matthew...

1046
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,040
doing it your own way.
Georgia's our Lady Luck tonight.

1047
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,440
Come on, 17.

1048
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,200
Come on, 17.

1049
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,960
- Here we go.
- There it goes.

1050
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,040
- 17 black.
- Yeah!

1051
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,960
- That's the ball over there.
- Where to next, lucky?

1052
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,520
- What was that number I just played?
- 17.

1053
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,360
Seventeen. Sounds good to me.

1054
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,800
Isn't it a bit reckless
to bet on the same number twice?

1055
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,040
I guess that's why they call it gambling
and not crocheting.

1056
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,920
Gambling it is.

1057
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,280
- Well, the house is loving you guys.
- I'm in.

1058
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,040
- Place your bets.
- Me, too.

1059
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,040
Here we go, here we go,
here we go. Red.

1060
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,920
No more bets.

1061
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,400
- Come on, show me something.
- Come on, 17.

1062
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,640
- Come on.
- Big money, big money!

1063
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,080
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Red, come on.

1064
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,280
17 black!

1065
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,160
- What?
- Yes!

1066
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,160
Oh, my Lord!

1067
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,160
Give me a little kickback over here.

1068
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,080
- Thank you.
- Wow.

1069
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,920
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>
place your bets.

1070
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,000
Place it, place it.
What are we doin' here?

1071
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,640
I'm going with 17.

1072
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,680
Georgia, you can't go there a third time.

1073
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,760
A third time? Come on!

1074
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,960
Come over here
and get some of this luck.

1075
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,960
Maybe I am pushing it a little bit.

1076
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,480
I was born on the 13th.

1077
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,200
Thirteen, thirteen.
Put this on the thirteen.

1078
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,760
You sure about that?

1079
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,240
But then again,
I lost my mama when I was 11.

1080
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,200
Good idea.
Double me up. Double me up.

1081
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,480
Eleven. Yeah. Thank you. Eleven.

1082
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,320
- I love my mama.
- Could you please just place the bet?

1083
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,200
But my mama was born on the 17th.
What am I doing?

1084
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,760
- Oh, come on, bet!
- Wherever you're going, I'm following.

1085
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,000
No more bets.

1086
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,080
Thank you.

1087
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,120
- Here we go!
- Come on, come on.

1088
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,240
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1089
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,120
Come on, please, 17. 17. 17.

1090
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,280
17 black.

1091
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,920
What?

1092
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,360
Georgia!

1093
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,560
Great. Now you change my luck
for the better?

1094
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,960
You know what?
I'm not playing with you no more.

1095
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,040
- Can I cash in my chips, please?
- Yes, I'd like to cash in mine, as well.

1096
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,920
And me, too. Thank you.

1097
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,720
Gosh, how much?

1098
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,520
That's 3,546,305 crowns.

1099
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Wow.

1100
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,440
- How much would you guess that is?
- That's about $100,000.

1101
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,360
Wow!

1102
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,720
Not very well-traveled.

1103
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,680
Sales associate?

1104
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,840
I wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth.

1105
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,760
Oh, <i>mademoiselle...</i>

1106
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,240
You were incredible tonight.
You amazed us all.

1107
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,680
And myself, too.

1108
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,000
So, how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home?

1109
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,600
Probably because you're not home
that much anymore.

1110
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,840
Well, Washington
is a hard place to resist.

1111
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,120
Come visit me sometime. You'll see.

1112
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,760
I'm sorry,
but I just can't seem to get past...

1113
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,160
that big flashing "for sale" sign
on your forehead.

1114
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,080
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

1115
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,240
What are you doing here with Kragen?

1116
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,000
I mean, what exactly is it
that you two do for each other?

1117
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,720
I'm helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee, that's all.

1118
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,720
Well, it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people...

1119
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,160
over some hurdles.

1120
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,760
I mean, precious little's happened...

1121
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,640
with that Community Redevelopment
Program of yours.

1122
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,440
And nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless I get re-elected.

1123
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,160
Having generous supporters
like Matthew Kragen is a political reality.

1124
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,800
Yeah, well...

1125
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,200
I'm sorry, but...

1126
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,640
I only have time for reality realities.
Good night.

1127
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,480
Good night, Georgia.

1128
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,520
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd, I hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight.

1129
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,000
- I don't know about that.
- But there's no need to be humble.

1130
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,200
Did you have a marvelous time?

1131
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,960
Why're you being so nice to me?

1132
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,760
Yeah, I know. I'm a bitch.
At least that's what people tell me.

1133
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,680
Oh, Miss Gunther...

1134
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,600
no, you're not. You're just like
a lot of women who work too hard.

1135
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,840
And yet you are always so kind.

1136
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,840
You are a woman of distinction
and courage.

1137
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,880
Yeah, apparently I am, all of a sudden.

1138
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,880
Wish it had happened a little sooner.

1139
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,320
Miss Gunther.

1140
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,480
I hope you're not trying
to make a pass at me...

1141
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,960
'cause I really can't handle that
right now.

1142
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,600
Please don't die, Miss Byrd.
I read the note.

1143
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,360
- You went through my stuff?
- Oh, yeah, I go through everyone's stuff.

1144
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,920
I apologize.

1145
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,040
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of relieved...

1146
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,120
to have somebody to share it with.

1147
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,360
Don't worry, I'll be with you here
to the very end.

1148
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,640
I don't know if I want to be here
to the very end.

1149
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,520
Why are you here
with these terrible people?

1150
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,520
You should be with people you love.

1151
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,640
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that myself.

1152
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,160
One in particular.

1153
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,960
It's time I go home and find him.

1154
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,800
Thank you, God.

1155
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,560
That's a lot of snow.

1156
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,720
- What's going on here?
- It's an avalanche.

1157
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,360
I'm sorry, but we'll have to go back.

1158
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,200
I can't believe this happened
on New Year's Eve.

1159
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,200
You're just not gonna cut me
any slack at all, are you?

1160
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,600
You're telling me there's nothing else?

1161
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,560
- I wanted you to find out everything...
- As I told you before, nothing.

1162
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,600
- Nothing?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

1163
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,760
Except that she is a saint.

1164
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,400
- And from New Orleans.
- Yes.

1165
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,480
- And her occupation?
- You should know. She works for you.

1166
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,800
- Now, please.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1167
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,520
- She works for me?
- That's all I know and all I'm telling.

1168
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,040
Here's your tip back.

1169
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,520
At this rate,
we're going to be here all night.

1170
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,880
Oh, no, we are not.
We are going back down the mountain.

1171
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,760
I prefer to spend the night with my wife.

1172
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,120
Hey, what are you doing?

1173
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,960
- Are you crazy? It's dangerous.
- Yeah, I know.

1174
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,720
But I don't have much time.
Keep the change.

1175
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,320
Wish me luck.

1176
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,240
I hate snow.

1177
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,240
Snow sucks.

1178
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,800
Cookware? Are you sure?

1179
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,440
I heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche.

1180
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,280
I just thought I'd check
to see if you needed any help.

1181
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,640
But I don't want to get in your way
or nothing.

1182
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,320
No, no, no, it would be an honor,
a privilege.

1183
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,440
What is this?

1184
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,000
It's a turnip.

1185
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,280
No, it's not. That can't be no turnip.

1186
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,840
The poor baby turnips.
Nobody likes them, you know?

1187
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,480
Of course.

1188
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,560
Life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom.

1189
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,480
But the turnip is to be loved...

1190
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,120
because she's a self-made woman
of vegetables.

1191
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,240
All the others you can only destroy
with cooking.

1192
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,000
But the turnip, she gets better.

1193
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,240
So, you see, it's not how you start...

1194
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,840
but how you finish.

1195
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,760
That's gonna be good!

1196
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,080
The first time I saw you...

1197
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,520
I was so happy
to see your appetite for food...

1198
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,040
for life.

1199
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,000
I'm so sorry.

1200
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,320
Gunther.

1201
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,320
Does anybody else know?

1202
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,520
No.

1203
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,600
Okay.

1204
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,160
Well, good.
Let's not say anything, all right?

1205
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,240
Let's just... Let's just cook.

1206
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,960
The onions, they make me cry.

1207
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,160
You have been very lucky.

1208
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,520
Well, you didn't get everything
you wanted...

1209
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,960
but you have...

1210
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,080
Next time, we do things different.

1211
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,400
We will laugh more, we'll love more.

1212
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,880
We'll see the world.

1213
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,840
We just won't be so afraid.

1214
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,840
Happy New Year.

1215
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,360
Look at you.

1216
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,080
Now, see, look at these tumors.
Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

1217
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,320
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it...

1218
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,640
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

1219
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,000
So, I said to myself, "Rabindranath,
it has to be the machine."

1220
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,440
Oh, my God.

1221
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,840
Thanks. I'll see you.

1222
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,360
Excuse me, young man,
do you live here?

1223
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,640
Yeah, I live right here.

1224
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,760
- Please tell me you know Georgia Byrd.
- Yeah, I know Georgia.

1225
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,720
Thank you.

1226
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,600
Tonight I'd like to make a toast...

1227
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,120
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us.

1228
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,800
To Georgia Byrd.

1229
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,680
Well, hear, hear.

1230
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,920
To Georgia.

1231
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,360
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

1232
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,560
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

1233
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,920
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

1234
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:28,160
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

1235
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,520
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

1236
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,480
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

1237
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,840
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk...

1238
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,240
in my New Orleans store.

1239
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,480
In the cookware department, no less.

1240
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,480
Salary? $29,000 a year.

1241
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,960
Cheers, Georgia.

1242
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,640
- What?
- No.

1243
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,560
Or as we might say back home:

1244
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,360
"Attention Kragen shoppers,
impostor, aisle three."

1245
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,320
Oh, come on. Georgia, is this true?

1246
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,480
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

1247
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,640
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

1248
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,000
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

1249
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,480
- That's when...
- You owe these people no explanation.

1250
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,880
No, excuse me. I think she does.

1251
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,760
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week...

1252
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,520
and the only reason we took it was...

1253
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,000
because we thought
she was somebody.

1254
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,600
Well, I'm sorry.

1255
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,920
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

1256
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,840
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

1257
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,960
You see...

1258
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,560
I'm gonna die.

1259
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,560
- Georgia, please.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1260
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,120
It's all right.

1261
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,760
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out...

1262
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,760
I only had three weeks to live.

1263
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,520
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

1264
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,720
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

1265
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,280
But I did land on that mountaintop.

1266
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,440
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

1267
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,160
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

1268
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,480
Never in my life did I think...

1269
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,520
I would end up
in such a beautiful place...

1270
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,960
doing so many incredible things.

1271
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,560
So...

1272
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,840
I'm sorry if I was...

1273
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,120
maybe a little too honest with you.

1274
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,800
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

1275
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,960
I was afraid, I guess.

1276
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,960
You know how it is.

1277
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,280
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

1278
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,640
Then you look up one day and wonder:

1279
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,040
"How did I even get here?"
Huh, bro?

1280
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,840
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

1281
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
So...

1282
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,800
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

1283
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,400
And...

1284
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,800
it's truly been my pleasure.

1285
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,280
Happy New Year.

1286
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,880
- Happy New Year, Georgia.
- Thank you.

1287
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,600
Asshole.

1288
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,920
That's a very appropriate sentiment,
darling.

1289
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,720
I second that.
Happy New Year, Matthew.

1290
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,040
Where are you going?

1291
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,080
Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

1292
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,160
And then I'm gonna go back to school...

1293
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,360
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

1294
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,640
And then one day, when your wife
finally decides to divorce you...

1295
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,600
and takes half of everything you have...

1296
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,720
I'll only be too happy to help her figure
out exactly how much that should be.

1297
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,720
Marie, what are you doing?

1298
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,520
Has that ceiling
ever made you want to cry?

1299
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,240
What ceiling? Get back to work.

1300
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

1301
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,920
Georgia, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am that...

1302
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,320
Girl, it's okay. I know you are.

1303
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,080
I left Matthew.
I'm going to the airport now.

1304
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,720
Oh, well, I don't know if they've cleared
the road yet to the airport.

1305
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,120
- What do you mean?
- The avalanche and stuff.

1306
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,280
Ms. Byrd,
something terrible has happened.

1307
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,600
Matthew Kragen's
jumped out a window?

1308
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,080
Pity, but not yet. He's still on the ledge.

1309
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,480
- What?
- Come on.

1310
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,960
I'll get my jacket.

1311
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,080
What's going... Wait a minute.

1312
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,560
Who? Hey, that's Kragen!

1313
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,520
- What the hell is he doing?
- He does not take rejection well.

1314
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,800
Matthew!

1315
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,920
Matthew, what are you doing?

1316
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,400
- What you doing?
- Thinking.

1317
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,480
- About what?
- Not falling.

1318
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,280
- Oh, no. What's she doing out there?
- Oh, my goodness.

1319
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,960
This is crazy.

1320
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,640
You don't have to be nice to me.
I know I'm a jerk.

1321
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,760
You don't think I know I'm a jerk?

1322
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,360
Oh, so, this is where jerks come
to hang out?

1323
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,280
You're starting to get
a little crowd down there.

1324
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,560
Happy New Year!

1325
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,480
- Wave to the people.
- Happy New Year!

1326
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,040
I can't believe this guy.

1327
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,040
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1328
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,480
- They'd like me to jump.
- Well, don't start people-pleasing now.

1329
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,160
Matthew. Come back in here.

1330
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,360
You know you're not gonna jump.
You couldn't even jump off the dam.

1331
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,000
Equipment failure.

1332
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,680
- See? You know...
- Miss Burns, let me handle this, please.

1333
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:30,080
Mr. Kragen, you know what?
You're really starting to piss me off.

1334
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:33,000
- Give me that.
- No, no, no.

1335
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,480
Oh, heads up!

1336
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,520
Damn, that is a long drop.

1337
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:43,840
Look, a guy like you has all the money
and time in the world...

1338
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,280
to turn things around for himself,
you know?

1339
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,400
So, just stop whining and get with it.

1340
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,280
Get with what, exactly?

1341
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,120
I don't know. I mean, I don't have...

1342
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,280
Georgia Byrd's five rules
to how to be a better human being.

1343
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,480
All I know is, if you want somebody
to care about you...

1344
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,080
stop trying to buy and sell them
all the time.

1345
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,240
Do I do that?

1346
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,080
And you know what?

1347
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,720
Get your pasty face off the cover
of your own magazine every month.

1348
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,640
Yep, that's the face right there.

1349
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,000
Every month!

1350
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,200
I can't believe I had somebody like you
working for me all this time.

1351
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,080
Well, I wasn't gonna work
for you forever.

1352
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,640
I had plans, you know.

1353
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,800
Yeah? What were you gonna do?

1354
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,600
Well, nothing big by your standards.

1355
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,560
But I was gonna open me up
a little restaurant.

1356
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,320
Bistro style.

1357
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,720
And, of course, a husband and a family.

1358
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,760
Do you have a boyfriend?

1359
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,200
Well, I wouldn't call him that.

1360
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,680
He works for your company, too.
His name is Sean.

1361
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,920
Georgia!

1362
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,760
- It's starting to happen.
- What?

1363
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,320
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

1364
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,640
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

1365
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,160
Georgia!

1366
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,320
- Is that...
- Sean, what are you doing here?

1367
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,640
Wait, I'm coming!

1368
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,280
- You are here to see Miss Byrd?
- Yeah, how did you know?

1369
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,680
Lucky guess.

1370
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,080
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

1371
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,760
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

1372
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,240
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

1373
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,320
Georgia!

1374
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,200
What the hell? I mean...

1375
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Come on.

1376
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,640
How many people
can get on that ledge?

1377
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,160
Who the hell is that?

1378
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,040
Sean, what you doing here?

1379
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,440
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease...

1380
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,440
and, well, I up and quit my job.

1381
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,560
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

1382
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,200
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit...

1383
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,760
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

1384
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,120
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

1385
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:34,440
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

1386
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,360
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

1387
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,560
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

1388
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,200
Okay. Talk to me.

1389
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,920
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

1390
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,000
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

1391
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,480
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1392
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,240
Well, look, I...

1393
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,520
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

1394
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:01,800
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

1395
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,040
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

1396
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,760
I have feelings for you.

1397
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,440
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

1398
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,680
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

1399
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,720
- I like this guy. Good guy.
- Me, too.

1400
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,600
Oh, come on, knock it off.

1401
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,480
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here...

1402
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,520
when you know I gotta die?

1403
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,680
- Who you talking to, baby?
- God.

1404
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,640
Hello!

1405
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,840
Oh, God.

1406
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,400
- We're the only ones not up there.
- We should join them.

1407
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,880
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

1408
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:51,800
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

1409
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:56,280
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

1410
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,760
- I'm not gonna die?
- No!

1411
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,000
- I'm gonna live?
- Yes!

1412
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:05,720
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

1413
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,680
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

1414
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,400
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

1415
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,600
Oh, no.

1416
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,720
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years...

1417
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,240
my whole life!

1418
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,800
All right!

1419
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,640
All right!

1420
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,600
- Can we get off this ledge now?
- Yeah.

1421
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,000
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

1422
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,120
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

1423
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,760
- You had enough of this?
- Yeah, go in inside.

1424
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,200
- Yeah, it's time to get warm.
- Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

1425
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,600
I want to tell you, thank you...

1426
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,280
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

1427
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:58,080
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

1428
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,520
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

1429
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,440
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

1430
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,760
Come on, baby. Come on.

1431
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,320
Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

1432
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,320
How about a little taste? Smell.

1433
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,200
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

1434
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,080
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

1435
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,680
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

1436
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,040
- Come on, baby, let's go.
- Go out and see to your friends.

1437
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,840
And I'll take care of the rest.

1438
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,880
- Okay?
- Okay.

1439
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,880
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

1440
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,240
Okay, all right.

1441
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,560
<i>Merci!</i>

1442
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,840
- Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you for coming.

1443
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,720
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Welcome to Georgia's.

1444
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,560
- My baby!
- Tough guy!

1445
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,240
- Who's my little guy?
- Congratulations.

1446
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,840
- Rochelle.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1447
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,120
You did it!

1448
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,720
- I quit my job.
- Thank you.

1449
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,280
You did? Oh, congratulations.

1450
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,320
- I quit my job!
- You should never have had that job.

1451
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,880
- I'm so glad.
- Hi, I quit my job!

1452
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,400
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

1453
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,280
- Welcome.
- Come on in to Georgia's.

1454
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,640
Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

1455
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,280
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1456
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,960
- Thank you for coming!
- Thank you. Congratulations.

1457
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,640
- She loves you.
- Congratulations.

1458
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,080
Thanks for coming.

1459
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,120
Pleasure.
