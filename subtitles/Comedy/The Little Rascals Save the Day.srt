Oh, they are indeed, Officer Kennedy.

That's our band name? Since when?

Don't be fooled. We're older than we look.

-And our combined ages equal over 45.
-Mmm-hmm.

and my staff do you for today?

How hard can it be?
I've been eating 'em my whole life.

00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,983
First off, a little vanilla.

276
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,279
And flour.

Perfect.

Isn't this gonna be a little too sweet?

283
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,465
No such thing as
too sweet when you're talking about cakes.

284
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,008
Don't forget the eggs.

285
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,346
Had to go out to
the garage to find it, but I got the oil.

00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:14,140
I sure could go
for one of those delicious-looking cupcakes.

00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,559
But Spanky says
we can't eat the merchandise.

00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,894
We're not gonna eat them,

301
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,980
we're just gonna
test them out to make sure they're still good.

Well, this one's good.

303
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,405
This one, too.

304
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,823
Better test the rest.

305
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,533
Good idea.

306
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,252
This is gonna be some cake.

I've reviewed your paperwork, Mrs. Larson,

309
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,888
and I'm very sorry,

310
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,226
but you owe this bank $10,000,
and it is past due.

311
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:02,272
You must pay it back
or we will be forced to take away your bakery.

312
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,901
Oh. Would you like to
try one of my chocolate chip cookies?

313
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,528
Ooh.

No. No, I'm trying to watch my calories.

Now, about the loan.

Well, I don't think one would hurt.

317
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,788
I mean, they're from my bakery,

318
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,292
and you would just be doing due diligence.

319
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,927
I'm sorry about not paying back the money,

320
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,805
but if you could
just give me a little bit more time.

That's the best
chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.

324
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,981
It's got just the right crunchy to chewy ratio.

325
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,233
Ooh, I'm so glad you like them.

326
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,443
This isn't a cookie.

327
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,653
It's nirvana.

328
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,155
It's bliss.

329
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,656
It's a warm puppy.

330
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,826
-(GIGGLES)
-It's sleeping late on a summer morning,

331
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,996
or walking barefoot on the beach at sunset.

332
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,749
If this cookie were a woman,
I would ask it to marry me.

333
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,001
You see? With a cookie like this,

334
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,295
business is just bound to pick up.

335
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:11,633
And I'm sure I could
pay back the $10,000 in two months.

336
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,969
-Would you like another one?
-Yes. What? No.

337
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,847
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs. Larson,
but you've already had three extensions.

338
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,182
My hands are tied.

339
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,686
You simply must
pay back the $10,000 by the end of the month.

340
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,938
But that's only two weeks away.

341
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,315
-Maybe it's time you retired.
-Oh.

342
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,525
Yes, sell the bakery.

343
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,026
Do what makes you happy.

344
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,530
I'm happiest when I'm baking.

345

see the expression on Grandma's face

00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,189
when she sees
how we made a cake on our own.

Me neither.

What was that?

Sounds like a moose trying to sing.

362
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,593
Maybe it's Alfalfa.

No, no, no. It's what can I do for you.

I understand that your property here,
its loan is coming due.

And I'm here to offer you
a business proposition.

406
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,741
it's desperately in need of a face-lift.
And here's my plan.

407
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,411
We're gonna tear it all down
and then in its place, this.

Retail stores, office space, luxury apartments.
All very modern.

Oh, no, no, no.

Not a mall. A Big Ray's Malltopia.

No, no, no, no, no.

420

No, I wanna offer you a very fair price,

421
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,488
then tear it down.

No, don't worry about the tree house, Waldo.

424
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,742
We'll uproot the tree and the tree house,

425
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,078
and we'll have it moved
right into our backyard.

Not after my dad buys it.

00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,961
Then it will be my tree house.

or lose it to the bank in two weeks.

Unless, of course, I don't know,

437

you got $10,000 lying around. No.

438
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,820
Look, you're gonna get a much better deal

439
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,613
from me than you will from the bank.

440
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,782
Well, I have two weeks to raise the money.

441
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,993
Until then, I won't sell.

442
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,787
Well, I'm just trying to be the good guy here.

443
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,999
All right. Have it your way.

444
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,376
Two weeks. Bye-bye.

445
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:44,841
Grandma, you owe the bank $10,000?

446
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,009
Yes.

447
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,470
I know.

448

When we win the talent show, Grandma,

449
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,182
we'll just give you the $10,000.

Did you hear
what we sounded like this afternoon?

453
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,981
We were terrible.

454
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,232
Speak for yourself.

She's right.

We'll never win the talent show.

Please excuse me,
but I think I'm gonna clean up the kitchen

460

while I still have a kitchen to clean.

461

What are we gonna do?

462
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,384
Not only will Grandma lose her bakery,

463
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,053
but we're gonna lose our tree house to Waldo.

Is this some kind of a joke?

I'm sorry,
but three of my caddies called in sick.

what difference does it make?

00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,238
They're future criminals.

966
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,532
(TOGETHER) Sorry, Officer Kennedy.

967
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,410
He seems a little mad.

968
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:42,370
(HORN HONKING)

969
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,290
-(GASPS)
-Darla, I heard the crash. Are you all right?

970
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,876
Thank you, Waldo. I'm fine.

971
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:49,544
Just a little dizzy.

972
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,380
We were just trying
to make money for Grandma's bakery.

973
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:53,798
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

974
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,885
And if I had my way,
I'd lock each one of you up in jail right now

975
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:59,304
and save the world
a whole lot of trouble in the future.

976
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,222
You know what, Edgar?

977
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:04,893
I don't think
you and I should see each other anymore.

978
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,770
What? Why not?

979
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:11,149
What kind of future do I have with a man
who doesn't even like children?

980
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,069
-Goodbye!
-Junebug.

981
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:16,446
Junebug, I like kids...

982
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,572
From a distance.

983
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:20,283
Would you like that ride to the library now?

984
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:21,993
With pleasure.

985
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:24,287

-(SIGHS)
-Officer Kennedy, I found this.

991
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,936
I thought you might want it back.

992
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:52,023
Women.
I don't think I'll ever understand them.

993
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:53,692
Join the club.

994
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,033
ALFALFA: (SINGING) <i>Well, I don't know</i>

<i>If all that's true</i>

<i>Babe</i>

998
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:15,672
Hold it, hold it. That sounded terrible.

999
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,883
Alfalfa, what's the problem?

1000
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,177
The problem is I don't got the babe.

1001
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:24,139
And I don't got Darla.
I'm too depressed to sing.

1002
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:26,349
Face it, Spank, we're never gonna be

1003
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:28,351
ready in time for the talent show.

1004
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:31,354
And we're never gonna make enough
money to save Grandma's bakery.

1005
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:32,856
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1006
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:36,192
Okay, so we had a little
setback with the taxi service.

1007
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:39,863
A little setback? We lost money again.

1008
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:43,074
And I lost Darla again.

1009
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,869
To Waldo. Boy, do I hate that guy.

1010
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,538
Want another reason to hate him?

1011
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:52,417
Look. The brake lever from the taxi cab.

1012
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:55,628
The cables didn't snap, they were cut.

1013
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:56,713
(GASPS)

1014
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,133
And who would want to
see us fail more than anyone?

1015
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,553
-Waldo.
-Exactly.

1016
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:06,431
That's it. I'm gonna tear him limb from limb.

1017
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:08,725
Boy, Waldo messed with the wrong guy.

1018
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:10,602
And he's gonna be sorry he did.

1019
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:13,938
'Cause I'm a caged tiger. A hurricane.

1020
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:16,941
And when someone crosses me, they unleash

1021
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,235
the sledgehammer!

(GASPS)

1023
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:25,492
Did I win?

1024
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:31,664
Alfalfa, you're a genius.
You've given me a great idea.

1025
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,334
How we can raise money
and help you get Darla back.

1026
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,087
Isn't that what you said last time?

1027
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:38,963
And the time before that?

1028
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:40,340
ALL: Yeah.

1029
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:43,635
This time, it's a sure thing.

1030
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,769
Here you are, Darla.

1031
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:56,856
One refreshing
jumbo strawberry fizz supreme.

1032
00:55:57,315 --> 00:55:58,775
Two straws.

1033
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,194
Thank you, Waldo. It's so nice of you.

1034
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,822
Anything for my partner in the talent show.

1035
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,283
You and I are going to be unstoppable.

1036
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,871
BUCKWHEAT: Come see
the wrestling match of the century.

1037
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:15,792
-PORKY: Tell your friends!
-Alfalfa versus the Masked Marvel.

1038
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,962
Yeah, you don't want to miss it.

1039
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:20,630
One day only.

1040
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:25,719
Alfalfa's gonna wrestle the Masked Marvel?

1041
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,846
Sounds dangerous.

1042
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:31,057
Sounds ridiculous.
He couldn't wrestle a teddy bear.

1043
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:35,311
I think he's pretty brave to do this.

1044
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,481
Something fishy here.

1045
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,026
Would you excuse me a moment, Darla?

1046
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:43,153
Well, of course, Waldo.

1047
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:48,074
BUCKWHEAT: Alfalfa is gonna
beat the Masked Marvel.

1048
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,909
PORKY: Yeah, tell your friends.

1049
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,494
Excuse me, my good man.

1050
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:55,540
You don't happen to know
who this Masked Marvel is, do you?

1051
00:56:55,665 --> 00:56:57,542
Yeah. But it's a secret.

1052
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:01,087
Yeah, a big secret.
Spanky told us we're not supposed to tell.

1053
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,589
I don't believe it.

1054
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,675
Spanky would never tell you
who the Masked Marvel is.

1055
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,260
You're too little.

1056
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,179
We're not too little. We know.

1057
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:12,015
Yeah, we know exactly who it is.

1058
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:13,391
My friend,

1059
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:17,604
Abraham Lincoln here, says you don't.

1060
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:21,900
I bet you $5
you don't know who the Masked Marvel is.

1061
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:24,444
Yeah? Well, guess what.

1062
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:26,905
I'm going to be the Masked Marvel.

1063
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,617
Yeah, Porky's gonna be the Masked Marvel.
Now pay up.

1064
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,411
Well, you guys sure showed me.

1065
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,207
Here, don't spend it all on gum balls.

1066
00:57:42,128 --> 00:57:43,672
-Yes!
-Yeah!

1067
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,174
Gentlemen.

1068
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,511
Who you callin' a gentleman?

1069
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:51,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1070
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,973
I'm here to make you a proposition.

1071
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,851
Yeah? What kind of proposition?

1072
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:59,229
Yeah? What kind of proposition?

1073
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,897
The best kind.

1074
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:02,982
A profitable one.

1075
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:04,401
Give me that.

1076
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,987
Oh, there's more where that came from.

1077
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,740
Follow me, there's a secret entrance.

1078
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,075
Hurry, I hope it hasn't started yet.

1079
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,284
I don't wanna miss it.

1080
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,954
-Me neither.
-WALDO: Two tickets, please.

1081
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,956
DARLA: Thanks for inviting me, Waldo.

1082
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:20,542
Normally, I abhor violence,

1083
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,294
but this seemed too good to miss.

1084
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,006
Enjoy the match. Next!

1085
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,844
Popcorn! Get your popcorn!

1086
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:35,306
Can't enjoy a wrestling match
without a big old bag of popcorn.

1087
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:37,892
Thank you.

1088
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,772
Popcorn! Get your popcorn!

1089
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:44,357
Welcome to the match.

1090
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:46,693
Welcome.

1091
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:49,779
Psst. Spank. How we doing so far?

1092
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,573
Great. We got a full house.

1093
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:53,450
Boy, are we gonna clean up.

1094
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,621
-I'll take that.
-(WORM LAUGHS)

KID: I paid good money for that.

1096
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:10,967
I just hope Alfalfa doesn't
hurt the Masked Marvel too badly.

1097
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:14,304
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

1098
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:27,400
(GASPS) Hey, this area is for wrestlers only.

1099
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,612
-There's been a change of plan.
-Yeah.

(YELPS)

1101
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,367
Hello, Spanky.

1102
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:39,245
Waldo? I didn't think of you
as the wrestling type.

1103
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:42,624
I couldn't pass up the opportunity

1104
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:46,127
to see the Masked Marvel
wipe the floor with Alfalfa.

1105
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,588
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna be disappointed, Waldo.

1106
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,132
There's no way Alfalfa's going to lose.

1107
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:53,843
Oh, really? Care to make it interesting?

1108
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:55,762
What do you mean?

1109
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,849
I'll bet you all the money
you've made from collecting admissions

1110
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:03,061
that Alfalfa is going to lose.

1111
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:07,190
You're on, Waldo. It's a bet.

Showtime, Porky.

1115
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,628
Wow, Porky. The costume looks great on you.

1116
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,715
You even look taller.

1117
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:35,218
Oh, and remember,
when I give you the high sign,

1118
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:36,970
that's your cue to take a dive. Got it?

said everything we need to say, Edgar.

1286
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:23,223
No, then I need to say more.
I can't sleep, I miss you.

1287
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:24,808
Junebug, I miss you. And I feel terrible

1288
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:26,851
-about the way I acted the other day.
-Oh?

1289
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,270
I'm really, really sorry
about what I said to the kids.

1290
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,564
It's just every time they're around,

1291
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:35,276
our dates get ruined, bad things happen
to us, every time.

1292
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,569
Well, they're just children, Edgar.

1293
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:38,488
They're not trying to make your life miserable.

1294
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,323
They don't have to try, they're succeeding.

1295
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:42,158
Oh, if you can't be patient with children,

1296
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:43,535
you shouldn't date a school teacher.

1297
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:46,830
I'll be patient.
I'll be patient. Just give me a chance.

1298
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:48,790
I know I can be the kind of guy you want,

1299
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:51,876
the kind of guy that likes kids.

1300
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,962
Loves... I love kids.

1301
01:10:54,045 --> 01:10:55,714
Let me prove it.

1302
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:59,384
You wanna prove it?
Well, tonight is the kids' talent show.

1303
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,219
How would you like to be my date?

1304
01:11:03,054 --> 01:11:04,472
Are those kids gonna be there?

1305
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,017
Yes, Edgar, those kids.

1306
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:09,978
You wanted a chance to prove yourself.

1307
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:14,357
That sounds great.

1308
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:16,151
-Good.
-I love kids.

1309
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:17,569
Now, are those flowers for me,

1310
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:19,195
or are they just there to make you look pretty?

1311
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,323
No, they're for you. And the balloons.

1312
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:27,162
-I like chocolate, too.
-Okay, okay.

And here we go, spinning in an orbit

1316
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:36,171
like the Mars Rover and spinning out.

1317
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:39,341
Spinning in and dipsy-doodle.

1318

-What's wrong?
-It's very nice, Waldo.

1320
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,557
But when you make this gesture...

1321
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:53,646
I want to see a little more,
"I'm a pre-teen idol, worship me,"

1322
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,232
and a little less,
"I'm your next president, vote for me."

1323
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:58,193
Gotcha. Thanks, Sergio.

1324
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:01,363
Now, about you, Darla,
when you come out of the double spin,

1325
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:04,240
I want to see a bigger smile, like this.

a choreographer and musical director.

1338

It was the day we finished building this place.

1359

Do you ever think we'll
have another tree house as good as this one?

1360

Yeah. You said it.

money without asking you all first.

-Hmm.
-But this is our last chance to save

1373

Grandma's bakery and our tree house.

1374

You're not the leader anymore.

1375
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,552
Well, then who is the leader?

1376

I guess we're all the leaders now.

It's a democracy.

Yeah, democracy.

SPANKY: Fair enough.

1380
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:39,688
So I'd like to propose something

The grand prize to the talent show is $10,000.

1383

That's more than enough
to stop Big Ray and Waldo.

1384
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:53,868
But we've hardly practiced.

1385

really have of winning that show?

01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:38,902
Bravo!

1603
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:40,403
SPANKY: Grandma.

1604
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:45,241
Oh, you, kids. Thank you so much.

1605
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:47,827
How are we gonna fit this
check in the ATM machine?

1606
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:49,537
(LAUGHTER)

1607
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:51,456
I don't know!

1608
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:58,463
Hey, Alfalfa. You were great tonight.

1609
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:00,757
Thanks. So were you.

1610
01:29:00,882 --> 01:29:03,426
But what about Waldo?

1611
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,262
He just became a solo act.

1612
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:09,432
And I'm looking for a new band to sing in.

1613
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:11,893
Any ideas?

1614
01:29:14,604 --> 01:29:17,440
Well, Mrs. Larson,
I hope you're proud of yourself.

1615
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:18,942
Not at all.

1616
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,611
I'm just so proud of my Little Rascals.

1617
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,822
Well, what about the tree house, Dad?

1618
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:25,657
I'll build you
another new tree house from the ground up.

1619
01:29:25,782 --> 01:29:27,784
-But I want that tree house.
-Look, I've got a great architect.

1620
01:29:27,909 --> 01:29:29,327
-I want... They don't deserve it! I do!
-You know.

1621
01:29:29,452 --> 01:29:31,746
-I want! I want! I want it!
-I'll take care of it, all right?

1622
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:34,958
Congratulations, kids. You were great.

1623
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,459
You really were.

1624
01:29:37,002 --> 01:29:40,296
I'm even thinking you could perform

1625
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:43,633
at the policemen's
Fourth of July picnic next month.

1626
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:45,427
(CHEERING JOYOUSLY)

1627
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:47,846
SPANKY: That would be awesome.

1628
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:51,141
Or we could perform
at your wedding instead?

1629
01:29:51,349 --> 01:29:54,102
Uh, my wedding?

1630
01:29:55,478 --> 01:29:56,479
No. Alfalfa.

1631
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:58,648
Yeah, hasn't he asked you to marry him yet?

1632
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:00,650
He showed us the ring and everything.

1633
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:02,318
-(BARKING)
-Uh...

1634
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:03,695
(STUTTERS)

1635
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:07,991
He certainly has, and I just told him...

1636
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:10,326
"Yes."

1637
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:13,538
-You have?
-(LAUGHS)

1638
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:15,540
(LAUGHS)

1639
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:16,958
She has.

1640
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,501
Yes?

1641
01:30:21,671 --> 01:30:23,631
-Aw.

1643
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:47,238
-Hi, Grandma.
-Well, you're just in time.

1644
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,991
-Who wants muffins?
-ALL: Me!

1645
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:53,536
Get in line. Ready?

1646
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:55,038
Okay.

1647
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:07,676
I caught it.

1648
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,762
ALL: Thank you, Grandma!

1650
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,431
Here we go.

1651
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,687
Come on, gang.

1652
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:41,793
Wow!

1653
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:44,587
Home, sweet home.

1654
01:31:44,754 --> 01:31:47,090
RASCALS: And how!

1655
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,258
And how.

(LAUGHING)

1659
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:15,405
Wow.

1660
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:18,992
Yes, it is "wow." It's got all the amenities.

1661
01:34:19,075 --> 01:34:22,537
Central air and heat,
Italian marble floors, granite countertops.

1662
01:34:23,038 --> 01:34:24,748
It's amazing, Dad.

1663
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,916
Yes, it is. Here, you do the honors.

1664
01:34:29,252 --> 01:34:32,422
I christen thee "Club Waldo."

1665
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:35,717
Members only, no riffraff.

1666
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:42,766
Well, built to last.

1667
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,288
Didn't see that coming.

1668
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:05,288
I think I still have the receipt.
