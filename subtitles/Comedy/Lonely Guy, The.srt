1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,634
What you get is what you see

2
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,878
And you can bet
it's worth it, baby

3
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:32,593
'Cause what you get is me

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,522
Don't be afraid
to let it embrace you

5
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:41,590
I'm gonna show you
every little thing about love

6
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,538
- Yeah, yeah
- Do you really want it?

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,758
If you want it,
you can get it

8
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:46,357
If you get it, don't regret it

9
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,457
So what you gonna do?

10
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:52,184
Love is like a butterfly,
tapestry across the sky

11
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,076
Doesn't need a reason why I feel
it taking you and I

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,670
Higher and higher

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,645
So what you gonna do?

14
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,327
If you only knew
what I just dealt with.

15
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,919
I mean, this guy was right in
front of me, going little...

16
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,966
That guy deserves a ticket.
I'm sure he's...

17
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,179
A- A-A woman never
reveals her age.

18
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:10,426
I've been in this
relationship for...

19
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,892
He was going ten miles an hour
on the highway.

20
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,917
I'm trying to...

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,026
If you want it, you can get it

22
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:19,708
Higher and higher

23
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:23,160
"And only then
will the people of Tajikistan

know true and lasting peace. "

25
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:29,081
Andie, it's brilliant.

26
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,712
It's really moving.

27
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,169
<i>But it's never going to appear
in Composure Magazine.</i>

28
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,983
God, I busted my butt
in grad school

29
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:40,768
to be Andie Anderson,
"How to" girl,

30
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:42,625
and write articles like,

31
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:44,120
"How to Use the Best
Pick-Up Lines"

32
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:47,229

More Fun?"

34
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,752
I want to write about
things that matter,

35
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:53,471
like politics and
the environment,

36
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:55,896
and foreign affairs...
things I'm interested in.

37
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,249
Keep busting your butt.

38
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,746
You're going to get there.

39
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:01,538
Hey, I've got something
to cheer you up.

40
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:03,580
<i>You know that editor
from Sports Illustrated</i>

41
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,725
that you have been
shamelessly flirting with

42
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,172
on the phone for... whoo,

43
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:09,344
a month now?

44
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,485
He made a little delivery
this morning.

45
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:13,664
Ah, ha, ha, let me see.

46
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:14,684
Oh, no.

47
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,035
Hey!

48
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,094
Tomorrow night.

49
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:21,443
What happens tomorrow night?

50
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,326
Only the most exhilarating
and artistic display

51
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,115
of athletic competition
known to mankind.

52
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,711
The Ice Capades are in town?

53
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,435
No, the NBA Finals
are in town,

54
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,773
and I got tickets!

55
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,780
Come with me?

56
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,548
All right, I'll go.

57
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,275
But I am not putting out.

58
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:40,768
Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,

59
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,263
you'll be whistling
a different tune.

60
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:44,963
You know what I like.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,462
Good morning, ladies.

62
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:49,189
Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.

63
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,280
Michelle... haven't seen
her all morning.

64
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,169
- Have you?
- Ten to one she's wallowing.

65
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:57,861
It's my turn. I'll get her,
you get the coffee,

66
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:58,913
meet me in the corner in 20.

67
00:02:58,954 --> 00:02:59,903
Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,408
Here, take some samples.

69
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,556
Samples. Samples.

70
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,831
Great idea.

71
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,834
Oh, boy.
Drama, drama, drama.

72
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,793
I walked 47 miles of barb wire

73
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,933
I got a cobra snake
for a necktie

74
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:18,882
A brand-new house
on the road side

75
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,779
And it's made out
of rattlesnake hide

76
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:27,626
Come on, take a little walk
with me, baby

77
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:29,701
And tell me who do you love

78
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,116
Hey!

79
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:35,907
Who do you love?

80
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,957
Now around the town
I use a rattlesnake whip

81
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,170
Take it easy, baby,
don't you give me no lip

82
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,484
Who do you love?

83
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,698
Who do you love?

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,789
Hello, Ben.

85
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,378
Hey, hey, good morning, Spears.

86
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,271
What are you reading, girl?

87
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,004
You catching up on
your current events?

88
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,009
"Turn-On Tricks:
How to Make Him Hot. "

89
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,025
You know, if you want
to try those out sometime,

90
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,144
we should get together.

91
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>Green and I have
an appointment at Composure,</i>

92
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,554
the fastest growing women's
magazine in the country.

93
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:22,478
And seeing as how

94
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,107
our clients run a lot
of our campaigns

95
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,764
in their nationally-syndicated
little girlie magazine,

96
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:28,690
it wouldn't hurt you
to do a little reading.

97
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,348
Hey, Benny.

98
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:31,401
Good morning, Green.

99
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,523
You finally decided to show up?

100
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes, I did.

101
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,857
You ready?

102
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,881
Ready.

103
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,483
Later, Ben.

104
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:40,011
Have a nice day, ladies.

105
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:43,594
Hi.

106
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,414
Oh!

107
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,842
Good morning, sunshine.

108
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,251
Okay, get dressed.

109
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,233
Get dressed.

110
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:53,771
Staff meeting, 15 minutes.
Let's go.

111
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,732
I'm going back to bed.

112
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,530
I have no reason to live.

113
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:01,809
Sun's out. Oh...

114
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,668
Okay, just...

115
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,262
Okay, now...

116
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:08,337
Cashmere?

117
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,262
Put it on.

118
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,182
It'll make your eyes
look fiercely green.

119
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,459
Oh!

120
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,383
Get up. I'm not going
to let you lose your job

121
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,528
on top of everything else.

122
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,844
- Oh.
- Come here.

123
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,051
Oh, Andie.

124
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,364
Okay.

125
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,512
Okay.

126
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,893
You only dated the guy a week.

127
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:27,244
It was the best week of my life.

128
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,906
Sweetheart.

129
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,253
Good morning, ladies.

130
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,368
- What's up, Tito?
- Hey.

131
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:33,336
Warren Advertising.

132
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:35,092
Hi, yes, we're waiting for you.

133
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,056
Good morning.

134
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,714
What's up, kitty cat?

135
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,281
What's up, daddy?

136
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,304
Big night?

137
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:41,458
- Not bad.
- Orgy?

138
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:42,610
Where were you, man?

139
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,472
Not at an orgy.

140
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,521
Did you hear?

141
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:46,707
What, that my Knickerbockers

142
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,176
are now in
the championship series

143
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,128
and Tone "The Bone" here
owes me $20?

144
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,218
Pay him.

145
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,186
Oh, man.

146
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,462
Well, you were right.

147
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,572
DeLauer Diamonds is looking
for a new ad agency.

148
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:57,367
Warren wants to move
on it aggressively.

149
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,745
Yes!

150
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,878
Oh, oh, this is a good day,
this is a good day.

151
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:03,508
Guys, did you know
that diamonds are about

152
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,010
as common as taxis
on Fifth Avenue?

153
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,769
The value is entirely
sentimental,

154
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:08,884
maintained by a supply,

155
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,227
demand and advertising.

156
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,667
Stripes.

157
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,287
Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.

158
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,787
Meaning if I represent them,

159
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,066
I basically represent
the entire industry.

160
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,628
Tell him.

161
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,464
What?

162
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:22,712
Warren gave it to the Judys.

163
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,441
Spears and Green...
they're already on it.

164
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,623
No way!

165
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:27,222
Yeah, well, you know,
he's kind of partial

166
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,856
to hot, leggy chicks
for some reason.

167
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,618
Yeah, and we're the, you know,

168
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,637
the sneakers and beer division.

169
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:32,988
Precious gems aren't exactly
our forte.

170
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:36,155
Lips and Hips are over at
a chick's magazine right now.

171
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:37,915
I got to get to Warren
before they sink...

172
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,358
You can't, you can't.
He's on a plane.

173
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,668
Easy, pal.
The Chicago meeting.

174
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,046
And it's too late anyway,
because Warren's

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,673
meeting them for drinks
at Mullins' tonight

176
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:44,726
to discuss their ideas.

177
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:45,815
You know what?
This isn't happening.

178
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,034
You know why?
This was my tip.

179
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,599
It's going to be my pitch,
my account, my campaign.

180
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,135
- This is my baby.
- That's what I'm talking about.

181
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,158
They will not ace me
out of this.

182
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,208
- That's right.
- I heard that.

183
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,261
Okay.
Mullins', tonight.

184
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,029
"I heard that"?

185
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,872
Oh.

186
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:00,888
- Hi.
- Hi.

187
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:02,936
I- I don't really want
to talk about it, okay?

188
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:03,926
- Okay.
- Okay.

189
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,530
Okay.

190
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,505
Why does this always happen
to me?

191
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:10,489
Things were going great
for, like, a week and a half,

192
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:12,569
and then, all of a sudden,
it's over,

193
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:13,855
and I am mystified.

194
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,746
Seriously, I am mystified,

195
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,682
because it always starts out
so well.

196
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,803
Poor baby.

197
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,250
Let's just roll with this one.

198
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:23,935
Oh, Mike and I had
such a connection.

199
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,663
The first time that we had sex,

200
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,893
...it was so beautiful...

201
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,874
I cried.

202
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:34,980
You cried?

203
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,606
Yeah.

204
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,173
You mean, like,
one glistening tear

205
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:39,458
on your cheek, right?

206
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,566
No. I was really emotional.

207
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:44,192
I even told him
that I loved him.

208
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,757
After how many days?

209
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,813
Five.

210
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:48,229
Two.

211
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,751
It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.

212
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,279
Okay, well, what did he say?

213
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,491
Oh, Mike didn't have
to say anything.

214
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:57,382
I know that he felt the same.

215
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,449
But then he started
getting really busy,

216
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,862
and I didn't know where he was.

217
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:04,035
So I kept calling him
and calling him.

218
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:05,000
He was never home...

219
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,276
You kept calling him?

220
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:08,200
I didn't leave a message.

221
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,175
He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.

222
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:13,599
Oh, I-I'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.

223
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,754
You know, men frequently call

224
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,200
their friends'
answering machines

225
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,411
and hang up 20 times.

226
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,594
Anyway...

227
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,764
I know why he dumped me:

228
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,395
I'm too fat.

229
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,124
- You're not fat!
- You're not fat!

230
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:28,904
Oh, Michelle, if the most
beautiful woman in the world

231
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:29,866
acted the way you did,

232
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,328
any normal guy
would still go running

233
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,353
in the other direction.

234
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:35,461
Oh, no. No guy would go
running from you, Andie.

235
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:38,598
You could barf all over him,
and he would say, "Do it again. "

236
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,287
That is both
incredibly disgusting

237
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:43,080
and categorically untrue.

238
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:45,709
If I did the things you did,
I'd get dumped, too.

239
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:48,293
Okay, family,

240
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,786
shoes off.

241
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,725
And breathe.

242
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,563
Out.

243
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,573
Okay, Lori,
let's start with you.

244
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,516
Well, the "Botox for Beginners"
piece is done.

245
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:06,533
Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.

246
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,623
Now I'm on

247
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:08,743
"What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,"

248
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,190
which is also pretty scary,

249
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:11,205
but, you know, upbeat.

250
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,036
I finished my research
on deadly pedicures,

251
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:14,598
about the woman who contracted

252
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,265
that fungus
from the unsterilized tools.

253
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,060
Yeah.

254
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:19,175
It's a terrible story.

255
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,518
Although, surprisingly...

256
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:22,763
upbeat!

257
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,229
Marvelous.

258
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,273
What's next for
"'How to' with Andie"?

259
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,418
Well, I've been
working on something

260
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:30,537
that's kind of different.

261
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,333
It's...

262
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,352
It's a political piece,
and it's...

263
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,376
No.

264
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,587
<i>Andie, you work at
Composure Magazine.</i>

265
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,641
We are fashion,

266
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,722
trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

267
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,705
<i>salacious gossip...
that's Composure.</i>

268
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,121
- Okay, but...
- Look,

269
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,839
Andie, okay...
the column is new for you.

270
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,079
When you turn it
into a must-read,

271
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,385
then you can write
about whatever you want.

272
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,835
Until then, you can write
about whatever I want.

273
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,054
Understood?

274
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,652
Yeah.

275
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:57,805
Michelle, what have you got?

276
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,027
I'm sorry, Lana,

277
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,148
I wasn't feeling very well...

278
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,137
She got dumped.

279
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,515
Oh, no,

280
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,694
Michelle...

281
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,580
What a hellish ordeal for you.

282
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,501
But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.

283
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,744
Are we loving

284
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,991
the way she looks, all?

285
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,852
- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you are so right.

286
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,130
She looks great.

287
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,595
Well, I haven't eaten
since the split.

288
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,686
Good for you!

289
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,806
Write about it.

290
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,694
I can't use my personal life
for a story.

291
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,410
I understand completely.

292
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:30,447
Who will use Michelle's
personal life for a story?

293
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:31,381
Oh, I will.

294
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,692
- Go.
- No, no, no,

295
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:33,775
Lana,

296
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:34,764
with all due respect,

297
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:35,855
Lori has no business
mucking around

298
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:36,823
in my personal life,
and I can't...

299
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:37,685
I can't let her.

300
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,281
- I am...
- I'll do it.

301
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,727
What?

302
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,670
I'll... I will...
I'll sort of do it.

303
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,207
It's... You will be

304
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:45,198
my inspiration.

305
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,189
For?

306
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,371
Look at Michelle.

307
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,501
- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.

308
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,393
An amazing woman.

309
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,841
But she has a problem
hanging onto relationships,

310
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,060
and doesn't really know

311
00:10:59,098 --> 00:10:59,927
what she's doing wrong,

312
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,272
which is like a lot
of our readers.

313
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:02,419
Uh-huh.

314
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:08,023
So, I was thinking that
I could start by dating a guy,

315
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,041
and then drive him away,

316
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,156
but only using
the classic mistakes

317
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,562
most women, like Michelle,

318
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,483
make...

319
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:17,371
all the time.

320
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:18,965
I'll keep a diary of it,

321
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:25,944
and it will be sort of a...
dating "How to" in reverse.

322
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,861
What not to do.

323
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,748
Yeah.

324
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:33,684
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. "

325
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,614
Yes. Go.

326
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,240
Bart, what's new
in the shoe world?

327
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,067
Wait, wait, Lana, I'm sorry.

328
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,344
Why ten days?

329
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,798
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

330
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:44,984
Okay, what we found out

331
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,747
is men are attracted
to purple shoes.

332
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,277
Now, I love...

333
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,507
Maybe toss in something
spiritual as well.

334
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,892
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

335
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:56,864
The Dalai Lama.

336
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:57,944
He's fabulous. Ah!

337
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,162
Here's my 10:00. Welcome.

338
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,149
Hi.

339
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,462
Ladies, Judy Spears
and Judy Green

340
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,155
from Warren Advertising.

341
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:06,528
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins

342
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,489
for the fall.

343
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:10,337
Jeannie Ashcroft,
Fashion and Trends.

344
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:11,863
Michelle Rubin,
Fitness and Health.

345
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,051
Excuse me. Hi.

346
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,327
And Andie Anderson,
our resident "How to" girl.

347
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,672
Oh, I've seen
your column, Andie.

348
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:17,884
What are you working on now?

349
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,002
Oh, actually...

350
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:21,825
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. "

351
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,768
She's actually going
to start dating a guy,

352
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,753
and then drive him away
in a week and a half.

353
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:28,633
Sounds needlessly vicious.

354
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,886
It's going to be fabulous.

355
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,613
Now all she has to do
is run along

356
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,375
and find the lucky guy.
Go, go, go.

357
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,524
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

358
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:35,644
Good-bye.

359
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:36,960
Ladies, come.

360
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:37,923
Find the guy.

361
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,200
- Okay.
- Find the guy.

362
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,571
Oh, you are never going
to pull this off.

363
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,547
Watch me.
Tonight, I'll hook a guy.

364
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,116
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

365
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,165
Before the ten days are up,

366
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,091
I'm going to have this guy
running for his life.

367
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,394
You're not going to burn
his apartment down

368
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,121
or bite him or anything,
are you?

369
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:54,653
No! I'm going to limit myself

370
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:57,377
to doing everything girls
do wrong in relationships.

371
00:12:57,414 --> 00:12:59,519
Basically, everything
we know guys hate.

372
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,795
I'll be clingy, needy...

373
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,009
- Yeah.
- Be touchy-feely.

374
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:04,574
Ooh, call him in the middle
of the night,

375
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,371
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

376
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,780
What's wrong with that?

377
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm kidding.

378
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,688
Hello, Ben.

379
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,615
What are you doing here?

380
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,591
Phil, I'm here for
the meeting. Ladies.

381
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,844
But you weren't invited.

382
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,823
Yeah, but I should have been.

383
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,240
I mean, it was my tip

384
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:32,735
that DeLauer's shopping
for a new firm.

385
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,273
Yes, it was, but I have
to think in terms

386
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,005
of who's best-suited
within the company team.

387
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:39,042
Yes, sir, and that's me.
I want to handle this pitch.

388
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,279
Ben, you sell Joe Blow better
than anyone else in my shop,

389
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:43,908
but these girls sell luxury

390
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,314
better than anyone else
in the business.

391
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:48,551
We have to put our best foot
forward on this pitch.

392
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,244
DeLauer would be
our biggest account.

393
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,429
Yes, sir, they would.

394
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,020
Annual advertising billings
of 50- to $60 million.

395
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,521
And I am the man that's going

396
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,190
to bring this home
for you, Phil.

397
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,569
Why this place?

398
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,749
It's perfect.

399
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:00,771
Hi, Ingrid.

400
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,958
Hi.

401
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:04,550
Mullins' is the apres-work
watering hole

402
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,116
for the upwardly mobile.

403
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,139
Now, to date,

404
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:09,254
the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

405
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,181
sending the message
that the woman needs the man

406
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,556
to buy her the rock.

407
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:15,077
All right, they say,
"A diamond is forever. "

408
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:17,159
We say,
"A diamond is for everyone. "

409
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,278
I like that.
Yes.

410
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:19,246
We don't.

411
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,034
"A diamond is for everyone"

412
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:24,105
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

413
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:27,624
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

414
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,157
they lose their status.

415
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,541
Status is the reason

416
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,234
to buy them in the first place,

417
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,661
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

418
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,598
which you don't.

419
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:41,420
You can't feel bad about that,
Ben. No man does.

420
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:42,384
Here you go.

421
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,344
Thank you.

422
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:44,304
Thanks.

423
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,581
Oh! Sorry.

424
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,105
Here. Here.

425
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,250
Thanks.

426
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,657
Dum, dum, dum, dum,
dum, dum, dum...

427
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,413
Hey, don't pressure her.
She's perusing.

428
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,337
Yes, exactly. Hmm.

429
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,799
Hmm.

430
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:59,730
Selling a diamond to a woman

431
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:01,934
is like making her fall in love.

432
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,615
She has to feel giddy,
desirous, adventurous,

433
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,081
and desperate.

434
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,781
Take a look around
this room, Phillip.

435
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,919
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

436
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,029
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

437
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:17,200
are the same as those needed to
make a woman fall in love, yes.

438
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,698
I'm not talking about lust.

439
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,788
A woman in lust

440
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,138
wants chocolate.

441
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,474
A woman in love...
wants diamonds.

442
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah, I'm not talking

443
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,149
about lust, either, ladies.

444
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,742
I'm talking about deep,
meaningful,

445
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,570
head-over-heels,
his and her towels,

446
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:34,923
let's grow old together,
L- O-V-E.

447
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:38,763
Look, I love women. I do.

448
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:42,997
Whether they're four, 40,
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

449
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,973
I respect women, all right?

450
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:48,431
And I also listen... to women,

451
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:52,464
and that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

452
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:56,116
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin...

453
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,593
or with you?

454
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,316
Eh, either one.

455
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:00,847
Well, that's cocky, Ben.

456
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:03,158
No, not cocky... confident.

457
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:06,161
I'd like to see you prove that.

458
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,379
You would?

459
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,846
The agency's cohosting

460
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,737
a party for the DeLauers
at the Astor Museum.

461
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,559
The party's a week from Sunday.

462
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:14,804
Do you think you could make

463
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,500
a woman fall in love with you
by then?

464
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,611
Ten days?

465
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,211
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?

466
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,375
Any single, available,
straight woman... yes.

467
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:25,360
Yes.

468
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:26,777
I'm not trying
to trick you, Ben.

469
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,659
In fact, we'll choose
a woman right here,

470
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:31,382
right now, in this bar,

471
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,794
and then you decide.

472
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:33,722
Ooh.

473
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,695
So, who's the lucky girl?

474
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:37,626
Okay...

475
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,186
Let's see here. Ooh,

476
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:42,523
there's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

477
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,539
Whoa, ho, ho!

478
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:44,628
She looks like fun.

479
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:45,814
Be nice, ladies.

480
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:47,097
Or... wow,

481
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,540
<i>Miss Babylon Five.</i>

482
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,461
Now, she's on the prowl.

483
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,901
No.

484
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,144
Her.

485
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,491
Her who?

486
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:57,942
Her, in the gray dress.
Blonde hair. Pretty smile.

487
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,828
Her?

488
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:10,783
Done.

489
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:12,376
What?

490
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,977
Done.

491
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,543
Done.

492
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:19,032
See the guy next
to the horrible guy

493
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,942
in the green shirt that I would
never even consider? Okay?

494
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:22,999
- Hmm!
- Very cute.

495
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,024
Right?

496
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,275
- Good.
- All right?

497
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:26,841
Here I go!

498
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:30,458
Okay, you're on.

499
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,676
But here are the stakes.

500
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,274
After I win this bet,

501
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:34,656
this pitch is mine.

502
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,618
Agreed.

503
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,341
- Phil?
- Agreed.

504
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,234
You come to that party
with a girl

505
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,339
that's really in love
with you, Ben...

506
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:43,518
you can make the pitch
to the DeLauers.

507
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,149
But, Phillip, you can't...

508
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:48,057
I've made up my mind.

509
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,082
To the DeLauers.

510
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,400
To the DeLauers.

511
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,450
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

512
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:52,735
Cheers.

513
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,081
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

514
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,410
I was just wondering
if you find...

515
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,242
...exciting?

516
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,358
Yes. My wife and I love
New York,

517
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,924
especially this time of year.

518
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,689
She'd been here before,
and I'd...

519
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:07,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

520
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:08,797
This is Andie.

521
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,660
Hi. Um...

522
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:11,621
Oh!

523
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,668
You guys enjoy New York.

524
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,725
Okay.

525
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:14,628
Thanks. We will.

526
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:15,906
Yeah. Nice meet...
nice meeting you.

527
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:16,990
Eww!

528
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,379
Good luck!

529
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:22,659
Thank you, Phil.

530
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:25,379
Now, if you'll excuse me,
ladies...

531
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,757
I have a bet to win.

532
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,450
Ta-ta.

533
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,355
Now do you want to tell
me what's going on?

534
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:37,986
You don't recognize her?

535
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,831
Hi.

536
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:46,813
Hi.

537
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,198
Hi.

538
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,705
Andie Anderson.

539
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,120
I'm Benjamin Barry.

540
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:55,081
Cute.

541
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,041
Thank you.

542
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,667
I meant your name.

543
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,260
Thank you two times.

544
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,672
Unattached?

545
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,885
Currently.

546
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:03,851
Likewise.

547
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,923
Surprising.

548
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,273
Psycho?

549
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:08,802
Rarely.

550
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,054
Hmm.

551
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,237
Interested?

552
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,000
Perhaps.

553
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:14,378
Hungry?

554
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,933
Starving.

555
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:17,955
- Leaving.
- Now?

556
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:18,924
Mm-hmm.

557
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,419
Okay.

558
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,955
Okay.

559
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,404
One second.

560
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,542
I'll meet you at the door.

561
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,988
Hey, hey, guys.

562
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,429
What?

563
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,541
I think I got one.

564
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,988
He was married.

565
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,640
No, not him. It's the guy by
the door, but don't-don't look.

566
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,304
Oh, guys!

567
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:40,135
Oh! He is really cute!

568
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,150
I'm going to check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.

569
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,119
Okay.

570
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,079
And if he is?

571
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,900
Tomorrow night, we'll...

572
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,310
Flip the switch.

573
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,765
Doing this for you.

574
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:52,230
Well, good luck.
Be safe.

575
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:53,352
Call me.

576
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,505
Mm...

577
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:57,578
Drama, drama, drama.

578
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:02,796
...you

579
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,972
Wanna get to know you...

580
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,824
No, no, no. This one.

581
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:25,098
And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

582
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:29,675
This won't look goofy on me.

583
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,603
It looks goofy
on just about everybody.

584
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,807
Look at you.

585
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,405
That's pretty damn cute.

586
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:40,432
There you go.

587
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:49,613
You ready to go
for a ride, Andie?

588
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:52,502
Are you ready to go
for a ride, Ben?

589
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,822
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Get it? Get it?

590
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,009
Yeah.

591
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,705
Mmm. So, what do you think?

592
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:09,265
About the food, or... you?

593
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,311
Both.

594
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:12,879
This is delicious...

595
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,868
Mm-hmm.

596
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:16,051
...and I'm still deciding.

597
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,878
Anything I can do to help?

598
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,887
Yeah, you could answer some
questions for me, actually.

599
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,969
"Some" sounds
a little too indefinite.

600
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,089
I'll give you three.

601
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,722
What do you do for a living?

602
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,907
I'm in advertising.

603
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,604
I work mostly
with alcoholic beverage

604
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,103
and athletic equipment
companies,

605
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,829
and I'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.

606
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:32,793
Hmm...

607
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,760
Saving the world,
one keg party at a time?

608
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:38,104
Yeah, something like that.

609
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,762
What about you?

610
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,691
What about me?

611
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:46,967
Have I seen your work?

612
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,727
<i>I work at Composure.</i>

613
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:52,147
Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.

614
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:53,333
I'm impressed.

615
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,063
Saving the world,
one shop-a-holic at a time, eh?

616
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:58,646
Hey, all right.

617
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,092
Look here, Sparky,

618
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,718
I have a Master's
in journalism

619
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:02,870
from Columbia.

620
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,325
My boss loves me, and if I do it
her way for a while,

621
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,535
I can write about
anything I want.

622
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:10,265
Like shoes?

623
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:11,731
No.

624
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,694
No.

625
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,247
Like alcoholic beverages

626
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:18,392
and athletic gear.

627
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,075
Touché. Very nice.

628
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:24,567
So, you think you got me
all figured out, eh?

629
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,535
Almost.

630
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:28,863
Still got one last question.

631
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:31,263
Shoot.

632
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,369
True or false:

633
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,840
All's fair in love and war.

634
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,612
True.

635
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:47,544
Great answer.

636
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:50,204
Good question.

637
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:51,933
Welcome.

638
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,560
Oh, nice place.

639
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:58,531
Thank you.

640
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,676
Very... tidy.

641
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:01,699
Can I get you

642
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:03,008
a cold beer?

643
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:03,971
Sure.

644
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,530
Can I use your restroom?

645
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:06,554
Yeah, you can.

646
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,931
It's up the stairs,
through the bedroom.

647
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,860
You are, aren't you?

648
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,617
The first night.
I can't believe you!

649
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,595
Michelle, I'm not going
to sleep with him.

650
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,815
Oh, you are such a hussy.

651
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:20,347
You can't hide
those lying eyes.

652
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:23,456
No, no, because I can practice
some self-control,

653
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:25,152
unlike some people I know.

654
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,466
Oh, really?
That hurts, kind of.

655
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,809
Get up up on the dance floor

656
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:33,537
Give that man
what he askin' for

657
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:34,589
'Cuz I feel like...

658
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:36,486
I'm going to dangle the bait...

659
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,828
Wait, what's the bait?

660
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm the bait, Michelle.

661
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:40,481
- Oh...
- Yeah.

662
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,429
Okay, I'm with you. Then what?

663
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:44,032
It's gettin' hot in here

664
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:44,999
So hot

665
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:46,941
So take off all your clothes

666
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,221
- Mmm... Diamond...
- I am getting so hot

667
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:51,591
- is no one-night stand.
- I want to take my clothes off

668
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,032
It's gettin' hot in here

669
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,013
So hot

670
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,137
So take off all...

671
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:02,527
A diamond
is a long-term commitment.

672
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:03,879
Take notes.
You better be prepared...

673
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:05,223
I can't talk right now.
I have to go.

674
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,206
Call me later, you slut.

675
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,143
Okay. Bye.

676
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,847
Whatever you want to do

677
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:17,699
Is all right with me...

678
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,114
'Cause you make me feel

679
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:20,260
- There you go.
- Thank you.

680
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,673
You're welcome.

681
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,912
...so brand-new

682
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,377
I want to spend

683
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:31,340
Ooh.

684
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:35,399
My life with you

685
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:39,747
Let me say that since, baby

686
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,310
Since we've been together

687
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,272
Ooh, loving you forever

688
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,217
Is what I need

689
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,214
Let me be the one you come...

690
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,662
Okay.

691
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:02,958
...running to

692
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:11,110
I'll never be untrue

693
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:16,423
Oh, baby, let's

694
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:20,589
Let's stay together,
together

695
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:24,074
Loving you whether, whether

696
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:25,773
Times are good

697
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,461
Hey, hey, let's not go too fast,
okay?

698
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,473
Happy or sad

699
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:32,903
Yeah.

700
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,369
Yeah.

701
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:39,634
Ooh... ooh... yeah...

702
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:45,996
Whether times are good or bad

703
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,857
Happy or sad

704
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:49,299
We're moving too fast.

705
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,755
I... you're right.

706
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,683
It's-it's too fast.

707
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,539
...and break up

708
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,962
- Okay.
- Oh, turn around and make up

709
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:04,433
I just can't see

710
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:11,764
You'd never do that to me

711
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,425
- Too fast.
- Too fast.

712
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:14,837
Yeah.

713
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:17,522
I want you to respect me.

714
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,283
Loving you is all I see

715
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,247
I do.

716
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,905
Okay.

717
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:24,278
And I want your respect.

718
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:26,995
I respect you for respecting me.

719
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:29,399
I respect that.

720
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,215
Good.

721
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:44,376
Good night, Andie Anderson.

722
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:52,178
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

723
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,805
I'm going to make you wish
you were dead.

724
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,908
Poor guy.

725
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:09,113
Of all the women
Spears and Green

726
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:11,320
could have thrown at me,
this one is amazing.

727
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:14,008
Hanging with her for ten days
is going to be no problem.

728
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,834
Right, so, it's only
nine days longer

729
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:18,291
than you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?

730
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,188
That's why I didn't go
for the gold immediately.

731
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,149
Oh.

732
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,109
I'm taking my time.

733
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,768
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

734
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:25,083
Ten days is a marathon?

735
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:27,737
Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000-meter hurdle.

736
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:29,716
The point is, she's already
on the ropes, guys.

737
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:31,515
Wow, that-that's a lot
of sports analogies.

738
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:33,491
That it?

739
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:35,029
- That-that's it?
- That's it.

740
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,282
Have you looked inside?

741
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:37,245
No.

742
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:38,391
Do you have an ethical problem

743
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:39,773
with rifling through
a woman's purse?

744
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,018
Uh, yeah, I guess I do.

745
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:42,682
Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.

746
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,663
It's more like a clutch
or something.

747
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,591
Guys, a woman's purse,
all right...

748
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,079
it's her secret source of power.
All right?

749
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:51,095
There-there are many dark
and dangerous things in there

750
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,203
that we, the male species,
should know nothing about.

751
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:58,136
Oh. Unless, of course, she, uh,
left it behind intentionally

752
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,218
to secure a next-day call back.

753
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,502
Mm-hmm.

754
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,905
She's a very clever minx.

755
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:05,215
Oops, I'm sorry.
Oh, God. Um...

756
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,941
Oh, shit,
we got to clean that up.

757
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,025
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:11,842
Carefully. Carefully.

759
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:16,067
Oh, what have we here?

760
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,652
Let us see, let us see.

761
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:21,310
Oh... Knicks tickets...

762
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:22,592
Huh.

763
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:25,181
...for tonight's game.

764
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:27,007
Delivery, Andie.

765
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:28,222
Wow, look at those!

766
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,635
Oh, who are those for?

767
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,597
Andie,

768
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:31,709
oh, my God!

769
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,090
Where do you want these?

770
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,783
Who are these to?

771
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,827
Wait. "100 times... "

772
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,548
...more beautiful... "

773
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:41,793
Wait.

774
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,034
"... than 100 roses. "

775
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:44,998
Catchy.

776
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:47,071
The guy's in advertising.

777
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,485
He can't help it.

778
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,925
So, does this mean he's hooked?

779
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,774
This means he found
the Knicks tickets.

780
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:55,229
You left the tickets
in the purse?

781
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,384
Yeah.

782
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:58,911
You are just on a whole
different playing field.

783
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,160
Here you go.

784
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,599
Mm-hmm.

785
00:29:02,632 --> 00:29:03,744
Andie Anderson.

786
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,306
Hey, hey, pretty girl.

787
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,555
Guess what?

788
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:10,048
I got a really embarrassing
display of white roses.

789
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,169
Well, you are welcome.

790
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,183
Listen, I had a wonderful time
last night.

791
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,198
I have your bag.

792
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,151
Ah, I know.

793
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,398
I can't believe I left it there.

794
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,545
Yeah, well, you must need it
back, what with all the cash,

795
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:25,764
credit cards, and...

796
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:28,039
those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.

797
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,759
Sounds like you've been
peeking through my bag, Ben.

798
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:31,744
Oh, absolutely not.

799
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,543
Tony, my Art Director,
he's an oaf,

800
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,402
and he accidentally
knocked it over.

801
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:36,384
Ow, right!

802
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,467
Yeah, I'm a clumsy man.

803
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:40,068
All right, I'm sorry, though.

804
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:41,349
I'm going to the game

805
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,730
with somebody else.

806
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:43,909
Not anymore.

807
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:44,996
Besides, what?

808
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,011
You think you left your purse
at my place by accident?

809
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,776
No. Subconsciously,
you are dying

810
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,089
to take me to that game.

811
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,165
Denying your subconscious
desires

812
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:54,147
is extremely dangerous
to your health, young lady.

813
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,164
Does that psycho-babble
really work on anybody?

814
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:57,896
You tell me.

815
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,070
Andie, you're so bad.

816
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:06,089
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

817
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,371
7:30. Don't be late.

818
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,609
You got it. Bye-bye.

819
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:10,662
Bye.

820
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,278
And that's how it's done.

821
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,906
And that's how it's done.

822
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:24,586
Foul on Number 20,
Allan Houston.

823
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,399
Bullshit. Come on, ref!

824
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,389
What is that, ref?

825
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,673
Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways!

826
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,768
Oh, you're soft, man!

827
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,816
You were soft last year,
and you're still soft.

828
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:37,515
And he's 85% on the line
all year, too.

829
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:38,797
What was that?

830
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:47,631
There we go.
One more left. All right.

831
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,140
Come on, bud.

832
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,259
Defense!

833
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,333
Oh, oh, oh!
That's off!

834
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:01,648
Defense!

835
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:04,179
Knicks call. 20 second time out.

836
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:07,278
All right, take your five.
Take a minute...

837
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,942
This is all right.

838
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,297
Got 20 seconds.
20 second team.

839
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:17,491
Kiss me,
down by the broken treehouse

840
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:18,735
Swing me

841
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:22,516
Up on this hanging tire

842
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,227
Bring, bring,
bring your flowered hat

843
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:29,742
We'll take the trail
marked on your father's map

844
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,783
Oh, kiss me

845
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,540
Beneath the milky twilight

846
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:40,310
Lead me,
out on the moonlit floor

847
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,100
Lift your open hand.

848
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,819
Knicks' ball.

849
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:48,824
- Whoo!
- Bring it back.

850
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:49,750
Charge!

851
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,487
Work your arm, baby.

852
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,696
Go, baby.

853
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:57,656
Hold 'em up!

854
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:58,616
Charge!

855
00:31:58,649 --> 00:31:59,576
Benny?

856
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:00,853
Hold 'em up!
Work it, work it. Yeah?

857
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,686
Benny, I'm kind
of thirsty.

858
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:02,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

859
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:04,176
- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, could you get me a soda?

860
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:05,560
Yeah, just let me
tell you right now...

861
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,641
I'm parched.

862
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:07,893
...there's a minute and nine
left in the game,

863
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,135
- and then I'll go up and get it.
- I'm really thirsty.

864
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,250
I'll go get it.

865
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,778
Hey, hey, hey. You want...
you want it right now?

866
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:14,899
Yeah.

867
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:17,328
And no ice, Ben.

868
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,378
Thanks, Benny.

869
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,175
Lawrence Funderburke.

870
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:22,137
Oh, man!

871
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,978
Here's Sprewell with a fake.

872
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,533
Gets the step on Christie.
What a crossover...

873
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,979
Whoo, my man.
Coke, no ice.

874
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,125
Next line over, pal.

875
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:32,953
No ice. Hey, buddy?

876
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,859
Small coke, no ice.
Small coke, no ice.

877
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,178
Okay, you got it.

878
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,642
...beyond the three-point line,
fires!

879
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:39,613
Ah... no!

880
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:40,791
Man, don't let him have
that shot!

881
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,324
No. Does that mean
no, you don't want ice,

882
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:43,293
or no, you want ice?

883
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,114
No. No ice.
Coke, no ice.

884
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,223
And Don Chaney
wants to talk it over...

885
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:49,204
Oh, did you want a small?

886
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:50,457
No, I-I want that one
right there.

887
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,989
You know, for 25 cents more,

888
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:52,958
you could get a jumbo?

889
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:54,267
Okay, you take that right there.

890
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:54,935
Keep the change.

891
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,055
All right.

892
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,183
Charge!

893
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,201
Excuse me.

894
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,418
Ah...

895
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:08,384
Excuse me.

896
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,719
Come on! Score!

897
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,793
Come on, baby,
drive into the net!

898
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:13,781
Right there, right there.

899
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,970
Oh, thanks!

900
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,896
Hey, hold him, hold him.
Move it.

901
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,831
Set your pick! Watch
the three seconds! Traveling!

902
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:20,954
Ben, it's not diet.

903
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:22,488
- Huh? What?
- Ben, it's not diet.

904
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,832
Please, I'm so thirsty.

905
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,240
- All right, all right.
- With a lime.

906
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,161
- All right, okay, I got it.
- With a lime. Okay.

907
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,217
Shoot it!

908
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,031
Sprewell for the win!

909
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:40,995
Yes!

910
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
That was Sprewell!

911
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,878
It's all over!

912
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,804
The Knicks
have defeated the Kings

913
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:50,462
in the final seconds...

914
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,827
...Sprewell with
the game-winning shot,

915
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:58,116
and the Knicks over Sacramento:
97 to 96.

916
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,663
Oh, what an incredible game.

917
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:05,477
I've never seen a more exciting
game-ending play before.

918
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,478
Wow, well, neither have I.

919
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:09,533
Hey, hey, hey.

920
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:11,583
It's too bad you missed it.

921
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:13,957
Yep, it's too bad.

922
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:15,071
One second.

923
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:19,364
So...

924
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,342
you as nice as you seem, Ben?

925
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:24,863
No.

926
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:30,334
Good. Neither am I.

927
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:32,003
Oh, here.

928
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:35,396
Fifth and 12th, please.

929
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,408
See you later.

930
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:44,549
Horseshit.

931
00:34:44,587 --> 00:34:45,797
More horseshit.

932
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,682
The horseshit continues.

933
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:51,465
Horseshit. Come on, people.

934
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:52,841
We've got to do a lot better
than this

935
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:53,803
if we're going to com...

936
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:54,948
What?!

937
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,962
There's a phone call
for Mr. Barry.

938
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:58,564
Yeah, can you take a message,
Candi?

939
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:00,392
Uh, Mr. Barry, it's Andie.

940
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:04,331
- Make it quick.
- I will.

941
00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:06,601
It's line two, Mr. Barry.

942
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:07,585
Thank you.

943
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:11,533
Hello.

944
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:14,249
It's me!

945
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:15,562
Listen, I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

946
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:16,808
Can I call you back
in just a minute?

947
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:17,773
I miss you,

948
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:20,872
Benny boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.

949
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,634
Well, you know what?
I miss you, too.

950
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,012
Mm-hmm.

951
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,224
You busy tonight?

952
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:27,534
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

953
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,672
Why don't we catch a movie
or somethin'?

954
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,791
A movie... my choice?!

955
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,758
Your choice.

956
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,896
Oh, I'm so excited!

957
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,822
Okay. I'll call you later.

958
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:36,781
Bye-bye.

959
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:37,741
Bye.

960
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,287
Jonah!

961
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:46,256
Dad!

962
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,198
I always wanted a man
like Tom Hanks.

963
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:52,617
It's my favorite movie
of all time.

964
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:53,902
Yeah, me, too.

965
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:54,864
Shh!

966
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:57,418
What if something
happened to you?

967
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,320
What if I couldn't get to you?

968
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:02,791
What are you thinking about?

969
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,394
Nothing. I'm watching the movie.

970
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,018
Yeah, but what's on your mind?

971
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,139
Shh!

972
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:10,218
I like this movie.

973
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:13,739
Oh, so I suppose your mind
is a complete blank.

974
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,147
You are my family,
you're all I have.

975
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:17,193
Who is she?

976
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,145
Shh!

977
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:20,432
Who's who?

978
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:21,995
The girl you're thinking about.

979
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:23,083
Can't hear.

980
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,034
- I'm not thinking about a girl.
- Aah!

981
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:26,451
You can't watch Meg Ryan

982
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,412
- for two hours
- Shh!

983
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:29,267
And not be thinking
about another girl.

984
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,707
Uh...

985
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:33,010
You want to know what
I'm thinking about?

986
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,125
Yes.

987
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,173
I'm sitting here thinking

988
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:38,931
about how damn beautiful
you are.

989
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,591
That's what I'm thinking about.

990
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,964
Come on, let's watch this movie,
it's good.

991
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:46,795
Aww...

992
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,464
Benji.

993
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,255
Oh, sweetie!

994
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,987
I love sharing this with you.

995
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:56,951
Yeah.

996
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,293
Can't hear and can't see.

997
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:00,816
If you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over here

998
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:01,969
is going to come back there

999
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,896
and pummel your ass.

1000
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:04,943
Put a muzzle on your old lady

1001
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,479
the next time
you bring her out in public.

1002
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,415
What?!

1003
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,376
What is that?!

1004
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:09,336
Do something about...

1005
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:10,645
- You, outside.
- Shh!

1006
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,760
Keep it down!

1007
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:14,190
Keep it down!

1008
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,760
I mean, have a little class,
all right?

1009
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,940
You want to talk like that
to me, we can work it out,

1010
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:19,123
but not to a lady, all right?

1011
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:20,689
Ben, Ben, B-B-Ben, he's huge.

1012
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,218
I got it. I'm not looking to get
in a fight with the guy, okay?

1013
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:24,568
He owes you an apology.

1014
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:27,896
Oh! Oh, whoa!

1015
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:29,786
Now, I'm going to go
back inside,

1016
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:32,208
<i>and finish watching
Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

1017
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,462
Nobody screw with me.

1018
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,387
Son of a... bitch.

1019
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,761
- Oh, Ben.
- Aah!

1020
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,723
Are you okay?

1021
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,000
- Oh...
- Ben,

1022
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:39,963
- Ben, Ben,
- Ow, ah-ah-ah. Yes?

1023
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,141
Maybe we should
get you to a hospital.

1024
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,108
No. No, no, no, no.

1025
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,356
No, you could have a...
Excuse me!

1026
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:44,858
Uh-uh-uh, hey, hey,
can you hold still,

1027
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:45,939
right there, hold still?

1028
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:47,061
Okay, I'm sor...

1029
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,522
Oh, ooh... oh.

1030
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:50,492
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:51,453
That's feeling real nice.

1032
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,413
Ben... Ben...

1033
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:53,558
I'm starting to feel
a little better.

1034
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:54,645
Ben...

1035
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,180
Ben!

1036
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:58,707
Oh, my God!

1037
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,927
You're fine.

1038
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:02,421
Oh, you are totally fine.

1039
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,207
Okay, come on, Rocky.

1040
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:06,173
No, no...

1041
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:07,100
Get up.

1042
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,676
Ouch. Huh?

1043
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,799
Yeah.

1044
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,766
Hey, don't feel bad.

1045
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,360
If I had a nickel for every time

1046
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,733
I got in a fist fight
during a chick flick, whoo!

1047
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,109
Uh-huh, right.
It really wasn't that bad.

1048
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:19,387
Really?

1049
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,791
No. I mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?

1050
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:23,001
Well...

1051
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,723
But the getting taken care of
after the punch... it was nice.

1052
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,865
All right! Florence
Nightingale syndrome, yeah.

1053
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,076
You want me to tape the game
for you tonight?

1054
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:31,673
No need, my friend.

1055
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:33,142
I'll be watching the Knicks

1056
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,552
from the comfort of my
own home this evening.

1057
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:37,625
- How'd you swing that?
- Oh, yeah.

1058
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,910
What's good to grill?

1059
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:39,927
- No.
- Heavyweight.

1060
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,344
You're making the lamb.

1061
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:42,305
Voilà.

1062
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,509
A woman loves a man
who can cook, yeah?

1063
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:45,757
Bringing out the big guns.

1064
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:47,005
- Let's go deep.
- I like it.

1065
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:49,050
Why do they always
forget my bacon?

1066
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:51,906
I can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.

1067
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:53,826
Only for a few seconds.

1068
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:59,227
He was the most adorable,
unconscious man ever. Mm-hmm.

1069
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,748
Are you dating him, or are you
contemplating adoption?

1070
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,387
Andie, I am loving
your notes on this piece.

1071
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:11,067
Thank you, Lana.

1072
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:12,386
When are you seeing him again?

1073
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:14,145
Tonight.

1074
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:16,603
He's invited me over for dinner.

1075
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,224
Marvelous. I've got
a feeling about this one.

1076
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:21,691
Thanks, Lana.

1077
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,971
I hate it when she pops
her head in like that.

1078
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:25,413
Ahem!
I never noticed it.

1079
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,940
I heard that.

1080
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:30,299
And Andie, tonight,
take smaller bites.

1081
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:34,687
Oh, my God!

1082
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,639
Disgusting.
I can barely eat over here.

1083
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,118
You know you could've
been a candle

1084
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:43,559
Come on in. Door's open.

1085
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,153
I'm holding you so tight

1086
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:46,883
You know you could've been
a handgun

1087
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,676
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1088
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,600
I hope you brought
your appetite, girl.

1089
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:51,561
Whew.

1090
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,154
We got a feast tonight.

1091
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,120
Hmm.

1092
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:56,390
- And baby so, so sweeted
- Mmm...

1093
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:58,465
Oh...

1094
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,131
You know you could've been
some bird food Benny,

1095
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,097
isn't that sweet?

1096
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,057
Hmm?

1097
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,392
Go on and pour yourself
a glass of wine.

1098
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:06,020
We got diner in about five

1099
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,946
and tip-off in about eight.

1100
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:09,734
Great. I'm starving.

1101
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,178
The way you do
the things you do

1102
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,099
As pretty as you are
Ah...

1103
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,057
Mmm...

1104
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:15,499
You know you could've
been a flower

1105
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:16,459
Ah...

1106
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:20,070
If looks were minutes

1107
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:21,864
You know you could've
been an hour

1108
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,144
Oh...

1109
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,068
Well, you could've
been anything you wanted to

1110
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:26,475
So perfectly pink!

1111
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,744
I can tell you

1112
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:31,912
The way you do the things
you do, all right

1113
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:34,338
The way you do
the things you do

1114
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:42,244
<i>Pour la pièce de résistance.</i>

1115
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,043
Ah...

1116
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,309
Sheryl, Tori,

1117
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:52,165
Sinead, Jewel, Fiona, Carly...
gang's all here!

1118
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,603
Great.

1119
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,323
Got two minutes to game time.

1120
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,840
You walked into the party

1121
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,874
Like you were walking
onto a yacht

1122
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:10,215
You had strategically dipped
below one eye

1123
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:13,519
Your scarf... it was apricot

1124
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:16,138
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

1125
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:18,447
- You had one eye in the mirror
- Those are cute and...

1126
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:20,718
- As you watched
- I saw the...

1127
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:23,274
- Yourself gavotte
- the new comforter.

1128
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,355
And all the girls dreamed that

1129
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:28,777
They'd be Ben's partner,
they'd be Ben's partner

1130
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,503
And you're so vain
What you got in the box?

1131
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,198
Oh.

1132
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:35,275
You probably think
this song is about you

1133
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:36,657
It's a baby fern.

1134
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:38,415
Really? Oh, yeah?

1135
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:40,143
Just like our relationship.

1136
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,726
A helpless little baby
in need of tender loving care.

1137
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,619
Don't you? Don't you?

1138
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:47,700
Thank you.

1139
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,488
You had me several years ago

1140
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:50,572
- Turn it down.
- Ooh!

1141
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,074
Okay, let's check out
the starting line

1142
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:53,045
Have a seat.

1143
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,322
For the New York Knicks.

1144
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:56,561
- At the point, Latrell Sprewell
- Get ready. Mm-hmm.

1145
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,275
Game two. Welcome to
the front row, madam.

1146
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,677
Oh, oh. Here.

1147
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,394
Mm-mm-mm, mm-hmm.

1148
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,674
Dinner is served.

1149
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,078
Chef's special tonight.

1150
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,020
Lamb with a cherry glaze.

1151
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:14,838
Start you off
with the main dish

1152
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:16,813
right about there.

1153
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,307
A few carrots.

1154
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:22,232
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

1155
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:23,671
You okay?

1156
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:25,527
It's beautiful.

1157
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:29,109
Thanks.

1158
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:30,389
You're beautiful.

1159
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,116
The game, the whole thing.

1160
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:37,586
I wish I ate meat.

1161
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:42,770
Mary had a little lamb

1162
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,337
Little lamb...

1163
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,563
You have to take it away
before I gag.

1164
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,170
This stuff's for cows.

1165
00:42:58,523 --> 00:42:59,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1166
00:42:59,835 --> 00:43:01,079
How you doing?

1167
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:04,182
Oh, aw, it's just
a little indigestion.

1168
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:05,715
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1169
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:06,803
All right.

1170
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,372
Uh, excuse me, m'am?

1171
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:10,650
Do you happen to know the
score of the Knicks game?

1172
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:12,212
Do I look like
the kind of person

1173
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:14,042
who knows the score
of a Knicks game?

1174
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:15,900
No, you don't.

1175
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:21,427
Is something wrong
with the barley?

1176
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,772
No, no.

1177
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,125
My boyfriend thinks I'm fat!

1178
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,803
And I can't eat
in front of him!

1179
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,181
I can't eat in front of you!

1180
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,900
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don't think you're...

1181
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:41,562
I don't think you're fat.

1182
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:47,034
I don't think she's fat.

1183
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:57,369
What's happening?

1184
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,744
Spre just turned up;
23 seconds left.

1185
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:01,185
Knicks' ball.

1186
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:02,462
Get the ball, man.

1187
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,643
Oh, come on!

1188
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,217
Throw it!

1189
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:06,463
Oh! That was in!

1190
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:07,513
- Oh, man!
- Oh...

1191
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:08,537
Come on, get it back.

1192
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,451
Come on.

1193
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,498
Get the ball back,
get the ball back!

1194
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,001
Jackson takes the ball.

1195
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,221
A spin by Jackson.

1196
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,187
- Get it back!
- No!

1197
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,300
Damn!

1198
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,420
And the time has run out.

1199
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,475
- Damn!
- Pick up!

1200
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,945
The Kings have beaten
the Knicks.

1201
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,363
Their first win in the series.

1202
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:24,857
Next game.

1203
00:44:32,198 --> 00:44:34,085
Well, that was fun.

1204
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:37,434
Okay. 11:25.

1205
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:38,819
Sports.

1206
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:40,098
Ah, there we are.

1207
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,694
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1208
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:44,931
Then it's Mark Jackson with
a no-look pass to Kirk Thomas...

1209
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:46,211
Sorry we missed the game.

1210
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:48,003
Post, post. Reverse it!

1211
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,625
30 seconds left in the game,
Sprewell...

1212
00:44:50,663 --> 00:44:51,329
There we go, baby!

1213
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:52,611
Oh, I can't believe

1214
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:53,989
he missed that shot.

1215
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,268
Take it, take it!

1216
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:57,605
- 12 seconds left, the game...
- Pitch! Aah!

1217
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,680
How the hell did you know
he was going to miss that shot?

1218
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,411
...with a narrow Monroe move.

1219
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,139
He always misses... the shot

1220
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:04,867
...the way it ended...
- from the top of the key.

1221
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:07,271
...as the Knicks
could not get off another shot.

1222
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,619
Aah, man.

1223
00:45:13,097 --> 00:45:14,242
Houston never misses

1224
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:16,288
from the top of the key.

1225
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,975
Oh!

1226
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,833
- Whoa.
- Mmm...

1227
00:45:27,147 --> 00:45:29,536
Does Princess Sophia
want to come out and play?

1228
00:45:29,642 --> 00:45:32,774
Who's Princess Sophia?

1229
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,696
- No, no, no, no... no!
- Ow!

1230
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,146
Aw, yo-yo-yo-you...

1231
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:41,066
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
y- you're kidding me, right?

1232
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:42,571
Princess Sophia?

1233
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:44,360
Little, big, little,
big, I don't know.

1234
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:45,574
We will find out!

1235
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,019
Ah, you know,
hang on a second.

1236
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:47,946
Ah, no, no.

1237
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:50,823
All right, listen.

1238
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,227
You can't name my... my member

1239
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:54,854
Princess Sophia.
It doesn't...

1240
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:56,235
Yes, I can.

1241
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:57,382
Listen. L-L-Listen to me.

1242
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:59,788
If-If you're going to name...
my member, all right,

1243
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:02,189
you got to name it something
hyper-masculine, okay?

1244
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:04,873
Something like Spike or Butch,
or Krull, the Warrior King,

1245
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,957
but not Princess Sophia.

1246
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,208
What did you just say?

1247
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:09,702
Spike.

1248
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:11,019
You know what I mean?

1249
00:46:11,055 --> 00:46:13,062
No, no, after Spike.

1250
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,866
Butch.

1251
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,332
After Butch.

1252
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,489
Krull... Krull,
the Warrior King.

1253
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:25,896
Does Kr-rull, the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

1254
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,395
- Oh, come on...
- No.

1255
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,745
...Krull.

1256
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:34,640
You know what?

1257
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:35,949
Due to...

1258
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:38,952
intense humiliation,
the King has...

1259
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:41,416
momentarily abdicated
his throne.

1260
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,400
- Okay?
- Oh, uh-oh!

1261
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:44,904
Yeah.

1262
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:47,248
Well, in that case...

1263
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,136
I'd better get going.

1264
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:54,796
Take care of our love fern,
honey.

1265
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:15,029
Hi. Mm.

1266
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:16,174
Can I see you tomorrow?

1267
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:17,707
Really?

1268
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,277
I hope so.

1269
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,710
Call me.

1270
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,678
I will.

1271
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,659
And I'll call you.

1272
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:24,629
Sweet dreams.

1273
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:26,550
Answer your phone!

1274
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:27,859
What?

1275
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:30,710
What was "icy" again?

1276
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,902
"Arctic, freezing, frigid. "

1277
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:35,351
How about "glitter"?

1278
00:47:35,383 --> 00:47:37,107
Thayer's favorite movie.

1279
00:47:37,143 --> 00:47:38,256
It was underrated.

1280
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:39,408
Huh?

1281
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:41,717
"Glint, glisten,
scintillation. "

1282
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:43,825
"Scintillation... "
that's not bad.

1283
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:44,977
Aw, that sucks.

1284
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:46,293
Guys, let's take a break.

1285
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:48,117
Huh? A little coffee
and nine-ball.

1286
00:47:48,152 --> 00:47:49,232
Shake it out.

1287
00:47:49,273 --> 00:47:51,378
Maybe I'll be able
to concentrate

1288
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,068
since the woman
is driving me crazy.

1289
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:55,993
Which woman... Andie,
or Princess Sophia?

1290
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:56,953
- Ah!
- Uh-huh.

1291
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:58,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1292
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,193
Wait a second.

1293
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:01,113
I thought you said
after the Knicks game

1294
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,388
that she was a goddess.

1295
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,793
Oh, she was. That was
the good Andie, guys.

1296
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:06,768
This amazing, fun,
cool, sexy woman.

1297
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,949
I'm talking
about the evil Andie, now.

1298
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,067
It's like a...

1299
00:48:10,107 --> 00:48:12,628
it's like a crack-enhanced
Kathie Lee Gifford.

1300
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,325
She... she's
probably bipolar.

1301
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,785
Well, her South Pole's
definitely prevailing.

1302
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:20,603
Well, all you gotta do
is rock it for five more days.

1303
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:21,563
Muffin!

1304
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:23,189
Which shouldn't be
too difficult.

1305
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:24,438
- Hi!
- Andie!

1306
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:25,752
- My little muffin.
- Hey, sweetie.

1307
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,033
We were just talking about you.

1308
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,246
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

1309
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:29,910
How are you?
You look gorgeous.

1310
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:30,876
Oh, thank you.

1311
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,469
Andie, this is Tony,
and this is Thayer.

1312
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,437
- Oh, yes.
- Hey.

1313
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,226
Benny Wenny's told me
so much about you two.

1314
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,749
Oh, well, Benny Wenny's said
wonderful things about you, too.

1315
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,870
Oh...

1316
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,666
Oh, they don't look
so simple-minded.

1317
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:41,782
Honey,

1318
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:42,749
Hmm?

1319
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:43,709
Look what

1320
00:48:43,742 --> 00:48:44,789
I got for us. Oh.

1321
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:47,031
Look at that.

1322
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:49,590
Oh, wow!

1323
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:51,192
- Ooh!
- Look at him go. What is it?

1324
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:52,660
Jumper.

1325
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:55,005
It's a Chinese Crested,
of course.

1326
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,120
No kidding.

1327
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,850
- A Chinese Crested.
- Mm.

1328
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,611
So, it-it's like a dog, right?

1329
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,444
Oh, hey.

1330
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,429
There he is.

1331
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:02,650
Ooh, Ben. Ben.

1332
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:03,703
You got a dog.

1333
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:04,922
You're hurting Krull's feelings.

1334
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,626
Krull, is it?

1335
00:49:05,664 --> 00:49:08,086
Krull. Krull, the Warrior King.

1336
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:10,169
Well, sure, 'cause
that's clearly what... Yeah.

1337
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,136
Oh, oh, oh.

1338
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:12,096
Oh, wait, there's more.

1339
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,056
What do you got there?

1340
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,016
Oh, nice.

1341
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:14,976
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

1342
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:16,570
- Get out of town.
- Try it on.

1343
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,552
That's like the...
inside of a raincoat.

1344
00:49:18,594 --> 00:49:20,089
- Medium. Oh, yeah.
- It matches! Try it on.

1345
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,301
Now, that is going to fit
nicely, sweetie, thank you.

1346
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:23,265
No, Ben, put it on.

1347
00:49:23,298 --> 00:49:24,476
No, you should try
it on. Otherwise,

1348
00:49:24,514 --> 00:49:25,921
you don't know if it's
going to fit or...

1349
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:26,882
Oh, go for it.

1350
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:28,125
That has never hurt anybody.

1351
00:49:28,163 --> 00:49:29,690
Huh? Huh?
I was just gonna save it

1352
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:31,225
for a better occasion,
all right?

1353
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,056
Check that out.

1354
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:34,553
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1355
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,970
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1356
00:49:36,004 --> 00:49:37,116
You're a vision in khaki.

1357
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:41,409
It's going to be
a happy little family,

1358
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:43,866
Just the three of us.

1359
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:45,916
We are, aren't we?

1360
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:47,550
Wow.

1361
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:49,280
He's our boy, Ben.

1362
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:50,724
Oh, see, that's sweet.

1363
00:49:51,685 --> 00:49:53,890
Mm-hmm, hey, mm-hmm.

1364
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,616
Whoa, ho, ho, ho,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1365
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,858
Andie, hey, it's good
to see you, too, sweetie.

1366
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,876
Ah, I got you.

1367
00:49:58,918 --> 00:49:59,966
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1368
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:00,933
Gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha.

1369
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:01,894
Oh...

1370
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:03,814
He's just
not potty-trained yet.

1371
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:05,090
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1372
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,075
Okay, well, he's a pisser.

1373
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:09,318
Come here, little tinkle king.

1374
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:10,366
No, no, no.

1375
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,487
Come here, tinkle king.

1376
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:13,088
- He is a tinkle king.
- Oh, yeah.

1377
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:14,851
Who's my little tinkler?
You tinkle tinkles.

1378
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:15,934
Well, congratulations,

1379
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:16,958
little plaid family.

1380
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,407
We, you know,
we got a whole bunch

1381
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,869
of work we got to do,
but we're...

1382
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:20,839
we're still on for poker

1383
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:21,919
at your house this weekend?

1384
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:23,390
- Oh, you count on it.
- Whoo! Boys' night.

1385
00:50:23,432 --> 00:50:24,359
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

1386
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:25,320
Yeah, it was nice meeting you,

1387
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:26,280
Nice to meet you.

1388
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:27,240
And, of course, Krull.

1389
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:28,352
- Bye. Say bye, Krullie.
- All right.

1390
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:29,767
A little soap and water
will take that out.

1391
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:30,728
He goes, "Woof, woof. "

1392
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,655
Yeah, thank you, buds.

1393
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,601
Oh, come here. Ooh.

1394
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:35,976
Do you love him?

1395
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:36,937
Oh, I do.

1396
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:39,108
Oh, look at Krull's necklace.

1397
00:50:39,146 --> 00:50:42,277
He's got more ice than
Liberace, don't you?

1398
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:43,973
Oh, it's just a little frosting.

1399
00:50:47,115 --> 00:50:48,609
Frosting?

1400
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:51,139
Frosting.

1401
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:52,161
We were thinking bold,

1402
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:53,218
new, fresh.

1403
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,332
"Frost yourself. "

1404
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:56,299
Excuse me?

1405
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:57,444
"Frost yourself... "

1406
00:50:57,484 --> 00:50:59,110
The slogan for the campaign.

1407
00:50:59,148 --> 00:51:00,261
You frost a cake.

1408
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,667
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Benjamin.

1409
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,904
I'm talking about diamonds.
They're frosting.

1410
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:07,308
As in, "Whoa, would you
check out her frosting?"

1411
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,747
- Frost yourself.
- Frost yourself.

1412
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:10,058
How did you come up with it?

1413
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:11,021
I got it off the woman

1414
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:12,580
who is falling
madly in love with me.

1415
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:13,549
Oh...

1416
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:14,727
It may have possibilities,

1417
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:17,516
but as far as the woman who's
falling madly in love with you,

1418
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,011
I will decide that at the party.

1419
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:20,331
If he can get her there.

1420
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:23,628
Now, just think about it...
ladies, frost yourself.

1421
00:51:23,662 --> 00:51:25,320
Frost yourself.

1422
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,820
Mm-hmm. We could introduce it
at the party.

1423
00:51:26,863 --> 00:51:27,495
It-It should be the theme.

1424
00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:27,982
Yes.

1425
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:29,127
Everything frosted.

1426
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:30,215
- All of it.
- Martini glasses.

1427
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,181
Chandeliers.

1428
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:32,840
Ah, jewels everywhere.

1429
00:51:32,879 --> 00:51:33,446
The women.

1430
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:34,698
The whole party...

1431
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:36,142
a sparkling diamond.

1432
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,670
All of it frosted.

1433
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,226
Women of New York!

1434
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,988
Frost yourselves!

1435
00:51:43,024 --> 00:51:45,326
Hey, frost this!

1436
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:47,052
Well, I like it.

1437
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:52,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1438
00:51:52,337 --> 00:51:54,126
yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1439
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:56,398
You have 17 new messages.

1440
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,638
Message one. Received at 5:44.

1441
00:51:58,674 --> 00:51:59,787
Oh. Sit down. Sit.

1442
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,834
Hi, sweetie pea. It's me.

1443
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:02,802
Where are you?

1444
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:03,947
I'm not home.

1445
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:06,026
Received at 5:47.

1446
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:09,231
Benny, it's Andie.
Guess you're not home.

1447
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,951
Three. Received at 5:48.

1448
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:13,362
Benny Bear, are you not
answering your phone?

1449
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:14,508
Yeah, I am.

1450
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:16,238
Four. Received at 5:49.

1451
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:17,388
Hey, buddy.

1452
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:18,922
Game three tonight. Blondie's.

1453
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:20,208
Don't be late
or I will kill you.

1454
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:22,164
Who is it?!

1455
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:23,309
It's me.

1456
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,836
Five. Received at 5:52.

1457
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,436
It's me.

1458
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,492
Ah!

1459
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:29,548
Ow!

1460
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:30,637
Ow!

1461
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:31,790
What a surprise.

1462
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:33,203
Tried to get ahold of you.

1463
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:34,165
Yeah?

1464
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,086
I did something kind of wacky.

1465
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:37,814
Eh?

1466
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:39,949
Yes. I used Photoshop
at work today

1467
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,964
to composite our faces together

1468
00:52:42,006 --> 00:52:44,308
to see what our kids
would look like.

1469
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:45,836
Our... Family... Album!

1470
00:52:57,943 --> 00:53:00,464
You don't want
to see our children?

1471
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:03,537
We don't have...

1472
00:53:03,576 --> 00:53:04,624
children.

1473
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:17,651
I hate you.

1474
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:20,882
You know what?

1475
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:21,936
I'm sorry. No, no, no.

1476
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:23,801
I didn't mean it
like that, all right?

1477
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,071
I... Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

1478
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:27,034
Please show me.

1479
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:28,376
We don't have children!

1480
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,418
Oh, I thought you meant...
Krull.

1481
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:31,637
I just want to...

1482
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,366
Will you show them to me?

1483
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:35,061
You don't want to see them.

1484
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,401
I do. Please, please
show them to me.

1485
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,258
I really do
want to see them.

1486
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:41,496
Really?

1487
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:42,460
Yeah.

1488
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:43,441
Okay.

1489
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,195
Oh, that's our wedding.

1490
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:51,803
And this is our first child...

1491
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:53,081
Benny, Jr.

1492
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:54,392
Yeah.

1493
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,814
Oh, there's us

1494
00:53:57,854 --> 00:53:59,316
vacationing in Hawaii.

1495
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:01,725
Little Andie's
on my shoulders

1496
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,027
and dum-da-da-dah,

1497
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:05,077
Benjamin, Jr. On yours.

1498
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:06,428
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:07,411
There's little Andie.

1500
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:08,884
Oh, there are the kids

1501
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:10,934
in Switzerland,
yodel-odel-ing.

1502
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:13,823
Our kids are really...

1503
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,000
attractive.

1504
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:22,846
Yeah!

1505
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,727
Ah, hey, Mom.

1506
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,254
Ah, yeah, I'm-I'm doing fine.

1507
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, she is.

1508
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,505
Just a second.

1509
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:30,617
It's for you.

1510
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:32,762
Oh, great.

1511
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:34,689
Hey, Glenda.

1512
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:36,282
Why is my mom
calling you?

1513
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:37,249
Shh.

1514
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:40,315
I just showed him.

1515
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:42,426
Yeah, well, he
thinks our children

1516
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,216
will be very attractive.

1517
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:48,441
Oh, no.

1518
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:51,358
All right,
you go back to cooking.

1519
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:52,475
Call me later.

1520
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:54,239
Tomorrow. Yeah, great.

1521
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:55,290
Okay, Glenda.

1522
00:54:55,331 --> 00:54:56,411
Love you, too. Bye.

1523
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:58,619
Thanks, honey.

1524
00:54:58,659 --> 00:54:59,805
Yeah.

1525
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,090
So you and my mom,
you talk, huh?

1526
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,039
Yeah, I called
her to get some

1527
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:08,987
baby pictures of
you for our book.

1528
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:10,938
Hey, you never told me...

1529
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:12,955
that you wore diapers
till you were five.

1530
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:17,084
You know what, honey,
I got to go to the...

1531
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:18,074
Uh-oh.

1532
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,387
Ah, no,

1533
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:21,762
come on, man.

1534
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:24,187
You think maybe he thinks
the felt is grass?

1535
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:51,682
Oh...

1536
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:53,314
Oh, man.

1537
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:00,969
Oh!

1538
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:06,305
Ah... Ah... No, no,

1539
00:56:06,347 --> 00:56:07,809
No, man! Come on!

1540
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,051
Hey, Benny Bear?

1541
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:16,360
Hey!

1542
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:17,476
Do you have plans tonight?

1543
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:18,858
Tonight?

1544
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:20,321
I have another surprise for you.

1545
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:22,731
Ah... you know what?

1546
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:24,652
Not a good night for me.

1547
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,243
I- I, I gotta work.

1548
00:56:26,284 --> 00:56:27,528
- Of all things.
- Oh, no.

1549
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:28,490
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1550
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:29,451
We got a Knicks game on.

1551
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:31,142
I had a broccoli-
and-asparagus casserole

1552
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:33,385
planned for you and me,
right there in front of the TV,

1553
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,331
and we're not going to be able
to do that either,

1554
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:36,584
'cause I got to go in to work.

1555
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:39,306
That's too bad, 'cause
I had tickets for tonight.

1556
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,230
Tickets?

1557
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:42,986
Tickets! Great tickets.

1558
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:45,324
Front row seats,
right in the action.

1559
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,148
I mean, you can smell...

1560
00:56:47,183 --> 00:56:49,223
the sweat.

1561
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:51,783
I guess...

1562
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:53,384
I...

1563
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:55,212
I don't really have to.

1564
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:56,622
Oh, why don't I

1565
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:58,696
call Tony, and he can come
fill in for me, right?

1566
00:56:58,736 --> 00:57:00,110
Great.

1567
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:02,597
Oh, yeah! Thank you.

1568
00:57:02,641 --> 00:57:04,429
Honey, you're more than welcome.

1569
00:57:04,465 --> 00:57:07,313
Yes!

1570
00:57:07,345 --> 00:57:09,866
Oh, look what time it is. Huh?

1571
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:13,966
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime experience,

1572
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,423
and I'm going
to share it with you.

1573
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:24,110
Reaches up,
she brings it down.

1574
00:57:24,146 --> 00:57:26,252
It was the most
powerful thing

1575
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,665
I've ever... seen.

1576
00:57:30,003 --> 00:57:32,305
And after all this,
he still didn't leave you?

1577
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,761
Oh, I'm telling you,
this calls for drastic measures.

1578
00:57:34,803 --> 00:57:35,851
Come on, guys,

1579
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:37,168
concentrate.

1580
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,854
Are you being clingy?

1581
00:57:39,892 --> 00:57:42,161
Clingy, needy, whiny...

1582
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:43,571
Baby talk?

1583
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:46,769
Occasionally. I mean,
I could kick that up a notch.

1584
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:49,073
I used to obsess
over Mike's old girlfriends.

1585
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:51,857
Or better yet, talk about
all your old boyfriends.

1586
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:53,552
It's good, it's good, it's good,

1587
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:55,378
but it's not going
to crack this guy.

1588
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:56,875
I mean, this is Defcon Five,

1589
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,478
and I have
to do something

1590
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,428
truly appalling...
it's not funny.

1591
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:04,755
Look, I have to think
of something before tomorrow.

1592
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:07,311
Wait, why not tonight?

1593
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,205
Poker night. Boys' night out.

1594
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,734
Oh, Mike used to have
a boys' night.

1595
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:12,684
Boys' night? You're
giving him a boys' night?

1596
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,094
They do it every week.

1597
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:17,746
Before... he met... you.

1598
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:19,922
What are you suggesting?

1599
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,902
I think you know
what I'm suggesting.

1600
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:26,031
- Feel lucky, boys?
- Yeah.

1601
00:58:26,072 --> 00:58:28,211
Gentle Ben, that's two bucks.

1602
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:30,452
I'm feeling luckier than you.

1603
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:33,424
Glad to not have to sit
through a Celine Dion concert.

1604
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:36,463
That's what true love
is all about, my friend.

1605
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:37,586
I fold.

1606
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:39,186
All right, I'll see your two,
raise you fifty.

1607
00:58:39,226 --> 00:58:40,371
She's in love with you?

1608
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,588
You kidding me?
She's planned the wedding.

1609
00:58:41,626 --> 00:58:42,554
Call.

1610
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:43,863
All right, guys,

1611
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:45,459
- read 'em and weep.
- Oh, shit.

1612
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,025
Got ladies over fours, huh?

1613
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:48,627
- Damn.
- Nothing.

1614
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,455
I have a three and an ace.

1615
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:52,793
It does not get
any better than this.

1616
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:53,875
Look at that.

1617
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:55,322
Bennykins, I'm home.

1618
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,184
Hi, honey.

1619
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,715
Hey, Andie.

1620
00:59:03,484 --> 00:59:05,372
She has a key?

1621
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:06,931
Is that legal?

1622
00:59:06,973 --> 00:59:09,656
I wasn't expecting you.

1623
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,335
How'd you get a... key?

1624
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,926
Oh, honey, Francesco,
your super,

1625
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:17,492
he made me a copy.

1626
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:18,778
Francesco, huh?

1627
00:59:18,814 --> 00:59:20,221
Hmm. All right.

1628
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:22,140
You're not mad, are you,
Benky Wenky?

1629
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:23,930
- No, I'm not mad.
- You're not mad?

1630
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,341
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

1631
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,716
- Oh, good.
- You know the guys.

1632
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,726
- Everybody, Tony, Clar, Francis.
- Oh, yes!

1633
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:29,628
- Hey.
- Watch out!

1634
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,557
Hi.

1635
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:34,806
Tony, hi,

1636
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:35,829
- Tony!
- Yeah!

1637
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:36,820
- Ronald.
- Ronald.

1638
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:37,812
Joe.

1639
00:59:37,856 --> 00:59:39,100
- Joe.
- Hey, Andie, guys.

1640
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,990
I didn't mean to interrupt
your little game.

1641
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:43,031
We got it, we got it.
We're all straightened out.

1642
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:44,283
I brought some yummy snacks.

1643
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:45,433
Snacks? Hmm.

1644
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:48,156
The game is hold 'em.

1645
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:50,331
Three up for company,
ante a dollar, please.

1646
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:51,416
Oh, Tony.

1647
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,505
Hmm?

1648
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:54,203
- Yucky, yucky pizza.
- Oh.

1649
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:56,315
- Yucky pizza.
- Oh, no.

1650
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:57,881
Yummy, yummy,
cucumber sandwich.

1651
00:59:57,922 --> 00:59:59,002
Oh... oh.

1652
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,359
- First card up is a nine.
- Thanks.

1653
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,661
I'll take one.

1654
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:07,073
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1655
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,416
Good boys. Good.

1656
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:10,360
Here we go... get rid
of those over there.

1657
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:11,451
Thank you very much.

1658
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,401
- Three up, three up.
- I went a buck. You follow?

1659
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,451
Look around the horn,
look around the horn,

1660
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:16,539
look around the horn.

1661
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:31,261
Ssss...

1662
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,479
Thanks, Benny.

1663
01:00:36,518 --> 01:00:37,663
Thayer.

1664
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,360
That means you, too, Thayer.

1665
01:00:39,398 --> 01:00:40,860
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,146
All right,
everyone in for a buck.

1667
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:42,881
Next card, five,

1668
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:44,063
nines and fives,
nines and fives.

1669
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:45,280
That's back to you, Tito.

1670
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:47,905
Oh! Nine and a seven.

1671
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,082
Go for the straight.

1672
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:51,429
Hmm.

1673
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:52,391
Round two.

1674
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:53,798
Tone, the bone, you're up, man.

1675
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:55,358
She told you my hand.

1676
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,610
Peekaboo!

1677
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:58,983
- Oh, hey.
- Hi!

1678
01:00:59,016 --> 01:01:01,537
Guys, are we going to play cards
here, or what's going on?

1679
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:03,486
What game are we playing?

1680
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:05,765
We're playing hold 'em?

1681
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:09,542
All right,
I'm already maxed out.

1682
01:01:09,577 --> 01:01:10,854
We got a nine up, nine up, guys,

1683
01:01:10,889 --> 01:01:12,515
- nine up, nine up.
- Blow.

1684
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,139
Blow.

1685
01:01:15,178 --> 01:01:17,317
Nobody likes a Mr. Sniffles.

1686
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:19,525
I hate Mr. Sniffles.

1687
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:20,707
Come on, stuffy head.

1688
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,007
Good, good, good.

1689
01:01:28,043 --> 01:01:29,025
Ooh... white.

1690
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:31,206
- Healthy boy.
- Good. Mm-hmm.

1691
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:33,731
- Healthy.
- Hmm.

1692
01:01:35,244 --> 01:01:36,837
Tone, get your head
in the game. Please?

1693
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:37,803
Oh, no.

1694
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:38,915
Are we playing?

1695
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:40,385
Oh, no!

1696
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:43,592
Our love fern!

1697
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:45,898
It's dead!

1698
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,675
No, honey, it's just sleeping.

1699
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:52,491
You let it die!

1700
01:01:53,805 --> 01:01:55,561
Are you going to let us die?

1701
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:56,742
Hmm?

1702
01:01:58,638 --> 01:02:00,711
You should think about that.

1703
01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:03,530
What the hell's a love fern?

1704
01:02:06,383 --> 01:02:08,042
All right, guys,

1705
01:02:08,143 --> 01:02:10,565
let's try to get through
one hand.

1706
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:15,309
Is she on something?

1707
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:16,937
God, I hope so.

1708
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,662
Hi.

1709
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:29,799
Are you saying I'm some kind of

1710
01:02:29,841 --> 01:02:32,230
- mental person?!
- No, no, no, he wasn't...

1711
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:33,386
Oh, Tony!

1712
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:35,335
What? He was talking about...

1713
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:36,752
- Come on.
- That's it!

1714
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,193
- Andie.
- That is it!

1715
01:02:40,274 --> 01:02:41,835
I'm taking this love fern
with me.

1716
01:02:51,731 --> 01:02:52,811
Hang on.

1717
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,739
Hey.

1718
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,747
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1719
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:57,868
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1720
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,315
What just happened in there?

1721
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:00,526
I'm going to go listen.

1722
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,419
- Yeah.
- Quietly.

1723
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:04,884
Look, this is getting
really creepy.

1724
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:07,186
All right? You're acting
completely insane.

1725
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:08,149
You know that?

1726
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:09,676
Oh, so I am insane.

1727
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:12,172
No, you're acting insane.

1728
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:14,799
Shut up, Krull.

1729
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:16,431
Oh, he is an innocent animal.

1730
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,550
And he'll live, okay?
I'm talking to you.

1731
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,517
I don't know

1732
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,477
if I can be with somebody

1733
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,437
who doesn't like animals

1734
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,812
and thinks I'm a mental person.

1735
01:03:21,846 --> 01:03:23,505
That's what I'm talking about.

1736
01:03:23,543 --> 01:03:26,445
Where's the sexy, cool, fun,

1737
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:28,275
smart, beautiful
Andie that I knew?

1738
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:30,100
All right? The one who wanted

1739
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:31,761
to be a serious journalist, huh?

1740
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,555
You're up, you're down,
you're here, you're there.

1741
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:35,959
You're like a freakin'
one-woman circus, Andie.

1742
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:37,847
So I guess this means
we're over.

1743
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,124
Yeah, I guess so.

1744
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,087
Fine.

1745
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,843
Fine.

1746
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:44,369
Oh, finally.

1747
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:50,297
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

1748
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:58,928
It's over, man.

1749
01:03:58,971 --> 01:03:59,702
Oh, man, that's...

1750
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:00,884
No, no, no, no, no.

1751
01:04:00,923 --> 01:04:02,646
- No, no, no.
- It is, man, it's over.

1752
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:04,091
- Four days. Four days.
- Four more days!

1753
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:05,716
Guys, you were here...
did you just witness

1754
01:04:05,756 --> 01:04:07,163
<i>the one-woman homage
to The Exorcist?</i>

1755
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:08,406
You saw it, huh!

1756
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:09,851
Yeah, I did.
I thought it was sexy.

1757
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:10,809
Yeah.

1758
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,501
It's not sexy.

1759
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,645
- He's right, he's right.
- No, forget it.

1760
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:17,400
So, do-do you think Spears
and Green are going to be

1761
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,997
comfortable in
their new office?

1762
01:04:19,037 --> 01:04:20,052
Oh, absolutely. Sure.

1763
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:21,238
- Maybe he's excited that
- Guys, stop.

1764
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:22,554
He's going to be
selling Nerf footballs

1765
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:23,931
- Hey, hey, hey!
- For the rest of his life!

1766
01:04:23,965 --> 01:04:25,591
He may get, like,
a really good douche campaign.

1767
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:26,578
Hey, that's done!
What? What?

1768
01:04:26,622 --> 01:04:27,636
- Couples therapy.
- Of course!

1769
01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:28,758
What?

1770
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:29,943
Every time my wife
wants to divorce me,

1771
01:04:29,982 --> 01:04:30,909
I suggest couples therapy.

1772
01:04:30,942 --> 01:04:32,087
It'll buy you
at least four days.

1773
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:33,304
She-she hates him!

1774
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:34,968
Therapy. Couples therapy.

1775
01:04:35,006 --> 01:04:36,119
Yeah, couples therapy.

1776
01:04:36,158 --> 01:04:37,086
Couples therapy!

1777
01:04:37,118 --> 01:04:38,428
- Couples therapy.
- Come on!

1778
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:39,390
Couples therapy.

1779
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:41,277
- Couples therapy.
- Couples therapy.

1780
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,620
Couples therapy!

1781
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:43,735
Whoa!

1782
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:54,584
Ah!

1783
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:55,552
Andie!

1784
01:04:55,585 --> 01:04:57,527
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, listen.

1785
01:04:57,568 --> 01:04:58,713
Can you forgive me, sugar puss?

1786
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:00,662
Look, I don't know what
I was thinking, all right?

1787
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:01,947
I- I'm sorry.

1788
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,392
I am way out of line, Andie.

1789
01:05:03,425 --> 01:05:05,978
Can you... can you give me
another chance?

1790
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:09,628
Haven't you had enough?

1791
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,226
Hey, look, I'm willing
to do anything.

1792
01:05:11,266 --> 01:05:12,542
Get up.

1793
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:14,367
I'll do...
I'll do anything, Andie.

1794
01:05:14,402 --> 01:05:15,482
Get up.

1795
01:05:15,522 --> 01:05:17,246
Look, what do you think
about...?

1796
01:05:17,282 --> 01:05:18,711
What do you think about...

1797
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,722
couples... therapy?

1798
01:05:21,827 --> 01:05:23,485
Couples therapy?

1799
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:24,603
Couples therapy.

1800
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:26,105
Look, Thayer up there,

1801
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:27,162
he's got this doctor.

1802
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:28,546
He says he's a hell of a guy.

1803
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,969
No, I know a therapist
who will work wonders

1804
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:32,835
with somebody like you,
Benjamin.

1805
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,210
Yes, that's what I need.

1806
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:36,064
I will call and schedule
an emergency session.

1807
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:37,410
Baby, wh-whatever it takes.

1808
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:39,005
Kiss.

1809
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:40,452
Thank you, sweetheart.

1810
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:43,780
Thank you for understanding.

1811
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:46,530
I love you, Binky...

1812
01:05:46,566 --> 01:05:48,671
but I don't have to
like you right now.

1813
01:05:53,447 --> 01:05:55,007
Thank you, Andie.

1814
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:01,895
Ah, damn it!

1815
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:04,066
S- S-Shit!

1816
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,973
If you're really going
to commit to this,

1817
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:08,772
you're going to have
to open up...

1818
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:10,532
- Yeah.
... and dig deep.

1819
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:11,496
Okay.

1820
01:06:11,528 --> 01:06:12,543
Bare that beautiful soul.

1821
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:13,533
Let me see your teeth.

1822
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:17,032
Andie Anderson.

1823
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:19,105
Benjamin Barry.

1824
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:20,705
Please come in.

1825
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:22,272
Hi, welcome.

1826
01:06:27,626 --> 01:06:28,706
Before we get started,

1827
01:06:28,746 --> 01:06:30,688
how are you planning on paying
for the session?

1828
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,869
Sweetie?

1829
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:33,954
How much is it?

1830
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:35,369
$300.

1831
01:06:35,402 --> 01:06:36,450
$300?

1832
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:37,189
Mm-hmm.

1833
01:06:38,507 --> 01:06:40,482
Whatever it takes, yeah.

1834
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:42,279
So, tell me,

1835
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,071
how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

1836
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:45,056
Seven days.

1837
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:46,146
Seven days.

1838
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,430
Interesting.

1839
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:49,507
Is it too soon
to be seeing a therapist?

1840
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:50,922
Well, Ben,

1841
01:06:50,956 --> 01:06:53,509
seven days isn't like
a lifetime, or anything,

1842
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:55,272
- It's like a week.
- It...

1843
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:58,316
Did you hear that tone?

1844
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:00,007
How can we not have
a gulf between us

1845
01:07:00,045 --> 01:07:01,093
with a tone like that?

1846
01:07:02,093 --> 01:07:04,712
How are things
between you sexually?

1847
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:06,789
Oh!

1848
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:08,139
Ooh-ooh.

1849
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:09,156
No, no...

1850
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:10,310
- we haven't had sex.
- Oh, no.

1851
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,205
Ben has a little, bitty problem.

1852
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:13,515
- I don't have a problem.
- Oh.

1853
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:14,630
Yes, you do.

1854
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,077
- No, I do not have a problem.
- Yeah.

1855
01:07:16,111 --> 01:07:17,256
It's a big problem.

1856
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:18,888
- I do not have a problem.
- You have a problem.

1857
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,040
Look, look, look, wait a minute.

1858
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,486
The one night that we even
thought about

1859
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,764
getting close to having sex,

1860
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,898
all right, she up and decides
she's going to nickname my...

1861
01:07:25,935 --> 01:07:27,081
Penis?

1862
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,494
Yeah. "Princess Sophia. " Ha!

1863
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:29,772
You want to talk about

1864
01:07:29,808 --> 01:07:31,914
shooting a man's horse?
Whop! Come on!

1865
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:34,025
I thought it was
a beautiful name.

1866
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:35,526
Hmm, I see, Benjamin.

1867
01:07:35,569 --> 01:07:38,253
And when was it
that you first realized

1868
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:40,875
that you were attracted
to other men?

1869
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:43,117
- What?
- Oh, that's serious.

1870
01:07:43,153 --> 01:07:44,582
Hmm.

1871
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,567
Benjamin, this is a safe space.

1872
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,650
Look, it's just simple...
I like women, okay?

1873
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,868
It just happened that way.

1874
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:51,248
Methinks thou doth

1875
01:07:51,283 --> 01:07:52,592
- protesth too much.
You see? Stop it.

1876
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:53,903
This is the shit
I'm talking about.

1877
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:54,953
What the hell was that?

1878
01:07:54,994 --> 01:07:55,922
Whoa, whoa.

1879
01:07:55,954 --> 01:07:56,903
What did I do?

1880
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,508
I mean, this is what she does.
Stop that!

1881
01:07:58,547 --> 01:08:03,436
You know, I'm hearing a lot
of latent anger here, Benjamin.

1882
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:04,620
Rage-o-holic.

1883
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,837
I'm not a rage-o-holic!

1884
01:08:05,876 --> 01:08:07,152
- I called that one.
- Stop...

1885
01:08:07,188 --> 01:08:09,490
You know what...
take a deep breath for me, Ben.

1886
01:08:10,612 --> 01:08:11,856
Okay, and let it go.

1887
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:13,038
Just let it go.

1888
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:15,280
Yeah.

1889
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:16,942
Yeah. I feel better.

1890
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:18,541
Okay. Come here.

1891
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:20,752
I've seen this before.

1892
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:22,480
- I've seen it many times.
- Yeah?

1893
01:08:22,517 --> 01:08:23,695
Yeah.

1894
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:26,483
Whoo, would you two
like to be left alone?

1895
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:27,216
No.

1896
01:08:27,254 --> 01:08:28,269
Maybe you should get a room.

1897
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,619
You are hitting

1898
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:32,043
on our shrink!

1899
01:08:32,086 --> 01:08:33,428
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

1900
01:08:33,463 --> 01:08:34,291
No, I'm not.

1901
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:35,275
And you are
a pathological flirt!

1902
01:08:35,318 --> 01:08:37,391
Jesus, five seconds ago,
I'm gay.

1903
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:38,925
Now I'm a pathological flirt?

1904
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:40,341
I sweat when I get nervous.

1905
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,651
Which one is it, Andie?

1906
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:44,143
And besides,
why would I need to hit

1907
01:08:44,184 --> 01:08:44,980
on another woman?

1908
01:08:45,015 --> 01:08:46,095
You've got more than

1909
01:08:46,136 --> 01:08:48,624
enough personalities
to keep me completely occupied.

1910
01:08:48,664 --> 01:08:49,941
That was hurtful.

1911
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,601
Okay, Ben.

1912
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,047
Are you ashamed of Andie?

1913
01:08:53,081 --> 01:08:54,357
- Of course he is!
- I'm not ashamed.

1914
01:08:54,393 --> 01:08:55,375
Of course he is.
You are!

1915
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:56,431
I'm not ashamed.

1916
01:08:56,473 --> 01:08:57,618
How do you think

1917
01:08:57,657 --> 01:08:58,737
that makes me feel?

1918
01:08:58,777 --> 01:09:00,304
I'm not ashamed of you.

1919
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,255
It's like, when I talked
to his mother...

1920
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:03,858
he freaked out.

1921
01:09:03,898 --> 01:09:05,556
No, see, you-you did that
behind my back.

1922
01:09:05,594 --> 01:09:06,870
She did it behind my back.

1923
01:09:06,906 --> 01:09:08,815
I just wanted to say "hi. "

1924
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:10,167
Andie, you want to talk
to my mother?

1925
01:09:10,202 --> 01:09:11,348
Y- You want to talk to my mother?

1926
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:12,313
Talk to my mother.

1927
01:09:12,346 --> 01:09:14,801
Hey, you want to talk
to the whole family?

1928
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:16,272
You can talk
to the whole family.

1929
01:09:16,315 --> 01:09:18,552
Hell, we can go to Staten
Island, spend the weekend

1930
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,515
with them, Andie.

1931
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:20,922
Now, that is
a positive idea, Ben.

1932
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:22,035
It... it is?

1933
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,483
How about it, Andie?

1934
01:09:23,515 --> 01:09:24,792
What?

1935
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,289
Would you like to go
to Staten Island?

1936
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:50,490
Uncle Ben, hi!

1937
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:54,935
Thanks.

1938
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:55,902
Yes, ma'am.

1939
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:58,750
Hey, Mom, Pop,
we're here.

1940
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:00,157
Yeah, bullshit!

1941
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:01,752
Who's that handsome guy?

1942
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:04,061
That's my dad when
he was an ensign in the Navy.

1943
01:10:04,095 --> 01:10:05,656
He got stationed here
about ten years ago.

1944
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:06,905
- Bullshit!
- Uh-oh.

1945
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:08,188
Hey, darling.

1946
01:10:08,224 --> 01:10:09,173
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

1947
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:10,361
I'm glad to see you.
Good. Perfect timing.

1948
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:11,578
You know who this is?

1949
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:13,558
I do, and I need you
to check the baby,

1950
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,007
see if he needs changing.

1951
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,448
I know who that is.

1952
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:17,561
- Hi.
- Hi, Andie, I'm so happy

1953
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:18,681
to have you here in the flesh.

1954
01:10:18,721 --> 01:10:20,282
You're just as pretty
as you sound on the telephone.

1955
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:21,249
Glenda!

1956
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:22,939
I'm coming!
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1957
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,603
Excuse me.
Show her upstairs, okay, hon?

1958
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:27,708
Oh, yeah.
And this is Joey, Jr.

1959
01:10:27,746 --> 01:10:28,858
Bullshit!

1960
01:10:28,898 --> 01:10:31,287
And the whole family suffers
from Tourette's.

1961
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,704
I hope that's not a problem.

1962
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:33,666
You're so handsome.

1963
01:10:33,698 --> 01:10:35,073
Joey, he suffers
from being a stinky rose.

1964
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:36,482
We're going to go get you
cleaned up, sir.

1965
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:37,595
Go on out back.
Have a good time.

1966
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:38,563
Okay.

1967
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:40,857
Ooh!

1968
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:41,827
Got you.

1969
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:42,787
Okay!

1970
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,314
You're it.

1971
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,396
He got you.

1972
01:10:46,435 --> 01:10:47,810
Oh...

1973
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,633
Uncle Arnold says
he's got three kings.

1974
01:10:49,668 --> 01:10:50,748
Yeah, right.

1975
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,446
Okay, Uncle Arnold.
Now, dare I say it, or not?

1976
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:53,412
I'm just going to say it.

1977
01:10:53,445 --> 01:10:54,623
Okay, I'm going to say it...

1978
01:10:54,724 --> 01:10:55,455
bullshit!

1979
01:10:56,388 --> 01:10:57,730
Hi.

1980
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:58,463
- Honey?
- Oh, wow.

1981
01:10:58,501 --> 01:11:00,324
Andie.

1982
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,982
Whoa, ho, whoa, well, well!

1983
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:02,949
Come on out here, Andie.

1984
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:03,930
- Meet everybody.
- Okay.

1985
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:05,125
I want you to meet
Ben's father, Jack.

1986
01:11:05,253 --> 01:11:06,049
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

1987
01:11:06,085 --> 01:11:07,427
Welcome to our humble abode.

1988
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:08,409
This is Andie, Jack.

1989
01:11:08,453 --> 01:11:09,915
Oh, thank you.
Nice to meet you.

1990
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:10,883
And this is our Uncle Arnold.

1991
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:12,062
- Hi, Uncle Arnold.
- Oh, hi, good morning.

1992
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,116
This is Andie.

1993
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:14,947
You got to watch him.
He farts like a howitzer,

1994
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:16,508
but he's family,
so what are you going to do?

1995
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,405
Intestinal complications.

1996
01:11:18,438 --> 01:11:20,326
Yeah, right, Arnold. Prunes.

1997
01:11:20,358 --> 01:11:21,187
Did you meet Joey?

1998
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:21,822
A female Andy.

1999
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:22,790
L- E.

2000
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:23,750
Nice to meet you.

2001
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:24,710
Okay, here we go now.

2002
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:26,237
The game is Bullshit,
and you are just in time

2003
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:28,067
for the lightning round,
my dear.

2004
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:29,827
I don't really know how to play.

2005
01:11:29,863 --> 01:11:31,292
Well, we're going to teach
you how. It's very simple.

2006
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:32,230
Trick is to get rid
of all the cards

2007
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:33,124
in your hand, all right?

2008
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,687
So I'm going
to look in my hand,

2009
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,647
and I'm going to see
what I've got here.

2010
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,087
And, well, do you know?

2011
01:11:38,121 --> 01:11:39,462
I've got two aces here.

2012
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:42,180
Well, two aces.
What do you say to that?

2013
01:11:44,713 --> 01:11:47,201
What are you
going to say?

2014
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,518
- I say bullshit.
- Mm-hmm.

2015
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:49,535
What did she say?
I didn't quite hear.

2016
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:50,657
Did you guys...?
I didn't hear what she said.

2017
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:51,625
What did you say?

2018
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:52,519
I said bullshit!

2019
01:11:52,554 --> 01:11:53,481
All right!

2020
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:54,462
Well, she knows how
to play the game,

2021
01:11:54,506 --> 01:11:56,328
Yes, sir.

2022
01:11:56,362 --> 01:11:58,402
Hey, big daddy,
come to Papa.

2023
01:11:58,442 --> 01:12:00,581
Get on over there, big man.
Slick as a whistle.

2024
01:12:00,618 --> 01:12:01,546
How you doing, Unc?

2025
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:02,244
Hi, Ben.

2026
01:12:02,282 --> 01:12:03,526
- That's my grandson.
- Pop.

2027
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:04,326
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

2028
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,311
Got a game of Bullshit
going here?

2029
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:05,890
A little game of Bullshit.

2030
01:12:05,931 --> 01:12:06,498
Want to join us?

2031
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:08,033
Good luck.

2032
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:08,871
What'd you leave me with, Joe?

2033
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:09,856
Look at the expert here.

2034
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,077
Okay, now, we went
through the deck.

2035
01:12:11,116 --> 01:12:11,977
We're going to start
at the beginning now.

2036
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:13,222
So we go to twos.

2037
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,503
Let's see, now.
I've got myself one deuce here.

2038
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,849
Bullshit.

2039
01:12:15,884 --> 01:12:16,866
Whoa!

2040
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:18,021
Bullshit, Pop.

2041
01:12:18,093 --> 01:12:20,329
He's a human lie detector,
isn't he?

2042
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:21,739
Try this, son:

2043
01:12:21,773 --> 01:12:22,788
Two threes.

2044
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:23,756
Mm-hmm.

2045
01:12:23,789 --> 01:12:25,251
One four.

2046
01:12:25,293 --> 01:12:26,503
Three fives.

2047
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:27,817
Bullshit.

2048
01:12:28,941 --> 01:12:30,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2049
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:33,063
You see whose name's on top
of the board over there?

2050
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:36,101
Yes, it says "Ben,"
with a star next to it.

2051
01:12:36,142 --> 01:12:37,451
You still want to bullshit me?

2052
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,396
God, you must be so proud.

2053
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,965
I'm doing my best.
What do we got?

2054
01:12:41,006 --> 01:12:41,770
Yes.

2055
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:42,700
- Did I b-b-bullshit?
- Got, uh...

2056
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:44,524
No, I told the truth.

2057
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:45,988
Three fives.

2058
01:12:46,031 --> 01:12:47,242
He's good. He's the champ.

2059
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,313
All right, all right.
Lighten up on me, Jim.

2060
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:50,951
What am I?

2061
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,584
Sixes to you.

2062
01:12:52,688 --> 01:12:54,477
One six.

2063
01:12:54,512 --> 01:12:55,308
One six, all right.

2064
01:12:55,344 --> 01:12:56,751
Whoa, look at what I got here.

2065
01:12:56,784 --> 01:12:58,573
You see, the key to this game
is being able to read people.

2066
01:12:58,609 --> 01:13:00,202
Two eights.

2067
01:13:00,304 --> 01:13:05,226
Bullshit.
Bull... shit, Mama.

2068
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:06,214
Huh?

2069
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,882
I- I'm going to have to hurt you.

2070
01:13:07,985 --> 01:13:09,611
Uh-huh. You see,
Mom's never been

2071
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:11,056
that great at it, but why?

2072
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,912
Just 'cause I'm so pure
of heart.

2073
01:13:12,946 --> 01:13:15,913
- So pure of heart.
- Bullshit.

2074
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:17,994
Hello, hello!
Yeah, where is everybody?

2075
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:18,961
Hey!

2076
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,368
Ho!

2077
01:13:20,435 --> 01:13:21,929
Hi.

2078
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:25,069
This is Andie.
Andie, this is my sister, Dora.

2079
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:26,514
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2080
01:13:26,547 --> 01:13:27,922
Andie is kicking Ben's ass
in Bullshit.

2081
01:13:27,955 --> 01:13:28,904
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2082
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:30,605
- Oh, I like this girl.
- That's right.

2083
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:33,033
Ben's starting a little
card collection.

2084
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,483
All right, let me get back
on track here.

2085
01:13:34,516 --> 01:13:38,313
Gentle Ben starts with three
ladies, and that's to you.

2086
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,298
What do you got to say
about that?

2087
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:47,892
Bullshit.

2088
01:13:49,942 --> 01:13:52,113
You heard me.
I said bullshit.

2089
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,230
Ooh-ooh.

2090
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,830
Ah. Mm-hmm.

2091
01:13:56,566 --> 01:14:00,429
Uh-huh. What is that...
seven in a row, Sparky?

2092
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,674
I think somebody's met
his match.

2093
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:07,054
Well, I-I, it's...
all about... reading people.

2094
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,942
Loser.

2095
01:14:09,975 --> 01:14:11,863
Okay. Two kings.

2096
01:14:16,088 --> 01:14:17,200
Bullshit?

2097
01:14:20,057 --> 01:14:21,486
Bull... shit!

2098
01:14:24,153 --> 01:14:26,357
Yeah, you!

2099
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:27,953
Nah, nah, nah, no!

2100
01:14:27,993 --> 01:14:29,652
You have met your match.

2101
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:31,478
And you, Mom...
Miss Pure of Heart.

2102
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:33,935
Pop, I told you.
You're hiding behind a badge.

2103
01:14:33,978 --> 01:14:34,905
I didn't see anything.

2104
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:35,886
Cheated me.

2105
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,687
Betrayed by my own parents.

2106
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:39,827
The only honest man
in this place

2107
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:41,842
is Uncle Arnold, who's asleep.

2108
01:14:41,883 --> 01:14:43,541
But I won.

2109
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,433
I'm going to go inside
and play with the kids.

2110
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:47,060
Maybe they won't lie,
cheat, and steal.

2111
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:48,474
Okay, keep my name
on top of the board.

2112
01:14:48,508 --> 01:14:49,435
Now, Andie, I hope you know

2113
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:50,962
that we are expecting you
to come back here,

2114
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:54,419
because you have held Ben
to his lowest Bullshit score...

2115
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,387
Yeah, yeah.

2116
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,046
...since his tonsillectomy,

2117
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:58,873
and we are thrilled!

2118
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:00,599
Lowest!

2119
01:15:00,637 --> 01:15:02,971
Why, were all his other
girlfriends Bullshit losers?

2120
01:15:03,005 --> 01:15:04,892
What other girlfriends?

2121
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:05,851
Ma, he's picky.

2122
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,884
You are the first girl
he's ever brought home.

2123
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:11,926
Don't you break
his heart, now.

2124
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,235
And that dress. Andie, now,
does that come in my size?

2125
01:15:20,222 --> 01:15:24,379
There's a new wind blowing
like I've never known

2126
01:15:24,415 --> 01:15:27,928
I'm breathing deeper
than I've ever done

2127
01:15:27,999 --> 01:15:34,164
And it sure feels good
to finally feel the way I do.

2128
01:15:35,392 --> 01:15:36,505
Yes, sir.

2129
01:15:36,544 --> 01:15:38,170
- I want to love somebody
- My turn?

2130
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,288
Yes, ma'am.

2131
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:41,947
Love somebody like you.

2132
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:44,058
It's... heavy.

2133
01:15:44,097 --> 01:15:46,137
Turn it on.

2134
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:47,105
Good.

2135
01:15:47,138 --> 01:15:48,926
- Keep this clutch in.
- That's the clutch.

2136
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,488
Brake here on your right.

2137
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:51,642
Your gears are on the left.

2138
01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:53,111
- One down.
- Okay.

2139
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:54,234
Now, when we take off,

2140
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:55,899
you're going to give
a little bit on the clutch.

2141
01:15:55,938 --> 01:15:56,920
Uh-huh.

2142
01:15:56,962 --> 01:15:58,785
And you're going to go
a little bit here.

2143
01:15:58,818 --> 01:15:59,746
A little give, a little go.

2144
01:15:59,778 --> 01:16:00,706
How's it go?

2145
01:16:00,738 --> 01:16:02,233
A little give and a little go?

2146
01:16:02,275 --> 01:16:03,223
That's it.

2147
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:05,983
Whoa!

2148
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,093
A little clutch and
a little brake. There we are.

2149
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:14,912
You got it?

2150
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:17,087
I got it.

2151
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:18,052
I got it.

2152
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:19,033
You got it.

2153
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:20,386
Whoo!

2154
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:23,323
Voilà, voilà, voilà, voilà.

2155
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:26,879
I mean, there's a lot of cool
things about a bike, you know?

2156
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,291
Use less gas.

2157
01:16:28,325 --> 01:16:31,075
In traffic jams, you park
wherever the hell you want.

2158
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:32,516
But at the end of the day...

2159
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,532
Thank you.

2160
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:36,062
...chicks dig 'em. Ah!

2161
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:37,762
- Oh!
- Hey!

2162
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:42,431
You look so cute.

2163
01:16:42,471 --> 01:16:44,032
Can I ask you a question?

2164
01:16:44,071 --> 01:16:45,151
Well, yeah.

2165
01:16:45,191 --> 01:16:46,337
Chicks dig this?

2166
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,390
Yes, chicks dig this.

2167
01:16:48,743 --> 01:16:51,558
I'm ready to love somebody

2168
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:54,494
Love somebody like you.

2169
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,048
I turned!

2170
01:16:58,088 --> 01:16:59,753
Oh, oh, oh,
you're driving like a pro.

2171
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:03,549
Yeah, look at you.

2172
01:17:03,593 --> 01:17:04,673
Ooh!

2173
01:17:04,713 --> 01:17:05,793
Look at this look.

2174
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,524
Yeah, now, this shower...

2175
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:09,986
...whoa...
is a little bit tricky.

2176
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,848
The hot is actually cold.
The cold is actually hot.

2177
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:13,474
You got to crank it
all the way up, at first,

2178
01:17:13,514 --> 01:17:16,067
and...

2179
01:17:16,106 --> 01:17:18,441
if somebody flushes
the toilet in Bayonne,

2180
01:17:18,474 --> 01:17:20,165
you are going to get scalded.

2181
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:21,632
The towels are right there.

2182
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:29,162
Everything all right?
Is this okay?

2183
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:33,124
Oh, no, it's more than okay.

2184
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:36,524
I love everything
about this house:

2185
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:37,833
The noise, the smells...

2186
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:41,032
Oh, well, the smells...
that's Uncle Arnold,

2187
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:42,279
I mean...

2188
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,361
What's wrong?

2189
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:01,964
It's just that when
your mom hugged me today,

2190
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:06,506
she really hugged me...

2191
01:18:06,544 --> 01:18:09,577
for winning a game of Bullshit.

2192
01:18:09,616 --> 01:18:12,583
Sweetie, that's a good thing.

2193
01:18:12,624 --> 01:18:15,112
Smile.

2194
01:18:15,152 --> 01:18:18,665
Smile. Now come on.
Give me a smile.

2195
01:18:18,705 --> 01:18:20,559
Okay, that's good, that's it.
Yes, you're scaring me.

2196
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:43,602
Something in your eyes
makes me want to lose myself

2197
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:51,054
Makes me want to lose myself
in your arms

2198
01:18:54,932 --> 01:18:57,583
There's something in your voice

2199
01:18:57,621 --> 01:19:02,804
Makes my heart beat fast

2200
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:11,413
Hope this feeling lasts
for the rest of my life

2201
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:21,616
If you knew how much
this moment means to me

2202
01:19:21,655 --> 01:19:29,206
And how long I've waited
for your touch

2203
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:40,021
And if you knew how happy
you are making me

2204
01:19:40,057 --> 01:19:48,688
I never thought
that I'd love anyone so much

2205
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:57,907
It feels like home to me,
it feels like home to me

2206
01:19:57,947 --> 01:20:07,058
It feels like I'm all the way
back where I come from

2207
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:16,603
It feels like home to me,
it feels like home to me

2208
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:24,471
Feels like I'm all the way back
where I belong.

2209
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:33,437
This is home, huh?

2210
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,609
This is home.

2211
01:20:44,512 --> 01:20:46,367
Hey, listen,

2212
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:48,025
tomorrow night my boss
is throwing a party

2213
01:20:48,063 --> 01:20:49,973
for that diamond account
I was telling you about.

2214
01:20:50,016 --> 01:20:53,016
I want you to come with me.

2215
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,267
Okay.

2216
01:20:54,304 --> 01:20:55,679
Okay?

2217
01:20:55,713 --> 01:20:56,793
Yeah.

2218
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:01,273
As my girlfriend.

2219
01:21:05,505 --> 01:21:07,480
Are you calling me
your girlfriend?

2220
01:21:07,554 --> 01:21:10,336
Yeah. I think I am.

2221
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:18,621
Won't tomorrow be the tenth day
we've been seeing each other?

2222
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:20,153
Mm-hmm.

2223
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:23,740
Maybe after that we'll know.

2224
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:27,169
Listen, don't make any plans

2225
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:29,179
for day 13, okay,

2226
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,594
because...

2227
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,501
we have a game to go to.

2228
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,467
Uh-huh.

2229
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,449
Oh!

2230
01:21:35,493 --> 01:21:37,402
They're not as good of seats
as you got us,

2231
01:21:37,445 --> 01:21:38,852
but this is Game Seven, huh?

2232
01:21:38,885 --> 01:21:40,162
Yes?

2233
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:43,488
Ah, come here.

2234
01:22:04,871 --> 01:22:06,464
Okay.

2235
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:07,616
Yes?

2236
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,444
Lana,

2237
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:10,755
I can't write this article.

2238
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,181
Is your computer broken?

2239
01:22:13,224 --> 01:22:15,591
I've gotten to know this guy.

2240
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:19,684
Andie, do you see any
patches or insignia

2241
01:22:19,721 --> 01:22:22,142
anywhere on my clothing?

2242
01:22:22,186 --> 01:22:23,495
No.

2243
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:26,563
It's because I'm not your Girl
Scout leader, I'm your boss.

2244
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:27,911
You'll write the article.

2245
01:22:27,946 --> 01:22:29,321
This cover is
at the printer

2246
01:22:29,354 --> 01:22:32,453
as we speak, with a special
section on diamonds,

2247
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:36,615
which is going to take care of
my ad quota for the entire year.

2248
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:39,368
I want copy on my desk
in 48 hours.

2249
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:40,680
Okay, but, Lana...

2250
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:43,050
No "but, Lana. " You'll do it...

2251
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,938
because you're

2252
01:22:44,972 --> 01:22:47,427
a professional.

2253
01:22:50,092 --> 01:22:52,547
Yes, I am.

2254
01:23:23,951 --> 01:23:26,373
You're beautiful.

2255
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,546
You look pretty good, too,
Sparky.

2256
01:23:51,154 --> 01:23:52,136
Champagne, madam?

2257
01:23:52,179 --> 01:23:53,161
Thank you.

2258
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:07,564
Chalk one up
to couples' therapy.

2259
01:24:07,603 --> 01:24:10,222
Wow. Some party.

2260
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,635
Hmm?

2261
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:13,805
You're going to do great.

2262
01:24:13,845 --> 01:24:15,857
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

2263
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,870
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

2264
01:24:17,908 --> 01:24:18,988
Oh, good idea.

2265
01:24:19,029 --> 01:24:21,517
Okay? And while I do that,
would you please...

2266
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,307
head over there, and...
frost yourself.

2267
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:27,889
I can wear those?

2268
01:24:27,926 --> 01:24:29,748
Yes, ma'am, you can.

2269
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:38,540
Phillip.

2270
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:39,565
Lana.

2271
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,534
I don't see you
at a party for ages.

2272
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:41,647
Now here you are,

2273
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:43,062
throwing the bash of the year.

2274
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:45,103
I'm glad you could make it.

2275
01:24:45,143 --> 01:24:46,092
Like them?

2276
01:24:46,136 --> 01:24:47,991
Ah, it suits you.

2277
01:24:48,023 --> 01:24:48,951
I know!

2278
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,358
Harry Winston.

2279
01:24:50,392 --> 01:24:52,596
How did you get
all these jewelers

2280
01:24:52,632 --> 01:24:54,967
to agree to appear
at the same fete?

2281
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,302
At the request of Mrs. DeLauer.

2282
01:24:57,337 --> 01:24:58,285
Really?

2283
01:24:58,328 --> 01:25:00,849
Yes, you see,
Mr. DeLauer controls

2284
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:03,093
70% of the world's diamonds,

2285
01:25:03,129 --> 01:25:04,373
and Mrs. DeLauer

2286
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:05,970
controls Mr. DeLauer.

2287
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:08,431
You're bad.

2288
01:25:08,474 --> 01:25:09,783
Ah! Enjoy.

2289
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:11,411
Lana!

2290
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:12,378
This is real?

2291
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:14,353
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

2292
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:15,539
I insist.

2293
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,105
<i>Notre bonne Isadora,
s'il vous plait?</i>

2294
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:18,259
Yes, sir.

2295
01:25:18,299 --> 01:25:20,087
Such beauty
should be celebrated.

2296
01:25:22,043 --> 01:25:22,971
Oh!

2297
01:25:23,003 --> 01:25:23,985
Isadora.

2298
01:25:24,028 --> 01:25:26,264
Oh, no, I'm Andie.

2299
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,773
Oh, and a pleasure to meet you,
Andie, but this is Isadora.

2300
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:33,113
<i>Turn, turn, s'il vous plait.</i>

2301
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:38,232
84 carats,
named for Isadora Duncan.

2302
01:25:38,269 --> 01:25:40,724
Congratulations.
You got her here.

2303
01:25:40,765 --> 01:25:41,878
Yeah.

2304
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:43,510
But the question remains...

2305
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:45,556
Does she, or doesn't she?

2306
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,303
We're going to find out.

2307
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:53,276
An angel of God.

2308
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:55,034
- Thanks.
- I am Frederick.

2309
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:56,183
Andie Anderson.

2310
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,559
Well, it looks like you've got
some competition, anyway.

2311
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:07,035
Miss Anderson will be wearing

2312
01:26:07,072 --> 01:26:08,730
Isadora for the evening.

2313
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,959
Enjoy the party, Andie.

2314
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,294
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

2315
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:18,013
Oh, that's stunning!
Fabulous!

2316
01:26:18,049 --> 01:26:19,642
Excuse me.

2317
01:26:19,681 --> 01:26:21,536
Two champagnes, please, sir.

2318
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:25,272
Pardon me, young man.

2319
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:28,063
Would you be kind enough
to order me a whiskey sour?

2320
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:29,756
Yes, ma'am, I can.
Mrs. DeLauer?

2321
01:26:29,794 --> 01:26:30,972
Yes.

2322
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,733
I'm Ben Barry
with Warren Advertising.

2323
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:33,785
How do you do?

2324
01:26:33,826 --> 01:26:35,833
The pleasure's mine.
It's nice to finally meet you.

2325
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:39,224
I'm very happy to meet you, too,
that's for sure.

2326
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:40,958
Can I get a whiskey sour,
please?

2327
01:26:49,092 --> 01:26:51,034
I can promise you
that our presentation

2328
01:26:51,076 --> 01:26:53,662
will not weary you
in the wrong way, Mrs. DeLauer.

2329
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,435
I cannot wait to see
what you present, Benjamin.

2330
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:03,676
Ladies, do you
see what I see?

2331
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:08,321
Oh, Phillip, that's ridiculous.
She couldn't possibly.

2332
01:27:08,358 --> 01:27:10,562
Don't be so sure.

2333
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:12,541
She might possibly.

2334
01:27:12,582 --> 01:27:14,524
I think I'll go find out.

2335
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:29,191
E- Excuse me.
You're Andie, yes?

2336
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:30,686
Yes.

2337
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:32,932
I'm Phillip Warren.

2338
01:27:32,968 --> 01:27:35,587
Oh, you're Ben's boss.

2339
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:36,552
That's right.

2340
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,533
Hi, pleasure to meet you.

2341
01:27:37,577 --> 01:27:38,722
Pleasure to meet you.

2342
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,663
Well, I understand you've been
an inspiration to Ben

2343
01:27:41,705 --> 01:27:42,949
in more ways than one,

2344
01:27:42,985 --> 01:27:43,913
and I must say,

2345
01:27:43,946 --> 01:27:47,459
you look rather inspired
yourself.

2346
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,628
There isn't a diamond
in the room that sparkles

2347
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,161
like a woman in love.

2348
01:27:52,202 --> 01:27:55,333
Oh, no.

2349
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:58,186
I'm not in love.

2350
01:27:58,219 --> 01:27:59,463
No?

2351
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:01,026
I guess I was mistaken.

2352
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,496
No, no, no. I mean...

2353
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:04,394
I mean, I've only known him

2354
01:28:04,427 --> 01:28:06,762
for ten days. I...

2355
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:08,935
You can't...

2356
01:28:08,972 --> 01:28:12,802
I can't... I can't be...

2357
01:28:18,349 --> 01:28:20,716
Ben is a very lucky man.

2358
01:28:20,749 --> 01:28:21,959
Excuse me.

2359
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:23,591
Yeah.

2360
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:28,427
Mr. Warren,
please don't tell him.

2361
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:30,884
Please don't tell him.

2362
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:34,318
Hey.

2363
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,278
Ben, Ben.

2364
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,358
Hey, hello, gentlemen.

2365
01:28:36,463 --> 01:28:37,990
She loves you;
she loves you not.

2366
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,958
What-what is it?

2367
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:39,918
I don't know.

2368
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:41,358
We'll see.

2369
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:42,471
Ben.

2370
01:28:42,512 --> 01:28:43,559
Mr. Warren.

2371
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:46,087
Saw her, met her.
She loves you. You win.

2372
01:28:46,127 --> 01:28:48,266
Get ready to pitch.

2373
01:28:55,505 --> 01:28:56,999
Congratulations, point man.

2374
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:58,186
I'm very proud.

2375
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:01,543
So, you're the new
point man on the DeLauers.

2376
01:29:01,585 --> 01:29:03,592
She loves me.

2377
01:29:03,634 --> 01:29:04,561
Good for you...

2378
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:07,409
and... good for whoever she is.

2379
01:29:08,978 --> 01:29:10,538
Ah, well...
thank you so much.

2380
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:12,334
Oh, you're so very welcome.

2381
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,378
Gloating, are we?

2382
01:29:14,418 --> 01:29:15,760
Yeah, pretty much.

2383
01:29:15,795 --> 01:29:17,355
Warren told us, so...

2384
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:18,988
Yeah, you don't mess
with my man Ben.

2385
01:29:19,027 --> 01:29:19,954
Mm.

2386
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:21,711
Your man Ben
is a cheater.

2387
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,503
Mm-hmm. The girl
has known about the bet

2388
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,467
from the beginning.

2389
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,223
She was playing along
so Ben would win.

2390
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,627
Tell him to enjoy his
short-lived, ill-gotten victory.

2391
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,090
We're going to talk to Warren.

2392
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,741
No.

2393
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,122
- Let's...
- Come on...

2394
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:41,587
Hey.

2395
01:29:41,653 --> 01:29:42,547
Remember us?

2396
01:29:42,613 --> 01:29:43,507
- Hi.
- Hi.

2397
01:29:43,573 --> 01:29:44,817
You know, uh, Warren

2398
01:29:44,854 --> 01:29:47,243
is going to come over here
in a minute,

2399
01:29:47,286 --> 01:29:49,042
and it would...

2400
01:29:49,078 --> 01:29:52,144
it would be so great if you
could just, you know, like,

2401
01:29:52,182 --> 01:29:54,801
act like you don't know
anything about the bet.

2402
01:29:54,838 --> 01:29:56,594
I mean, if-if you could tell him

2403
01:29:56,631 --> 01:29:59,217
that you-you really,
truly love Ben, you know,

2404
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:01,360
and you weren't just,
you know, pretending,

2405
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,709
so he would... he would win,

2406
01:30:02,775 --> 01:30:05,230
that would be... huge.

2407
01:30:05,272 --> 01:30:07,727
<i>So what's the average
Composure reader like?</i>

2408
01:30:07,768 --> 01:30:10,616
Spunky, insatiable.
Uppity? You bet.

2409
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:12,143
If you'll excuse me, Lana,

2410
01:30:12,184 --> 01:30:14,072
there is a beautiful
young woman

2411
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:15,119
in a yellow dress

2412
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,404
that I must go to.

2413
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:17,389
Andie?

2414
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:18,545
Yeah, she's my "How to" girl.

2415
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:19,698
How to?

2416
01:30:19,737 --> 01:30:21,843
Yes. Right now, she's doing
an article called,

2417
01:30:21,914 --> 01:30:25,558
"How to... Lose a Guy
in Ten Days. "

2418
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:26,804
Just look him
straight in the eye...

2419
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:28,184
Yeah, and just,
and just, you love Ben,

2420
01:30:28,218 --> 01:30:29,712
and you never heard
anything about any bet.

2421
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:31,795
Yeah. Love.
No bet. Okay?

2422
01:30:31,834 --> 01:30:32,762
I understand.

2423
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:33,722
Awesome.

2424
01:30:33,754 --> 01:30:34,736
Yeah, that's good.
Thank you.

2425
01:30:34,779 --> 01:30:35,793
You look beautiful.

2426
01:30:35,835 --> 01:30:38,966
This poor schmuck
she's been pretending to date...

2427
01:30:39,003 --> 01:30:40,912
well, not even
pretending to date...

2428
01:30:40,955 --> 01:30:42,646
she's actually dating the guy.

2429
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:44,888
She's doing the most
atrocious things to him.

2430
01:30:44,923 --> 01:30:46,614
She's... she's actually

2431
01:30:46,652 --> 01:30:49,019
named his...

2432
01:30:49,053 --> 01:30:51,541
She's named his...

2433
01:30:55,677 --> 01:30:58,296
You're Krull.

2434
01:31:04,606 --> 01:31:06,428
Ladies and gentlemen,

2435
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:08,404
may I ask you all kindly
to be seated?

2436
01:31:08,446 --> 01:31:10,552
Now that we're all
suitably frosted...

2437
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,248
Benjamin, where have you been?

2438
01:31:12,287 --> 01:31:13,880
We haven't much time to play.

2439
01:31:13,919 --> 01:31:16,669
Ah! And the ladies
do look lovely...

2440
01:31:16,703 --> 01:31:18,558
please help me give
a warm welcome

2441
01:31:18,591 --> 01:31:20,664
to our special guests
of the evening,

2442
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:21,947
Mr. And Mrs.

2443
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,510
Frederick DeLauer.

2444
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:33,471
And now, I want to introduce

2445
01:31:33,505 --> 01:31:35,196
a true musical legend

2446
01:31:35,233 --> 01:31:38,681
who will perform
some of his Oscar, Grammy,

2447
01:31:38,721 --> 01:31:42,912
Tony, and Emmy
award-winning songs,

2448
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:45,499
Mr. Marvin Hamlisch.

2449
01:31:54,498 --> 01:31:55,611
Thank you very much.

2450
01:31:55,651 --> 01:31:56,829
I really do apprec...

2451
01:31:56,866 --> 01:31:58,939
Wow, yes! Give another hand

2452
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:01,849
for... Marvin Hamlisch
is in the house!

2453
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,353
Ow!

2454
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:08,162
A lot of you out here
don't know Benjamin Barry.

2455
01:32:08,196 --> 01:32:09,374
Well...

2456
01:32:09,412 --> 01:32:10,939
shame on you.

2457
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,988
'Cause he is a very talented

2458
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:16,063
advertising executive,
a knowledgeable sports fan

2459
01:32:16,101 --> 01:32:17,694
and a wagering enthusiast

2460
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:20,549
but most impressively,

2461
01:32:20,581 --> 01:32:22,818
he is one hell of a singer,

2462
01:32:22,853 --> 01:32:26,269
and he has prepared
a little musical snack

2463
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,132
for his new special friend,

2464
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:29,726
Mrs. DeLauer.

2465
01:32:29,766 --> 01:32:31,326
Oh. Oh, isn't that wonderful?

2466
01:32:31,398 --> 01:32:33,253
So, Ben, why
don't you come up here

2467
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:36,001
and sing your song?

2468
01:32:37,063 --> 01:32:37,990
Oh.

2469
01:32:38,023 --> 01:32:39,136
Come on, Ben.

2470
01:32:39,175 --> 01:32:43,005
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benjamin Barry.

2471
01:32:44,904 --> 01:32:45,886
Come on, Ben.

2472
01:32:53,129 --> 01:32:55,103
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

2473
01:32:55,145 --> 01:32:57,000
Andie, Andie.
Whoa, whoa, don't run off.

2474
01:32:57,033 --> 01:32:57,961
Don't run off!

2475
01:32:57,993 --> 01:32:59,368
Ladies and gentlemen
you do not want

2476
01:32:59,401 --> 01:33:00,743
this young lady
to leave the room.

2477
01:33:00,778 --> 01:33:02,305
Thayer. Tony.

2478
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:03,655
Would you stop her, please?

2479
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:05,828
You see, tonight, the
really special event

2480
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:09,509
is that we will be singing,
her and I, a duet.

2481
01:33:09,546 --> 01:33:11,554
Yes, Miss Andie Anderson.

2482
01:33:11,595 --> 01:33:12,969
Could you please give
a warm round

2483
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:13,951
of applause! Thank you!

2484
01:33:13,995 --> 01:33:16,744
Andie. Andie Anderson.

2485
01:33:19,947 --> 01:33:21,321
Knock 'em out.

2486
01:33:21,355 --> 01:33:23,297
Let's see what
our song tonight will be.

2487
01:33:23,339 --> 01:33:25,380
Maybe one of her
personal favorites.

2488
01:33:26,828 --> 01:33:28,072
Marvin, do you know,

2489
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,530
"You're So Vain"?

2490
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:31,914
That's not one of my songs.

2491
01:33:31,949 --> 01:33:33,891
Can you work with me, Marvin?

2492
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:35,177
Yeah?

2493
01:33:37,165 --> 01:33:38,475
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2494
01:33:38,573 --> 01:33:41,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2495
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:43,269
You walked into the party

2496
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:46,790
Like you were
walking onto a yacht

2497
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:49,961
You had your-your hat pulled
down real strategically

2498
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:51,275
Over one eye, you had a scarf

2499
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:52,358
I think it was apricot

2500
01:33:52,398 --> 01:33:54,024
Strategically tipped
below one eye

2501
01:33:54,063 --> 01:33:54,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2502
01:33:55,023 --> 01:33:56,135
One eye in the mirror

2503
01:33:56,175 --> 01:33:58,247
As you made sure
you had a real cool...

2504
01:33:58,288 --> 01:33:59,881
- Gavotte.
- Gavotte. Yeah.

2505
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:02,669
And all the girls think
that they'd be your partner

2506
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:07,625
They'd be his partner
'cause he's so vain

2507
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:10,534
You probably think
this song is about you

2508
01:34:10,576 --> 01:34:11,950
Ben Barry, you're so vain

2509
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:13,130
So, so vain

2510
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:16,016
You probably think
this song is about you

2511
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:17,675
Don't you? Don't you?

2512
01:34:17,713 --> 01:34:19,884
Tone deaf and drunk is not
a good combination.

2513
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,328
No, you-you fooled
me to win a bet...

2514
01:34:21,362 --> 01:34:22,289
Oh, I fooled you?

2515
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:23,336
And you should feel ashamed.

2516
01:34:23,378 --> 01:34:24,490
Look, you took me

2517
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:26,057
to a goddamn
Celine Dion concert.

2518
01:34:26,098 --> 01:34:27,559
You made me miss the big game.

2519
01:34:27,602 --> 01:34:28,878
Oh, smart guy's a rhymer.

2520
01:34:28,914 --> 01:34:30,223
Well...

2521
01:34:30,258 --> 01:34:32,528
Do we want everybody to know
your lovemaking is lame?

2522
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:35,144
Oh, maybe because
you named my penis.

2523
01:34:35,187 --> 01:34:36,169
Yeah, you named my penis.

2524
01:34:36,211 --> 01:34:40,335
You named my penis after a dame!

2525
01:34:40,372 --> 01:34:42,281
No, I really think
you have to get over that.

2526
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:43,850
Come on, you're so vain.

2527
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:45,386
- No, you're so vain.
- You are so vain.

2528
01:34:45,428 --> 01:34:47,283
This is the worst thing
I've ever heard.

2529
01:34:47,316 --> 01:34:49,203
And you know that this song
is about you, don't ya?

2530
01:34:49,236 --> 01:34:50,414
- No, no.
- Because you're...

2531
01:34:50,452 --> 01:34:51,979
You're so vain.

2532
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,119
...so vain.
- You're so... vain.

2533
01:34:55,157 --> 01:34:56,979
You do know the words
so well, don't you?

2534
01:34:57,013 --> 01:34:58,988
There she goes,
ladies and gentlemen.

2535
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:00,491
There she goes.
Thank you very much.

2536
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:01,843
Thanks, guys.

2537
01:35:01,877 --> 01:35:03,765
Take it from here, Marvin.

2538
01:35:06,486 --> 01:35:08,428
Wasn't she wearing
the Isadora diamond?

2539
01:35:08,471 --> 01:35:09,551
Isadora?

2540
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:10,671
<i>Oh, mon dieu.</i>

2541
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:11,863
<i>Sécurité!</i>

2542
01:35:12,823 --> 01:35:14,896
No, no, no, no, no.

2543
01:35:14,935 --> 01:35:16,244
Hold on, Andie Anderson.

2544
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:17,489
I'm not done with you.

2545
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:18,639
You used me...

2546
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,760
Oh, I used you?

2547
01:35:19,799 --> 01:35:21,076
...to get ahead in your work.

2548
01:35:21,111 --> 01:35:22,256
You arrogant...

2549
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:23,703
- Hold it!
... backstabbing jerk!

2550
01:35:23,736 --> 01:35:24,784
- Lady, hold it!
- Come on, Andie.

2551
01:35:24,824 --> 01:35:26,417
All right,
you drove me half insane

2552
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:27,885
for a goddamn magazine article.

2553
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:29,041
Oh, yeah, and you told people

2554
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,968
you could make any girl fall
in love with you, and I...

2555
01:35:31,001 --> 01:35:32,245
- Ma'am?
- I was exhibit A.

2556
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,004
- Now folks, time out.
- You talk about integrity?

2557
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:34,969
- What?!
- What?!

2558
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:36,430
Look, please,
just give me the necklace.

2559
01:35:36,537 --> 01:35:38,610
Then you guys can go on
and kill each other.

2560
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,976
So that's what I was, huh?

2561
01:35:45,018 --> 01:35:46,032
I was a guinea pig.

2562
01:35:46,106 --> 01:35:47,797
Somebody you could test
your theories on?

2563
01:35:47,835 --> 01:35:48,915
Yeah, and I...

2564
01:35:48,986 --> 01:35:50,448
and I was...

2565
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:53,109
just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.

2566
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:54,489
Yeah, you know what? Big deal.

2567
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:55,930
Hell, I'm sure now

2568
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:58,352
you can even use it
as a little twist in your story.

2569
01:35:58,396 --> 01:35:59,803
It's a good idea.

2570
01:35:59,835 --> 01:36:02,007
Maybe we should bet on it.

2571
01:36:02,043 --> 01:36:04,051
You know what?

2572
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:05,237
You did your job now, Andie.

2573
01:36:05,308 --> 01:36:06,421
Yes, I did.

2574
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,922
You wanted to lose a guy
in ten days.

2575
01:36:07,964 --> 01:36:09,077
Congratulations.

2576
01:36:09,116 --> 01:36:11,156
You did it.
You just... lost him.

2577
01:36:13,085 --> 01:36:14,612
No, I didn't, Ben.

2578
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:18,840
Cause you can't lose something
you never had.

2579
01:36:39,807 --> 01:36:41,979
Well...

2580
01:36:43,488 --> 01:36:45,310
...it's not what I expected.

2581
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,699
It's better.

2582
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:51,038
Congratulations.

2583
01:36:51,072 --> 01:36:54,007
This shows me
you're ready to be unleashed.

2584
01:36:54,049 --> 01:36:55,031
From now on,

2585
01:36:55,073 --> 01:36:58,172
feel free to write
about anything.

2586
01:36:58,209 --> 01:36:59,900
Anything?

2587
01:37:00,001 --> 01:37:02,390
Wherever the wind blows you.

2588
01:37:04,706 --> 01:37:06,593
Even politics?

2589
01:37:06,626 --> 01:37:08,568
No, the wind's not going
to blow you there.

2590
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:13,441
What about religion,
poverty, economics...?

2591
01:37:13,475 --> 01:37:14,653
This wind

2592
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:17,058
is really more
of a light breeze.

2593
01:37:18,436 --> 01:37:20,411
What can I write about, Lana?

2594
01:37:20,452 --> 01:37:21,979
Whatever you want.

2595
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,165
Shoes.

2596
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:26,051
Laser therapy,
dressing for your body type.

2597
01:37:26,084 --> 01:37:27,971
Use your imagination.

2598
01:37:28,004 --> 01:37:30,143
The sky is the limit.

2599
01:37:33,221 --> 01:37:35,130
Thank you
for this opportunity, Lana.

2600
01:37:35,173 --> 01:37:37,245
Okay.

2601
01:37:37,286 --> 01:37:39,260
And thank you for
making it easy

2602
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,243
for me to turn it down.

2603
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:49,282
No. I mean, look,
it's not something I'm proud of.

2604
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:52,287
Obviously, if I could...
do it over again,

2605
01:37:52,327 --> 01:37:54,236
I'd do some things differently,
you know?

2606
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,011
Say, it's good to talk
to you, though, man.

2607
01:37:59,047 --> 01:38:00,258
It really is.

2608
01:38:01,095 --> 01:38:02,175
Ah, I know it.

2609
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:04,288
You are the only one...

2610
01:38:04,328 --> 01:38:06,629
that knows us both.

2611
01:38:06,664 --> 01:38:07,842
Yeah.

2612
01:38:10,281 --> 01:38:11,426
Hmm.

2613
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:14,754
You want to go?

2614
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:18,025
You want to go to the game?

2615
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:20,643
Well, go ahead,
'cause I'm not going.

2616
01:38:20,682 --> 01:38:21,991
Seventh and final game

2617
01:38:22,026 --> 01:38:24,262
of what has been
a classic series between...

2618
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:26,665
Sweetie, I wouldn't have gone,
either.

2619
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:28,586
I mean, I-I would have liked
to have gone,

2620
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:30,855
but they probably
wouldn't let me.

2621
01:38:33,963 --> 01:38:36,068
You're doing the right thing.

2622
01:38:37,387 --> 01:38:38,948
Oh, sweetie.

2623
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:43,329
There's the Chinese.

2624
01:38:44,748 --> 01:38:46,603
I'm coming.

2625
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,311
Okay.

2626
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:52,934
Okay, so that's going to be...

2627
01:38:52,973 --> 01:38:54,981
Michelle?

2628
01:38:56,974 --> 01:38:58,981
Andie...

2629
01:38:59,021 --> 01:39:00,396
that wasn't the Chinese.

2630
01:39:00,429 --> 01:39:02,023
It's Mike.

2631
01:39:02,062 --> 01:39:03,142
Mike?!

2632
01:39:03,182 --> 01:39:04,938
Yeah, what do I do?
What do I do?

2633
01:39:04,974 --> 01:39:07,429
Talk to him.

2634
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:09,478
Okay, okay.

2635
01:39:11,471 --> 01:39:12,715
Okay.

2636
01:39:15,728 --> 01:39:17,615
Mike?

2637
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:18,892
Mike?!

2638
01:39:18,927 --> 01:39:21,197
Hi.

2639
01:39:21,232 --> 01:39:22,858
Hi.

2640
01:39:24,048 --> 01:39:26,951
So, um...

2641
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:28,935
what are you doing here?

2642
01:39:28,976 --> 01:39:30,351
I don't know exactly.

2643
01:39:30,384 --> 01:39:31,464
Um...

2644
01:39:31,537 --> 01:39:34,090
It was last night...
I- I was...

2645
01:39:34,129 --> 01:39:37,195
I was just lying there
and trying to sleep, and...

2646
01:39:37,233 --> 01:39:41,063
you know that... that perfume
you sprayed on my pillow?

2647
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:42,730
Oh, yeah.

2648
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:45,072
Well, that smell is gone now,

2649
01:39:45,106 --> 01:39:46,928
and, uh...

2650
01:39:46,962 --> 01:39:48,872
Michelle, I-I want it back.

2651
01:39:48,915 --> 01:39:50,890
I, um...

2652
01:39:52,371 --> 01:39:54,673
I don't know
if you can have it back.

2653
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,591
Right.

2654
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:01,806
Yeah.

2655
01:40:01,844 --> 01:40:03,054
Okay.

2656
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,631
But I... I'm willing

2657
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:09,742
to-to consider it.

2658
01:40:09,781 --> 01:40:11,374
Okay.

2659
01:40:11,413 --> 01:40:12,820
- Yeah.
- Oh, my...

2660
01:40:12,853 --> 01:40:14,479
These are for you.

2661
01:40:14,517 --> 01:40:15,564
Thank you.

2662
01:40:15,606 --> 01:40:17,100
Hi.

2663
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:19,051
Hi.

2664
01:40:29,879 --> 01:40:31,766
We could... kiss.

2665
01:40:31,799 --> 01:40:33,457
I remember where you live.

2666
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:39,821
Who needs men?

2667
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:46,225
Ladies... frost yourselves.

2668
01:40:46,265 --> 01:40:47,541
Mmm...

2669
01:40:48,889 --> 01:40:49,969
Beautiful.

2670
01:40:50,009 --> 01:40:50,991
And cut it.

2671
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:52,210
Very nice.

2672
01:40:52,249 --> 01:40:53,176
You like?

2673
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:54,136
Oh, it was superb.

2674
01:40:54,169 --> 01:40:55,314
Okay, let's go one more.

2675
01:40:55,353 --> 01:40:57,044
Right away, people.

2676
01:40:57,082 --> 01:40:58,805
Real good.
I'll keep working on it.

2677
01:40:58,842 --> 01:41:00,631
Tim, can I see playback?

2678
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,810
Open me, Ben.

2679
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:02,930
Please, break my binding.

2680
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,180
- Jesus.
- Please.

2681
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:05,560
- Get that out of here, man.
- Please?

2682
01:41:05,594 --> 01:41:07,023
Straightening this out.

2683
01:41:07,066 --> 01:41:08,244
You might want to read this.

2684
01:41:08,283 --> 01:41:10,071
Ah, no thanks.

2685
01:41:10,107 --> 01:41:11,896
Yeah?

2686
01:41:11,931 --> 01:41:14,615
"I've lost a guy,
and I don't know why.

2687
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:16,342
"What went wrong?

2688
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,518
"When I started writing
this month's column,

2689
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:21,306
"I wanted to commit the certain
silly dating faux pas.

2690
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,675
"What I didn't realize was

2691
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,596
"that I was making
the biggest mistake...

2692
01:41:25,629 --> 01:41:26,839
of all. "

2693
01:41:26,876 --> 01:41:30,390
Here. Trust me.

2694
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:32,501
Read it.

2695
01:41:47,871 --> 01:41:49,781
Come on set.

2696
01:41:59,296 --> 01:42:01,206
Andie Anderson?

2697
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:13,370
Excuse me, ma'am.

2698
01:42:13,409 --> 01:42:14,489
Holy crap.

2699
01:42:14,593 --> 01:42:15,673
Where's Andie Anderson?

2700
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:16,662
She's not here.

2701
01:42:16,705 --> 01:42:17,949
- Where is she?
- She quit.

2702
01:42:17,986 --> 01:42:19,513
She's got an interview
in Washington.

2703
01:42:19,554 --> 01:42:20,350
When is she leaving?

2704
01:42:20,386 --> 01:42:21,466
- Today.
- When?

2705
01:42:21,506 --> 01:42:23,961
Well, like, now.

2706
01:42:26,275 --> 01:42:28,097
You're not a therapist, are you?

2707
01:42:28,131 --> 01:42:29,178
Oh.

2708
01:42:29,219 --> 01:42:30,202
No.

2709
01:42:30,243 --> 01:42:31,290
Good job, though.

2710
01:42:34,435 --> 01:42:36,290
You owe me 300 bucks.

2711
01:42:53,893 --> 01:42:54,908
Andy!

2712
01:42:54,949 --> 01:42:57,633
Anywhere you go

2713
01:42:57,734 --> 01:43:00,036
I'll follow you down

2714
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:05,343
Anyplace but those
I know by heart

2715
01:43:07,303 --> 01:43:13,381
Anywhere you go,
I'll follow you down

2716
01:43:13,415 --> 01:43:16,416
I'll follow you down
but not that far

2717
01:43:23,464 --> 01:43:24,839
Hey!

2718
01:43:24,872 --> 01:43:27,011
I know
we're headed somewhere

2719
01:43:27,049 --> 01:43:31,206
I can see how far we've come

2720
01:43:31,241 --> 01:43:34,405
But still I can't remember
anything

2721
01:43:37,162 --> 01:43:38,591
It's a long way down

2722
01:43:38,634 --> 01:43:43,010
When all the knots we've tied
have come undone

2723
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:47,240
Anywhere you go,
I'll follow you down

2724
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:51,878
I'll follow you down
but not that far

2725
01:43:51,915 --> 01:43:53,093
I'll follow you down

2726
01:43:53,131 --> 01:43:54,080
Woooo

2727
01:43:59,116 --> 01:44:00,229
Andy!

2728
01:44:01,389 --> 01:44:02,337
Ben!

2729
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,355
Pull over, we need to talk.

2730
01:44:04,397 --> 01:44:07,364
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

2731
01:44:07,405 --> 01:44:08,747
If that's what it takes, yeah.

2732
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:09,763
Now pull over the cab.

2733
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:11,496
Sir...

2734
01:44:11,565 --> 01:44:12,459
excuse me, sir.

2735
01:44:12,525 --> 01:44:13,573
Can you please pull
the car over?

2736
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:15,948
We're in the middle of a bridge,
lady.

2737
01:44:15,982 --> 01:44:17,029
I can't pull the car over here.

2738
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,564
Okay, well, do you have
an ashtray

2739
01:44:18,606 --> 01:44:19,981
or something I can throw up in?

2740
01:44:20,014 --> 01:44:20,963
Gee, lady.

2741
01:44:26,799 --> 01:44:28,141
Watch it, broad!

2742
01:44:28,175 --> 01:44:29,451
What the hell was that?

2743
01:44:29,488 --> 01:44:30,917
Is this true?

2744
01:44:32,335 --> 01:44:33,263
Ben, please.

2745
01:44:33,295 --> 01:44:34,244
Is this true?

2746
01:44:34,288 --> 01:44:37,158
Or are you just trying
to sell magazines?

2747
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:42,735
I meant every word.

2748
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,281
Well, where you going?

2749
01:44:47,345 --> 01:44:48,872
I have an interview.

2750
01:44:48,945 --> 01:44:50,221
Yeah, in Washington.

2751
01:44:50,257 --> 01:44:51,533
I know.

2752
01:44:54,994 --> 01:44:57,067
Where you going?

2753
01:44:58,674 --> 01:45:00,584
Ben, it's the only place
I can go

2754
01:45:00,626 --> 01:45:02,187
and write what I want to write.

2755
01:45:03,219 --> 01:45:05,324
No, I'm not buying that.

2756
01:45:05,363 --> 01:45:08,211
You can write anywhere.

2757
01:45:09,523 --> 01:45:11,411
I think you're running away.

2758
01:45:11,443 --> 01:45:14,411
Why don't you save your mind
games for your next bet, okay?

2759
01:45:14,452 --> 01:45:15,881
I am not running away.

2760
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:19,635
Bullshit.

2761
01:45:27,061 --> 01:45:28,693
Excuse me?

2762
01:45:31,317 --> 01:45:32,725
You heard me.

2763
01:45:35,893 --> 01:45:37,388
Bullshit.

2764
01:45:39,062 --> 01:45:42,029
Hey, lady, what do ya wanna do?

2765
01:45:43,478 --> 01:45:44,427
Take the lady's luggage

2766
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,648
back to her place.

2767
01:45:45,686 --> 01:45:47,923
She has alternate
transportation.

2768
01:45:50,647 --> 01:45:53,168
You callin' my bluff?

2769
01:45:53,207 --> 01:45:55,247
You bet I am.

2770
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:15,279
Look who made the trip with me.

2771
01:46:15,385 --> 01:46:17,393
It's our love fern.

2772
01:46:17,434 --> 01:46:19,060
Oh, Benny-boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.

2773
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:23,927
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2774
01:46:23,994 --> 01:46:28,217
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly

2775
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:32,113
I don't know why
I was so afraid

2776
01:46:32,156 --> 01:46:34,043
All of the time

2777
01:46:35,676 --> 01:46:39,451
Memories seemed to bother me

2778
01:46:39,484 --> 01:46:42,299
My whole life

2779
01:46:42,332 --> 01:46:46,075
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2780
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:49,938
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly

2781
01:46:49,981 --> 01:46:53,494
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2782
01:46:53,534 --> 01:46:56,698
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and

2783
01:46:56,733 --> 01:47:04,798
Fly

2784
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:12,185
Oh, and there's
always something

2785
01:47:12,224 --> 01:47:19,775
There's somebody right behind

2786
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:23,671
Well, we're not meant to be

2787
01:47:23,712 --> 01:47:26,942
Everything

2788
01:47:26,977 --> 01:47:30,523
We're just a piece

2789
01:47:30,561 --> 01:47:34,718
So spread your wings out

2790
01:47:34,754 --> 01:47:38,431
I don't know why
I was so afraid

2791
01:47:38,466 --> 01:47:44,795
All the time

2792
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:48,282
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2793
01:47:48,387 --> 01:47:53,024
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly

2794
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:56,443
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2795
01:47:56,484 --> 01:48:00,129
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly

2796
01:48:00,164 --> 01:48:03,645
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2797
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:07,492
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly

2798
01:48:07,557 --> 01:48:11,005
I used to carry
the weight of the world

2799
01:48:11,046 --> 01:48:16,545
And now all I wanna do
is spread my wings and fly.

2800
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:24,317
L is for the way
you look at me

2801
01:48:24,358 --> 01:48:30,469
O is for
the only one I see

2802
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:36,484
V is very, very
extraordinary

2803
01:48:36,519 --> 01:48:41,986
E is even more
than anyone that you adore

2804
01:48:42,056 --> 01:48:47,873
And love is all
that I can give to you

2805
01:48:47,913 --> 01:48:53,664
Love is more
than just a game for two

2806
01:48:53,705 --> 01:48:56,869
Two in love can make it

2807
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:59,721
Take my heart,
but please don't break it

2808
01:48:59,754 --> 01:49:04,611
Love was made for me and you

2809
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:35,044
Love is all
that I can give to you

2810
01:49:35,085 --> 01:49:40,650
Love is more
than just a game for two

2811
01:49:40,687 --> 01:49:43,786
Two in love can make it

2812
01:49:43,823 --> 01:49:46,441
Take my heart,
but please don't break it

2813
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:52,175
Love was made for me and you

2814
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:57,959
Love was made for me
and you

2815
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:06,959
Love was made
for me... and you...
