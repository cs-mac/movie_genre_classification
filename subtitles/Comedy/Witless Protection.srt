00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,288
Congratulations on your purchase

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,884
of the Spartan Police
digital training course,

3
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,055
guaranteed to turn you into a lean, mean

4
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,567
- crime-fighting machine!
- Here we go.

5
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,541
Ah! Damn!

6
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,348
Son of a...

7
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,117
Take that! Like that!

8
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,128
Take it!

9
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,987
The Gyro Spartan 3000, sold separately,

10
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,546
is the ultimate tool for developing agility,

11
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,057
catlike reflexes,

12
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,787
and total body control.

13
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,125
For just 99 payments of $99,

14
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,721
the Gyro Spartan will be

15
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,766
the best investment
you'll ever make!

16
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,616
One more.

17
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,558
You are well on your way

18
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,467
to becoming the super-cop
of your most cherished dream.

19
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,602
Larry here.

20
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,610
Bo here. I'm at Elmer's.

21
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,442
Better get down here.
We got us a situation.

22
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,608
All right, Sheriff, I'm on my way.

23
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,008
What's up, Boodles?

24
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,630
Let's go do some good.

25
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,385
What's going on?

26
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,354
Uh, Elmer's in the barn.

27
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,050
He's armed, and he's got a hostage,

28
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,093
somebody named Buttercup.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,324
We figure it's either his girlfriend
or his horse.

30
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,923
With Elmer, it's the same thing.

31
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,669
Hold that.

32
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,203
Oh, you.

33
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,964
Elmer! It's Larry!

34
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,101
Don't shoot.

35
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,371
I'm coming in!

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,984
Where you at, bud?

37
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,951
Right here.

38
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,683
Tell me your troubles.

39
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,783
It's over, Larry.

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,624
That damn mare's thrown me
for the last time.

41
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,427
I'm gonna put her down.

42
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,363
Stay here.

43
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,372
Put down that damn gun.

44
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,569
Hey, sugar.

45
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,339
Hey. Need a buttercup
for Buttercup. Huh?

46
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,312
Buttercup for Buttercup?

47
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,905
These is delicious.

48
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,541
There you go.

49
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,108
See what we got here.

50
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,688
What the...

51
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,453
Oh, for Pete's sake.

52
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,084
You big retard!

53
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,924
Hey, Elmer!

54
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,965
Next time, clean the burrs
off the saddle

55
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,499
before you put it on her.

56
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,898
Sorry, Larry.

57
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,595
Don't tell me, tell her.

58
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,900
Well, I ain't going to apologize
to no dumb animal.

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,872
You know, that's probably
why you're getting thrown.

60
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,704
You don't know how to treat a lady.

61
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,834
Here.

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,971
Go on, give it to her.

63
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,641
Good girl.

64
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,151
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,619
That's a girl.

66
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,989
Ah, jeez.

67
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,905
Smoot just saved the free world, Larry.

68
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,236
Where the hell were you?

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,708
Staking out the Krispy Kreme.

70
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,940
Putting up his profile
on IntimateCousins. com.

71
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,947
Laugh it up, you sorry
sons of bitches.

72
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,279
I closed that deal.

73
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,613
I made you a malt, Larry.

74
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,586
Drown your sorrows.

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,681
What sorrows? I saved Buttercup
and kept Elmer out of jail.

76
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
Then it's a celebration!

77
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,827
Ah. Boy, Connie,
you know what your malts do to me?

78
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,421
Countin' on it, darlin'

79
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,658
I get off in an hour.

80
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,893
Ain't gonna take that long.

81
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,628
I got Crisco at my house.

82
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,471
Hey, I thought that lure
is supposed to catch the big fish.

83
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,803
You playing a minnow,
there, Connie.

84
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,333
Gus, if Larry's a minnow,
you must be a shrimp.

85
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,505
Boy, big-titted and quick-witted.

86
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,948
That's how I like 'em.

87
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,178
She's the onliest reason

88
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,480
I stay around this two-mule town.

89
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,317
I thought it was for the free rent.

90
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,321
Or the fishing.

91
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,418
The unbreakable bond of friendship
that dates back to our formative years.

92
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,199
Yeah, I do dream of bigger things.

93
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,961
Although, Connie's ain't small.

94
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,559
I mean, big enough
for most fellers, but...

95
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,035
Nope, what this town lacks

96
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,541
is law enforcement opportunities
that equal my cap-a-cicity.

97
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,203
You ain't gonna find a town
with less crime than this one.

98
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,246
Smoot wants to shuffle off
to the raisin ranch.

99
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,248
How does Sheriff Larry sound?

100
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,374
Hey, better yet,

101
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,443
how does Special Agent Larry sound?

102
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,250
Federal Bureau of...

103
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,450
Guys who show their butt cracks!

104
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,789
FBI, Gus.

105
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,557
That's right,
I'm ready for the big-time.

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,825
'Cause I know a criminal
when I see one,

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,992
a rat when I smell one,

108
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,059
and a bad moon when it rises.

109
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,743
Bring her in.

110
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,545
Tell me she ain't hotter
than an electric prod on a hog's ass.

111
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,080
Did you see them fellers?

112
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,777
Them bulges?

113
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,480
They either got elephant mumps
or they're packin' heat.

114
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,490
Oh, you've been watching
way too many cop shows.

115
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,083
They try to go in there with me,
I'm going to scream.

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,128
Did she just say something
about screaming?

117
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,663
You think she's in trouble, huh?

118
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,992
Yeah, I do.

119
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,362
Oh, happy prunes!

120
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,993
Especially since Dotter and Marge
just dropped a deuce in there!

121
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,805
Four coffees to go, honey.

122
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,035
Black, honey?

123
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,284
There's a black
Suburban out there.

124
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,414
You know who drives
black Suburbans?

125
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,958
Drug dealers,

126
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,322
smugglers,

127
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,759
I'm telling you.

128
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,063
Keep your hands off me.

129
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,194
See, look.

130
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,603
Calm down. Don't make a scene.

131
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,969
What'd I tell you?

132
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,808
Did you see that rude jerk?

133
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,813
Yes, I did.

134
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,372
Not only is he a rude jerk,

135
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,077
I think he's a kidnapper.

136
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,778
Have you lost your marbles?

137
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,378
Come on, men in black,
high-class babe.

138
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,720
Babe? You think she's a babe?

139
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,520
She looked like
a different B-word to me.

140
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,993
"Furtervious," sneaky attitude,

141
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,654
security procedurals...

142
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,891
If this ain't a kidnapping,
I ain't a lawman.

143
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,435
Now that you mention it...

144
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,704
What are you gonna do?

145
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,935
I'm gonna rescue me
a damsel in deestress.

146
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,946
If you're gonna rescue a damsel,
I get off in 48 minutes.

147
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,916
Connie, this could
be my chance at the big time here.

148
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,442
You're blowing your chance
for a big time with me.

149
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,682
Sweetheart, you're
gonna be proud of me.

150
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,817
I don't want to be proud.
I want to get some.

151
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,925
Some help cleaning my garage.

152
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,899
Well, I guess big time can wait
a minute and 37 seconds.

153
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,196
Forget it.

154
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,203
You'd rather chase that other woman.

155
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,536
I wouldn't touch you now
if you put on your Billy Ray Cyrus wig.

156
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,668
She's kidding.

157
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,838
I ain't got no such like wig.

158
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,042
Con, come on, I really
need to do this.

159
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,642
Well, what if you're wrong?

160
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,883
Like the time I shot
that masked gunman

161
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,049
at Coleman's jewelry store

162
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,682
and it turned out
to be Old Man Coleman?

163
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,922
Yes, on Halloween.

164
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,433
Or that time I thought I cracked
that major illegal immigrant ring,

165
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,866
and it turned out to be the Sanchez
family reunion?

166
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,167
Yeah, Mayor Sanchez
was pretty upset about that.

167
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,766
All right, so I made
some minor mistakes,

168
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,574
but you can't make an omelet
without cracking a few walnuts.

169
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,138
Con, this is gonna be different.

170
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,653
Next time you see me,
that badge is gonna say FBI.

171
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,279
You'll see.

172
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,693
I don't love your job, Larry.

173
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,357
I love you.

174
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,804
Then trust me,
I'm doing the right thing,

175
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,239
Larry, please.

176
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:48,770
Darlin', a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

177
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,476
I know. I just don't
want my man to get hurt.

178
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,446
Then your love will be
my bulletproof vest.

179
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,318
Oh, Larry.

180
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,090
Women.

181
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,965
Who can possibly unravulate
their mysteries?

182
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,095
Then again, who gives a shit?

183
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,607
I'm just kidding.
I didn't mean that, Con.

184
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,977
Norm's Last Chance. This is Norm.

185
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,878
Oh, toothless son of a godless whore!

186
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,714
I got teeth.

187
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,153
And for the last time,
Mama was a dancer.

188
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,986
You got my money, cuz? A bet's a bet.

189
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,286
You gotta be kidding me.

190
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,192
That girl had more scars on her chest
than Frankenstein.

191
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,923
That's because she
was mauled by a bear.

192
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,931
But her boobs were real.

193
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,626
All right, I'll pay you. Shit.

194
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,293
But listen, at presently,

195
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,202
I'm involved in a high-level
law enforcement pursuit

196
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,173
and have reason to believe
that the subject in question

197
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,075
may attempt to regress
at your peril, man.

198
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,635
Speak American, Larry.

199
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,874
Got bad dudes
headed your way, Norm.

200
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:35,751
No, I am quite sure
that no men-in-black kidnappers

201
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,984
driving Suburbans
with beautiful hostages

202
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,787
has been by here today.

203
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,965
Well, burn the tick off my butt.

204
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,831
Hold 'em there, keep 'em there.
I'm on the way.

205
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,801
With my money?

206
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,269
We must be going through
a bad cell area, Norm.

207
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,638
I'll see you in a minute.

208
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,072
The oil's fine.

209
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,010
Hell, I'm sure it is,
but I have to check it.

210
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
It's part of the full service.

211
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,443
Consider it checked.

212
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,348
Well, I can't do that.
It's company policy.

213
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,942
All right, all right. just make it snappy.

214
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,532
The oil is fine, isn't it?

215
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,035
Yes, sir. Yes, it is.

216
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,098
What's that?

217
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,639
Oh, it's gas. It's gas.

218
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,804
You got a fuel leak.

219
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,580
Here, it's split.

220
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,516
See, GM gets these
chintzy hoses from Red China,

221
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,644
and they're not worth turd pie.

222
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,449
Shut up. Just fix it.

223
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,616
Yes, sir. Yes.

224
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:29,094
How much longer
is this going to take?

225
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,468
Well, I don't have
this exact hose in stock,

226
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,906
so I'm gonna have to improvise.

227
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,442
There's no smoking in here, ma'am.

228
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,832
How nice. A gentleman.

229
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,834
That's me.

230
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,273
"Swayve" and "deboner. "

231
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,934
Listen, I'm here to help you.

232
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,000
Help me what?

233
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,375
Escape.

234
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,435
From the clutches of evil.

235
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,414
How, by impeaching Bush?

236
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,781
Listen, just act natural
and get in my truck over there.

237
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,515
I'd rather get in a hearse
for my own funeral.

238
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,656
You need to speed it up.

239
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,217
I'm trying to execute
a flawless ejaculation.

240
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,025
I beg your pardon!

241
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,291
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. We've been nailed.

242
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,391
Get away from me, you pervert.

243
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,436
- Hold it!
- Blue 47! Break!

244
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,267
- Put me down!
- Hold my head!

245
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,738
Start the car.

246
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:46,642
Aah! No! Put me down,
you crazy grizzly bear.

247
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,379
Get in the car!

248
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,883
Ah! No!

249
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,312
Boy, those are real.

250
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,501
I didn't get the clip on!

251
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,246
Are you insane?

252
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,508
No, I'm Larry.

253
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,752
You haven't the slightest idea
of what you're doing.

254
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,155
Sweet potato, I know
exactly what I'm doing.

255
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,923
Brilliant.

256
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,831
Mobsters or terrorists?

257
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,962
I don't know. Are you
a mobster or a terrorist?

258
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,700
Not me, them.

259
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,038
They're FBI agents, you cretin.

260
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,008
I ain't cree.

261
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,669
So why'd the FBI kidnap you?

262
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,374
They didn't kidnap me.
They were protecting me.

263
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,881
You're kidnapping me.

264
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,282
- Brainwashed you, huh?
- What?

265
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,444
They do the Patty Hearst on ya?

266
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,215
A little stockyard syndrome?

267
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,915
Frickin' evil bastards.

268
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,716
Hey.

269
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,599
If I want you to play with my shifter,
I'll let you know.

270
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,141
Well, are you at least
going to excuse yourself?

271
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,543
Liberal, huh?

272
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,546
What?

273
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,741
That's what liberals do.

274
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,477
Always trying to
accuse everybody else

275
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,984
of doing the same thing they're doing.

276
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,749
Are you trying to imply
that you didn't just break wind?

277
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,723
That little squeak?
That was all you, sugar.

278
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,592
Believe me, if I let one fly,
they'll pick that up on the Doppler.

279
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,163
Well, at least roll down my window.

280
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,293
Oh, for the love of Mike.

281
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,705
Looks like you've
inflicted collateral damage

282
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,765
upon my finest mallard caller.

283
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,368
I want you to stop this truck
and let me out immediately.

284
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,539
- Aah!
- What the...

285
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,346
Stop this truck!

286
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,578
Sweet potato, I got a policy.

287
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,052
If somebody's shooting at me, I run.

288
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,520
Watch this.

289
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,596
Floor it!

290
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,634
What's happening?

291
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,297
It's the hose, sir.

292
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:33,507
He didn't get the clip attached.

293
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,212
Are we slowing down?

294
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,309
Are they getting away?

295
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,391
Does a compass point north?

296
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,559
It does, sir.

297
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,168
That a girl.

298
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,364
Boy, I love this truck.

299
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,000
What is that god-awful racket?

300
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,207
You need to download
a decent ringtone.

301
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,943
- Hello.
- What the hell is going on?

302
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,245
That's what I'd like to know.

303
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,684
Toby Keith's a good one.
Charlie Daniels.

304
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,686
Are you all right?

305
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,553
As if you care. You were shooting at me.

306
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,525
Waylon. Willie's always good.

307
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,958
Not at you, at the psycho.

308
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,495
You were never in any danger.

309
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,428
Oh, what a relief.

310
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,056
I was never in any danger.

311
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,566
He was shooting at the psycho.

312
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,365
Them son of a bitches almost
made a mistake and got me.

313
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,667
Give me that phone.

314
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,938
This is Deputy Larry Stalder
of the Amicus County Sheriff's Department.

315
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,740
Identify yourself.

316
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,610
Special Agent Ricardo Bodi, FBI,

317
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,206
Witness Protection Program.

318
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,220
I thought the FBI was supposed to
rescue hostages, not take 'em.

319
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,416
You seem to be laboring under some
misconception, Deputy.

320
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,358
We were in the process of escorting
a valuable witness

321
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,359
when you intervened.

322
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,419
Boy, I love that government lingo.

323
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,226
What's that mean?

324
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,565
I'm impressed, Deputy.

325
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,571
You're a smooth talker.

326
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,539
Your truck has deceptive speed.

327
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,235
Yeah, it's pretty fast, too.

328
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,902
Now, I want my witness back.

329
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,445
Let me ask you something,

330
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,538
how long you been
with the Bureau?

331
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,515
19 wonderful years,

332
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,348
during which, mostly said,
I have compiled

333
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,389
a unblemished record
of impeccable service,

334
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,821
which I'd like to keep intact.

335
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,688
19 years?

336
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,818
Shoot, you oughta be SAC by now.

337
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,919
Indeed, I am.

338
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,726
Scratch my nuts and call me shorty,

339
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,597
I'm talking to a special agent in charge.

340
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,001
You know, that was
always one of my not so secret dreams

341
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,007
to wanna be a G-man myself.

342
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,838
You don't say.

343
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,969
I do say, and in spades.

344
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,972
Nothing racialistic intended.

345
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,846
You think you could
write me a letter of recommendation?

346
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,580
It'd be my pleasure.
Now what about my witness?

347
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,790
Heck, if that's all that's holding us up,
let's go to the swap meet.

348
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,486
I'll call you back.

349
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,256
Standin' by!

350
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,432
Get your little book out.

351
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,696
Write down the name Larry.

352
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,804
Now draw a line through it.

353
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,678
I didn't think it was possible.

354
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,678
What's that?

355
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,476
For you to be dumber than you look.

356
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,448
Guess again, Longshanks.

357
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,917
You know, I didn't think it was possible

358
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,784
for somebody's ass to be
tighter than a bull's during fly season.

359
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,222
You don't even know
where you're going.

360
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,953
I know exactly where I'm going.

361
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,155
Shoot, I know these
back roads like I do

362
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,893
the ingrown hair pimples
on my ex-girlfriend's front bud.

363
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,866
I see.

364
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,890
You wanna step
out of the car, please, ma'am?

365
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,266
Just don't ask me to get back in.

366
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,805
Beautiful, isn't it?

367
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,971
If you like insects,
animal excrement, and dysentery.

368
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,481
Look, we ain't been
formally introduced.

369
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,450
My name's Larry.

370
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,316
I know, although
I profoundly wish I did not.

371
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,320
And who are you?

372
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,822
I'm Madeleine Dimkowski.

373
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,223
Pleasure to meet your acquaintance,
Madeleine.

374
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,922
Just have a couple of
questions I need to ask you.

375
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,623
Such as...

376
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,667
just what is the FBI
protecting you from?

377
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,066
None of your business.

378
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,125
So you won't talk.

379
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,330
Not a chance.

380
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,804
Is that your final answer?

381
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,506
Hey, you heard her, Skinny.
She don't wanna talk.

382
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,609
What's that?

383
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:06,276
No, we can't force her.

384
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,443
Shoot, this ain't Abu Grub.

385
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,611
Okay, I'll talk. I'll talk.

386
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,622
Just... Just... Just...
Just get that thing...

387
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,920
I was a senior accountant
at GiantCom.

388
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,121
I worked for Arthur Grimsley.

389
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,061
I know that case...

390
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,623
I know that case.
I seen it on Court TV.

391
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,601
Operation Looker Cooker.

392
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,933
Yeah, that Grimsley was
skimming six ways from Sunday,

393
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,633
had that good-looking babe cooking the books
and cuffing his pork.

394
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,573
Hey, why'd you beef?

395
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,907
You lost me in the meat section.

396
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,504
Grimsley dumped you.

397
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,607
He most certainly did not dump me.

398
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,209
I was just fed up with the venality
and the chicanery.

399
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,187
Well, that vecanery,
that chaps my ass, too.

400
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,884
But his goons will try
to keep me from testifying.

401
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,722
The FBI was escorting me
to the trial in Chicago

402
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,389
until you decided
to play the Lone Ranger.

403
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,329
Clint Eastwood.
I was playing Clint Eastwood.

404
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,331
Whomever.

405
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,332
Lone Ranger.

406
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,165
Them little powder blue duds? Shoot.

407
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,898
Them things would ride up my crack.

408
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,436
I'll answer it.

409
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,876
First get rid of that thing.

410
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,074
Shoot. Skinny?
He's just a little old rat snake.

411
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,377
He ain't gonna hurt nobody.

412
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,719
Let me see that phone.

413
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,359
Yeah?

414
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,457
You know Tutweilers
Pig Farm off route 45?

415
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,728
I do.

416
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,292
Follow the smell. I'll meet you there.

417
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,338
I'll be there.

418
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:39,469
Heh. Now we'll see who's
stupid, Miss I.P. Perfume.

419
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,518
It stinks out here.

420
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,680
Is it also humid?
Are we on planet Earth?

421
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,194
Hello, Larry.

422
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,431
You got my letter?

423
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,969
Right here.

424
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,594
Well, now.

425
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,104
What about my witness?

426
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,401
She's fine.

427
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,837
Say, where's your backup at?

428
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,133
What backup?

429
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,538
Section 17. It's in the manual.

430
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,544
Proper procedural
for a hostage transfer.

431
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,979
We don't always go by the book, Larry.

432
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,675
Go on! Get on out, everybody!

433
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,975
Now!

434
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,957
Enough. Enough.

435
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,054
This is silly. Get in the car.

436
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,534
Slide over. What you trying to do,
get me killed?

437
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,440
Jesus.

438
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,975
Just... go.

439
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,857
God damn.

440
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,361
You crazy son of a bitch!

441
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,561
What'd you do back there?

442
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,797
Found out Bodi's dirty.

443
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,304
Dirtier than Larry Flynt's diary.

444
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,364
- That's idiotic!
- He ain't followin' procedure.

445
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,272
Oh, as if you would know.

446
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:29,336
1, he opened fire
in dangerous close proximification

447
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,438
to a protected witness.

448
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,073
That's a violation.

449
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,280
2, he agreed
to my proposed location

450
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,015
for a little teet-a-teet,

451
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,613
and didn't have
the escape routes covered.

452
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,556
That's a violation.

453
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,323
And 3, he didn't call for backup.

454
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,329
- That's a setup.
- Is that all?

455
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,365
Ain't that enough?

456
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,923
You held up four fingers, Larry.

457
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,232
Oh, yeah.
My letter of recommendation.

458
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,439
Oh. He could just be indignant.

459
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,342
On a government salary
with benefits?

460
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,471
You kidding me?

461
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,742
Indignant, as in offended.

462
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,283
Not indigent, as in penniless.

463
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,546
Oh, forgot it.
Why do I bother with a man

464
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,088
who keeps a possum
in his glove compartment?

465
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,386
Wally's in the glove box?
Wally! Wally!

466
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,483
Don't!

467
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,858
What are you gonna do with me?

468
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,591
Pretty soon we'll be
in Chicago, there, Slim Jim,

469
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,498
and when I turn you over
to the United States Attorney,

470
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,536
I think you'll be singing
a different tune.

471
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,765
Quite possibly
"Achy Breaky Heart".

472
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,445
We only give free refills
to nice customers,

473
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,174
and y'all weren't that nice.

474
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,442
We're looking for Larry.

475
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,110
He ain't in my bra.

476
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,948
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,923
Who are you guys?

478
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,219
You look like that movie.

479
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,453
Is Larry an alien?

480
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,928
'Cause that would
explain a lot of things.

481
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,929
Nice beaver.

482
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:27,930
Crabs.

483
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,263
No, I mean...

484
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,826
He was attacked by land crabs.

485
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,134
Cut him up pretty bad
with their claws.

486
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,969
If, uh, Larry
wanted to get away

487
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,010
because he was in trouble,
where would he hide out?

488
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,670
His cousin's, probably.

489
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,509
- Who's that?
- He's got about 60,

490
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,378
spread across five states.

491
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,974
Hey, where's the chick
with all the jewels?

492
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,542
He has her. He has her
or he's had her?

493
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,782
He has her! I don't know
if he's had her.

494
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,323
'Cause if he's had her, he's had it!

495
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,517
No, I've had it!

496
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,854
This is a top priority case.

497
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,519
I don't have time
to play games with you.

498
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,325
Where's your warrant
to bust in here?

499
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,366
I can tell you in two words:

500
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,923
national security.

501
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,629
I can tell you back in two words:

502
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,796
bull... shit.

503
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:16,942
Okay, um, all right, all right,
gentlemen, let's...

504
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,815
What now?

505
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,547
Let's go see the sheriff.

506
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,343
I only stay at five-star hotels.

507
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,216
Well, you're in luck
'cause this is the Six Star Inn.

508
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,154
Shoot, you're worth four stars
all by yourself.

509
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,851
Is that a compliment?

510
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,485
You're quicker
than a mule gettin' nut kicked.

511
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,324
What is that god-awful racket?

512
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,386
It's my phone.

513
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,094
Hello.

514
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,003
The FBI just paid me a visit.

515
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,700
Con, you okay?

516
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,366
Do you even care?

517
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,240
Course I do. Where you at?

518
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,903
Your place, feedin' the critters.

519
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,709
Hey, where's Wally?

520
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,146
Oh, he's with me.

521
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,911
Those men in black busted in here.

522
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,545
But I chased 'em off with your shotgun.

523
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,747
Girl of my dreams.

524
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,016
Hey, we'd better get off the phone.

525
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,489
They might be tappin' it.

526
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,150
Hey, you better not be tappin' anything.

527
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,820
I wouldn't touch this
Big Bird-lookin' beanpole

528
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,363
with a stolen pecker.

529
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,625
Don't you try to sweet talk me, Larry.

530
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,098
Just keep your hands to yourself

531
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,192
and watch out for those G-men.

532
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,464
All right. Bye, Con.

533
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,767
Bye, darlin'.

534
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,110
If I could understand
what you were saying,

535
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,440
I'd be insulted.

536
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,606
Aw, nothing but compliments.

537
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,311
Come on in.

538
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,551
Cozy.

539
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,850
Got any cash on you?

540
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,189
Cash?

541
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,894
I don't think I got enough money.

542
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,259
Can't use plastic.

543
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,592
Big Brother will trace that.

544
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,264
Check in?

545
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,068
Oh, no, unless it's barbecued.
I'm a steak kind of guy.

546
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,101
Checking. In you're checking.

547
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,112
Oh, checkin' in.

548
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,545
Yeah, right, uh,

549
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,207
Mr. and Mrs. Earnhardt.

550
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,209
Nights, how many?

551
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,481
Oh, just one.

552
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,852
Hold on there, cupcake.

553
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:39,947
She got to go to the toilet.

554
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,720
You know, female bladders,
like thimbles.

555
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,489
I can see why, though.
We've been driving

556
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,291
all the way, uh, from Miami.

557
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,831
Bed king?

558
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,457
Well, you have to ask her.
I'm pretty good,

559
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,899
but I wouldn't say I'm a bed king.

560
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,459
- What would you think?
- You're not.

561
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,334
You know, maybe a duke or prince.

562
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,305
Size bed. King?

563
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,605
Two twin beds
would be fine, thank you.

564
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,645
As far apart as possible.

565
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,706
Card credit you have?

566
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,716
Credit card? You got
a problem with cash?

567
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,411
The almighty U.S. dollar?

568
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,181
La, la. It's policy.

569
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,222
Policy.

570
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,952
You know what? In America,
the world's freest society...

571
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,792
this note is legal tender
for all debts, public and private.

572
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,059
Can you read English,
there, pamper-head?

573
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,566
Pissing me off you are.

574
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,033
Card credit?

575
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,502
We just been
through that, Mohammed!

576
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,300
- Omar!
- Omar Mohammed

577
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,465
or Mohammed Omar?

578
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,532
Omar Bensaladine Sharif Al Rashan.

579
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,544
Well, son of a bitch,
ain't got to cuss me out.

580
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,842
At least throw in an infidel
or something I can understand.

581
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,438
Go burn a flag,
throw rocks at my embassy.

582
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,041
No card, no key.

583
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,553
Well, that's how
it's gonna be, huh? Looky here.

584
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,610
Oh, boy.

585
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,455
Out of jurisdiction you are.

586
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,729
You forced my hand.

587
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,958
That is what?

588
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,898
There, Johnny Quest,
this here's a swab.

589
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,698
And what it does is test
for explosive "resininity. "

590
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,170
Which in case, if I find,

591
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,174
I will tell my friends at the Department
of Homeland Security

592
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,766
and you'll be sitting at Club Gitmo

593
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,107
quicker than you can
say Islamic Jihad,

594
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,340
using your holy book here
for toilet paper.

595
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,849
Credit card no.

596
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,043
Key yes.

597
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,278
Thanks for your cooperation.

598
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,152
Okay, thank you. God bless you.

599
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,885
You're such a nice man.
I love you so much.

600
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,483
You're a funny little feller.

601
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,927
Trash white.

602
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,965
Oh, nice.

603
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,765
What a dump.

604
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,738
I'm famished, and I have to pee.

605
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,801
Well, let me make you
nice and comfortable.

606
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,438
So you see, Sheriff, absolute secrecy

607
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,312
and immediate action
are necessary.

608
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,908
I understand, yes.

609
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,919
This... This Lady X,

610
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,582
if she has vital information
about al-Qeada in America...

611
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,149
Oh, that damn Larry.

612
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,695
I wanted him to take over for me.

613
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,924
The poor simpleton
couldn't catch fish

614
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,431
in a trout pond with dynamite.

615
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,933
Do you think he'll call you?

616
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,696
Me? No.

617
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,794
Then who?

618
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,203
Well, if Connie can't
tell you where he is,

619
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,106
then your best bet would be
Bo, Gus, and Tater.

620
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,438
His law firm?

621
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,672
No, his drinking buddies.

622
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,908
You're a fine officer of the law.

623
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,975
Well, thank you, sir.

624
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,680
Six Star Inn near Brownsville.

625
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,122
Suspicious clerk called it in.

626
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,456
Omar Bensaladine Sharif Al Rashan.

627
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:34,430
Omar Bensaladine
Sharif Al Rashan, huh.

628
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,161
Sounds like a good American.

629
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,598
Honey, I'm home!

630
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,974
You doing all right in there?

631
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:50,409
What, are you thinkin' about me
in a pair of little shorty-shorts?

632
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,012
I'm coming in.

633
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,551
Sorry I took so long.

634
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,852
Aw, don't give me that look.

635
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,757
I'm trying to save your life.

636
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,561
Don't do that again.

637
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,260
Ever!

638
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,599
Well, as soon as you trust me,

639
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,299
I can trust you.

640
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,543
Madame.

641
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,174
Château Screw Cap '08?

642
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,512
No, thanks.

643
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,019
All right, well, suit yourself.

644
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,293
What's that?

645
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,229
Wheatgrass with spirulina.

646
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,325
Best stuff in the world for you.

647
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,767
Whew.

648
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,236
Smells like a hot tub
in an old folks home.

649
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,631
Let's eat!

650
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,048
For the lady.

651
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,813
Spinach salad...

652
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,855
with a side of your tofuie.

653
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:08,255
That ought to taste real good
with that pond scum of yours.

654
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,226
I have a headache.

655
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,693
Probably starvation.

656
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,127
Is that citronella?

657
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,826
I know you don't like bugs, so...

658
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,494
Outdoor use only, Larry.

659
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,161
The fumes are poisonous.

660
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,105
Only thing poisonous
around here is your attitude.

661
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,301
Oh, well, put yourself in my position.

662
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,437
Oh, wait. First you'd have to have
an I.Q. above room temperature.

663
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,416
The last female I was with
that was as warm and cuddly as you

664
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,043
was a porcupine.

665
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,279
And what's that?

666
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,688
Aw, a little present.

667
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,385
I got you some PJs.

668
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,122
Stop trying to be romantic, Shrek.

669
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,356
Romantic?

670
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,660
What, are you trying
to make me blow chunks?

671
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,167
Stuck-up women like you
put a rash on my nuts.

672
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,495
What's so funny?

673
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,167
I, um, owe you an apology.

674
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,006
You owe me about a hundred.

675
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,340
I actually thought

676
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,382
this was some warped stump-jumper's
idea of a seduction.

677
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,474
No, I never jumped
no stumps before.

678
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,985
But I did get a blue ribbon
at the Fair in clog kickin'.

679
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,113
Really? I didn't think
you people actually...

680
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,123
We don't.

681
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,683
Look, you misunderstood
my interior motives.

682
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,060
Typical womanly thing to do.

683
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,065
They all think men think like they do,

684
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,293
when in fact...

685
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,267
Their minds are much simpler
and less developed?

686
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,463
Yeah.

687
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,165
Can we eat now?

688
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,309
I guess that's a yes.

689
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,393
Is that really necessary?

690
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,955
Well...

691
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,228
you believe Bodi is dirty?

692
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,965
Yes.

693
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,565
Heh, nice try.

694
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,077
You get some sleep.

695
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,844
Larry.

696
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,717
Whoa.

697
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,917
They almost busted my rod.

698
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,629
I'll bet that's a 40-pound catfish.

699
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,829
Uh, what the hell?

700
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,496
I can't sleep like this.

701
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:12,338
Well, we could put the beds together.

702
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,571
I'll find a way to cope. Good night.

703
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,636
Good night, Madeleine.

704
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,191
Betty Jean,

705
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,259
I didn't know you had feelings for me.

706
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,573
Give us a kiss.

707
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,042
Oh, I do have feelings for you.

708
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,703
Didn't I show you that all night?

709
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,145
Ya did?

710
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,048
Yeah, but a girl
needs a rest.

711
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,607
And so do you,
handsome.

712
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,177
You know, I mighta
let you get away with it

713
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,223
if it wasn't
for that last remark.

714
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,019
But even I know
I ain't handsome.

715
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,150
Give me the key.

716
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,694
- Give the key!
- No!

717
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,108
<i>Way to go, chick from Alias.</i>

718
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,771
You done made me swallow the key.

719
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,610
One car, again.

720
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,948
No backup, again.

721
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,885
Still don't think he's dirty?

722
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,649
I think we can make it.

723
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,020
They might shoot at us.

724
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,063
You do have feelings for me.

725
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,155
- They might hit me.
- Well,

726
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,927
then both our troubles will be over.

727
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,161
Come on!

728
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,528
Hold it!

729
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,337
Cease fire, or your witness
will be a Sloppy Joe!

730
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,396
Cease fire!

731
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,487
It's a dud, sir.

732
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,527
Now what?

733
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,804
Now I must do what we were
trying to avoid.

734
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,173
Call Grimsley.

735
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,985
How's that?

736
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,580
No, put somethin' else on.

737
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,833
Man, forget it.

738
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,660
- Gimme some of that sludge.
- What?

739
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,004
Some of that algae juice you drink,
whatever the hell it is.

740
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,337
Yeah, here.

741
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,072
So good for you.

742
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,021
Hey, it ain't too bad.

743
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,318
I know.

744
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,367
Well, that was some good eatin'.

745
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,964
Where the hell is it?

746
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,235
Bingo.

747
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,879
You believe me now?

748
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,177
Maybe.

749
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,742
All right, we're making progress.

750
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,219
Now I'm gonna prove it.

751
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,348
I'm starving how about you?

752
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,961
I thought we couldn't use plastic.

753
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,592
Paper trail? Big Brother?

754
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,967
That was before I was sure

755
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,734
that Bodi and the Three Dwarves
was working alone.

756
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,174
Nail clippers.

757
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,835
What?

758
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,472
Oh, God!

759
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:24,250
Sir, I strongly suggest
you remove your boots.

760
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,948
You strongly suggest?

761
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,217
That's right.

762
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,419
Well, I'm going to have to firmly decline
your strong suggestion.

763
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,395
Sir, please do not attempt
to enter this area

764
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,022
without removing your boots.

765
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,828
Well, what happened to suggestion?

766
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,232
Your attitude is uncooperative.

767
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,329
Your attitude is snottier
than a teething toddler with a head cold.

768
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,464
Sir?

769
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,064
you are behaving
in a disruptive manner

770
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,076
that may violate federal law.

771
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,807
All right, I'll take off my boots.

772
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,042
But if I do, I got to warn you...

773
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,744
Don't warn me!

774
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,252
Warning a federal official
may constitute a threat

775
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,845
under the Patriot Act.

776
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,514
Well, then I firmly suggest

777
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,025
that you get gas masks
for everybody in this vicinity

778
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,426
'cause to be honest,
last time I took these off in public,

779
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,330
I had skunks coming out
waving white flags.

780
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,027
There is nothing funny
about homeland security!

781
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,831
- You're shoutin'.
- I'm not shouting!

782
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,338
Yeah, you are.
Why are you shouting?

783
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,896
Because I am a deeply insecure,

784
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,170
petty bureaucrat
with a domineering wife!

785
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,371
- And you have a gun.
- You have a gun?

786
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,038
No, I don't have a gun,
you have a gun.

787
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,138
Gun!

788
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,746
Get down!

789
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,252
Bitch!

790
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,915
Don't touch that!

791
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,355
- Hey!
- I got him!

792
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,413
Somebody call the police!

793
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,947
Bad mistake.

794
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,881
Way to go, Michael Vick.

795
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,751
What is that?

796
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,559
I don't know, and I don't want to.

797
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,259
It's disgusting.

798
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,596
Is that hair?

799
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,260
Send in the expert.

800
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,644
Oh, my God.

801
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,012
What is that?

802
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,209
Is it a fuse?

803
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,808
No.

804
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:36,818
I mean the lumps.

805
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:37,876
There.

806
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,117
I don't know.

807
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,658
You're the expert.

808
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,320
I'm going in.

809
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,841
Better clear the area.

810
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,744
Let's get out of here.

811
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:13,522
Sir, I'm going to do
a body cavity search.

812
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,024
I wouldn't if I was you.

813
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,152
It's procedure.

814
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:29,037
Officer down!

815
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,212
That's how it's done.

816
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,317
Sorry.

817
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,321
Whoa!

818
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,019
Whoa, whoa.

819
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,725
Oh, man.

820
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,700
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap!

821
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,031
What's with him?

822
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,866
- Hey, it's Grimsley, you know?
- Gentlemen,

823
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,204
I've seen better horsemanship
on the merry-go-round.

824
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,209
I suggest you work on your game.

825
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,676
Otherwise, it's work

826
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,474
you'll be looking for.

827
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,980
Cheerio!

828
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,038
- Okay.
- Okay.

829
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,843
Any calls I should know about?

830
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,583
A man named Bodi.

831
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,284
Get him.

832
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,691
Yes, sir, Mr. Grimsley.

833
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,962
That's him.

834
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,864
No question.

835
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,530
I understand why you
put it on the grid.

836
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,266
But why did you let him go?

837
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,969
If you'd have smelled those feet,
you'd have let him go, too.

838
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,443
Yes, yes, yes.

839
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,877
I'm not surprised

840
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,279
this man's feet caused an incident.

841
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,442
They reek of fear.

842
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,451
But I will follow that...

843
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,511
They were on the 8:30
to Chicago O'Hare.

844
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,718
They did not get on that flight.

845
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,817
I can assure you of that.

846
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,964
Arthur Grimsley.

847
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,470
Oh, yes. Mr. Grimsley.

848
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,507
I trust everything is in order.

849
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,543
Uh, no, um,

850
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,305
everything is not in order.

851
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,745
I couldn't care less about details.

852
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,782
Just get her back!

853
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,878
Under no circumstances
must that woman appear in court.

854
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,557
Reach out for Wilford Duvall.

855
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,959
Look, if Bodi wasn't dirty,

856
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,020
I'd be on the no-fly list by now,

857
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,497
and that little ruckus
would've landed me in jail.

858
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,397
Chocolate praline?

859
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,534
We need to find out
who else is dirty.

860
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:43,868
Other than your mind?

861
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,773
Who was your prosecutor
on the case?

862
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,470
Mark somebody, I think.

863
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,537
- Mark somebody.
- Yeah.

864
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,349
Come, my precious,

865
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,353
I got you.

866
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,657
Dagnabbit.

867
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,091
Keep your seats, girls, I got it.

868
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,763
Clubhouse.

869
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,030
Hey, quit lighting farts
and listen to me.

870
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,162
Yo, Larry!

871
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,603
Put the smart one on.

872
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,935
Hey, Bo.

873
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:21,000
Larry wants to speak at ya.

874
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,915
- Yo.
- Do me a favor.

875
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,952
Go on that computer
and punch in the DOJ website.

876
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,578
"Dyno-mite Jugs?"

877
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,556
Department of Justice.

878
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,354
Here's what I need. I need the name

879
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,895
of the U. S. attorney,
Northern Illinois district

880
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,023
and the name of the first
and second chair.

881
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,625
Bean bag and Barcalounger.

882
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,533
Call me back.

883
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,662
What?

884
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,672
How is that possible?

885
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,674
I mean, even in Chicago.

886
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,606
Hang on.

887
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:56,839
Mark Bedell.

888
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,244
Yeah, Mark, listen.

889
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:02,081
Uh, this here is the deputy director
of, uh, operations,

890
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:05,019
uh, FBI Regionalized Field Office

891
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,818
in the, uh, South Central Division

892
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:11,292
here in the southern area
uh, of the South.

893
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,658
Uh, yes, sir.

894
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,663
Uh, just one moment, please.

895
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,631
I got the Bureau on the other line.

896
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,930
I'll call you back.

897
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,469
How can I help you, Director?

898
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,334
Oh, just call me Larry.

899
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,532
Uh, this is about
Operation Looker Cooker.

900
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,475
Uh, news travels fast, Larry.

901
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:31,378
Faster than Angelina Jolie
adopting jungle pygmies.

902
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,710
What news?

903
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,079
I thought you were calling...

904
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,086
Uh, never mind, it can wait.

905
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,883
Why did you call?

906
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,018
Well, just to tell you

907
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,322
that Special Agent Bodi
is no longer involved

908
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,021
in the protection of our key witness,

909
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,395
and that I have put myself
personally in charge.

910
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,899
What do you think of that?

911
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,628
I think it's better late than never.

912
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,829
The disk has vanished
from the evidence locker.

913
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:59,167
The disk has vanished
from the evidence locker?

914
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,675
Yes.

915
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,609
You know what that means.

916
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,375
Uh, yes, I know exactly
what that means.

917
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,382
And that knowledge sits heavy,

918
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,817
heavier than Michael Moore
after a Las Vegas buffet.

919
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,411
Could be catastrophic.

920
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,615
And real bad, too.

921
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,317
Protect that witness, Larry.

922
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,620
Oh, you can count on me.

923
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,184
Her testimony is now
more vital than ever.

924
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,093
Hey, listen, Mark. From now on,

925
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,291
just so we can prevent
any more catastrophics,

926
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,459
I think you and I ought to speak

927
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,503
on a secure line, one-on-one.

928
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,970
Good idea, sir.

929
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,233
All right, I'm gonna call you back

930
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,899
- with some more particulars.
- Yes, sir.

931
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:32,942
10-4.

932
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,874
Ten...

933
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,037
Good-bye, Larry.

934
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,149
What disk?

935
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,516
Well done, Mr. Duvall.

936
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,387
So what about Madeleine?

937
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:53,725
Oh, Bodi fumbled the cow hide.

938
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:54,991
You mean pig skin, sir.

939
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,397
Don't correct my use of idiom.

940
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,630
Just secure my witness.

941
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,898
Roger that.

942
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,304
No, don't roger it.

943
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,604
- Sir?
- "Roger"...

944
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,076
is a British idiom for sexual intercourse.

945
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,476
I knew that.

946
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,844
I was just testing you.

947
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,214
Now you're testing my patience.

948
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,276
Get out.

949
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,791
Hey.

950
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,232
Oh, my God.

951
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,270
Yeah. Hearty.

952
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,396
They didn't have
any of that rabbit food you like to eat,

953
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:40,341
but I did get you some parsley
and some hot sauce.

954
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,207
Strangely,
my appetite has vanished.

955
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,680
Hey, traveling with you
is better than the South Beach Diet.

956
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,682
Oops.

957
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,723
Sorry.

958
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,222
I didn't know it was loaded.

959
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,422
Hey, let me see if I can do it again.

960
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,896
Try it.

961
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,867
And I'll tell them that you consider
facial hair an aphrodisiac.

962
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,459
If them fellers is African,

963
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,266
I'm watching the wrong
Discovery Channel.

964
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,137
Your attempts at humor are feeble,
juvenile, and bigoted.

965
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,640
A trifecta.

966
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,838
Let me ask you something.
If you ever laughed,

967
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,177
will that nullificate
your inheritance?

968
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,307
I laughed.

969
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,248
About those
flannel pajamas, I laughed a lot.

970
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,752
That wasn't fun laughter.

971
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,844
That was to scorn me,

972
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,752
to make me believe I'm beneath you...

973
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,018
when in fact, you're beneath me.

974
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,084
Or anyway, you could be
after four beers.

975
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,424
What inheritance?

976
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,862
A little garlic, some paprika,

977
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,662
genuine casing,

978
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,135
Dimkowski smoked sausage.

979
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,535
Unless I'm mistaken.

980
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,266
How long have you known?

981
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,899
Dimkowski of Chicago?

982
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:48,136
I mean, that's one
of America's favorite meats!

983
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,441
I grew up in a smokehouse.

984
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,140
Did your little boyfriends
try and kiss you

985
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,409
or lube you up with condiments?

986
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,646
I wouldn't eat another kielbasa
if it meant world peace.

987
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,524
Yeah, the missing disk
contains information

988
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,617
on the money Grimsley stole.

989
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,719
Oh, no, I'm starting
to understand what you say.

990
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,093
What else is on the disk?

991
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,359
Access codes to numbered
accounts in Sweden?

992
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,661
Switzerland, yeah.

993
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,033
And they're after you,
because the codes have codes,

994
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,402
and you have the key.

995
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:20,273
You are a surprising
individual, Larry.

996
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,548
That, however, was
entirely predictable.

997
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,544
Hey, don't tell anybody.

998
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,986
That ringtone is really
starting to grow on me.

999
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,581
Your secret's safe with me.

1000
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,091
Hello.

1001
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,788
Madeleine. Wilford Duvall here.

1002
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,660
Wilford, this is a surprise.

1003
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,925
You all right?

1004
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,489
I can't imagine you're being concerned.

1005
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,693
Who is it?

1006
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,532
You'd be surprised.

1007
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,265
Arthur's head of security.

1008
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,000
- Give me the phone.
- No.

1009
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,079
Who is that? Are you alone?

1010
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,208
Uh, yes, I am alone for a minute.

1011
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,683
Can you talk?

1012
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,749
I'll do my talking on the witness stand.

1013
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,485
Tell that to your boss.

1014
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,686
He doesn't know
I'm reaching out for you.

1015
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,888
Madeleine, let's talk, please.

1016
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,057
- About what?
- Me keeping you alive,

1017
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,101
and you keeping me
out of the penitentiary.

1018
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,364
What kind of trouble are you in?

1019
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,666
Arthur's panicking.

1020
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:26,800
He wants to toss me overboard
and sail off into the sunset.

1021
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,776
I'm going to need more information.

1022
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:35,917
What kind of leverage
does he have on you, Wilford?

1023
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,782
I don't want to say
any more on the phone.

1024
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:38,821
Come on, Madeleine, it's me.

1025
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,181
I'll call you back.

1026
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,315
On my cell.

1027
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,950
Bye.

1028
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,555
Well, it does laugh.

1029
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,655
Yes, when something's actually funny.

1030
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,166
Well played.

1031
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,636
Larry?

1032
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:55,966
Yes, Madeleine?

1033
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,132
You smell like my childhood.

1034
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,335
Well, now who's gettin' romantic?

1035
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,746
It's not a turn-on, remember?

1036
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,477
Well, I'm spoken for.

1037
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,285
Run the trace with NSA SatNet.

1038
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,987
The call was made from here.

1039
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,826
They're staying
off the interstates and toll roads.

1040
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,490
Which is a complete waste of time

1041
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,193
because wherever they
use their cell phones,

1042
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,862
it's like sending up a flare.

1043
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,740
And we're in a pancake house,

1044
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,505
Barry Bonds takes steroids,

1045
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,513
and the Pope wears a funny hat.

1046
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,542
I'm going to kill you,
Agent Orange.

1047
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,986
As soon as this is all over,

1048
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,818
I'm going to kill you.

1049
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,733
So just how well
do you know this Duvall feller?

1050
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,066
Ex-military.

1051
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,663
Very thorough.

1052
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,038
I shook his hand once.

1053
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,100
It was like being grabbed
by a steel lobster.

1054
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,508
Ooh, what's going on?

1055
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,241
Hey, it's a parade!

1056
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,550
Lemonade? It's only 25 cents.

1057
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,220
Larry, give me some money.

1058
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,763
Here you go. Keep the change.

1059
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,323
God bless you, ma'am.

1060
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,597
God bless you.

1061
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,498
Oh, thank you, gorgeous.
Thank you.

1062
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,340
Lemonade.

1063
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,079
Perfect.

1064
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,660
Hey, what's your plan?

1065
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,596
If Duvall's with us, let's find out.

1066
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:03,597
If he's against us...

1067
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,157
Let's find out.

1068
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,429
Hey, we're a team.

1069
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,061
T- double E-M.

1070
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,070
I don't know, it's like Michael Jackson
trying to run a day care center.

1071
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,635
- It don't make no sense.
- What?

1072
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,547
A fella buyin' Pamprin. It just don't...

1073
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,845
I comprehend the crude similes,

1074
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,681
but what they're intended
to illustrate eludes me.

1075
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,722
Look, if this Duvall
fella's on the up and up,

1076
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,087
then how come he
contacted you personally

1077
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,523
and not the FBI?

1078
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,390
I mean, come on,
he's a military man.

1079
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,692
These fellas gotta
go through channels.

1080
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,289
Do you think
he's attempting subterfuge?

1081
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,927
Plus he's trying to fool us.

1082
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:40,935
Look, wait here.

1083
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,471
Alone?

1084
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,301
If I get killed or captured

1085
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,070
or knocked in the head
with a ball peen-hammer, call Doc Savage.

1086
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,441
On my two-way wrist TV?

1087
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,605
That's Dick Tracy. Rondog Savage.

1088
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,546
My brother-in-law.

1089
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,914
He's the medical examiner
around this area.

1090
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,180
Black sheep of the family.

1091
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,484
He married my sister Bernice.

1092
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,116
Boy, she is a big'un.

1093
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,557
We went to the Daytona 500,

1094
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,219
and she wore a Goodyear T-shirt,

1095
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:09,924
and some pilot crawled up her ass
and tried to fly her.

1096
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,695
Anyway...

1097
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,261
Doc's in the book.
You get in trouble, call him.

1098
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,273
He'll help you.

1099
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,017
Who are you?

1100
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,747
I'm Larry.

1101
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:39,627
<i>Man, my hand ain't been this sore
since the first episode of Baywatch.</i>

1102
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,788
Where's Madeleine?

1103
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,991
Don't worry, she's safer
than Anna Cornucopia at a gay bar.

1104
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,262
I'm her handler, and believe me,
she's a lot to handle.

1105
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,168
What the hell'd you do that for?

1106
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:55,108
I'm under a lot of stress.
I don't have time for bullshit.

1107
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,805
Stress? Ha!

1108
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,576
Try driving around
with Leona Helmsley for about two days

1109
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,380
with crooked FBI agents
shooting at ya.

1110
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:06,547
You didn't see me sucker-punchin' people
that are trying to help me.

1111
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,487
What do you mean,
crooked FBI agents?

1112
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,550
Hold on there,
Mr. Cage Deathmatch.

1113
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,117
You called the meeting.

1114
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,891
That's why I ask the questions.

1115
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,455
Such as...

1116
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:21,060
If you don't even know that Ricardo Bodi's
working with Arthur Grimsley,

1117
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,903
how do you expect
to keep Madeleine alive?

1118
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:29,275
I knew that. I was just testing you.

1119
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,403
How can I trust you?

1120
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,970
- Trust me?
- Yeah, trust ya.

1121
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,037
Trust this.

1122
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,347
Oh. That was a fear fart.

1123
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,761
Sorry.

1124
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,272
Go, go.

1125
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,330
Go!

1126
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:00,739
I'm in! Go! Go! Go!

1127
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,804
What are we gonna do now?

1128
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,644
Hell if I know.

1129
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,018
Man, this sucks.

1130
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,254
You know, I always
wanted to be a G-man.

1131
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,559
Seems like the higher up I get,
the more crookeder it gets.

1132
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,066
I know. That's what I found out
working for Arthur.

1133
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,331
I am sick and tired of running for my life.

1134
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,837
I thought that was your policy.

1135
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:33,137
When folks is shootin' at me, run.

1136
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,870
Who said this?

1137
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:39,278
I'd rather get into
a hearse for my own funeral.

1138
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,610
I did.

1139
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,079
You know, the only way
to get them folks to back off

1140
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,451
is if you give them
the key to the access codes.

1141
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,982
Or if I'm dead.

1142
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,461
Wait a minute. Sure, I can kill ya.

1143
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,226
Then I'd have a lot
of explaining to do.

1144
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,696
No, I don't mean really kill me.

1145
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,638
Go, Wally.

1146
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,273
Yup.

1147
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,517
Well...

1148
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,922
I'm gonna miss you, Cocoa Brown.

1149
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:26,894
Been through a lot together.

1150
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:30,194
You know all my secrets,

1151
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,097
my moves.

1152
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,002
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna replace you.

1153
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,186
I'm gonna regret this.

1154
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,064
Whoa.

1155
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,860
Damn.

1156
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,801
Man.

1157
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,998
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

1158
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,064
The truck was a piece of shit, Larry.

1159
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:16,043
Yeah, well, maybe to you,
Miss Lamborganini.

1160
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,706
Born with a silver
hotlink in your hoo-ha.

1161
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:19,907
Have a little class.

1162
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,108
You're lecturing me about class,

1163
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,172
with your skid-mark underwear

1164
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,219
<i>and your family tree
out of Deliverance?</i>

1165
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,915
Look, having money ain't
the same thing thing as having class.

1166
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,856
I mean, ain't you ever
had a prized possession?

1167
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,223
One-eyed teddy bear

1168
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,559
or a piece of glass
polished by the sea?

1169
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,291
Of course not.

1170
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:37,923
When you can buy everything,

1171
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,934
sacrificing something
don't mean nothing.

1172
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,163
I haven't even gotten
your malapropisms yet.

1173
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,469
Malaprop... You liberals.

1174
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,168
Oh, you got an "ism" for everything.

1175
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,608
Stop being such a baby.

1176
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,270
Okay, so you had to
give up your truck.

1177
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,509
I have to trust my life to a backwoods
physician named Doc Savage.

1178
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:57,416
Well, that's true,
but I also had to give up my possum.

1179
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:00,478
Oh. Wally.

1180
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,456
Stop it, you gonna make me cry.

1181
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,034
I thought Botox was just for them
over-the-hill actresses.

1182
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,332
It is.

1183
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:19,636
In small doses,
it smoothes out wrinkles.

1184
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,370
What about large doses?

1185
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,868
It can be fatal.

1186
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,846
What did you say?

1187
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,485
What is that?

1188
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,756
My wife.

1189
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,024
Bernice, my sister.

1190
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,556
Remember the one
I was telling you about.

1191
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,198
Cute.

1192
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,767
Oh, it's okay.
She's just taking a pee.

1193
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,370
Now, this here
is my own special formula.

1194
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:02,008
I call it Botox elite.

1195
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:07,044
The trick is to use just the right amount
so that she look dead,

1196
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:10,923
but that she can be revived
easily with the anec-a-dote.

1197
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:15,225
Ronald! Ronald!

1198
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,390
Oh, I'm coming, Bernice.

1199
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,004
sometimes she needs
help with the, uh...

1200
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,300
I really don't wanna know.

1201
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,364
Thank you.

1202
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:30,234
Get up here!

1203
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,712
This may take a while.

1204
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,925
Nitrous.

1205
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,963
It's hot.

1206
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,159
Hurry up. They're coming.

1207
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,534
No.

1208
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,266
Yes.

1209
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,445
Hey, Larry! Larry! Get up!

1210
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,289
You sure she's gonna come out of this?

1211
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,416
Uh, pretty sure.

1212
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,755
Say what?

1213
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,422
Well, Botox ain't exactly
my field of expertise.

1214
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,523
I've been working on
a fat dissolver for Bernice.

1215
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,970
Welcome, gentlemen.

1216
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,909
Would you care to sign
the guest register?

1217
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,037
Oh, it won't be necessary.

1218
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,481
We'd prefer to pay
our respects anonymously.

1219
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,482
As you wish.

1220
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:43,540
How did it happen?

1221
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,816
Well, it was a vehicular mishap.

1222
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:51,849
She hit the nitrous
switch instead of the cigarette lighter.

1223
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,417
Was she alone?

1224
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,794
There were no other bodies.

1225
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,527
Where are her personal effects?

1226
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:03,504
Uh, there are no personal effects
that I know of.

1227
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,870
She sure looks good.

1228
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,670
And so young.

1229
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,439
Must be that joy juice
she always drank.

1230
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,741
Not even a wrinkle.

1231
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,840
Not even a worry line to be found.

1232
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,475
Not even a scratch.

1233
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,713
Let's make sure
she's really dead.

1234
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,557
All right, you bastards.

1235
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,857
Look what you've done!

1236
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:31,059
She's dead. She's dead.

1237
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,862
You want proof?

1238
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,863
You want proof?
You want proof?

1239
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,299
There!

1240
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,037
How's that?

1241
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,203
Dead enough?

1242
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,678
Larry, control yourself.

1243
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,884
My little innocent lamb.

1244
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,624
What do you think?

1245
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,022
He's nuts.

1246
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,719
And monkeys throw shit at the zoo.

1247
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,354
She was so young.

1248
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,660
I need that key.

1249
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,565
Forget the key. It's perfect.
Don't you see?

1250
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,263
She's dead,
and we had nothing to do with it.

1251
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,270
He's right.

1252
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,807
With her dead, the key is worthless
without the disk.

1253
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,035
The whole case will collapse.

1254
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,169
Governor.

1255
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,873
We were never here.

1256
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,474
Who was never here?

1257
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,019
Good man.

1258
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,859
All right, let's bring her back now.

1259
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,054
Okay.

1260
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:36,896
This better work, or I'll tell Bernice

1261
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,297
you've been hiding
the Ding-Dongs on her.

1262
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,858
Oh, Jesus, Larry.
Don't even joke like that.

1263
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,308
Sweet potato.

1264
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,844
Come out of it.

1265
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,277
It's Larry.

1266
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:52,507
Talk to me!

1267
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,880
Come out of it. This is Larry.

1268
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,111
Speak to me, Madeleine.

1269
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,678
Oh, that's not Christian.

1270
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,290
That's for slapping me around.

1271
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,328
That didn't hurt.

1272
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:07,760
You hit like a girl.

1273
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,763
Why can't we just call Mark Bedell?

1274
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,203
Oh, yeah, that'll work.
He already lost the disk

1275
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,241
and turned you over
to a bunch of crooked G-men.

1276
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,639
I think we can do better than that.

1277
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,700
But Larry, why go this way?

1278
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,302
Because you're dead,
and I'm out of cash.

1279
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,348
No.

1280
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,818
No, absolutely not.

1281
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,549
Aw, come on. This'll be fun.

1282
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,252
I can't believe
I'm actually going to do this.

1283
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,124
I'll go first.

1284
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,957
Forget it, forget it.

1285
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,468
Although you're certainly driving me
to the edge of suicide,

1286
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,231
I'm not ready to actually jump.

1287
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,296
Well, have it your way.

1288
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,248
You okay?

1289
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,260
We look like a couple chicken-fried steaks!

1290
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,476
This is Chicago, huh?

1291
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,444
Wow.

1292
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,980
Yeah. Wow.

1293
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,749
Boy, I sure wish Connie
was here to see this.

1294
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,446
Who?

1295
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,920
Connie, my girl.

1296
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,991
The waitress.

1297
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,427
Yeah.

1298
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,522
Boy, she is all woman.

1299
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,546
Well, here it is.

1300
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,813
Look at this, "The winning team

1301
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,516
"automatically gets invited
to the Summer Solstice Ball,

1302
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,718
which is inside the mansion!"

1303
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,661
When I win that game,
I'll be right in the belly of the beast.

1304
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,323
Do you know how to play polo?

1305
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,833
Well, no.

1306
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,869
But I know horses, and I know balls.

1307
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,836
- I mean, how hard could it be?
- Right.

1308
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,634
I'm coming with you.

1309
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,141
When Hillary bakes a batch
of cookies, you are.

1310
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:37,178
Well, you can't do it alone, Larry.

1311
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,773
Why? 'Cause I'm, as you say,
dumber than a barrel of hair?

1312
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,079
Well, now that you mention it.

1313
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,676
Look, you're dead.

1314
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,482
They might get suspicious.

1315
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,352
Oh, come on. I'll go incognito.

1316
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,016
You got to wear underwear.

1317
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,389
I mean, I'll wear a disguise.

1318
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,430
You in disguise?
That ain't gonna happen.

1319
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,559
What, you don't think I can pull it off?

1320
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,035
Look, why don't you
leave the law enforcement

1321
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,196
to the professionals?

1322
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,638
Why don't you?

1323
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,741
I'm sorry, Larry. I didn't mean that.

1324
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,000
Hey, smell this.

1325
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,873
What do you think you're doing?

1326
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,145
This ain't the rodeo?

1327
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,449
Here we go!

1328
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,985
Hyah, now.

1329
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,333
Oh, hey!

1330
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,197
Velma Hanes, New Orleans.

1331
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,703
- Morgana Grimsley.
- Oh!

1332
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,240
Lilian Grimoire, Duchess of Darbish.

1333
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,741
<i>Enchanté.</i>

1334
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,509
Who is that?

1335
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,106
That's my cousin Larry!

1336
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:56,081
Aw, damn!

1337
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,014
Here we go!

1338
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,422
Damn.

1339
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:10,160
Oh, one for the Queen!

1340
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,590
You're playing dirty, Grimsley.

1341
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,432
Piss off.

1342
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:25,371
What the...

1343
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,542
Real nice.

1344
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,822
Polo, they call it.

1345
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,891
Yep. Real civilized, like.

1346
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,266
Yeah, to me it's more like
demolition derby with horses.

1347
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,577
And that's how I'm gonna play.

1348
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,216
Get off me.

1349
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,288
Grimsley, get your stick off me.

1350
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:22,126
There you go. Get the ball!

1351
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,466
Grimsley.

1352
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,104
Whoo-hoo! Larry!

1353
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,272
- Whoo-hoo!
- No breeding.

1354
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:34,906
Plenty of class, though.

1355
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:37,816
All of it low!

1356
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,950
You know, having class

1357
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,583
ain't the same thing
as having money.

1358
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,301
Get off me.

1359
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,201
All right? Come on.

1360
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,726
Hey!

1361
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,664
Yes!

1362
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,676
Well played, for a hillbilly.

1363
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,877
Hey, I won.

1364
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,113
That means I get to go
to your big hoedown tonight.

1365
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,849
- In your dreams.
- No,

1366
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,584
I dream about
getting a nut rub

1367
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,818
from Scarlett Johansson.

1368
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,291
That ain't gonna happen.

1369
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,851
Nor will you be
attending the ball.

1370
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,367
Not even if I have the key to get in?

1371
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:00,731
Darling,

1372
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,736
don't get too close
to this diseased rabble.

1373
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:06,865
Oh, beaten by a farmhand.

1374
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,068
Pathetic!

1375
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,078
Come now, ladies, let's be gracious.

1376
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:14,741
Larry was victorious today.

1377
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:18,308
Therefore, we will have
the pleasure of his company

1378
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,877
tonight at the ball.

1379
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,186
What the hell are you doing here?

1380
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,885
You're gonna blow everything.

1381
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,552
No, I told you I could pull it off.

1382
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:29,188
Just shut up and act natural.

1383
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:33,462
So it's a date, then, tonight.

1384
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,833
Yeah, will do it. Thank you.

1385
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,428
Oh, I need a drink.

1386
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:41,203
He is falling right into my trap.

1387
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,636
That girl looks familiar.

1388
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,545
No.

1389
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:52,178
She just has
one of those familiar... asses.

1390
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,916
Man, I hate wearing
these uppity clothes.

1391
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:04,559
Hoo, boy! Don't you look finer
than box seats at the Monster Truck?

1392
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,828
And you clean up pretty nice...

1393
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,002
yourself.

1394
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,061
Well, we all have our assets.

1395
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,871
You know, I really don't think
you ought to come.

1396
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,775
Yeah, well, somebody's got
to distract Grimsley

1397
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:18,870
while you're looking for the disk.

1398
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,211
Yeah, but it could be dangerous.

1399
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,980
Unlike being chased, shot at,
and jumping off bridges?

1400
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:27,988
Larry, you and I,

1401
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:29,523
we're a team.

1402
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:32,219
T- double E-M, "teem. "

1403
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,421
Let me get my hat.

1404
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,361
You're gonna love this.

1405
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,235
I don't like it.

1406
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:45,739
Maybe I won't wear a hat.

1407
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,798
There's a lot of people not...

1408
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:52,372
- Now that I like.
- Better.

1409
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,438
- Let's go do some good.
- Yes.

1410
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,347
Team activate.

1411
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,480
One last question.

1412
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,251
Where's the key?

1413
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,252
Welcome, Larry!

1414
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,723
Oh, Miss Hanes,
you look ravishing tonight.

1415
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,884
Thank you.

1416
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,894
Tell you what, your decorators
must've been busier

1417
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,486
than a blow-up doll at a frat party.

1418
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,859
Boy, tell you what,

1419
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,062
that beef jerky
and marmalade ain't sittin' too good.

1420
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,297
Hey, you got a crapper?

1421
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,169
I gotta go pinch out a grumpy.

1422
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,006
Oh, down the hallway,
second to the left.

1423
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,977
Hope it's got a plunger.

1424
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,813
Let's adjourn to the ballroom,

1425
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,251
shall we?

1426
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,310
May I?

1427
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,234
Don't touch a thing, Doughboy.

1428
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,572
This stuff is priceless.

1429
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:30,975
I want that disk.

1430
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,105
I want that key.

1431
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:35,172
Why don't you come and get it?

1432
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,364
Crouching tiger.

1433
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,568
Winded walrus.

1434
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,245
May I have this dance?

1435
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,874
Yes!

1436
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,511
Madeleine.

1437
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,790
Let me shake your hand.

1438
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:24,923
I'm gonna shove that BlackBerry
up where it's gonna be a BrownBerry.

1439
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,883
Good save.

1440
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:49,056
How long have you known?

1441
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,024
I suspected from the start.

1442
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:56,223
But I wasn't sure
until I got close enough to smell you.

1443
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:59,323
Funny, all I smell
is the stench of your corruption.

1444
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:02,336
Oh, you used to love my smell.

1445
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,269
That was before you dumped me.

1446
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,773
Oh, that was a horrible mistake.

1447
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:09,332
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1448
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,641
Do come back, Madeleine.

1449
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,953
I've changed, Arthur.

1450
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,692
I have to do the right thing.

1451
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,257
Then do the right thing.

1452
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,861
You can say anything
you want on the stand.

1453
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,306
I have the disk.

1454
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:44,402
And without physical evidence,

1455
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,974
no jury in Cook County
will take your word over mine.

1456
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,916
I have the key.

1457
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:59,891
Oh, do give it to me,
and I will give you half of everything.

1458
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,854
Forget it.

1459
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,898
Oh, whoa!

1460
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:20,807
Hold on, hold on.

1461
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,782
Is this really 4th century?

1462
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,478
Yes, it is. Roman.

1463
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,543
Why, it's a beautiful piece.

1464
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:50,939
Where's that disk?

1465
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,673
Go to hell.

1466
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:55,646
Is that your final answer?

1467
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:05,983
If you won't talk, maybe this will.

1468
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,729
Complicated, huh?

1469
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,843
No way.

1470
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:31,408
That is cool.

1471
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,990
Bingo.

1472
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:50,936
Well, we can have a shoot-out.

1473
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,802
And I surely will die.

1474
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,398
But so will you.

1475
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,908
Make me an offer.

1476
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,070
Why don't you come back
from the dark side?

1477
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,137
Help me put Grimsley in the big house,

1478
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,309
and I'll tell everybody
you and I was in this together.

1479
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,011
The dark side's more fun.

1480
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:07,748
So is shooting out a window
with a potato gun.

1481
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,491
I've got a better idea, Larry.

1482
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,159
Wait in the car.

1483
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,605
You let me go,

1484
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,142
clear out the safe,

1485
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,643
say there wasn't nothin' in it.

1486
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,771
I can do all that after I kill you.

1487
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:34,109
Yeah, but my way's better.

1488
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,581
That way, nobody
hears the gunshots,

1489
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,912
and you ain't got to worry about

1490
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,385
disposing of a two hundred and six...

1491
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,251
eighteen-pound law man.

1492
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,422
Deal...

1493
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:45,823
or no deal?

1494
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,085
Would you like to call a friend?

1495
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:51,688
- Wrong show.
- No, it ain't. Regis host...

1496
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,290
Never mind.

1497
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:54,892
Deal?

1498
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:55,958
Yeah.

1499
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:02,808
Good luck to you.

1500
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,243
- Take care of yourself, Larry.
- I'll do it.

1501
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,554
Hey, Enron,

1502
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,851
you trying to diddle my cousin?

1503
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,891
Get lost, white trash.

1504
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,395
Who you calling white trash,
you phony sack of shit?

1505
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:22,827
Get out,

1506
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:27,630
or I'll break Madeleine's
pretty little neck.

1507
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:31,229
Go ahead, I got a whole
passel of cousins.

1508
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,295
Did you say Madeleine?

1509
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:33,772
He knows, Larry.

1510
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:36,002
Does he know the lighter's the key, too?

1511
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,738
He does now.

1512
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,069
Oh, damn.

1513
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,617
Now I'm madder than
a two-fingered cripple

1514
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:45,312
trying to return a text message.

1515
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:48,378
Let's go to the swap meet.

1516
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:52,089
What do you want?

1517
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,559
The key?

1518
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,617
Or the girl?

1519
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,425
That's a tough question.

1520
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,328
Larry!

1521
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:00,898
I'll take the lady.

1522
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:04,028
Oh, you're not as stupid as you look.

1523
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,737
Larry.

1524
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:09,072
I'm impressed.
You chose me over your duty.

1525
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,134
Well,

1526
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,702
not really.

1527
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,645
What did you give Arthur?

1528
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:20,777
Don't tell my heart

1529
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,686
My achy breaky heart

1530
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:26,818
I just don't think he'd understand

1531
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,555
And if you tell my heart

1532
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,426
My achy breaky heart

1533
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:33,626
I might blow up and kill this man

1534
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,037
- Here they come!
- There they are!

1535
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:55,114
- Good job, Larry.
- Thanks.

1536
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:56,588
Hey, but Grimsley has the key.

1537
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:57,851
No problem, we got a copy.

1538
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,688
We kept it separate
from the evidence locker.

1539
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,423
Well, I guess
you wouldn't fall in a barrel of titties

1540
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,055
and come out sucking your thumb.

1541
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:10,969
Mr. Grimsley, do you have a statement?

1542
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:16,910
How do you feel about Madeleine
turning her back on you?

1543
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,276
Larry,

1544
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:22,714
you're better than any FBI agent
I've ever worked with.

1545
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,046
Why not make it official?

1546
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:25,449
I appreciate the offer, Mark.

1547
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,387
Once upon a time,
I'd have took you up on that.

1548
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:31,516
Nope, I'm just
a small-town boy at heart.

1549
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:32,524
Good luck then, Larry.

1550
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,117
Thank you. Madeleine?

1551
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,527
- In a minute.
- Okay.

1552
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,565
Well?

1553
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:41,295
You sure you don't
want to stick around?

1554
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,963
No, I did my job.

1555
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,666
Tell you what, I'm gonna miss
that pond sludge of yours.

1556
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:49,005
I'm gonna miss your bodily functions.

1557
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:50,202
Really?

1558
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,109
No!

1559
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,878
Bye, Larry.

1560
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:58,509
I'll see you around,

1561
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,178
Longshanks.

1562
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,934
I would've retired years ago

1563
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,837
but I didn't think you could handle the job.

1564
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,467
But I was wrong.

1565
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:23,874
Thanks, Sheriff.

1566
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,208
Ex-Sheriff.

1567
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:31,979
Not so fast, boys.

1568
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:39,121
Thanks, Con.

1569
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:43,186
<i>I didn't think I'd ever see you again,
except maybe on Cops.</i>

1570
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:46,631
Well, guess I had to take
the long way around

1571
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:52,007
to figure out what I really wanted
was just to be with you.
