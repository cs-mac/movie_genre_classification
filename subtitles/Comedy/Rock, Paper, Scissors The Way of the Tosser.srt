1
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,551
<i>My name is Augusten Burroughs.</i>

2
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,561
<i>Where do I begin to tell the
story of how my mother left me,</i>

3
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,655
<i>And then I left my mother?</i>

4
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,271
<i>Maybe I should begin with the part
about how she'd keep me home from school.</i>

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,806
<i>That's how close we were.</i>

6
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,307
<i>I was so crazy about her.</i>

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,106
Oh, hello, Miss Mimm, this
is Deirdre Burroughs calling.

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,941
Augusten won't be
attending school today.

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,845
I over-Conditioned my hair.

10
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,782
He over-Conditioned
his hair. And the party.

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,185
And he has to help me
with the dinner party.

12
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,688
Thank you.

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,562
<i>My mother was crazy about me too.</i>

14
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,999
<i>I've always known that.</i>

15
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,830
<i>I guess it doesn't matter where I begin,</i>

16
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,668
<i>Because nobody's gonna
believe me anyway.</i>

17
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,312
<i>Augusten.</i>

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,648
Wake up. Wake up.

19
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,155
Augusten. Wake up.

20
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,125
I need you.

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,890
Okay. Testing. Testing. Can you hear me?

22
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,266
Childhood is gone. What remains?

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,574
Childhood is gone. And youth.

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,878
And ties with people I
have loved are broken now.

25
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,423
My grief is more than
I can easily contain.

26
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,758
My grief builds this town anew

27
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:16,131
And raises all the dead
to walk with me this day.

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,799
What's left?

29
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,238
My future seems nefarious,

30
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,173
Drained of mystery

31
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,074
Known in my bones.

32
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,983
Most of all, what I will miss

33
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,751
Is the extravagance of my entire future

34
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,487
Stretched out before me
like a highway in the desert.

35
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,156
Waves of heat rising
up, wrinkling the air.

36
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,725
I weep for what is gone.

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,964
And I weep for myself.

38
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,110
Okay, now I need your honest
reaction. Did it feel powerful to you?

39
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,978
Emotionally charged?

40
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,019
<i>It really does seem like something
you'd read in The New Yorker.</i>

41
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,148
You really think so?

42
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,886
<i>The New Yorker's very selective.
They don't publish just anyone.</i>

43
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,985
I really think they would publish this.

44
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,224
That thing with your paralyzed
sister, that was great.

45
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,901
Well, we'll see.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,598
<i>I just got a rejection letter
from The Virginia Quarterly.</i>

47
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,099
That worries me.

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,374
<i>Of course, if The New Yorker did accept
this poem, your grandmother would see it.</i>

49
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,280
I can't imagine what she would say.

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,519
But I can't let her reaction
keep me from publishing.

51
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,619
Augusten,

52
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,563
Your mother was meant to
be a very famous woman.

53
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,184
I have a reading. I have books to sign.
I told you to be here at 4:00. It's 4:30.

54
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,450
I got stuck in traffic. Bullshit.
You're trying to sabotage me.

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,405
Wanna play checkers, Dad?

56
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,880
Not right now, son. My back is out, I've
got papers to grade and I'm very tired.

57
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,509
So why don't you go outside and
play with the dog for a little while?

58
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,918
But I'm sick of Cream. All
she wants to do is sleep.

59
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,820
She's an old lady.

60
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,704
<i>Testing. One, two, three.</i>

61
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,781
<i>Thank you for coming to
my poetry reading tonight.</i>

62
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,014
<i>Childhood is gone. What remains?</i>

63
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,725
<i>Childhood is gone. And youth.</i>

64
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,193
<i>And ties with people I
have loved are broken now.</i>

65
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,891
<i>My grief is more than
I can easily contain.</i>

66
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,218
What's left?

67
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,822
My future seems nefarious

68
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,122
Drained of mystery

69
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,528
Known in my bones.

70
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,627
<i>Thank you.</i>

71
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,078
I don't understand.

72
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,244
I polish my allowance.

73
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,721
I boil it clean, then
polish it with silver polish.

74
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,918
But why, Augusten? Why?

75
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,458
Because I like shiny things.

76
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,664
I really don't see myself in you at all.

77
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm more like my mom.

78
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,609
I wanna be special
and I wanna be famous.

79
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,225
Are you going to a funeral?

80
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,663
No. No, sweetie. It's a gown for
public appearances. You wanna cut?

81
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,134
See, the plan is, I'm announced,
at some place grand and serious

82
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,334
Like Carnegie Hall.

83
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,842
And I come out in this.

84
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,812
And I stand in front of
a black velvet curtain.

85
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,511
I'm gonna demand that in my contract.

86
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,016
And that way, everything
fades away, except my writing.

87
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,710
The mail came.

88
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,316
And when the sun comes out

89
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,512
The daffodil looks skyward.

90
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,088
Wet from the rain

91
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,885
But not broken.

92
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,753
Triumphant trumpet.

93
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,497
Did you like it, Deirdre?

94
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,637
I've been working on it since the
last meeting of the poetry club.

95
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,999
You said, "Write what you know."

96
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,504
I love to garden so I thought I
would write about dirt and the sun.

97
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,172
It's shit, Fern.

98
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,048
It's sentimental. It's
emotionally dishonest.

99
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,623
It implodes into
nothingness. I was bored.

100
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,826
Were you bored, Christy?

101
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,529
It sort of didn't go anywhere.

102
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,900
You didn't tap into your
creative unconscious, Fern.

103
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,802
Honey.

104
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,043
I'm sorry, Deirdre.

105
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,480
I so wanted to have a creative outlet
and I thought maybe this was it.

106
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,645
But you're right. It's terrible.

107
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:28,091
If Anne Sexton writes about flowers, Fern,
the poem isn't about the goddamn flowers.

108
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,096
The flowers would wilt and rot.

109
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,225
She'd use metaphor to explore her dead
marriage, her pain. You understand?

110
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:43,436
Sexton's therapist told her to write
poetry as a way to exorcize her rage.

111
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,445
Now, she's not a housewife.
She's a rock 'n' roller. Okay?

112
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,017
Last week in Boston, 2000 people waited
in a fucking blizzard to hear her read.

113
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,418
That's power recovered. So
that's what you need to do, Fern.

114
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,457
You need to recover by
expressing your anger.

115
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,826
I am angry.

116
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,799
Steve takes me for granted.
There it is again. Men.

117
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm so sorry.

118
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,603
No, don't you dare apologize, Fern.

119
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:20,168
You funnel that rage into the
only escape you have. Your art.

120
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,084
Who wants to read next?

121
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,354
Christy, you're hiding.

122
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,421
I'm just not quite there.

123
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,761
Get the rage on the page, women.

124
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,070
You infantile tyrant! Jesus.

125
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,973
You'd like nothing more than
to see me slit my wrists!

126
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,603
Why don't you just settle down?
You know, you are hysterical.

127
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,511
You're so goddamn hysterical!

128
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,708
I'm hysterical? You think
this is hysterical? Yes!

129
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,878
You poor bastard! You're
so repressed that you...

130
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,753
You mistake creative passion
for hysteria! Don't you see?

131
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,450
This is how you're killing me.

132
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,323
Nobody is trying to kill you, Deirdre.

133
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,794
You're doing a perfectly
good job of it yourself.

134
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,331
I wish you'd rot in hell. I
regret the day I ever married you.

135
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,832
Will you two stop fighting?

136
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,529
This is between me and your
father! Your father is the one...

137
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,628
Well, I live here too, you know!

138
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,267
Look at you. Look at your damn face.
You got the face of a man twice your age.

139
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,105
Forty-Five going on 90!

140
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,770
Will you just shut up?

141
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,051
He's not moving!

142
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,590
No, he's just playing another one
of his horribly manipulative games.

143
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,326
Get up, Norman!

144
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,363
Get up, Norman.

145
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,573
Enough of your pranks.

146
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,064
Please don't kill her.

147
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,196
He's not gonna kill me.

148
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,204
He'd rather suffocate me with his
horribly oppressive manipulation

149
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,040
And then wait for me
to cut my own throat.

150
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,089
Go to bed. Go to bed, Augusten.

151
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,552
You've got school in the morning.

152
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,890
I don't want to go to school.

153
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,964
You've got to go, Augusten!

154
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,299
You can't keep skipping
or I'll get arrested.

155
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,701
Why can't we just be a normal family?

156
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,108
Oh, thank God.

157
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,383
Hello there.

158
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,786
Please come in.

159
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,753
I've just been a frantic wreck
waiting for you to get here.

160
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,488
It's okay now, Mrs. Burroughs.

161
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,996
Oh, no, please. Call me Deirdre.

162
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,199
Where's Norman, dear?

163
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,565
Oh, he's passed out drunk.

164
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,197
I see. I was afraid for my life tonight.

165
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,972
I thought for sure he was gonna kill
me, that this would finally be the night.

166
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,742
Would you like a Sanka?

167
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:21,047
I'd like some slices of bologna
with a side of horseradish.

168
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,457
Do you mind, son?

169
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:43,234
Don't you worry about your parents,
buckaroo. We'll get this all sorted out.

170
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,003
Good luck.

171
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,805
I just pray to God Norman doesn't snap.

172
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,607
One of these days he's
gonna snap and kill us all.

173
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,738
Enough!

174
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,379
That's not the way to
talk around your son.

175
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,249
You need to comfort
him, not frighten him.

176
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,083
That's right. I know.

177
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,426
I'm sorry, Augusten. I'm
just very upset right now.

178
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,758
Sit down, Deirdre.

179
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,428
Good night, Augusten.

180
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,705
Now.

181
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,844
I'm gonna ask you a number of
questions if that's all right with you.

182
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,854
They may seem rather personal. In
fact, you may not see the relevance.

183
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:36,792
But I believe that's up to
me, as the doctor, to decide.

184
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,929
So,

185
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,230
Your

186
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,198
Anxiety level.

187
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,769
How would you describe it?

188
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,246
Well, I'm just frantic.

189
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,681
I'm very, very upset. I'm very anxious.

190
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,753
I feel very emotionally charged.

191
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,283
And I feel like I'm
at the end of my rope.

192
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,191
Tell me about your bowel movements.

193
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,093
Have you noticed any
changes either in regularity,

194
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,656
Or the shape and density
of the bowel matter itself?

195
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,963
Is that really...

196
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,600
I mean... Do we have to...

197
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:30,012
What I'm getting at is constipation.
Both literal and subconscious.

198
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,080
Are you constipated
in your life, Deirdre?

199
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,013
Stuck?

200
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,757
I am.

201
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,123
I am stuck.

202
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,424
I understand you write a lot. Are
you energetic when you write? Frantic?

203
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,568
Well...

204
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:58,633
When I write I'm writing from
my unconscious. Or I'm trying to.

205
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,110
Do you have sex with your husband?

206
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,748
Yes. Do you enjoy it?

207
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,228
Back to your anxiety for a moment.

208
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,696
You have thoughts of suicide, Deirdre?

209
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,194
Do you have suicidal thoughts?

210
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,965
Do you ever think of killing yourself?

211
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,983
And how often would you say you
have these thoughts of suicide?

212
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,458
Right after I have sex with my husband.

213
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,098
What are those?

214
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,838
Valium.

215
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,676
To quiet the nerves.

216
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,964
Is he an MD doctor?

217
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,236
Yes, and as I've told you 100
times, he got his MD at Yale.

218
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,709
And you heard about this guy from where?

219
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,302
Dr. Nupal.

220
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,608
Augusten's allergist.

221
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:50,882
If you were more of a man and involved in
your son's life, you'd know who that was.

222
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,820
I smell manure.

223
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,588
I don't smell anything.

224
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,925
I do, I smell manure. It's
coming out of your ears.

225
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,896
Fucking bitch.

226
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,763
I'm unhappy.

227
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,639
I'm unhappy.

228
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,303
Norman, if you're so unhappy,
why stay in this marriage?

229
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,812
I don't know why.

230
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,178
My son.

231
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,914
I don't think that's why you stay, Norman.
I think you stay because it's comfortable.

232
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,512
It's what you know.

233
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,525
You were trapped in your
childhood by a castrating mother,

234
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,324
And as an adult male you have
sought the same female archetype.

235
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,128
Well, that's just
brilliant. And very true.

236
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,764
Deirdre, smoking is a great
privilege in my sanctuary.

237
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,301
But for you, I will allow it.

238
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,740
Thank you.

239
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,380
So you're saying we should split up?

240
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,081
In order to reach that
conclusion, Norman,

241
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,718
I would need to see both you and Deirdre
on a regular and disciplined basis.

242
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,295
For five hours a day.

243
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,421
I'm available, Dr. Finch.

244
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,433
Five hours a day? I can't
do that. I have to work!

245
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,470
See, Dr. Finch, I told you.
I'm married to a narcissist.

246
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,509
Norman, if I'm willing to clear my schedule
to save your marriage but you're not,

247
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,100
Then get out.

248
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,442
Leave this office, go home,

249
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,778
And start dividing your
books and your record albums.

250
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,545
This is bullshit.

251
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,413
This is really fucking bullshit.

252
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,127
What are you writing?

253
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,070
Norman Burroughs is homicidal.
He is an unapologetic alcoholic.

254
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:53,110
He is dangerous, a threat to
himself, his wife and his child.

255
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,922
Finally, somebody sees.

256
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,326
Deirdre, express yourself. Let it out.

257
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,494
Tell Augusten and I why you are crying.

258
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,569
'Cause I...

259
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,302
I did love Norman once, long ago,

260
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,810
But I never should've married him.

261
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,803
So why did you?

262
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:35,317
He threatened to kill himself if I turned
down his proposal. I'm not a murderer.

263
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,350
I've failed as a wife and a mother.

264
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,022
Yes, you have.

265
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,893
But Deirdre,

266
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:46,862
You can't stay with a man
who doesn't see your gift.

267
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,895
You are a brilliant, brilliant poet.

268
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,433
Augusten, have you
any questions to ask me

269
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,976
Concerning the state of
your parents' marriage?

270
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,670
I do have one question.

271
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,238
What's behind that door?

272
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,008
That?

273
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,109
That leads to an adjacent room

274
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,055
Where I masturbate.

275
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,191
Dr. Finch...

276
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,931
As evolved as I may indeed be,
I'm still a human being, Deirdre.

277
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,336
A male human being.

278
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:33,002
I am still very much a man.

279
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,880
Would you like a tour?

280
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,329
What is this, Hope?

281
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,231
Jesus Christ, Dad! You
scared the shit out of me.

282
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,701
Hope, you've no business being in
here! This is my masturbatorium!

283
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,639
And you're using my blanket.
I was just taking a nap.

284
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,370
Nap? This is not the place for naps!

285
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,178
Go mind the telephone.
Make fresh coffee.

286
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,911
Do your job, like a responsible woman.

287
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,228
He's leaving.

288
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,939
Now I can focus on my writing.

289
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,478
This is nice.

290
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,544
Maybe I'll become a doctor.

291
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,949
It's just down here, on the right.

292
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,452
That's not it.

293
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,623
Is it?

294
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,161
It can't be.

295
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,327
This is it, Augusten.
This is Dr. Finch's house.

296
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,425
No doctor lives here.

297
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,901
Hello, Agnes.

298
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,163
Hello, Deirdre. Come in.

299
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,681
Oh, Freud.

300
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,760
Well, you must be
Augusten, isn't that right?

301
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,825
Yes, well, I'm Agnes.
I'm Dr. Finch's wife.

302
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,929
Well, make yourselves at
home. I'll go get the doctor.

303
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,135
I'll wait in the car.

304
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,112
No, no, you will not wait in the
car. It'll be hours and it's rude.

305
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,582
You just stay here. Get
along with the Finch children.

306
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,879
Up here, Deirdre.

307
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,712
<i>Abigail,</i>

308
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,119
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

309
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,503
Would you like to try some?

310
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,207
No.

311
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,850
Thanks.

312
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,476
Why does everybody make such a fuss?

313
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,953
It's just a little kibble.

314
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,591
That stuff's not clean.

315
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,888
It's for dogs.

316
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,226
Well, I guess you're afraid
to try new things, Augusten.

317
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,264
Sad.

318
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,069
Isn't it a little early for Christmas?

319
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,444
You mean late.

320
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,537
It's been up for two years.

321
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,584
I just pooped.

322
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,684
Oh, way to go, kiddie-Poo.

323
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,621
Hey.

324
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,331
I'm Natalie. The other daughter.

325
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,833
Augusten. I know.

326
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,642
What's with the clothes, choir
boy? Are you going to church?

327
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,541
I just pooped.

328
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,977
John Moses is the kid of
one of my dad's patients.

329
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,079
We watch him sometimes.

330
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,486
Come on, I'm supposed
to keep you occupied.

331
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,599
What is it? It's an
electroshock therapy machine.

332
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,066
My dad used to use it
on patients all the time.

333
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,843
Until the police came.

334
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,574
Come on, it'll be a wicked
blast. Help me move it.

335
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,425
So why is Dr. Finch seeing
patients in his house now?

336
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:08,431
Well, you know how President Carter makes
us drive 40 miles out of our way to buy gas?

337
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,966
Because we're in...

338
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,863
An energy crisis?

339
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,531
Right.

340
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,437
Well, that means people don't have extra
money for luxuries like mental health,

341
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,944
So he's lost a lot of
patients. He's downsizing.

342
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,939
Are you ready?

343
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,242
For what?

344
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,611
Are you retarded?

345
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,747
To play doctor.

346
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:43,891
Okay. Well, I'll be the doctor
and you can be the nurse.

347
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm not gonna be some
cunt-Licking nurse.

348
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll be my father and
you be your mother.

349
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,501
Okay.

350
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,180
How are we feeling today, Deirdre?

351
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,444
I'm blocked, Dr. Finch.

352
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,953
I can't tap into my subconscious.

353
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,349
I feel I do have a classic in me.

354
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,486
I feel I am owed a Pulitzer Prize,

355
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,260
Even though I've only published
one book I paid for myself.

356
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,098
It's very clear to me now.

357
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:29,771
There's only one treatment available
that could resurrect your creative spirit.

358
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:35,452
Electroshock therapy.
We'll start with 1000 volts.

359
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,270
Is this gonna hurt?

360
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,101
Well, maybe if you pass out
you won't have to go to school.

361
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,634
Put in the mouth guard.

362
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,200
What are you guys doing?

363
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:30,006
He's repressing a memory. We need to
go deep into his subconscious mind.

364
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:35,237
Awesome. But can you do it later? Dad
wants to see Augusten in the kitchen.

365
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,493
We have to get you in a
place where you will feel.

366
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,661
Feel warm and you will feel...

367
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,905
Take a seat, son.

368
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,660
Augusten, your mother
is in a state of crisis.

369
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,494
That's an understatement.

370
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,232
Your mother is in
trouble with your father.

371
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,070
Your father may want
to murder your mother.

372
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,907
Murder?

373
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,442
Your father is a very, very sick man.

374
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,186
Your mother needs to be protected.

375
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,192
What do we do?

376
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:06,635
Well, I'm gonna take your mother to
a motel and you're gonna stay here.

377
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,707
But...

378
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,039
I don't wanna stay here.

379
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,758
Deirdre, talk to your son.

380
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,025
When you're finished,
I'll be in the car.

381
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,333
Mom, what's going on?

382
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,936
Your father has a lot of anger

383
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,842
About how his life turned out.

384
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,380
He's projecting it onto me.

385
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,777
Dr. Finch is spiritually evolved.

386
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,678
We'll be safe with him.

387
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,024
Can't I come to the motel too?

388
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,098
I love those little soaps.

389
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,930
No.

390
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,001
The doctor thinks that it's best.

391
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,478
For how long?

392
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:27,517
Not long. A few days, maybe a week.

393
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,114
A week? I can't stay here for a week!

394
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,993
Augusten, don't argue with me. Not now.

395
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,025
I'll visit you in my dreams.

396
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,627
Did you know I can do that?

397
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,739
Once, I had a dream I went to Mexico,

398
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,368
And when I woke up there
were pesos in my hand.

399
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,284
I'm going to go now.

400
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,694
We'll be okay.

401
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,350
Telephone call.

402
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,348
Hello?

403
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,987
<i>I have an emergency collect
call from your son, Augusten.</i>

404
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,764
<i>Dear journal, somebody has to
write down what's happening to me.</i>

405
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,597
<i>It's not to be believed.</i>

406
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,399
<i>So I guess that person is me.</i>

407
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,703
<i>Day seven and still
no sign of my mother.</i>

408
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,643
<i>This place is worse than any
loony bin. I'm not kidding.</i>

409
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,977
<i>Every decision in the house is made
by something the Finches call...</i>

410
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,550
Bible dipping.

411
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,783
It's like asking a Magic 8-Ball a
question, only you're asking God.

412
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,922
Ask God a question, Augusten.

413
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,015
I don't know.

414
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,527
Oh, for goodness' sakes,
Augusten, it's not that hard.

415
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,860
Should we have fish sticks for dinner?

416
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,664
Awakening.

417
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,261
As in, awakening our taste buds.

418
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,139
Super, God wants us to have fish sticks.

419
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,676
Shit, I wanted McDonald's so bad.

420
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,382
<i>Of the daughters, Hope is by far
Finch's favorite. I know this because...</i>

421
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,476
Hope, you are by far
my favorite daughter.

422
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,688
Stop antagonizing me, Natalie. Just stop
transferring all of your anger onto me.

423
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,698
Please make an appointment to see Dad.

424
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,667
You know what? Your avoidance
tactics aren't gonna work, Miss Hope.

425
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,900
You're the one that hates me and
you're gonna have to confront that.

426
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,566
Is this really our dinner?

427
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:43,306
Fish sticks and grapes, that's all you
get. I am not a maid and I'm not a chef.

428
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,276
You know, Natalie, you're so
oral you'll never get to anal.

429
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,082
And you're never gonna get a dick
in your dried-Out cunt, you old maid.

430
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,385
Excellent, Natalie, your
hysteria is spectacular.

431
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,017
You're moving from the
anal onto the phallic.

432
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,420
I'm very proud.

433
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:11,003
<i>Oh, did I mention that Hope is an animal
lover? She has a cat named Freud...</i>

434
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>Freud is dying. ...that speaks to her.</i>

435
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,273
She told me through her
purrs, which I can translate.

436
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,579
Hope, Freud wasn't talking to you,
because fucking cats can't talk.

437
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,318
This is animal abuse.

438
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,153
Augusten, be sexier. Make them want you.

439
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,685
She asked me to do this to her.

440
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,595
She contacted me during REM sleep

441
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,757
And said that she'd hung
on as long as she could.

442
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,204
And she wants me to sit with
her so she doesn't die alone.

443
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,670
What are you all doing in here?

444
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,073
You better not be engaging
in pot or other activities.

445
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,575
Shut up, you hag. Leave us alone.

446
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,612
So how long are you gonna be
carrying around that basket?

447
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,276
Until Freud dies.

448
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,318
Which should be the end of the week.

449
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,523
<i>According to Hope, Freud
died of kitty leukemia.</i>

450
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,693
<i>According to me,</i>

451
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:17,467
<i>Freud died of being trapped in a laundry
basket for four days without food or water.</i>

452
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,975
Augusten, pay your respects.

453
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,643
Am I coming home for good now?

454
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,080
No, baby. Just a weekend visit.

455
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,012
You should let me cut your bangs.

456
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,877
It'd be really cool.

457
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,976
So is that what you
wanna be? A hairdresser?

458
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,351
Well, don't say "hairdresser."

459
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,516
Say professional,
licensed cosmetologist.

460
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:48,092
But what I really want is to
own my own hair empire, you know?

461
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,995
Like Vidal Sassoon.

462
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,430
What?

463
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,038
What do you wanna be?

464
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,640
Her.

465
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,274
Coed, majoring in literature.

466
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,512
You should apply.

467
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,211
They'd never let me in.

468
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,689
Why not? You're smart.

469
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,885
But I'm a Finch.

470
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,288
I'm used goods.

471
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,830
Besides, can you imagine
the college background check?

472
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,969
<i>When they find out what goes on in
that house, it'd be like Frankenstein,</i>

473
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:37,776
When the villagers surround the castle
and then burn it to the fucking ground.

474
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,386
I'm gay.

475
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,788
Big deal.

476
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,294
I know.

477
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,633
My adopted brother Neil's gay too.

478
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,736
Where does he live?

479
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,500
He used to live out back in the barn.

480
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,474
Then he got mad at my Dad because he
wouldn't give him a real room in the house,

481
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,943
So he moved to some boarding house.

482
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:12,777
<i>He rents a single room out
there. Kinda like a pied-À-Terre.</i>

483
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,614
You two should meet. I think
you'd really like each other.

484
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,118
Two, please.

485
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,517
Thanks.

486
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,074
That director is fucked up.

487
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,774
I've seen that like four
times this week already.

488
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,646
I love French movies.

489
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,888
First cousins fall in love and then stab
each other as the weeping clown appears.

490
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,757
I don't really understand
the weeping clown part but...

491
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,123
It represents the loss of innocence.

492
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,030
Wanna check out my wheels?

493
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,135
Sure. Come on.

494
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,377
So do you see your mom at all?

495
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,341
Sometimes.

496
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,972
On the weekends.

497
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,177
It's tough to have a sick mom, right?

498
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,550
My mom couldn't handle me
either. Neither could my dad.

499
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,716
Yeah, mine too. He
never wants to see me.

500
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,155
Where does that leave you?

501
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,527
At the crazy house of
the even crazier Finch.

502
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,293
Do you think he's crazy?

503
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,699
In a good way. I think he's a genius.

504
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,829
Like when I was your age
and I'd have a rage seizure,

505
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,841
He'd put on music to
lower my blood pressure.

506
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:50,744
<i>Nat King Cole, Stardust,
revolutionary sort of stuff, you know?</i>

507
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,675
Worked every time.

508
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:57,477
If he hadn't adopted me, shit, I
don't know what I would've done.

509
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,447
Well, here she is.

510
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,594
But couldn't you have
just been his patient?

511
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,960
I mean, I don't understand
why he had to adopt you.

512
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,362
Well, Finch believes that a
person becomes an adult at 13.

513
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,397
At that age, no adult
can tell them what to do.

514
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,901
And they can choose their
own parents. I did it.

515
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,902
Natalie did it.

516
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,275
Natalie?

517
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,676
Natalie never mentioned that to me.

518
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,150
Oh, really?

519
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,019
Ask her about Terrence Maxwell.

520
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,659
You're over 13, right?

521
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,161
Finchy saved my life, that's for sure.

522
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,803
He was the first
person I told I was gay.

523
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,241
I'm gay too.

524
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:05,087
Holy Mary, Mother of God, so that's
what this is about. You're gay?

525
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,015
Yeah.

526
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,289
I thought Natalie had told you.

527
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,861
Small world, right?

528
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,596
You, me.

529
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,262
Crazy.

530
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,565
Smoke?

531
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,408
Here, let me light you.

532
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,217
Want a ride home?

533
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,922
Please.

534
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,124
I won't go fast.

535
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,457
Maybe.

536
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,809
What just happened?

537
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,946
You think you're gay, right?

538
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,985
That's what gay men do.

539
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,351
Just wanted you to
know what you're in for.

540
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,788
Want a beer? Smoke?

541
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,422
No.

542
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,999
<i>Journal, what can I
say? He drove a cool car.</i>

543
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,203
<i>And it sure beat another crazy
dinner at the Finch house.</i>

544
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,943
<i>There's a first time
for everything, right?</i>

545
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,850
I took those. In New York.

546
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,764
They're not very good.

547
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,128
I'm not very good at anything.

548
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,863
<i>I'm not very good at anything.</i>

549
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:07,604
<i>I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything.</i>

550
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,573
Shut up.

551
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,407
What?

552
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,449
Nothing.

553
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,099
<i>One positive thing has come out of this.</i>

554
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,076
<i>Nobody can ever say again that
I'm afraid of trying new things.</i>

555
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,479
Come on, get dressed. I have
to drive you back to Finch's.

556
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,454
I wanna go to my mom's.

557
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,869
You okay with what happened?

558
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,715
Yeah, sure.

559
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,531
Well...

560
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,234
Thanks for everything.

561
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,643
Thank you.

562
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,838
Thank you for everything.

563
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,719
Oh, Fern. Fern. Fern...

564
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,658
No, Fern, it's okay.

565
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,027
No, no, no, it's okay.

566
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,803
Augusten. Augusten.

567
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,247
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

568
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,285
Oh, God. God.

569
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,572
I wish you enjoyed school more.

570
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:29,736
Although I guess it must be very
dull compared to your life with me.

571
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,315
Would you hand me my
cover-Up? I'm chilly.

572
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,449
Watch it, Augusten!

573
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,658
I've got a lit cigarette in my hand.

574
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,126
Don't act out in anger.

575
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,832
If you're upset by this,
talk to me about it.

576
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,598
How could I not have known?

577
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,242
How long has this been happening?

578
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,379
I've been in love with
Fern for a very long time.

579
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,883
Our relationship became
physical a number of weeks ago.

580
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,393
The intimate details
are between me and Fern.

581
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:24,430
<i>Journal, I'm confused. How
can my mother be with Fern?</i>

582
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,970
<i>Fern drives a Chevy Nova.</i>

583
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,439
I worry about you so.

584
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,105
I worry about you in school.

585
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,874
The law says you have
to go. Well, fuck that!

586
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,646
Augusten, please don't
smoke my cigarettes.

587
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,212
You have a pack of your own.

588
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,952
Although I wish you
wouldn't smoke. Well, I do.

589
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,977
All my life I've been
oppressed, Augusten.

590
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,820
And all my life I've worked
hard to fight that oppression.

591
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,724
When I was a little girl
living in Cairo, Georgia,

592
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,357
I had a black nanny named Elsa who lived
in a shack on the other side of town.

593
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,959
And in those days black
people were called niggers.

594
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,233
And I knew that word
"nigger" was a dirty word.

595
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,934
And I knew it was a word
filled with hatred and anger.

596
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,240
I knew Elsa was no nigger.
I knew it was wrong.

597
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,944
It's taken me all my life
to claim myself as an artist

598
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,110
And to claim myself as a woman.

599
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,313
I have struggled against
the oppression of my mother

600
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,684
And the oppression of your father,

601
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,250
And for the first time in my life I
feel I am truly able to claim myself.

602
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:07,027
And so, Augusten, I hope I have your
support in my relationship with Fern

603
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,096
Because at this stage in my life I do not
need and I will not accept more oppression.

604
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,936
I have spent my entire
life fighting oppression.

605
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,534
I hope I don't have to fight you too.

606
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,543
Can I have $5?

607
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,242
May I have $5?

608
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:24,813
Why?

609
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,183
So I can skip school
tomorrow and go to the movies.

610
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,524
Go get my pocketbook. I'll take a look.

611
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,457
Do you like my new house?

612
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,233
I need high ceilings.

613
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:52,874
So, you've been spending a lot
of time at the Finches' house.

614
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,982
Are there other options
I'm not aware of?

615
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,896
What is this?

616
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,802
Adoption papers.

617
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,638
Dr. Finch has agreed to
become your legal guardian.

618
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,839
What?

619
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,845
After discussing this with the doctor, we
both feel this really is the best option.

620
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,392
He and his family can give
you the attention you need.

621
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,620
You're giving me away to your shrink?

622
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,261
No.

623
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,736
I'm doing what's best for
you. What's best for us.

624
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,601
I love you very, very much.

625
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:58,380
I will always be your parent.
And you will always be my child.

626
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,963
And my fucking father won't
even give me money for food.

627
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,670
He won't take my calls.

628
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,642
Yeah. He's basically worthless.

629
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,239
Just like my mom.

630
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,978
Just like the fucking nuns who beat me.

631
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,045
God.

632
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:44,589
Sometimes I feel like just taking a
butcher knife and just stabbing them both.

633
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,124
I understand.

634
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,828
You're the only one who does.

635
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,670
How close are you to Bookman, Augusten?

636
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,508
It started out as just friends,
and now it's more than that.

637
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,845
This is a sexual relationship?

638
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,415
Bookman isn't a stable man.

639
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,250
His problems run very, very deep.

640
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,784
He seems okay.

641
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,423
Well, I'm not saying you can't see him.

642
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,825
After all, as you say,
you are already involved.

643
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,956
But I just want you to keep
me abreast of the situation.

644
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,534
Fine.

645
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:29,162
Now, would you like some of these?

646
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,698
What are they?

647
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,370
Well, I just got some samples
in the mail, so I don't know.

648
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,969
So let me see.

649
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:48,686
This is mild anti-Anxiety medication

650
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,658
Which might help you
feel a little calmer...

651
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,329
I'm calm.

652
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,454
...when I tell you

653
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,556
You have to go to school.

654
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,932
I go to school. I'm on to
your clever tricks, son.

655
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,975
I know you stay until homeroom, when
they do attendance, and then you skip out.

656
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,909
I know when you've been naughty.

657
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,540
What are you, Santa Claus?

658
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:24,625
If by that you're asking am I the
great patriarch, the father-Giver,

659
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,287
Who fulfills wishes
and challenges dreams

660
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,265
And brings merriment to
those who are suffering,

661
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:35,701
Well, then yes, Augusten,
I am Santa Claus.

662
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,972
I'm not going!

663
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,305
You're in junior high, for
Christ's sake. It can't be that bad.

664
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,240
I don't fit in.

665
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:56,219
Where would we be without
our painful childhoods?

666
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,694
Well, the only loophole, or way I
can see of getting you out of school

667
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,827
For any considerable length of time,
would be for you to commit suicide.

668
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,700
You want me to kill myself?
Well, if you try to kill yourself,

669
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:18,508
I could explain to the school board that
you are psychologically unfit to attend,

670
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,981
And that you needed intensive treatment.

671
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,612
It would be a staged suicide attempt.

672
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,884
Of course, your poor mother would have
to find you and drive you to the hospital,

673
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:31,552
Where you would stay for three
weeks, or a month, for observation.

674
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,659
I don't know, it doesn't... I don't...

675
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,594
Augusten.

676
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,996
Where is your spirit of adventure?

677
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,636
Augusten, stay with us!

678
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,679
You're in a hospital. We gotta get
these pills out of your stomach.

679
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,940
Oh, God, Augusten, wake up!

680
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,642
Don't you die on me! Wake up! Augusten!

681
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,719
Wake up! Wake up!

682
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,785
Please, stop! Please!

683
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,162
No, please!

684
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,423
I can't breathe.

685
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,861
<i>No, get away from me! Get away!</i>

686
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:52,476
The lady at the store
said it has illustrations

687
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:56,514
Of all the procedures that
cosmetology students have to master

688
01:01:56,615 --> 01:01:58,845
Before they earn their license.

689
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:10,117
Cold waves. Those are really hard.

690
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:13,896
Well, now you can learn how to do them.

691
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,030
It's good to have a dream, Augusten.

692
01:02:21,774 --> 01:02:24,106
Dreams get you through the hard times.

693
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:34,210
What's your dream?

694
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:35,914
Me?

695
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:42,125
I was never fancy enough
to have one of those.

696
01:02:43,496 --> 01:02:45,623
I was always too busy.

697
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:46,959
Working.

698
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:50,094
Well, so the doctor
could go to school and...

699
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:52,028
No.

700
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,774
Then the kids came and...

701
01:02:58,611 --> 01:03:01,637
Raising a family keeps
you on the run and...

702
01:03:07,553 --> 01:03:09,418
Maybe that was your dream.

703
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:12,388
To have a family.

704
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,754
Yes.

705
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:20,694
That was a dream.

706
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,440
It's a good one to have.

707
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,751
<i>Hello?</i>

708
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:46,322
Fern, it's me.

709
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:50,358
Why can't we do it?

710
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:52,160
Get out.

711
01:03:55,401 --> 01:03:57,232
I miss you.

712
01:03:57,336 --> 01:03:59,566
I miss the smell of you.

713
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:01,772
<i>Who is it?</i>

714
01:04:01,874 --> 01:04:04,934
<i>I'm not interested in
what you're selling.</i>

715
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:07,171
<i>Please don't call here again.</i>

716
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:24,328
Shit!

717
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,660
Shit! It's all shit!

718
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:22,683
I'm digging this new look.
I think you look much better.

719
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,839
Oh, my fucking hair! Oh, my God!

720
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:55,446
That was funny.

721
01:05:56,689 --> 01:05:58,281
You should be laughing.

722
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:08,393
You know what, Augusten?

723
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,730
I'm not gonna throw you a pity party.

724
01:06:11,904 --> 01:06:13,496
So fucking just get over yourself.

725
01:06:13,605 --> 01:06:16,506
Fuck you, Natalie. You don't know
what it's like to be sent away.

726
01:06:16,608 --> 01:06:17,575
You're right, I don't.

727
01:06:17,676 --> 01:06:20,236
And you don't know what it's like to
have a boyfriend that's just using you!

728
01:06:20,346 --> 01:06:21,540
Lucky me.

729
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:25,010
Who's Terrence Maxwell, Natalie?

730
01:06:29,688 --> 01:06:31,349
I've never heard of him.

731
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:35,558
Tell me who he is.

732
01:06:36,528 --> 01:06:38,519
Tell me who he is. Shut up.

733
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,757
It kills you, doesn't it? Shut up.

734
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,490
Let it out! Shut up.

735
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:44,228
Tell me who he is, Natalie! Shut up.

736
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:46,236
Tell me so I don't feel so alone!

737
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:49,865
He was the only one I ever loved
and he doesn't want me anymore!

738
01:06:49,975 --> 01:06:51,704
Do you feel better?

739
01:07:02,454 --> 01:07:03,887
A little bit.

740
01:07:06,091 --> 01:07:07,490
How'd you meet him?

741
01:07:10,396 --> 01:07:13,695
Terrence started seeing
my dad after his mom died.

742
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:18,663
She left him everything.

743
01:07:26,845 --> 01:07:29,143
He was 41 when I was 13.

744
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:35,213
He told me I was pretty.

745
01:07:38,257 --> 01:07:40,248
And he made me believe it.

746
01:07:43,362 --> 01:07:45,296
One day he broke my collar bone

747
01:07:47,299 --> 01:07:51,463
And I had to hitchhike
to the emergency room,

748
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,006
And I passed out on the side of
the road and somebody found me.

749
01:07:57,743 --> 01:08:02,339
My dad told him that he would press
charges and that he would go to jail,

750
01:08:02,448 --> 01:08:05,645
Unless he donated money
to my college fund.

751
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:08,616
And he did.

752
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:12,613
$75,000.

753
01:08:14,626 --> 01:08:16,218
That's so great.

754
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:19,994
So, if you just
apply... My dad spent it.

755
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:23,724
Every penny.

756
01:08:25,504 --> 01:08:28,302
So that the IRS
wouldn't take this house.

757
01:08:37,483 --> 01:08:41,214
So I do know what it's like, Augusten,

758
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:47,224
To love somebody who doesn't deserve it.

759
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:52,924
Because they're all you have.

760
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:01,302
God, I hate my life.

761
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:07,674
I hate this kitchen.

762
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:18,855
I need high ceilings.

763
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:24,317
Me too.

764
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:29,027
Let's get rid of it, then.

765
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,464
Let's take down the ceiling.

766
01:09:55,794 --> 01:09:58,194
Deirdre, I need to talk to you.

767
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,013
I'm a fuckup and it's your fault!

768
01:10:18,116 --> 01:10:20,914
That's right, Neil, blame your
father for your inability to focus.

769
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:23,283
Direct all that rage at me
if it makes you feel better.

770
01:10:23,388 --> 01:10:26,380
I can't focus because of the voices!

771
01:10:26,692 --> 01:10:28,489
I see you for what you are.

772
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:32,293
Yeah? Camera never lies, see?

773
01:10:36,368 --> 01:10:40,634
My parents have given you thousands
of dollars and I'm still sick!

774
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:43,740
You haven't helped me get
better! You know what I do!

775
01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:45,833
And you haven't helped me get better!

776
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:52,645
Deirdre?

777
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:55,116
Did you hear me?

778
01:10:57,389 --> 01:10:59,118
Hello, Agnes.

779
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:01,453
Why am I here?

780
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:06,826
Well, you have an
appointment. Your regular 2:00.

781
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:10,893
Yes. Why are you here?

782
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:17,301
Because I want you to
stop seeing my husband.

783
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:29,046
You're right, Neil, you're right.
I've done nothing, apparently.

784
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,553
I've never pulled any strings,

785
01:11:30,656 --> 01:11:32,954
Gotten you a scholarship to
the University of Rochester

786
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:36,687
To pursue your photographic
interests. Absolutely nothing.

787
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:42,729
You just wanted to get rid of me.

788
01:11:43,101 --> 01:11:47,094
I don't wanna get rid of Augusten.
He's part of the family now.

789
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:52,743
It's just you. I just need you to go.

790
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:57,410
But then I'd miss my
therapy. I need Dr. Finch.

791
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:59,211
No, I need Dr. Finch!

792
01:12:00,218 --> 01:12:03,847
I'm not as pretty as you
and I don't have your talent.

793
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:08,990
All I have is this family. And this
family doesn't work without him.

794
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:12,358
Why won't you let me live in the
house and be a part of this family?

795
01:12:12,464 --> 01:12:16,491
Because I am the patriarch, and when the
patriarch says jump, you jump, God damn it!

796
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:20,093
You don't cooperate, Neil,
and for that you're punished.

797
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,906
That's not why you won't
let me live in this house.

798
01:12:32,017 --> 01:12:34,178
You won't let me 'cause you're
afraid of me, aren't you?

799
01:12:34,286 --> 01:12:37,278
Of what I could do to you in the middle
of the night while you're sleeping?

800
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:39,949
You're afraid of my
anger, aren't you, Doctor?

801
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:44,156
Our time is up, Neil.

802
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:48,925
I believe we've made
a breakthrough today.

803
01:13:01,313 --> 01:13:02,541
Really?

804
01:13:14,025 --> 01:13:16,858
I am to see the doctor now.

805
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:31,168
Hello, Neil.

806
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,341
Hello, Mrs. Burroughs,
you look wonderful.

807
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:36,744
Oh, thank you. How's my son?

808
01:13:36,848 --> 01:13:38,406
He's just great.

809
01:13:38,517 --> 01:13:41,384
Will you be kind to him? I will.

810
01:13:49,928 --> 01:13:52,829
That's why I'm blocked,
Dr. Finch, I'm sure of it.

811
01:13:53,465 --> 01:13:55,956
You're not blocked
because of Fern, Deirdre.

812
01:13:56,535 --> 01:14:00,471
You're constipated creatively because
of the rage you are not expressing.

813
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:07,075
Scream, Deirdre,
scream. Express the pain.

814
01:14:38,743 --> 01:14:41,610
Fern has ceased to be a
suitable companion, Deirdre.

815
01:14:41,947 --> 01:14:46,179
You need someone who worships
you, who will feed your talent.

816
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:49,049
I have just the candidate.

817
01:14:51,923 --> 01:14:57,020
Deirdre, I'd like to introduce
you to Dorothy Ambrose, my 3:00.

818
01:14:57,128 --> 01:15:00,256
Dorothy is creative like you. She
paints her fingernails to match her mood.

819
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,424
What color are we today, Dorothy?

820
01:15:02,634 --> 01:15:05,432
Shell pink. I've had a nice day.

821
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:06,561
Dorothy has a trust fund.

822
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:10,732
It was established by her father after
he showed her his penis in a rowboat.

823
01:15:14,913 --> 01:15:17,347
I've always wanted a daughter.

824
01:15:33,865 --> 01:15:35,992
The ceiling was crushing us.

825
01:15:39,838 --> 01:15:41,669
So we made a skylight.

826
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,472
I think it brings a much-Needed
sense of humor to the kitchen.

827
01:15:56,755 --> 01:15:59,747
Vienna sausage. I've
been looking for these.

828
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,291
I'll get it.

829
01:16:05,163 --> 01:16:06,926
Don't touch my sausage.

830
01:16:12,337 --> 01:16:13,964
Dr. Finch? Yes.

831
01:16:14,506 --> 01:16:16,565
Michael Shephard, IRS.

832
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:33,787
Where will I treat
the people who need me?

833
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:36,560
How will I provide for my family?

834
01:16:36,661 --> 01:16:38,891
You got an extension, Dad.

835
01:16:39,197 --> 01:16:43,099
Six weeks. After six
weeks they take the house.

836
01:16:44,202 --> 01:16:46,932
We'll pray. God will help us.

837
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,570
And when God turns a deaf ear
we can all just live in the car,

838
01:16:50,675 --> 01:16:52,734
Because at least that's paid for.

839
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:03,954
You are a terrible daughter.

840
01:17:05,824 --> 01:17:08,122
Well, fuck you, kiss-Ass.

841
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:12,556
Just remember,

842
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:14,990
Daddy's like a great ocean liner.

843
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,825
If he goes down, he's taking
a lot of people with him.

844
01:17:36,821 --> 01:17:37,845
Stop.

845
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,115
Damn it, Bookman! What?

846
01:17:42,594 --> 01:17:44,152
Something's not right.

847
01:17:44,929 --> 01:17:47,159
It's your hair. It lacks proper body.

848
01:17:47,465 --> 01:17:49,524
That's because you've been
pulling at it for two hours.

849
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:52,899
Well, I wouldn't have to pull at it
if it wasn't so naturally hideous.

850
01:17:53,004 --> 01:17:55,495
I'm not complaining. I love it.

851
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,839
I love everything you touch.

852
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:02,375
Maybe you could work on my mustache.

853
01:18:06,217 --> 01:18:09,744
No, this is useless. Natalie,
come here, let me try on you.

854
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:17,057
No, no. Fuck that. Forget it. I
am through being your guinea pig.

855
01:18:17,162 --> 01:18:18,493
Look, my hair's coming out in fistfuls.

856
01:18:18,596 --> 01:18:20,325
Stop scratching at it.

857
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:24,362
You look like you have Down syndrome.

858
01:18:32,477 --> 01:18:33,739
Hope.

859
01:18:44,222 --> 01:18:47,350
Well, look, one of you is
gonna have to help me, okay?

860
01:18:47,459 --> 01:18:50,792
I don't get into beauty school
unless I master the cold wave.

861
01:18:51,896 --> 01:18:53,989
Guess you're stuck with me, jocko.

862
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:02,801
Being in love is fantastic,
Hope. You should try it.

863
01:19:03,308 --> 01:19:05,208
I'd hardly call you an expert.

864
01:19:09,414 --> 01:19:13,214
Are you saying my relationship
with Augusten isn't real love?

865
01:19:13,318 --> 01:19:16,481
I'm saying your
relationship with Augusten

866
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:18,920
Is not mature love, no.

867
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:20,281
Bullshit!

868
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:24,718
Neil, if you're not man
enough to handle the truth,

869
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:27,229
Then maybe you should
not be with a child.

870
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:29,095
I'm not a child, Hope.

871
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:35,230
You're right, Augusten, you're
not. I'm sorry, you're very mature.

872
01:19:36,274 --> 01:19:40,938
It's just that I was speaking of the love
you have when you're older. Mature love.

873
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:44,208
And what do you, Miss Iceberg,
know about mature love?

874
01:19:44,315 --> 01:19:48,081
When was the last time you had
anything in your twat besides a tampon?

875
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,219
That is the fucking truth.

876
01:19:53,925 --> 01:19:56,018
All right, Bookman, that's enough!

877
01:19:57,996 --> 01:20:02,126
I'm certainly not gonna listen to you
when you're talking like a teenage boy!

878
01:20:09,507 --> 01:20:11,236
What's in this? I'm starving.

879
01:20:11,342 --> 01:20:14,505
Oh, this and that. My secret ingredient.

880
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,638
Would you like to try?

881
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:30,258
What's the secret ingredient?

882
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:32,722
Freud.

883
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:43,701
Freud's dead, Hope. You buried her.

884
01:20:44,309 --> 01:20:48,143
I heard her calling me.
She wanted me to dig her up.

885
01:20:48,446 --> 01:20:51,381
She asked to be reincarnated as a stew.

886
01:20:53,218 --> 01:20:54,310
Oh, my God.

887
01:20:56,087 --> 01:20:57,884
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

888
01:20:57,989 --> 01:21:01,220
You fucking lunatic!
I knew you were insane!

889
01:21:05,897 --> 01:21:08,092
I don't eat pussy. Psycho.

890
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:10,363
Come on, Augusten, let's go.

891
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,329
I want my beads back, Hope.

892
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:19,740
I was just kidding, you jerks!

893
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:32,719
Got some of my anger out.

894
01:21:37,028 --> 01:21:39,656
Today, we are going to
explore sense memory.

895
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:42,198
I'd like everybody to
take their blade of grass

896
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,269
And stroke their cheeks
with their eyes closed.

897
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,305
Other senses are heightened
when the eyes are closed.

898
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:58,609
It's very soothing, isn't it?

899
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:02,041
All right.

900
01:22:02,153 --> 01:22:05,919
Neil, I believe you have a
poem you'd like to read today.

901
01:22:06,257 --> 01:22:07,281
Yes.

902
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:13,530
Deirdre, I'm not sure I feel
comfortable with a man in our safe space.

903
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:16,193
I guess, emotionally.

904
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:19,827
I just need time to process this.

905
01:22:19,938 --> 01:22:22,930
Joan, Neil is a beautiful
and sensitive poet.

906
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:24,941
He's part of my family

907
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:28,672
And we are going to welcome him
today with open arms and open ears.

908
01:22:30,715 --> 01:22:32,239
Okay, fine.

909
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,147
But he's a man.

910
01:22:34,252 --> 01:22:37,517
Joan, what you need to focus on is
not the presence of a man in this room,

911
01:22:37,622 --> 01:22:40,614
But the lack of your mother's
presence in your poetry.

912
01:22:46,331 --> 01:22:47,320
Neil.

913
01:22:58,643 --> 01:23:00,133
The Angry Nun.

914
01:23:01,379 --> 01:23:02,778
By Neil Bookman.

915
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:06,806
Bitch!

916
01:23:06,918 --> 01:23:08,249
Whore of Jesus

917
01:23:08,353 --> 01:23:12,653
Dressed in black, you do not bleed like
a woman should bleed between the legs!

918
01:23:12,957 --> 01:23:18,486
But with your ruler, your crucifix
of hatred, you strike my tender flesh!

919
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:20,826
I bleed for you!

920
01:23:23,134 --> 01:23:24,601
Oh, Mother.

921
01:23:28,339 --> 01:23:30,364
And then I ran out of ink.

922
01:23:32,076 --> 01:23:35,568
Good anger. It ended
exactly at the right moment.

923
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:42,285
Augusten, would you
make me some iced tea?

924
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:47,555
My new medicine makes my throat so dry.

925
01:23:47,658 --> 01:23:49,455
Baby, I'll get it. I got it.

926
01:23:49,761 --> 01:23:53,925
All right, all right, Neil. Let's break
it down. Let's break it down for Neil.

927
01:23:56,167 --> 01:24:00,035
Look, I always get my mom something
to drink when she works. Okay?

928
01:24:00,138 --> 01:24:03,403
That's our thing. Your
mother is my thing now.

929
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,237
Are we having a stare-Down contest?

930
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:10,239
Yeah.

931
01:24:11,482 --> 01:24:13,916
What do you want? What
do you want? Money?

932
01:24:14,085 --> 01:24:17,885
Here's 50 bucks. Go
chase the ice-Cream truck.

933
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:19,979
Leave!

934
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:27,361
You think this whole
thing is funny, don't you?

935
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:30,559
You look at my mom's craziness
as something to entertain you!

936
01:24:30,668 --> 01:24:33,159
You are so mundane.
Your mother is an artist.

937
01:24:33,271 --> 01:24:38,038
If you want Hamburger Helper, cupcake,
you need to find yourself another mother.

938
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:45,381
Everyone! Come quickly!

939
01:24:46,918 --> 01:24:49,284
Wake up! Wake up!

940
01:24:49,387 --> 01:24:50,786
A miracle!

941
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:56,987
A miracle! A miracle has occurred!

942
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,131
What are you looking at?

943
01:25:07,939 --> 01:25:08,963
Dad's morning shit.

944
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:12,668
See? See how the tip of the coil is
breaking out of the surface of the water?

945
01:25:12,777 --> 01:25:13,801
Holy Father.

946
01:25:13,911 --> 01:25:15,378
Doctor.

947
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,744
Let me draw you a nice bath.

948
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:19,913
Agnes.

949
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:24,185
Go get a shoehorn. A shoehorn, Agnes.

950
01:25:27,959 --> 01:25:29,722
But what does it mean, Dad?

951
01:25:29,827 --> 01:25:32,523
It means our financial
situation is turning round.

952
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:35,190
It means things are
looking upward, literally.

953
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:39,065
The shit is pointing out of
the pot, towards heaven, to God.

954
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:43,768
My turd is a direct communication
from the Holy Father.

955
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:50,445
No, no, no, no, children.
No. Laugh. Laugh.

956
01:25:50,948 --> 01:25:54,247
God is. He is the funniest
man in the universe.

957
01:25:58,556 --> 01:26:03,619
Agnes, I want you to carefully remove this,
take it outside and let it dry in the sun.

958
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:10,025
We're starting a
shrine, Agnes, a shrine.

959
01:26:10,134 --> 01:26:12,034
Hope, let's prepare.

960
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:26,613
Now I'll never get into Vassar.

961
01:26:51,943 --> 01:26:53,069
Agnes?

962
01:26:56,714 --> 01:27:00,650
Somebody's gotta stay on
top of things in this house.

963
01:27:00,751 --> 01:27:04,414
I am just trying to
hold it all together.

964
01:27:08,326 --> 01:27:10,123
I need to ask you something.

965
01:27:12,463 --> 01:27:15,489
He's fine. The doctor will be fine.

966
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,433
He's just overextended.

967
01:27:18,536 --> 01:27:22,404
That's not what I wanted to ask
you. What do you want, Augusten?

968
01:27:26,744 --> 01:27:29,474
I want you to make me Hamburger Helper.

969
01:27:44,528 --> 01:27:48,055
<i>So there it was at
last, the awful truth.</i>

970
01:27:50,368 --> 01:27:51,699
Thank you.

971
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:58,872
<i>Unlike my mom, I guess I had
finally tapped into my subconscious.</i>

972
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:21,331
<i>Journal, I feel doomed. I should
be getting ready for college.</i>

973
01:28:21,432 --> 01:28:23,992
<i>Instead, I'm in my mother's
psychiatrist's house</i>

974
01:28:24,101 --> 01:28:26,592
<i>Lying on a used twin bed
with pee stains on it.</i>

975
01:28:26,704 --> 01:28:31,368
<i>How did my life take such a dismal
turn? What did I do wrong along the way?</i>

976
01:28:40,017 --> 01:28:41,507
<i>I turned 15 today.</i>

977
01:28:42,453 --> 01:28:47,083
<i>My parents used to make such a big deal out
of my birthdays, out of all the holidays.</i>

978
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:51,821
<i>I want it to be like it used to be, when I
had a family that tried to love each other.</i>

979
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:54,489
<i>Where nobody thought that God
was talking through their shit.</i>

980
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:00,870
<i>I want a curfew.</i>

981
01:29:00,971 --> 01:29:04,805
<i>I want to be grounded for sleeping
with a 35-Year-Old schizophrenic.</i>

982
01:29:06,544 --> 01:29:09,513
<i>I want rules and boundaries,</i>

983
01:29:10,448 --> 01:29:14,441
<i>Because what I've learned
is that without them</i>

984
01:29:15,353 --> 01:29:18,652
<i>All life is, is a series of surprises.</i>

985
01:29:26,797 --> 01:29:28,128
Surprise!

986
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:30,657
We gotcha!

987
01:29:34,138 --> 01:29:35,662
Surprise.

988
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:43,943
We gotcha! And you didn't
see it coming. No, you didn't.

989
01:29:44,048 --> 01:29:45,345
Smile.

990
01:30:00,598 --> 01:30:02,190
Augusten, what's wrong?

991
01:30:03,701 --> 01:30:05,965
He's just overcome, that's all.

992
01:30:07,405 --> 01:30:09,066
I'll go get the matches.

993
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:22,812
This is good.

994
01:30:31,429 --> 01:30:32,760
Deirdre?

995
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,034
Deirdre, come along now.

996
01:30:39,403 --> 01:30:41,871
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital!

997
01:30:42,373 --> 01:30:45,103
Now, Deirdre, it's just for observation.

998
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:47,302
This is bullshit! Dorothy!

999
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:50,979
I will not be observed!

1000
01:30:51,549 --> 01:30:56,316
Deirdre, I have arranged a very,
very nice retreat for you in Vermont.

1001
01:30:56,954 --> 01:31:00,355
But if you don't open the door,
we will have to get the police.

1002
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:02,926
No, don't you call the police!
Why you gotta go to call the pigs?

1003
01:31:03,027 --> 01:31:07,521
Oh, please! Oh, that's right, you think
anyone that's not a lesbian is a pig!

1004
01:31:07,631 --> 01:31:09,531
You're all pigs! Oh, you
fucking selfish bitch!

1005
01:31:09,633 --> 01:31:12,500
Filthy, stinking pigs!
You just wanna hurt her!

1006
01:31:13,437 --> 01:31:15,166
Will you stop? Please!

1007
01:31:15,272 --> 01:31:16,569
You stop! You stop!

1008
01:31:16,674 --> 01:31:18,574
Oh, please, why don't you go out
and write your fucking poetry?

1009
01:31:18,676 --> 01:31:20,337
You don't need a mother!
You need an exorcist!

1010
01:31:20,444 --> 01:31:23,743
Oh, you need a fucking bone up
your ass, that's what you need!

1011
01:31:23,848 --> 01:31:26,078
And you'd like that, you'd like that!

1012
01:33:00,811 --> 01:33:01,778
Now.

1013
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:05,571
No, no. Shit, shit.

1014
01:33:05,683 --> 01:33:06,978
We love you.

1015
01:33:08,419 --> 01:33:11,286
No! No!

1016
01:33:11,622 --> 01:33:14,022
No, let me go!

1017
01:33:14,124 --> 01:33:15,386
Please let me go!

1018
01:33:15,492 --> 01:33:17,960
Let me go!

1019
01:33:49,526 --> 01:33:50,857
<i>Thank you.</i>

1020
01:33:52,997 --> 01:33:54,487
<i>Thank you.</i>

1021
01:33:54,598 --> 01:33:56,463
<i>Oh, this is too much.</i>

1022
01:33:57,635 --> 01:33:59,569
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1023
01:34:07,177 --> 01:34:08,439
<i>Grief.</i>

1024
01:34:10,214 --> 01:34:12,079
<i>The angels are gone.</i>

1025
01:34:13,317 --> 01:34:15,410
<i>For weeks I searched for them</i>

1026
01:34:15,519 --> 01:34:18,818
<i>And took the precise
measurements of each room,</i>

1027
01:34:18,922 --> 01:34:21,618
<i>As if the house had
grown smaller in my grief.</i>

1028
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,426
Not good enough. Boring. Repetitive.

1029
01:34:25,529 --> 01:34:27,588
<i>Journal, good news.</i>

1030
01:34:27,698 --> 01:34:31,657
<i>After only a week of observation, my
mother has been released from the loony bin.</i>

1031
01:34:31,769 --> 01:34:33,498
<i>Dr. Finch assures me she's doing well,</i>

1032
01:34:33,604 --> 01:34:38,007
<i>And is writing a masterpiece that will
finally get her on The Merv Griffin Show.</i>

1033
01:34:44,014 --> 01:34:45,481
<i>I wish I had that kind of discipline.</i>

1034
01:34:45,582 --> 01:34:49,279
Watch out. That's how he gets
you to fall in love with him.

1035
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:56,656
<i>Our first date was at
the movies. My Fair Lady.</i>

1036
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:01,594
I was so nervous my palms were sweaty.

1037
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,998
But Norman's hands were so dry.

1038
01:35:05,903 --> 01:35:08,269
I found out later it was from psoriasis.

1039
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,073
He reached for my hand in
the dark and that was it.

1040
01:35:15,612 --> 01:35:16,840
Hello, Norman.

1041
01:35:18,348 --> 01:35:20,373
Hello, Deirdre. You look well.

1042
01:35:23,487 --> 01:35:26,581
I'm sorry, Suzanne, this
is my ex-Wife, Deirdre.

1043
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:29,158
And, Deirdre, this is
my fiancée, Suzanne.

1044
01:35:31,962 --> 01:35:32,929
Hello.

1045
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:36,329
It's nice to meet you. I've
heard so much about you.

1046
01:35:38,135 --> 01:35:40,103
I've heard nothing about you.

1047
01:35:40,938 --> 01:35:42,530
I open up my mailbox every day,

1048
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,130
Hoping to get a child support
check from this deadbeat,

1049
01:35:45,242 --> 01:35:48,439
But all I get is my own
voice echoing back at me.

1050
01:35:51,148 --> 01:35:52,775
You drank our family's money away.

1051
01:35:52,883 --> 01:35:56,614
I don't drink anymore, Deirdre. I
haven't had a drink in three years.

1052
01:35:58,222 --> 01:36:00,452
Excuse me, could you get him a medal?

1053
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:02,222
I want my money!

1054
01:36:02,392 --> 01:36:05,452
I sent your money to
that goddamn Svengali,

1055
01:36:05,562 --> 01:36:10,056
And his lawyer sent me a paper signed
by you giving him power of attorney.

1056
01:36:12,035 --> 01:36:14,265
No. I didn't approve that.

1057
01:36:16,173 --> 01:36:18,368
Dr. Finch wouldn't do that.

1058
01:36:20,377 --> 01:36:21,639
Did I tell you?

1059
01:36:21,879 --> 01:36:24,973
What? Did you tell her what? What
did he tell you about me, Suzie Q?

1060
01:36:25,082 --> 01:36:27,778
That I was a little
housewife with a stupid hobby?

1061
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:31,480
Well, that hobby has become quite
lucrative, thank you very much.

1062
01:36:31,688 --> 01:36:33,588
<i>I was just published in Yankee Magazine.</i>

1063
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:35,248
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask
you to quiet down and leave.

1064
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:37,554
What else did he tell you
about me? That I was crazy?

1065
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:40,858
He's the crazy one. And
he's a goddamn bastard.

1066
01:36:40,964 --> 01:36:42,226
He doesn't even see his own son!

1067
01:36:42,332 --> 01:36:44,960
He's tried. From what I
hear, neither do you, Deirdre.

1068
01:36:45,068 --> 01:36:46,660
Shut up, you cunt!

1069
01:36:47,437 --> 01:36:48,426
All right, that's it. Let's go.

1070
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:50,507
Get your hands off me!

1071
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:52,941
I'm leaving here.

1072
01:36:53,043 --> 01:36:55,841
I need a peaceful environment
to do my writing in.

1073
01:36:59,983 --> 01:37:02,042
Could you get me a towel, please?

1074
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:05,950
Jesus. Fuck.

1075
01:37:07,024 --> 01:37:08,548
Are you wet? Did you get wet? I'm fine.

1076
01:37:08,659 --> 01:37:09,626
Okay.

1077

Why?

1097

Well, I want a daily reminder of my

01:39:17,087 --> 01:39:20,887
Mom, why did you mix your
pills with Dorothy's medicine?

1100
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:24,226
Dr. Finch says that's
what made you sick.

1101
01:39:25,228 --> 01:39:27,662
I'd rather not talk
about that right now.

1102
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:31,758
This whole episode's
been very intense for me.

1103
01:39:31,868 --> 01:39:34,803
But I do believe that may have
been my last psychotic episode.

1104
01:39:34,905 --> 01:39:38,306
I think I finally broke through
to my creative unconscious.

1105
01:39:44,381 --> 01:39:46,508
Did Dorothy take all the cups, too?

1106
01:39:47,918 --> 01:39:49,351
She's such a bitch.

1107
01:39:49,486 --> 01:39:51,920
Oh, no, no. They're
out back on the lawn.

1108
01:40:32,462 --> 01:40:34,555
What the fuck have you been up to?

1109
01:40:35,799 --> 01:40:38,233
Giving my worldly
possessions a moon bath.

1110
01:40:38,869 --> 01:40:42,828
Anything the doctor's touched,
anything he's looked at,

1111
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:45,237
Needs to be sterilized by the night.

1112
01:40:46,476 --> 01:40:48,603
I can't believe I just trusted you.

1113
01:40:48,879 --> 01:40:51,211
You have to trust me. I'm your mother.

1114
01:40:51,314 --> 01:40:54,112
And honestly, Augusten,
I worry about you.

1115
01:40:54,785 --> 01:40:57,015
I disapprove of your choices.

1116
01:40:58,321 --> 01:41:00,289
I haven't had a choice!

1117
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,991
You did when you wrote this, didn't you?

1118
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,228
You read my journal? Don't try
and compete with me, Augusten.

1119
01:41:13,336 --> 01:41:16,271
If you move back in with
me, I won't allow it.

1120
01:41:16,673 --> 01:41:18,300
You'll only get hurt.

1121
01:41:19,743 --> 01:41:21,074
When I become a very famous woman,

1122
01:41:21,178 --> 01:41:23,009
They'll write that I had
a son who is a writer, too,

1123
01:41:23,113 --> 01:41:26,776
Who doesn't compare to my brilliance.
I want more for you than that.

1124
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,685
Did you mix your pills again?

1125
01:41:32,155 --> 01:41:33,588
Are you judging me?

1126
01:41:36,693 --> 01:41:38,160
Where are you going?

1127
01:41:39,863 --> 01:41:43,924
Are you gonna call the doctor?
That bastard! He took my money!

1128
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:48,502
I won't be taken advantage
of again. Is that clear?

1129
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:53,669
What are you doing in there?

1130
01:41:53,777 --> 01:41:55,005
Let me in!

1131
01:41:56,012 --> 01:41:57,775
Are you calling the doctor?

1132
01:42:04,154 --> 01:42:06,213
<i>Neighbors reporting
domestic disturbance...</i>

1133
01:42:08,725 --> 01:42:10,955
Good evening, ma'am...
Get off of my property!

1134
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:13,962
Don't you dare tell me what to
do, not ever! You understand me?

1135
01:42:14,064 --> 01:42:16,191
Ma'am, you need to
calm down... Fuck you!

1136
01:42:16,299 --> 01:42:18,529
I will not be stifled in my own home!

1137
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:25,039
Hope, Hope. It's Augusten. You are
the goddamn devil! You are a Nazi!

1138
01:42:26,643 --> 01:42:29,942
My mom's gone crazy again
and I need your help.

1139
01:42:30,547 --> 01:42:32,174
<i>We need Dad.</i>

1140
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:36,146
Finch gave her a sedative.

1141
01:42:39,556 --> 01:42:41,547
I like watching her sleep.

1142
01:42:43,827 --> 01:42:45,818
She looks like she's dead.

1143
01:42:48,598 --> 01:42:50,896
Maybe she's finally at peace.

1144
01:42:52,602 --> 01:42:56,094
None of us'll ever be at peace,

1145
01:42:56,206 --> 01:43:01,166
Until Finch and every bad
seed spawned from Finch

1146
01:43:03,413 --> 01:43:04,880
Is dead.

1147
01:43:08,552 --> 01:43:10,179
You sound crazy.

1148
01:43:12,689 --> 01:43:15,089
Come on, let's go to bed.

1149
01:44:23,693 --> 01:44:24,887
Neil?

1150
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:31,092
Neil?

1151
01:44:33,036 --> 01:44:35,504
What are you doing, son? Shut up!

1152
01:44:35,905 --> 01:44:37,270
I'm not your son!

1153
01:44:37,874 --> 01:44:39,739
What in the hell is going on?

1154
01:44:46,249 --> 01:44:47,511
It's all right.

1155
01:45:07,504 --> 01:45:08,562
Neil.

1156
01:45:12,609 --> 01:45:13,576
Neil.

1157
01:45:16,112 --> 01:45:17,079
Neil!

1158
01:45:40,437 --> 01:45:42,530
Where did he go? Away.

1159
01:45:42,906 --> 01:45:45,272
Why don't we ever have
any relish in this house?

1160
01:45:45,375 --> 01:45:46,364
What happened?

1161
01:45:46,476 --> 01:45:48,740
It was a family situation.
It's been handled.

1162
01:45:48,845 --> 01:45:51,336
Natalie, you have to tell me, okay?

1163
01:45:51,881 --> 01:45:53,678
Where did Bookman go?

1164
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:35,152
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

1165
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:37,282
I needed to get away.

1166
01:46:38,595 --> 01:46:40,256
My father's very upset with you.

1167
01:46:40,363 --> 01:46:43,332
<i>He feels like you're taking your mother's
side in this and he needs your support</i>

1168
01:46:43,433 --> 01:46:46,368
Because he wants to have her
committed for good to a hospital.

1169
01:46:46,469 --> 01:46:48,596
I don't think she needs to be committed.

1170
01:46:53,376 --> 01:46:56,072
Look, where are you?
We'll come get you. Okay.

1171
01:46:56,813 --> 01:46:58,337
<i>Do you have a pen?</i>

1172
01:46:59,282 --> 01:47:00,510
Yeah.

1173
01:47:01,251 --> 01:47:03,242
<i>Okay, tell me where you are.</i>

1174
01:47:03,353 --> 01:47:06,345
I'll tell you where
I'll be tomorrow at noon.

1175
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:08,721
The bus station.

1176
01:47:11,194 --> 01:47:12,752
I'm going to New York.

1177
01:47:15,432 --> 01:47:16,990
You're coming with me.

1178
01:47:19,769 --> 01:47:21,828
We gotta get away from them, Nat.

1179
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,005
<i>Your family, my mother.</i>

1180
01:47:25,575 --> 01:47:28,339
It's the only way that
we can have a normal life.

1181
01:47:30,914 --> 01:47:32,814
What's going on?

1182
01:47:35,652 --> 01:47:38,143
What are we gonna do
in New York, Augusten?

1183
01:47:39,756 --> 01:47:42,657
Our only skills are
restraining psychotics.

1184
01:47:48,731 --> 01:47:49,789
I'll write.

1185
01:47:51,067 --> 01:47:55,470
<i>And I'll get a job so
you can go to school.</i>

1186
01:47:56,406 --> 01:47:58,033
I'll support us.

1187
01:48:03,446 --> 01:48:05,277
I'm afraid, Augusten.

1188
01:48:10,019 --> 01:48:11,247
Me, too.

1189
01:48:13,556 --> 01:48:15,285
But we can do this.

1190
01:48:18,228 --> 01:48:19,627
We have to.

1191
01:48:33,877 --> 01:48:36,277
Did a woman come in here by herself?

1192
01:49:01,571 --> 01:49:03,129
Can I take your order?

1193
01:49:03,907 --> 01:49:07,536
Yes, I'd like a TaB

1194
01:49:07,644 --> 01:49:10,044
And a slice of key lime pie.

1195
01:49:11,848 --> 01:49:13,816
Oh, nothing for me, thanks.

1196
01:49:16,419 --> 01:49:18,683
Aren't you hungry? You look skinny.

1197
01:49:20,123 --> 01:49:21,112
You really should eat something.

1198
01:49:21,224 --> 01:49:23,886
Don't pull that maternal
crap with me now, Mom.

1199
01:49:26,396 --> 01:49:27,988
It's too late for that.

1200
01:49:29,365 --> 01:49:31,356
No, it's not too late.

1201
01:49:33,036 --> 01:49:37,200
We can find a house together
where we both can write.

1202
01:49:37,874 --> 01:49:39,501
We can start over.

1203
01:49:40,109 --> 01:49:41,804
I am starting over.

1204
01:49:43,179 --> 01:49:44,544
In New York.

1205
01:49:49,052 --> 01:49:53,216
Really? Well, how are you
gonna make that work, Augusten?

1206
01:49:53,556 --> 01:49:55,387
You've no formal education,

1207
01:49:55,491 --> 01:49:59,222
No money, no furniture, no friends.

1208
01:50:01,798 --> 01:50:05,063
Yeah, well, could be worse.

1209
01:50:06,469 --> 01:50:08,494
Could be going to a prom.

1210
01:50:14,477 --> 01:50:16,604
Why did you come here then?

1211
01:50:20,216 --> 01:50:21,843
To say goodbye to you.

1212
01:51:03,026 --> 01:51:05,517
Did you pack enough warm clothes?

1213
01:51:14,237 --> 01:51:15,295
Yeah.

1214
01:51:40,997 --> 01:51:42,362
I'm gonna be okay.

1215
01:52:39,655 --> 01:52:41,520
Natalie's not coming.

1216
01:52:44,093 --> 01:52:46,425
I told her I'd deal with you.

1217
01:52:51,134 --> 01:52:53,261
Don't try to stop me, Agnes.

1218
01:52:54,203 --> 01:52:55,500
I'm going.

1219
01:53:05,982 --> 01:53:07,745
I'm gonna miss you.

1220
01:53:11,087 --> 01:53:12,714
I'll miss you, too.

1221
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:23,697
You're the best son
a mom could ever want.

1222
01:53:29,105 --> 01:53:31,005
You need to know that.

1223
01:53:56,499 --> 01:53:57,864
Oh, my God.

1224
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:02,032
Agnes, there's a lot of money in here.

1225
01:54:05,608 --> 01:54:07,633
Penny here, a dime there.

1226
01:54:10,713 --> 01:54:12,180
It adds up.

1227
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:18,379
The doctor doesn't know I have
it, of course. No one does.

1228
01:54:25,494 --> 01:54:29,897
You know, this morning
the IRS came again

1229
01:54:32,301 --> 01:54:34,462
And I almost gave it to them.

1230
01:54:36,072 --> 01:54:38,006
And then I thought, no.

1231
01:54:40,042 --> 01:54:44,570
For once in my life I'm
going to invest wisely.

1232
01:54:51,287 --> 01:54:55,018
When you write a book,
you send me a copy.

1233
01:55:11,474 --> 01:55:13,533
Goodbye, my sweet boy.

1234
01:55:25,087 --> 01:55:26,179
Agnes?

1235
01:55:31,093 --> 01:55:32,890
What are you gonna do now?

1236
01:55:35,298 --> 01:55:36,788
I don't know.

1237
01:55:39,502 --> 01:55:41,868
Maybe I'll take down the Christmas tree.
