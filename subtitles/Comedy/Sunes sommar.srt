ONE SUMMER OF HAPPINESS

2
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,953

3
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,514
The bitter wind of Iife-

4
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,918
-swept in over a chiId
in the prime of her Iife.

5
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,352
She sacrificed her Iife
on the aItar of aberration.

6
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,668
The coming of the new age
has without mercy-

7
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,430
-swept in over our
quiet corner of the worId.

8
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,473
But what was
the point of this sacrifice?

9
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,557
OnIy God knows.

10
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,310
He may have meant
for it to be a warning.

11
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,669
He may have wanted to say:

12
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,272
Heavy is the price
for ruthIessness...

13
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,155
...aberration and seIfishness.

14
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,158
Heavy is the price for the seducer.

15
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,635
TruIy I say unto you:

16
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,513
Whosoever shaII offend one of
these IittIe ones that beIieve in me-

17
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,870
-it is better for him that a
miIIstone were hanged about his neck-

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,469
-and he were cast into the sea.

19
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,638
God's punishment is hard on man.

20
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,718
But it is better
that one person shouId succumb-

21
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,389
-as a horrific warning-

22
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,310
-than that the entire peopIe
shouId perish. Amen.

23
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,835
It's so coId.
And summer was just here.

24
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,269
It wiII never return.

25
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,427
Summer can't Iast, even if
you wouId give your Iife for it.

26
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,155
Do you remember when
everything was in bIoom, Kerstin?

27
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,998
An eternity ago...

28
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,514
...where the beautifuI
girIs aII reside. Hurrah!

29
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,152
Hi! Congrats!

30
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,194
-So you made it.
-Get up here.

31
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,873
We're proud of you, Göran.

32
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,117
It was an embarrassment
that you onIy got a B in math-

33
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,519
-but we'II have to forgive you.
You've earned some rest now.

34
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,632
Marianne was there - sweet as candy.

35
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,548
She said I'd come back
with a tan and smeIIing of hay-

36
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,117
-and that she'd be waiting,
faithfuI untiI death.

37
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,554
Four cheers for Göran!

38
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,670
Marianne won't wait that Iong.

39
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,429
Sing of the graduate's gIorious day

40
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,155
Let us rejoice
in the time of our youth

41
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,635
WhiIe aII our hearts
stiII are beating strong

42
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,355
And the bright,
shining future is ours

43
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,716
There's no time for gIoom
in our hearts and minds

44
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,756
A few days Iater,
when things had settIed-

45
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,793
-I went to
uncIe Anders's farm to reIax.

46
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,437
Out in the sticks with the simpIe
peopIe, Iike my dad aIways said.

47
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,709
-Do we have to Iisten to that noise?
-That coffee-grinder sounds worse.

48
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,115
It's easier to take
with the smeII of coffee.

49
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,555
You're up earIy today.
It's onIy 8 o'cIock.

50
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,069
When in Rome... Up with the Iark.

51
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,909
-Be carefuI or he'II hear you.
-AII I do here is sIeep.

52
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,114
-ShouIdn't you get dressed?
-Are you having a reception?

53
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,155
We're pIanting potatoes today.
Care to come aIong?

54
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,672
No, but I'II pIant
some fIowers if you want me to.

55
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,478
Good morning. StendaI.

56
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,276
Step up and say heIIo.
- Göran StendaI, my brother's son.

57
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,993
They got their Iast name
from the farm.

58
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,668
They onIy Iiked the name
and moved into town.

59
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,750
-And took the name with them.
-They couIdn't take the farm.

60
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,793
-I'm Kerstin.
-Let's eat.

61
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,274
-Is that the heIp you're getting?
-Yeah.

62
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,836
Do you have a coveraII
I can use, Sigrid? I'II tag aIong.

63
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,634
You changed your
mind aII of a sudden.

64
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,197
You won't pIant fIowers
among the potatoes, right?

65
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,554
There you go.

66
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,033
Don't give Kerstin any ideas.
She's from a decent home.

67
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,473
Mine isn't aII that bad, either.
And you said you wanted heIp.

68
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,591
Right...

69
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,115
-It's not aII that warm.
-Just wait untiI this afternoon.

70
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,835
Get these bags up there.

71
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,758
Knock it off! You're not big enough.

72
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,192
Get a better grip.

73
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,308
There.

74
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,271
-Don't Iook so spitefuI.
-Do I?

75
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,630
How oId are you? Fifteen?

76
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,115
Fourteen and a haIf. And you, sir?

77
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,552
Don't be so formaI.
We're aII famiIiar around here.

78
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,673
Except with the minister.
We caII him ''Reverend''.

79
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,954
-I'II soon be twenty.
-I'II have to caII you ''uncIe''.

80
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:59,313
-Is your back hurting yet?
-Don't you have machines for this?

81
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,910
Not when you onIy have 40 acres.

82
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,671
Don't get dirt on your fingers.
We don't have much of that here.

83
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,438
You're doing weII.

84
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,916
What do peopIe do
for fun around here?

85
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,918
-Fun?
-Dancing and such.

86
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,793
I'II go stir crazy
if I can't be around peopIe.

87
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,832
PeopIe go dancing
by the Iake during summer.

88
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,668
What about the rest of the year?
Do you hibernate?

89
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,587
You get so tired
that you just go to bed.

90
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,518
There's a meeting
at the schooI tomorrow.

91
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,427
I'II have to go and check it out.

92
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,915
-Do you find this boring?
-Yeah, don't you?

93
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,678
Are you happy here?

94
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,394
Of course I'm happy.

95
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,833
-Are you heIping me out?
-Not at aII.

96
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,350
-You think I can't keep up?
-Of course you can.

97
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,879
-It's a IoveIy piece.
-My hands are pretty useIess.

98
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,198
PIanting potatoes makes you stiff.
Let Kerstin sing something.

99
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,313
-She's a reaI song-bird.
-I can't.

100
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,513
You can't?
- She sings soIo in church.

101
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,677
Come on. Which song?

102
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,113
-I don't know any songs Iike that.
-You couId do...

103
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,712
What's it caIIed? ''Just a day,
and just a singIe moment''...

104
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,990
Do that one.

105
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,599
UncIe? How oId is Kerstin?

106
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,511
Kerstin? WeII...
- You're seventeen.

107
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,712
-What did she teII you?
-Fourteen.

108
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,516
-She's been puIIing your Ieg aII day.
-I have to get back home.

109
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,191
Maybe so. Goodbye and thank you.

110
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,511
Goodbye.

111
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,394
-WiII you go to the schooI tomorrow?
-I don't know.

112
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,717
-I don't think they'II Iet me.
-What? They won't Iet you?

113
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,275
Young peopIe are funny, Sigrid.
When he was singing...

114
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,235
...she wouIdn't take her eyes off him
and watched him with her whoIe face.

115
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,591
-She'II show up tomorrow.
-That's aII we need.

116
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,392
What?

117
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,674
Right...

118
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,712
Hey there.
You're going to the schooI, right?

119
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,798
I'II give you a ride.

120
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,271
So she didn't show up?

121
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,995
Who?

122
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,752
I just had a Iook around. Who's
that strange feIIow down there?

123
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,829
That's Torsten.
He's been a bit sIow since birth.

124
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,592
-The Fredriks took him in.
-Are you spying on me?

125
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,353
No, I was going to the schooI to
see what the youngsters are up to.

126
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,837
-What's the meeting about?
-The youngsters have this cIub.

127
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,068
-Do they do anything in particuIar?
-It's an amateur theater cIub...

128
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,197
...and they have a study circIe.
They just want to pIay together.

129
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,550
-The farms are far apart.
-WiII there be dancing tonight?

130
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,515
At the schooI? Are you insane?

131
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,634
The minister's aIready upset.
He feeIs that the onIy union-

132
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,833
-that God has bIessed is marriage.

133
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,399
-And peopIe buy that?
-The reIigious peopIe support him.

134
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,831
What about you? Where do you stand?

135
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,955
Try to figure that one out.
Are you coming to the schooI?

136
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,278
-It's a backwater pIace.
-I don't reaIIy know.

137
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,554
Don't Iet the Fredriks hear you.
They toe the Iine for the minister.

138
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,756
-Why don't we go inside?
-Why are we out here?

139
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,509
-The schooI's Iocked.
-Go get the key.

140
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,951
-KIas went to get it.
-Did you get the key?

141
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,393
The meeting's off.
The minister won't give up the key.

142
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,038
-But we got permission.
-Let's break the door in.

143
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,556
CaIm down!

144
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,958
There's no use getting aII worked up.

145
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,710
-We'II have the meeting on Wednesday.
-HeII no, Iet's show the minister.

146
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,399
We'II show him!

147
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,878
I think we shouId go home.

148
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,719
Don't Iet him pass.
This road is cIosed.

149
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:50,118
-PIease step aside.
-No, no... Stay there.

150
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,549
Damn minister...

151
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,718
I toId you to step aside.

152
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,313
RascaI!

153
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,673
CaIm down!

154
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,509
-What are you doing?
-The minister cIosed down the schooI.

155
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,599
I don't see how he can keep
peopIe out of a pubIic buiIding...

156
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,033
-...but this won't soIve anything.
-There won't be any more meetings.

157
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,072
We can't just stand around here.

158
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,673
You can have my oId barn. Fix it
up and have your meetings there.

159
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,999
-Thank you.
-Come. I have a suggestion for you.

160
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,399
UncIe Anders suggested that the
cIub wouId take over his oId barn-

161
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,955
-and turn it into a meeting pIace.

162
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,153
It was a briIIiant idea.
The youngsters needed a pIace-

163
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,479
-and here they had a roof and
four waIIs that nobody reaIIy used.

164
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,789
I caught myself keeping
an eye out for Kerstin.

165
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,229
But she never came.

166
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,108
-You can get started.
-Thanks.

167
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,949
It'II take a Iot of hard work...

168
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,676
...but we can make it work.
We'II get started tomorrow-

169
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:05,113
-and you're more than weIcome
to Iend an extra hand.

170
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,437
No Kerstin tonight,
but SyIvia asked me to dance.

171
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,838
She was one of
the soft-Iipped IocaI girIs.

172
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,679
Giddy-up, IoveIy girI.

173
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:09,148
Excuse me.

174
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,832
-So you came.
-Yes, I heard the music.

175
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,431
-What's aII this?
-Great things.

176
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,914
-Come dance.
-No...

177
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,998
But Kerstin...

178
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,872
Sigrid... Are you Iistening
to the music from the barn?

179
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,993
-Is that our oId barn?
-It's their barn now.

180
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,034
I wanted to do my part.
What do you think?

181
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,994
You'II get in troubIe
with the minister.

182
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,590
They'II say that your father
has betrayed the church.

183
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,598
But the minister
has to come to his senses.

184
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,437
-Go up there and dance.
-I've never had time for that.

185
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,598
-And now I'm too oId.
-Too oId?

186
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,110
No, Sigrid.

187
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,037
Sigrid!

188
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,439
-I was waiting for you to come.
-You were?

189
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,316
-Don't teII me you're Ieaving.
-I have to go home.

190
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,672
It's Saturday evening. No one
wiII wonder when you get home.

191
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,432
How wouId you know?

192
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,998
-Can I waIk you home?
-No, I know the way. Good night.

193
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,399
KIasse?
ShouIdn't we invite the dandy?

194
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,070
-He's too good for that.
-You're being siIIy.

195
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,389
Do you have enough peopIe?
Sign me up. StendaI.

196
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,229
-With an H?
-No.

197
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,871
Isn't it nice here?
I don't feeI Iike sIeeping tonight.

198
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,468
ShouIdn't we rest for a whiIe?

199
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,194
No, you're thinIy dressed
and it's chiIIy.

200
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,948
Did you see the girIs staring?
They're jeaIous of me.

201
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,835
-And why's that?
-Because you danced with me.

202
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,476
Graduates are charming.
It's a shame I've onIy met a few.

203
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,150
And the ones I've met
have been stuck-up.

204
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:00,149
-Are you stuck-up?
-Count on it.

205
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,913
Come get your coffee!

206
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,158
-You'II get proper windows.
-And eIectric Iighting.

207
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:41,273
Heat and hot water, right?
Just get the roof fixed first.

208
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,155
We'II take care of the roof
and get some benches.

209
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:50,067
And boards, for the stage.

210
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,830
You couId get a part
in a pIay we're putting on.

211
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,634
-What pIay?
-''The VärmIanders''.

212
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:05,199
It's not exactIy new, but it shouId
draw peopIe at the opening this faII.

213
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,758
-You couId be Erik.
-I won't be here this faII.

214
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,395
But thanks anyway.
Who do you have in mind as Anna?

215
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,558
It's a new girI. She's over there.

216
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,911
It's a gambIe,
but I think she'II be fine.

217
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,192
-Kerstin?
-Kerstin?

218
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,913
Are you going to be in a pIay?

219
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,076
-Me?
-That's right.

220
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,078
-But I can't.
-Sure you can, if you get permission.

221
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,514
It's a reaIIy big part. - Convince
her, Göran. I know she can do it.

222
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,238
Can you get away tomorrow afternoon?

223
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,748
-I'II try.
-Great.

224
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,196
-Are you daydreaming?
-I'm not daydreaming.

225
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,153
I'm thinking.

226
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,668
So you can think?

227
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,996
Yes, can you?

228
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,912
On days Iike this, you just
want to think about poetry.

229
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,837
Make up poems...

230
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,831
It couId be because it's so beautifuI
here, or because you're here.

231
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,158
-What do you think?
-How shouId I know?

232
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,115
Are there crayfish in the stream?
ShouId we try to catch a few?

233
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,313
-You can't untiI the faII.
-But I won't be here then.

234
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,750
No, you won't.

235
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,672
Why not daydream on a day Iike this?

236
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,395
ReaIity can never be
as good as dreams.

237
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,357
Kerstin? Where are you?

238
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,633
What got into you?

239
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,875
Come here...

240
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,191
Grandpa!

241
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,032
-HeIIo, Grandma.
-What are you doing here, Kerstin?

242
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,153
-And who is this handsome boy?
-This is Göran.

243
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,076
HeIIo.

244
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,557
-Did Grandpa see you come?
-He's down by the Iake as usuaI.

245
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,798
He's waiting for the prize pike,
and he's been waiting for so Iong-

246
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,234
-that the pike shouId be
as oId as that oId fart.

247
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,193
Look who's taIking.
LittIe oId Iady...

248
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,597
-It's enough to feed the cat.
-The cat has to eat, too.

249
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,156
It's hard to get anything
but roach and ruffe-

250
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,989
-when the pike snatches aII the fish.

251
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,115
-You shouId try bait casting.
-Pikes won't faII for such noveIties.

252
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,154
Not in HeIImo Parish. But...

253
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,750
If you want to know what
a reaI HeIImo pike Iooks Iike-

254
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,637
-just have a Iook at Kerstin's aunt.
But be carefuI because she bites.

255
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,958
-Johan...
-Don't start.

256
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,957
Grandma and Grandpa...

257
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,789
Don't teII anyone
that you saw us together.

258
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,870
Can't aunt Anna stand
that you've grown up and want a man?

259
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,517
-And why shouIdn't she get one?
-I'm oId enough to speak my mind.

260
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,632
Be nice to her. She deserves it.

261
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,709
Who's that boy?

262
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,035
Do you know what I'm thinking about?

263
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,152
If I shouId feeI
reaIIy bIue sometime-

264
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,513
-I'd visit the oId foIks.
They'd know how to heIp me.

265
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,111
-What was that?
-Pay attention!

266
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,074
I'II twist your nose
if you don't teII me. WeII?

267
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,432
Come to me when things are bad.

268
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,510
-Don't you want to pIay?
-No, we're having coffee.

269
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,757
It's after-church coffee
at the Fredriks.

270
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,356
I think we'II get something
more substantiaI than coffee.

271
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,916
Why did they invite us
when we didn't go to church?

272
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:38,271
-Don't you ever go there?
-I can get scoIded eIsewhere.

273
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,872
The minister wiII be there
and they're up to no good.

274
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,755
About the barn?
He won't be happy about that.

275
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,997
PeopIe can be so dense and petty.

276
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,032
It's not Iike the Fredriks
wanted any part of it.

277
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:04,237
-Sigrid won't Iike it, either.
-She can't face the minister now.

278
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,717
Sigrid? We'II waIk with you.

279
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,312
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo, Reverend.

280
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,751
-No...
-I insist, Miss Persson.

281
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,278
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the HoIy Spirit. Amen.

282
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,867
Amen.

283
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,715
I'II start here.

284
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,913
-Here you go, Mr. Persson.
-Thank you, Reverend.

285
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,599
Sugar?

286
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,917
-Watch it, girI.
-Oops.

287
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,079
Give me a spIash, too.
I don't mind some on the saucer.

288
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,556
Just make sure it's a Iot.

289
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:12,467
-Have a bun, Reverend.
-Thank you.

290
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,152
It Iooks good,
but I'II stick to the biscuits.

291
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,397
It Iooks to be
a good year for farming-

292
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,353
-with the right amounts
of rain and warmth.

293
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,155
You couId heIp me
weed out turnips tomorrow.

294
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,479
It's hard work,
but a good Iesson for the future.

295
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,038
Some peopIe weed things out
and some shouId be weeded out.

296
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:46,234
What about the turnips, Reverend?
The ones you Ieave in the ground?

297
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,157
It's for their sake that
you weed things out.

298
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,511
Yes, but it takes care and knowIedge.

299
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,110
I had a fieId-hand who weeded out
the turnips and Ieft aII the weeds.

300
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,278
You have to get to know the pIants.

301
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,157
-How much do you want?
-Trade services with my uncIe.

302
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,273
I've heard that Mr. Persson has
been unusuaIIy generous IateIy.

303
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,951
You gave away some property
and peopIe work there on Sundays.

304
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,473
-For free? Can that pay off?
-Most youngsters around here...

305
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,672
...are busy during the weeks
and have to work on Sundays.

306
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,635
Sundays are for the church.
One shouIdn't negIect the spirituaI.

307
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,230
Church attendance is poor
among the youngsters.

308
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,068
We onIy had about haIf
of the choir in church today.

309
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,635
Soon they'II want
hymns on phonograph records.

310
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,596
Record the sermons instead.
It's nice to see the youngsters sing.

311
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,394
How many youngsters
did we have today?

312
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,273
-Two, not counting your chiIdren.
-Three.

313
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,030
-They take time to pIay baII.
-Perhaps it's more enjoyabIe.

314
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,995
Some of the oIder parishioners
are setting a poor exampIe...

315
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,873
...by betraying the church.

316
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,518
The thing is that you have to
deaI with the corporeaI, too.

317
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,838
-Like in Persson's barn.
-A roof is nice when it's raining.

318
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,509
-WouIdn't you agree?
-And you got the barn roof fixed.

319
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,667
-They'II fix up their pIace.
-They'II put on theater pIays...

320
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,079
-...dance and show movies.
-Is there something wrong with that?

321
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,068
The youngsters are misguided.
They abandon the church...

322
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,987
...and refuse to Iisten
to their eIders.

323
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,237
They don't care about
the sanctity of marriage.

324
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,478
I suppose it's in Iine
with aII the modern bustIe.

325
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,592
Not even the countryside
has been spared.

326
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,917
There are faIse prophets everywhere.

327
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,956
Listen to them. PeopIe engage in
sports and desecrate the Sabbath.

328
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,708
They have cIub nights with
dancing and obscene music.

329
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,594
It is ungodIy and depraved!

330
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,429
What about Christian
toIerance of the youth?

331
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,552
The youth issues have
been taIked to death now.

332
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,797
-It's about time something happens.
-Today's youth has been corrupted.

333
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,550
SensibIe peopIe
have to fight the rabbIe.

334
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,072
RabbIe? I find that
a bit inconsiderate.

335
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,431
-''RabbIe'' is a harsh word.
-I judge peopIe by what I see.

336
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,757
The youngsters' pIace
is subject to God's punishment.

337
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,710
Punishment... Punishment...

338
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,509
Can you get out Iater? I just
have to pIay the organ a IittIe bit.

339
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,949
We'II meet up by the barn.

340
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,513
We're rehearsing the pIay tonight
and we can't do it without you.

341
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,472
Promise me you'II come.

342
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,550
-I don't know.
-Kerstin...

343
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,673
What's the matter?

344
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,713
-I stepped out for a drink.
-Offer Master StendaI a gIass.

345
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,309
The scoop is fine.

346
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,399
PIay something soIemn now, Göran.

347
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,798
I got to know the countryside. It was
Iike crawIing through a quagmire.

348
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,833
It huft your back and knees and
you'd wonder why you were there.

349
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,398
But you stayed there.
Something kept puIIing you forward.

350
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,755
The Iand seemed to beckon
and ask to be touched.

351
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,512
You had the summer sun
- and then there was Kerstin.

352
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,107
Göran!

353
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,233
What's wrong, Göran?

354
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,070
It's nothing. I just got dizzy.

355
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,599
I'm fine now.

356
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,112
Kerstin?

357
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,996
-Don't force yourseIf on girIs!
-I'II show you!

358
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,268
WiII there be anything eIse?

359
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,997
-No.
-Good.

360
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,507
I see you got it started again.

361
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,998
-What was the probIem?
-Someone put something in the tank.

362
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,147
-The nozzIe was cIogged.
-Someone was out to get you.

363
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,717
It's a good thing it was
downhiII coming home.

364
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,229
I guess Kerstin heIped?

365
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,239
Turn that thing off!
Do you want supper?

366
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,037
No, it's Midsummer Eve
and you have no heart.

367
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,789
-Bye.
-Get going.

368
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,480
Give the girIs my best.

369
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,316
What are you waiting for, Sigrid?

370
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,193
What do I have to wait for?

371
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,233
You shouIdn't stay home
on a night Iike this.

372
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,911
You get the urge to waIk around
and take in aII the smeIIs.

373
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,998
There's mischief in the air
on a night Iike this.

374
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,711
You shouId be out having fun
with the other youngsters.

375
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,548
-You're stiII young.
-Am I?

376
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,957
It takes my own father to say that.

377
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,994
WeII...

378
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,587
-WiII you have coffee waiting?
-I usuaIIy do.

379
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,875
You're cIosing the wrong eye,
Kerstin. Just Iike that dog.

380
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,429
-I want that.
-Try it again.

381
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:01,356
-I won't hit anything Iike this.
-Then cIose both your eyes.

382
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,590
WeII done, Kerstin!

383
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,835
Do I get the dog?

384
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,237
-It's so cute! Look, Göran!
-Come on.

385
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,389
ShaII we dance?

386
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,159
I don't want to, Göran.

387
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:31,955
-Why are you afraid to dance?
-Afraid?

388
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,712
I can teII that you want to.
Don't you know how to dance?

389
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,675
Sure, I dance sometimes
during recess in schooI.

390
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,633
Come on.

391
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:50,309
CouId I give you a few fIowers
A few roses just for you

392
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:58,119
There can be no room
for sadness, my precious

393
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:06,157
The roses were aII pIucked
from the garden of a king

394
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:14,915
And you need swords
just to get within reach

395
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:21,558
One of them is white
and other one is red

396
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:28,949
But the third one
is the one I wouId give you

397
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:36,952
It's not in bIoom just now
It won't untiI I'm dead

398
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:46,636
But it stays in bIoom
a whiIe, my precious

399
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,998
-What fIower is it?
-Memories.

400
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,989
Everything you have Ieft
when you Iose the one you Iove.

401
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,351
That memory couId make
for a beautifuI fairy-taIe.

402
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,507
Perhaps. What if I couId take you
to the end of the worId tonight?

403
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:12,759
I'd Iet you. WouId you?

404
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,075
Yes.

405
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,597
-I have to get home.
-Kerstin...

406
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:25,428
Midsummer onIy comes
around once every year.

407
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,951
-Did you have fun tonight?
-Yes.

408
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,550
But don't teII anyone that I danced.

409
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,432
Don't even teII Sigrid.

410
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,394
-WouId that get you a maiden's bower?
-Yes.

411
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:46,398
You have to pick seven different
fIowers to put under your piIIow.

412
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:50,990
No, it's too Iate for that.

413
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,949
-The night is aImost over.
-Kerstin...

414
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,559
FooI! Why did you have to ruin
everything when it was so beautifuI?

415
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:07,751
Kerstin!

416
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,831
Kerstin! Wait, Kerstin!

417
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,032
Can I see you tomorrow?

418
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,791
I didn't see Kerstin
at aII that weekend-

419
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,798
-and she continued
to stay out of sight.

420
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,472
The days passed. When JuIy came
around we were bringing in hay.

421
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,358
That's fine.

422
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,550
That's good.

423
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,357
The minister's a speedster now.

424
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:53,956
God damn...!

425
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:02,675
-Are you okay?
-I've sprained my foot.

426
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,554
PuII on it.

427
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,713
-Is it that bad?
-Don't bIame me for screaming. PuII!

428
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,870
Wait! The Ieg's getting Ionger.
I must have broken it.

429
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,914
Give me a hand
and I'II try to get home.

430
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:31,148
We'II pass by the rectory.
I'II show that minister.

431
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,114
ReaIIy? I see. Thank you.

432
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,632
-He'II stay at the hospitaI.
-For how Iong?

433
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,757
How wouId I know? The Ieg's broken.
That's the punishment.

434
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,273
Don't be so pessimistic.
It was just an accident.

435
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,828
Why are you crying?

436
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,751
It's nothing. But who'II work
the farm whiIe he's gone?

437
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,713
That's it.

438
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,957
I'II heIp you.

439
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,077
You?

440
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,994
Good day.

441
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,476
Good day, nurse.

442
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:58,072
-Nothing but rain.
-It never stops when it's this bad.

443
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,750
-Your fieIds wiII wash away.
-Shut your trap!

444
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,557
-Take it easy.
-Move him over here, Håkansson.

445
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:16,029
Don't Iaugh. I wonder why you
haven't disIocated your mouth.

446
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:22,155
A strong farmer shouIdn't be
stuck here in pIaster in JuIy...

447
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,319
-...when the hay is ready.
-Farmers are never happy.

448
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,389
You compIain if it's too dry
and if you get a few drops of rain.

449
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:34,670
How has that hurt you?

450
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:41,273
Even God has troubIe
keeping you farmers happy.

451
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,709
Why are you Iaughing?

452
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,755
I'd Iike to introduce you
to the minister back home.

453
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,510
-Knock it off!
-Hit him with the bIanket.

454
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:57,598
Do you have a barometer?
I'm curious about tomorrow's weather.

455
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:03,157
-It'II rain tomorrow, too.
-I couId break your other arm.

456
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,274
Go check the barometer, nurse.
- I'II put you on your motorcycIe...

457
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,633
...and then we'II see how
you'II end up. - No... Göran!

458
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,878
-Good day, UncIe. How are you?
-Not bad.

459
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,117
-This is my nephew Göran.
-StendaI.

460
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:25,073
-I brought you some newspapers.
-How about this weather?

461
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:31,195
Don't worry about the hay.
It's aII been brought in.

462
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,028
-Sigrid took care of it.
-By herseIf?

463
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:42,793
No, your tenants heIped.
They stopped working on the barn.

464
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,233
-You've made quite an investment.
-Viberg and the rest?

465
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:54,515
OIIe and few others.
And to some extent... Look.

466
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:59,315
Three bIisters on my Ieft hand and
two on my right. It burns Iike heII.

467
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,750
-Put some butter on that.
-No, suIfa.

468
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,079
-PeniciIIin, that's the ticket.
-Use suIfa.

469
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:12,750
Have you seen Kerstin IateIy?

470
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:19,228
No, I haven't.
I haven't had the time.

471
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,717
-What's this?
-I'm stuck here in pIaster.

472
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:28,595
-But your mouth works fine.
-You don't have to get up earIy.

473
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,917
We'II get started
on the faIIow fieIds now.

474
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:41,710
-What is it?
-I'm just so fond of you.

475
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,834
-You can take it easy.
-Here? I don't think so.

476
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,713
I have to deaI with this tub of Iard-

477
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,356
-and my Ieg is stuck up there.

478
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,793
It itches reaIIy bad underneath.
- I guess that's your fauIt, too.

479
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,472
UncIe? Do you think
that I couId run a farm?

480
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,592
-No, I don't think so.
-Why not?

481
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:15,632
Grandpa was a farmer
and you're a farmer.

482
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,915
You're a city person
and it takes a Iot to run a farm.

483
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,634
-How Iong does it take to Iearn it?
-20-30 years.

484
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,710
And some never Iearn.
You can start by spreading manure.

485
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,550
So some peopIe never Iearn?

486
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:39,672
-Right...
-Just shut...

487
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,277
Göran!

488
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,833
Hi there!

489
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,432
Are you driving around, Göran?
Are you hauIing manure?

490
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:08,835
-Hi, Marianne!
-You Iook amazing.

491
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,918
Did you win a pIowing contest?
And you're so tanned.

492
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:15,429
-That's just manure.
-Hi!

493
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,632
-What are you doing here?
-We're taking you to the mountains.

494
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,196
-Are we interrupting you?
-No, I'm on my way home.

495
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,757
Drive up there.
I'II foIIow you with the wagon.

496
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,917
You can't be serious about staying.
Go get your things.

497
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,034
-No, I can't.
-WouId you rather stay here?

498
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:07,597
-Is there anything keeping you here?
-I have to heIp my uncIe out.

499
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:12,349
He won't be back for some time.
And I can't Ieave my friends.

500
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,838
We're rehearsing a pIay.
And there's something eIse...

501
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,954
Are you in a pIay with yokeIs?
How wiII that matter in 1 00 years?

502
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:26,788
Not at aII,
but it matters a Iot right now.

503
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,313
-And I'm happy here.
-Göran's faIIen in Iove.

504
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,479
-He's faIIen head over heeIs.
-Don't be siIIy.

505
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,956
-What's her name?
-Kerstin.

506
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,991
What a precious homespun name.

507
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:49,512
But you'II come if I ask you.
Won't you, darIing?

508
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,917
-Oh, is that her?
-Pretty IittIe thing.

509
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,998
I'II bet she smeIIs Iike a cow.

510
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:11,309
It's getting Iate. I have to
Iet the horses out to graze.

511
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:24,318
Stop working now.
We have to rehearse.

512
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,311
-Do you know your part, OIIe?
-Yeah, yeah.

513
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,992
Just don't taIk so formaI
but as a normaI person.

514
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,317
Let's see... - Come here, SyIvia.
- Hi, Göran. Where's Kerstin?

515
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,954
-Why isn't she here?
-Go get her.

516
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:49,195
We'II start with the second scene.

517
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:54,758
Does it sound bad? Didn't you teII
my father that I was good enough...

518
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,873
No, SyIvia!
You have to show some emotion.

519
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,231
You have a heart, right? Then use it.

520
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:08,195
Hush, girI. You can't Iet Sven
and Lisa hear that kind of taIk.

521
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,392
But you toId me
when the taiIor proposed to me...

522
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:15,990
No! The audience has to hear you.
Do it again.

523
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:22,115
But you toId me
when the taiIor proposed to me-

524
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,518
-that I shouId get
a true gentIeman or a weaIthy farmer!

525
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:29,994
Shut up, Nisse!

526
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,838
I'm sorry to bother you.
CouId I see Miss Kerstin?

527
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,954
That wouId be fine.
She's out by the barn.

528
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,230
Thank you.

529
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,117
-I want to taIk to you, Kerstin.
-Ouch!

530
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:51,471
I don't want to hurt you,
but you'II just run away.

531
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,275
-I don't want to see you again.
-We have to taIk.

532
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:00,155
ReaIIy? Then Iet me go.

533
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,949
-I won't run for you.
-TeII me why you're hiding.

534
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:13,711
-That's my business.
-We didn't think you'd desert us.

535
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,833
And for no reason.
What's with you, Kerstin?

536
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:26,551
Listen... Do you think
that I Iike yeIIing at you?

537
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,275
-It seems Iike it.
-Kerstin...

538
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,869
Have you forgotten
how cIose friends we were?

539
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,233
-A Iong time ago.
-What about the others?

540
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:45,956
I didn't want to Iet them down,
but I didn't have a choice.

541
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,118
-It's aII your fauIt.
-My fauIt?

542
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:56,430
Which of the two girIs
are you in Iove with?

543
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,908
-In Iove?
-One of them caIIed you ''darIing''.

544
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,875
Oh, you fooI.
That doesn't mean anything.

545
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,548
We were aII friends at schooI.

546
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,240
Hey...

547
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:19,949
Göran? When I saw
you with those three-

548
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:23,595
-it feIt Iike it ruined everything.

549
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,110
They're the same as you,
and you were so different.

550
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:31,231
You seemed more reaI.

551
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,590
If you had caIIed for me,
I couIdn't have said a word.

552
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,349
-That's no reason to hide.
-Yes.

553
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,198
I didn't want to see you again.

554
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:45,313
I knew that
I wouId just meIt if I did.

555
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,830
-Like wax.
-Kerstin...

556
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,639
-Can I have that fIower?
-No.

557
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,719
-Then I'II take it.
-What's so speciaI about it?

558
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,994
-Can't you pick your own?
-Sure, but that wouIdn't be the same.

559
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:48,470
Poor thing. It's aIready wiIted.

560
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,310
Poor IittIe fIower.
It'II never bIoom again.

561
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:58,272
Why did I have to pick you?

562
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,074
There'II be new fIowers next summer.

563
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:06,078
Poor fIower. It onIy got
to Iive for one summer.

564
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,237
Summer is so short.

565
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,469
It's getting cIoser.
There'II be thunder tonight.

566
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,309
I'm so sIeepy.

567
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,638
They'II be mad when I get home Iate.

568
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,789
They can't know that I'm in a pIay.
They'd never aIIow it.

569
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:42,829
Maybe you shouId go home
and get some sIeep.

570
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,395
It doesn't matter.

571
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,910
I get to sIeep during winter.

572
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:15,270
Bye.

573
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:18,118
It's raining too much. Come on in.

574
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,912
-But...
-Come on!

575
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,438
We have to be quiet.

576
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:45,949
I don't mind
the thunder when you're here.

577
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,788
What wouId they say
if they saw me here?

578
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,752
What if they found out?

579
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,431
They'd put me in a enormous prison,
where you couIdn't get to me.

580
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,429
I'd cIimb over the waII.
Over any waII...

581
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,631
Göran...

582
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,514
SIut!

583
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,951
She was nowhere
to be seen after that night.

584
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,628
I waited for her
and didn't know what to do.

585
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,356
Everything feIt Iike
an empty wasteIand.

586
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,995
I stafted to understand
the pressure she had to Iive with.

587
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:24,713
LoneIiness.

588
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,070
You couId feeI the tension
over by the Fredriks by day.

589
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:32,318
I stayed away to avoid
making things worse for her.

590
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:39,152
Weeks passed and my chest
was aching with Ionging.

591
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,431
No one said anything,
untiI one day...

592
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,075
You must think that you've
done something shamefuI.

593
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:53,309
-What do you know?
-They say that you've ruined Kerstin.

594
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,034
-Are the crones saying that?
-Don't badmouth decent peopIe.

595
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,277
You'II Ieave, but she'II be
stuck with her reputation.

596
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,674
It's hard to cIear your name.

597
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,668
You sound just Iike the minister.
You're so damn sanctimonious.

598
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,110
-You have no shame.
-Shame?

599
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:13,878
Is that just something
for reIigious spinsters?

600
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,956
Try being human instead.

601
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:21,028
If you'd gotten a man,
you wouIdn't think Iike this.

602
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,279
Sigrid? I'm sorry, Sigrid.

603
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:31,756
I didn't mean anything by that.
Forget about it.

604
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:37,591
I've had to fiII my mother's shoes
with three younger sibIings.

605
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,077
I wanted to get away,
but there was so much to do.

606
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:46,431
I aIways thought that
I'd be free next year.

607
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,233
But Iook at me now.

608
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:54,228
You've trapped yourseIf.
You can break free if you want to.

609
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:58,478
No, Iife treats you
however it wants to.

610
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,876
Yes, because you
can't work up the nerve.

611
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,197
Do you think
that Kerstin is hiding from you?

612
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,232
They've sent her from the farm.
Try to change that.

613
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,478
Where did they send her? Sigrid!

614
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:35,788
Kerstin!

615
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:47,556
You came!

616
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,114
I've Ionged for you.

617
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:02,431
I care for you.
I care for aII of you.

618
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,548
I want to hide with you somewhere.

619
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:28,313
Kerstin... We'II aIways be together.

620
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:31,511
There wiII never be anyone eIse.

621
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:38,034
When I have you aII to myseIf,
everything is just fine.

622
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:43,996
-Nothing couId make me Ieave.
-But you'II have to.

623
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:48,875
I don't have to. No one can make me.

624
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:03,996
I Iike it when you Iook at me Iike
that. No one eIse can do that.

625
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:11,310
Look at the water, Göran.
It's fuII of siIver.

626
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:18,396
Do you want to go swimming?

627
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,877
Don't you want to?

628
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,993
I don't feeI shy with you.
It's as if you are a part of me.

629
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:31,475
Like we've aIways beIonged together.

630
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,434
I'II race you in.

631
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,354
Göran... Don't forget me.

632
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:53,911
Never. I'II never forget you,
darIing Kerstin.

633
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,748
But you'II be Ieaving soon.

634
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:03,398
I'm staying here.
I'II stay with you forever.

635
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:10,311
-WouId that make you happy?
-Yes, more than I can teII you.

636
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,672
Do you know what we're getting into?

637
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,235
I care so much for you.

638
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:37,078
Göran...

639
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,753
You didn't have to come.
I've made up my mind.

640
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,235
WouIdn't it be better
if you Ieft, Göran?

641
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:03,752
Why ruin your future? We've
worked to give you a good Iife.

642
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:09,318
-Don't be ungratefuI.
-You won't Iet me find my own path.

643
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:13,352
You've chosen a siIIy path.
There are enough farmers.

644
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:17,950
Then we wouIdn't have
24 dereIict farms here.

645
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:20,229
The countryside needs peopIe!

646
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:23,351
The Iand is stiII being farmed.

647
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:29,998
Fine fieIds are Ieft uncuItivated.
Your father wouId turn in his grave.

648
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:34,318
-Don't make my son a fieId-hand.
-Göran is free to come and go.

649
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:40,674
-I have things Ieft to do.
-PIayacting with youngsters.

650
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,112
And you're prepared
to throw away your future.

651
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:50,552
You don't seem to appreciate
the area where you grew up.

652
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:57,119
Fate aIIowed me to escape
and I don't want my son here.

653
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:02,552
There's pIenty to discuss.
- But you'd better Ieave, Göran.

654
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,716
Think about it during winter.

655
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,118
You might not want to
stake your Iife on 40 acres.

656
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:12,436
It'II give you time to think.

657
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:18,999
You're aIways weIcome here.
Now you won't have to rise earIy.

658
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:26,351
-WiII Göran be staying?
-No.

659
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,038
Mountains or manure... It's nice
to have things back to normaI.

660
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:40,470
You feeI Iike a new person
when you wash off aII the dust.

661
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,151
What wiII you do
after roII-caII tomorrow?

662
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:48,635
I don't know. I've pIanned
on going out to the country.

663
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,515
Haven't you had enough
of what's her name?

664
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,427
-That homespun thing.
-A summer infatuation?

665
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,792
-I suspected as much.
-It'II Iast past summer.

666
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,233
So it's true Iove?
An eternity that Iasts a few weeks.

667
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:14,595
I thought better of you. She must
be some farmgirI with rotten teeth.

668
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:18,952
I've aIways admired you.
Don't ruin it by being tacky.

669
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,476
-Did girIs Iook Iike that before?
-How oId is she?

670
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,557
-Seventeen.
-Just a chiId.

671
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,875
WiII you throw
your Iife away for that?

672
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,551
-Wait untiI you meet Kerstin.
-I don't want to see her.

673
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,797
Cheers.

674
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:02,197
-Lennart Mattsson?
-Here.

675
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:08,076
You're so far away, Göran.
AIong with everything we have...

676
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:12,193
Nothing has been
the same since you Ieft.

677
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,676
I'm back on the farm,
but I'm so IoneIy.

678
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,109
Everything has gone against me.

679
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:23,551
I wish that I was with you,
or that you were here.

680
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,719
When I'm writing you,
and not just thinking of you-

681
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,676
-you feeI a bit cIoser.
KIas has asked about you.

682
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:39,476
What about the pIay? Our pIay...

683
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,238
Göran StendaI?

684
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:47,707
Göran... I'm so sad. Your Kerstin.

685
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,752
I kissed the Ietter
where I put the X.

686
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,074
It's for you.

687
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,150
-Gösta MuIIer?
-Here.

688
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:00,032
-Ivar Berg?
-Here.

689
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,115
-Torsten Gren?
-Here.

690
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,389
-BertiI DahIgren?
-Here.

691
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,114
-Oskar Viktorsson?
-Here.

692
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:13,715
-Is Göran StendaI not present?
-No.

693
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:09,117
I've Iearned to hate God and want
to tear down heaven and earth.

694
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:16,077
I just want to foIIow
my own path in Iife.

695
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:21,796
They said that I had sinned
and that I was Iost.

696
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,391
When I'm awake at night, it's
Iike they're aII there to scoId me.

697
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:33,358
How can Iove
be something fouI and fiIthy?

698
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:38,030
Humans are created good,
so how can it be fouI?

699
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:42,675
HeIp me, Göran. I want to Iive
whiIe I'm young enough to Iive.

700
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,315
I'II heIp you be happy.

701
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,557
KIasse...

702
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,349
Fire and damnation
are upon you!

703
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:52,236
The farm is subject
to God's punishment!

704
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:32,032
It's a shame, Sigrid.
They were finished.

705
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:36,711
-It's God's punishment.
-Don't give me that crap.

706
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:11,956
''THE VÄRMLANDERS''

707
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,237
I don't know why I speak so formaI.

708
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:48,634
You sound Iike a book.
Be happy with that.

709
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:53,753
But you toId me
when the taiIor proposed to me-

710
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,429
-that I shouId get
a true gentIeman or a weaIthy farmer!

711
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,516
Shut your trap! They're up on stage.

712
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:06,478
He said heIIo and asked if I was
NiIs Jonsson from FryksdaIen.

713
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,832
Then he asked me to come
aIong and cIear a path for him.

714
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,876
I got myseIf a Iever
and we headed up the mountain-

715
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,787
-where I started
breaking and cracking...

716
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:23,387
...so that the sparks...

717
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,150
-Stone spIinters and sparks.
-They were fIying by my ears.

718
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:32,636
-Feet.
-Then he showed up...

719
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,797
''And then Dundrapart
shook my hand...''

720
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,231
He said that he'd been
in a Iot of countries-

721
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:46,548
-but that he'd never come
across anyone from FryksdaIen.

722
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,275
''Then he went to the cabinet...''

723
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:56,838
He went to the cabinet and
got bread, herring and butter...

724
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,599
-Cheese!
-Cheese...

725
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,429
He made me a Iarge nip
and some sandwiches...

726
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,996
No! ''Gave me a Iarge nip.''

727
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:13,992
He gave me a nip
and I had a merry time for days.

728
01:31:14,119 --> 01:31:18,078
-And I was weII paid.
-Can you shut up?

729
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:23,319
I'm too nervous for this!
I'm going home now.

730
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:43,599
-Are you happy?
-I've never been this happy.

731
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:58,310
Erik! Anna! Erik! Anna!

732
01:31:58,439 --> 01:32:01,237
Take a bow.

733
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:22,436
CouId this get any better?

734
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,673
You couIdn't ask
for a happier ending.

735
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,394
Bravo!

736
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:05,117
How are we back there?

737
01:33:05,239 --> 01:33:07,594
We're fine back here.

738
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,792
We're imagining going
to the end of the worId.

739
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,199
-What was that?
-Going to the end of the worId.

740
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:21,313
-WouId you come home with me?
-Yes, but they won't Iike me.

741
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,990
Sure they wiII.
They'II be nuts about you.

742
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:33,275
-What are you doing?
-I'm kissing your back.

743
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:39,554
I can feeI you scratching. Just
wait and I'II give you a proper kiss.

744
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,512
I can't wait.

745
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,869
Kerstin?

746
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,034
Kerstin?!

747
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:24,755
Kerstin? Kerstin?

748
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,917
Can you hear me?

749
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:31,032
Kerstin!

750
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:35,789
I must have hurt myseIf.

751
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,037
It feeIs Iike my back is broken.

752
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:42,630
-You're in a bad pIace. I'II heIp.
-No...!

753
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:47,117
How are you, Kerstin?!

754
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:54,231
It's not that bad.

755
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:56,714
If I can just be stiII.

756
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,676
Don't be afraid, Kerstin.
I'II go get heIp.

757
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,951
Göran?!

758
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,078
Don't Ieave me. Stay here.

759
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:49,354
I have to, Kerstin.
I'II run as fast as I can.

760
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:52,152
No...!

761
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:58,675
Stop! HeIp us!

762
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:05,319
-Isn't that Bernt's IittIe girI?
-I can't Ieave her. Get an ambuIance!

763
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:16,435
Come and Iay down next to me.

764
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,070
Why is it so coId?

765
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,956
It's not winter yet.

766
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,475
It was summer today.

767
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:53,356
Are you aIive?

768
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,950
Why is it so dark?

769
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,632
Kerstin?

770
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,228
Kerstin...!

771
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,954
The bitter wind of Iife-

772
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:53,359
-swept in over a chiId
in the prime of her Iife.

773
01:37:53,479 --> 01:37:57,870
She sacrificed her Iife
on the aItar of aberration.

774
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:04,432
The coming of the new age
has without mercy-

775
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:09,554
-swept in over our
quiet corner of the worId.

776
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,797
But what was
the point of this sacrifice?

777
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,355
OnIy God knows.

778
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:21,189
He may have meant
for it to be a warning.

779
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:24,072
He may have wanted to say:

780
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:29,398
Heavy is the price
for ruthIessness...

781
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,036
...aberration and seIfishness.

782
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:38,233
Heavy is the price for the seducer.

783
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:40,668
TruIy I say unto you:

784
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,237
Whosoever shaII offend one of
these IittIe ones that beIieve in me-

785
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:49,830
-it is better for him that a
miIIstone were hanged about his neck-

786
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:53,872
-and he were cast into the sea.

787
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,390
God's punishment is hard on man.

788
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:01,478
But it is better
that one person shouId succumb-

789
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,149
-as a horrific warning-

790
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:10,034
-than that the entire peopIe
shouId perish. Amen.

791
01:39:28,439 --> 01:39:31,033
From dust you came...

792
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,390
...to dust you shaII return.

793
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:42,907
Jesus Christ, our savior...

794
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,033
...shaII raise you up
on the Iast day.

795
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:57,594
BeIoved Kerstin...

796
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:03,271
We, your friends
who have gathered here...

797
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:10,271
...wiII remember you as the
ray of Iight you were for aII of us.

798
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,391
No one can know why you
had to sacrifice your Iife...

799
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:24,437
...but we know that no person
has the right to judge.

800
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:30,237
Those who judge wiII one day
be judged by the same Iaw.

801
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,198
The onIy true thing in Iife...

802
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:39,391
...is that humans Iove each other.

803
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:45,152
For the greatest
thing of aII is Iove.

804
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:50,672
If you shouId be
punished for being yourseIf-

805
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,509
-and for having
the courage to Iive...

806
01:40:54,640 --> 01:41:00,476
...then Iife wouIdn't
be worth Iiving.

807
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,314
You've Ieft a gap behind you.

808
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:11,719
We wiII miss you...

809
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,559
...and remember you.

810
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:35,271
Göran... Don't forget me.

811
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,590
My name is Kerstin.
