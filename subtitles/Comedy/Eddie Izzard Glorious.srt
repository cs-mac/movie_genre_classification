6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Hyeong Woo!

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,850
Wake up! Pull yourself together, Hyeong Woo!

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,850
Hyeong Woo, wake up! Please open your eyes, Hyeong Woo.

9
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,340
Hyeong Woo...

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,280
Save us!

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,770
<i>Is anyone there?!</i>

12
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,470
Please help us!

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,490
Hey, Beom Soo. Wake up.

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,210
What is it?

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,870
Haven't you seen your older sister?

16
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,290
I came back in the middle of the night so how could I see her? She should be sleeping.

17
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,060
I'm saying this because she's not in her room.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,420
You older sister didn't come in yesterday night.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,980
Huh? Really?

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,500
Ah...what is this?

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,140
Is she really falling in love with someone?

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,130
Ah, I guess she woke up early and went out somewhere. You're a heavy sleeper in the early morning.

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,090
Is that it?

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,500
Il Joo.

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,660
I was drunk yesterday.

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,680
But we're a married couple.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,670
It's a given that we should sleep together if we're married.

29
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,050
I'm a man too.

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,240
Did you get-

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,100
My body isn't the only thing that's hurt.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,290
You ripped me to shreds.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,240
Hyeong Woo...are you awake?

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
Can you see me?

35
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,050
You're alive.

36
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,440
I thought you were gone...

37
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,260
Are you fine?

38
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm fine.

39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,720
But...you lost a lot of blood.

40
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,680
What are you doing?

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,820
My phone...

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,670
It's gone.

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
They took our wallet, phones, everything.

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,280
We don't even know where this is.

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
Why are you like this?

46
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,340
Hyeong Woo...

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,110
This is the sea.

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,090
We're heading towards the sea.

49
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,500
What happened?

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,060
Who would do something like this to us?

51
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,350
There's only 1 person who's trying to get rid of me. It's Kang Seok Hyeon.

52
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Why would he try to get rid of you?

53
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,390
Because I also have resentment built up against him.

54
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,470
The code document you saw.

55
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,520
Truthfully...that wasn't my father's slush fund.

56
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,100
It was Kang Seok Hyeon's slush fund.

57
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,900
My father was just someone who took care of it.

58
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,080
I wanted to reveal all of his slush funds to the world

59
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,460
and reveal that my father was innocent.

60
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,470
I lived the past 15 years only thinking of that.

61
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,310
He noticed.

62
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,930
So the reason you got injured last time...

63
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,690
Because of that, you got pulled in.

64
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,890
He must have noticed that

65
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,860
you were the one who saved me.

66
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm sorry, Eun Soo.

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,250
You became like this because of me.

68
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,910
No. It could be because of me, not you.

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Before he fainted, I said something I shouldn't have.

70
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,870
I asked him why he killed my husband.

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,340
What?

72
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,260
When he returned from the hospital, he said he didn't remember the events of that night

73
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,690
but that could have been a lie.

74
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,750
Madam Han, why did you come by yourself today?

75
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,850
Where did your cute son who trails behind Il Joo go to?

76
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,660
It seems he drank with his friends until late at night.

77
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,490
Ah-ha...

78
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,580
Thank you.

79
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,230
Ah, seriously. My eyes hurt that I really can't watch you.

80
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,850
Do you really have to show that you're a newlywed couple in front of a single woman? Like each other when you guys are alone.

81
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,010
Team Leader Go.

82
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,920
Yes?

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,520
Why can't I see that woman?

84
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,330
-Excuse me?<br>-The maid named Shin Eun Soo.

85
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,610
She didn't come to work today so I called her

86
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,810
but she won't pick up her phone.

87
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,050
Hyeong Woo.

88
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,330
Hyeong Woo.

89
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,840
You can't fall asleep, Hyeong Woo.

90
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,090
Pull yourself together. Hyeong Woo.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,130
Eun Soo...

92
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
I want to go back to that time...

93
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,660
under Koo's tree.

94
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,450
There were so many things I wanted to do with you.

95
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,270
I wanted to go on many vacations

96
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,480
and when I left for work,

97
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,850
I wanted to feel your fingers as they tied my tie.

98
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,280
At night, I wanted to lend you my arm as your pillow

99
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,300
and I wanted to talk about things that happened that day.

100
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,330
Why did we become like this?

101
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,460
Hyeong Woo...

102
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm not me.

103
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,070
I've lived like a monster. Not even once...

104
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,720
I've never been comfortable.

105
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,500
Why did I let go of you at that time?

106
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,460
<i>Hyeong Woo.</i>

107
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,210
<i> Hyeong Woo!</i>

108
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,200
I told you can't fall asleep. Wake up, Hyeong Woo.

109
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,790
Hyeong Woo! Is there no one outside?!

110
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,360
<i>Anyone?!</i>

111
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,850
Are you going to the office?

112
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,650
I'll drop you there.

113
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,640
Aide Jin drank a lot yesterday...

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,890
Save us! Save us!

116
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,170
<i>Is there no one outside?!</i>

117
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,990
Save us! Is there no one outside?!

118
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,400
Hyeong Woo.

119
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,190
Hyeong Woo!

120
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,030
I told you can't fall asleep.

121
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,950
Please get it together!

122
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,040
Hyeong Woo! Hyeong Woo!

123
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,370
Hyeong Woo!

124
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,040
Hyeong Woo! Hyeong Woo!

125
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,070
Hyeong Woo!

126
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,640
Aigoo you ate so much.

127
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,020
Mister, balloon.

129
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,620
Are you okay?<br>-Hyeong Woo, the person that was with me.

130
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,110
Where is Jin Hyeong Woo?<br>- Who? Jin Hyeong Woo?

131
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,690
You guys called me, saying that he was hurt.

132
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,000
They made a call to 119 (911).

133
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,360
Ah. They are just now done with surgery and are being moved to a hospital room.

134
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,630
Surgery? Did you say surgery?

135
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,800
Hyeong Woo. What's going on? Hyeong Woo!

136
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,870
How did this happen?

137
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,750
What in the world did you do to Hyeong Woo?

138
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,730
I asked you what happened. Why is he here right now?

139
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,290
I don't... really know either. He was suddenly kidnapped-

140
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,240
What? Kidnapped?

141
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,140
Why were you two together?

142
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,780
Well...

143
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,280
Last night, my daughter called me so I went there but Hyeong Woo was there.

144
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,230
But suddenly some men appeared.

145
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,010
Do you really think that makes sense?

146
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,490
Even if you made up a story, you should've made up a story that makes a sense.

147
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,680
Aunt, just a minute.

148
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,510
Let's talk for a minute.

149
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,430
Eun Soo.

150
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,640
We're friends, right?

151
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,880
Yeah.

152
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,030
If you really think of me as a friend,

153
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,350
tell me the truth.

154
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,960
I'm telling you the truth. What I told Madam is everything.

155
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,490
You know that's not everything.

156
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,150
You lied to me the last time too.

157
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,780
Hyeong Woo slept at

158
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,360
your house all night then left.

159
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,850
People really don't change.

160
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,220
Just like when we were young, you are still backstabbing me.

161
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,180
I wanted to at least stay friends with you.

162
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,190
So even if I gave you two chances,

163
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,990
you still lied to me.

164
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,510
Il Joo. <br>-I will give you one more chance.

165
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,950
Hyeong Woo...

166
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,880
Why did he sleep at your house?

167
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,660
I got off work and on the way home I found him fainted.

168
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,820
He was really hurt. <br>-Hurt?

169
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,010
Then you should have taken him to the hospital or his home. Why did you take him your home?

170
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm sorry. I can't say anymore.

171
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,060
What did you say? <br>-This isn't because I don't think of you as a friend.

172
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,810
You should ask him yourself.

173
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,790
If you really love Hyeong Woo.

174
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,290
You should protect Hyeong Woo.

175
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,180
Then we...

176
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,330
are no longer friends.

177
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,710
From now on, I don't owe you anything in mind.

178
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,910
With this,

179
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,070
let's end our childhood relationship here.

180
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,880
Why has she turned off her phone?

181
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,950
Does she really have a guy so she doesn't care for her mom or child?

182
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,120
Um... they are many dishes piling up in the kitchen. What are you doing here?

183
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,230
I'm going!

184
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,140
Did an accident happen or something?

185
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,420
Do I have to report this to the police?

186
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,320
No, w-why? Did something happen to Eun Soo?

187
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
This rascal didn't come home yesterday night

188
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
and she hasn't even called me yet.

189
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,300
She spent the night out? Eun Soo did?

190
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,300
That punk...

191
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,800
That punk?

192
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,920
Hyeong Woo, are you awake?

193
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
If you're looking for Eun Soo, she already left.

194
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,180
How did this happen? Exactly how did you get injured like this?

195
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,520
Why am I here?

196
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Who rescued me?

197
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,680
That's what I want to ask.

198
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,140
What does it mean that you were kidnapped?

199
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,740
We received a call from the hospital. Someone rescued you

200
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,700
and then they disappeared after leaving my contact information behind.

201
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,040
It's someone who knows your contact information?

202
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,800
They say he came together with the ambulance. After checking,

203
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,960
it said you went to Samcheok, why did you go there?

204
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,220
You installed a tracking device on her?

205
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,740
Yes.

206
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,580
If she's someone who can dig through your study,

207
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,470
I thought we shouldn't underestimate her rear.

208
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,370
Thanks to the tracking device on her shoe, we found that she fell into the ocean.

209
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,850
Who did something like that?

210
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,510
Is it that this woman became useless now?

211
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,310
Or...have they realized that we're suspecting this woman?

212
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,230
We're checking the CCTV of where Aide Jin's car was.

213
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,370
Father says that I need 2 wings to become

214
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,410
the President.

215
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,050
Jin Hyeong Woo wing for the brain and my husband wing for the public opinions.

216
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,790
But I'm

217
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,510
going to clip one of those wings.

218
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,950
Even though it'll take a long time with 1 wing,

219
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,670
even if I get tired because I'm powerless,

220
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,350
I want to try flying with just 1 wing.

221
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,470

222
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,370
By any chance, you...

223
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,350
Yes. I'm going to get a divorce.

224
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,330
I'm not going to live in misery behind a mask.

225
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,130
Have you still not understood the Prime Minister's words?

226
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,650
This is something with your life and my life on the line.

227
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,090
It's a relief that it's not only your life.

228
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,810
If it's together with you, I'll go until the ends of hell.

229
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,010
Was the Kang Il Joo I knew only this much?

230
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,870
All of the humiliation and insults you received from that family,

231
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,230
you're going to forget all of that?

232
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,310
Then exactly why did you dream of the President in the first place?

233
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,090
I can abandon everything.

234
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,070
But did you want the President Kang Il Joo,

235
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,730
not the woman Kang Il Joo?

236
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,070
Even if I wasn't Kang Seok Hyeon's daughter and just Baek Sang Yi,

237
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,290
would you still have protected me?

238
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,230
Exactly where were you yesterday?

239
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,570
When I so desperately wanted you yesterday, where were you?

240
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,550
Are you sure we're going down the same path?

241
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,630
Is it, Hyeong Woo?

242

Oh? What's wrong with how you look?

247

What about Mi Rae?

248
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,290
What do you think she would be doing at this time? She's sleeping.

249
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,190
Why didn't you pick up your phone?!

250

Were you really together with a man?

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,170
No.

Don't try to just pass by it and tell me for certain.

Yeah. But why are you outside at this time?

My mom is sick. She has a really high fever too.

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,430
You got attacked when you were with a maid?

326
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,880
Why did you meet that woman?

327
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,520
You know well exactly who that woman is.

328
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,960
Before, it was a person who was involved in my Father's incident.

329
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,540
It was uncomfortable to see her in your house, so

330
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,310
I met her to tell her to leave.

331
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,940
Why are you so concerned over matters in the past?

332
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,900
It is not your job to decide whether to hire or not.

333
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,150
Don't value your life so lightly.

334
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,640
From now on, there are many things to do.

335
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,860
If it wasn't for General Manager Jo, then you would be dead right now.

336
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,840
Are you saying General Manager Jo saved me?

337
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,640
Yes.

338
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,570
Then do you know who made me like this by any chance?

339
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,280
I'm looking into it. I'll let you know when I find out.

340
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,260
How do you manage the workers so she could be absent without a notice?

341
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,520
Isn't it necessary to let a person be in this house who was irresponsibly absent without a notice and late for work?

342
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,860
I'm sorry.

343
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,440
I didn't speak to you. How dare you butt in when we have systematic orders here?

344
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,550
Are you saying 'systematic orders'?

345
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,240
System, system that prevents from being creative world!

346
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,900
Hey. Because of people like you,

347
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,650
the sentimentality is getting dry out.

348
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,940
Everybody! Life is to relax,

349
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,190
love is borderless, and idea is beyond age.

350
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,500
Oh my, things like that are coming from my mouth.

351
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,890
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.

352
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,320
Everyone, listen up. This one's mine.

353
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,240
If you mess with her, then it's the same as messing with me.

354
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,650
Be warned.

355
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,330
Let's go, my love!!

356
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,650
Go, go, my love!

357
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,910
You! Where is the anthology? Are you sure to throw it away?

358
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,040
No.

359
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,640
I told you to throw it away.

360
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,130
I like that anthology.

361
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,240
I'm sorry, but I can't throw it away.

362
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,090
Really? You're pretty faithful.

363
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,930
Man is strength, and of course woman is faithfulness.

364
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,690
Do you carry the bag I gave you?

365
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,660
Ah that,

366
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,470
Perhaps, did you sell it?

367
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,940
No... It was pickpocketed.

368
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,930
Oh my god!

369
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,930
Was that fantastic bag pickpocketed?

370
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,950
That is your fault that you used the public transportation!

371
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,090
I'm sorry.

372
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,940
You know your wrongdoings,

373
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,100
so you are my slave this afternoon.

374
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,350

375
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
Eun Soo.

376
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,130
Let's have a talk.

377
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:23,690
Why did I not know that when weeds and flowers are together, they can be pretty?

378
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,870
Isn't that's how the mother's feel?

379
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,390
You're raising a kid, so you would know.

380
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,050
Mom's selfish that she wants to raise her own child the best.

381
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:47,610
It's certain to over-affectionate toward her own child when a child is raised by herself.

382
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:53,330
That's why I seem going through fire and water for Hyeong Woo's sake.

383
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,260
And I treated you more harshly.

384
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,870
I hope you understand the motherhood that is growing more venomous.

385
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,100
When we see each other very often like this, let's not hold grudges.

386
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,700
Your clothes are thin, you'll catch a cold.

387
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,090
After your husband left you like that, you raised your daughter by yourself right?

388
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,460
Yes.

389
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,720
Now,

390
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,320
I am seeing you as me of 15 years ago.

391
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,580
Are you okay?

392
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,910
Thank you.

393
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,650
Prime Minister, I found it.

394
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,340
A truck that contains the container was caught in CCTV on the highway to Samcheok.

395
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,440
We caught the driver and are inquiring him right now.

396
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes. Did you find out who it was?

397
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,880
Who is it?

398
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,240
I don't have a good appetite these days so I invite you at my regular restaurant .

399
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,410
It's your first time here, right?

400
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,930
Yes, father.

401
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,040
Is something wrong with you and Il Joo these days?

402
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,290
No.

403
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,930
Then why did you try to kill Jin Hyeong Woo?

404
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,330
What are you talking about?

405
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:17,300
The people you hired, told me already

406
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,640
It doesn't look good that you deny it.

407
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,840
I don't know what you've heard about Il Joo and Jin Hyeong Woo's past, but

408
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,730
It's all in the past and something I've taken care of.

409
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,850
Il Joo won't be getting tangled in those matter, I'll give you my word.

410
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,270
You, seriously...

411
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,470
You stay still.

412
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,440
Jin Hyeong Woo is a family member that I really need.

413
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,100
From now on, if anything happens to Jin Hyeong Woo, then be prepared to have a divorce.

414
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,020
You do the most you can for your husband as well.

415
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,980
You have to make sure that your husband can trust and love you.

416
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,060
Let's eat.

417
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,320
A person's mind is such a scary thing.

418
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,080
Did you hear about Aide Jin and me from my brother?

419
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,320
Yes.

420
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,500
Is that why you trampled on me like that, last night?

421
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,030
You tried to kill Aide Jin, and...

422
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,170
Il Joo, that...

423
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,630
Everyone has painful past,

424
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,150
I was about to marry with love,

425
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,170
but I failed.

426
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,850
Don't you have those kind of past?

427
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,130
I knew you as a gentleman.

428
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,390
There was hurtful things, but your respecting and understanding heart for me.

429
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,250
I was in the process of opening my heart to you.

430
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,070
But now,

431
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,730
I despise you and my skin trembles.

432
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,910
How could you try to kill a person,

433
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,430
and rape a person? What are you?

434
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,190
I'm sorry.

435
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,050
I,

436
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,610
I wanted you, Il Joo, to love only me.

437
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,310
As precious as you are, I shouldn't have broken you.

438
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,510
I, I must have been crazy.

439
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,990
It's right that you're crazy.

440
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,690
Please get mental counseling first.

441
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,290
Don't place your hand on my body.

442
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,330
For what we should do from now on,

443
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,970
Let's think a bit more and decide.

444
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,950
The night you went to Eun Soo's house, I heard you got hurt.

445
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,630
Why didn't you tell that to me?

446
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,350
Did Eun Soo tell you?

447
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,030
Why did you go to her house and hide there?

448
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,970
I thought Prime Minister was trying to get rid of me.

449
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,150
The warning to break up with you,

450
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,250
he did something again because I didn't listen.

451
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,750
So I couldn't go to the hospital either.

452
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,130
I couldn't go home either.

453
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,290
And with me going to Team Manager Kang as well,

454
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,810
because of that.

455
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,270
You dummy.

456
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,270
That's not my father's work.

457
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,350
My husband did it.

458
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,630
After finding out that you and I were going to get married,

459
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:48,410
my husband did that.

460
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,250
This one too.

461
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,310
Because of me, you almost died so many times.

462
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,170
Because of me.

463
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,160

464
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,390
No, no, no. That's not my style, put it away.

465
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,320
OK, that one is good.

466
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,540
Miss, that dress is worth ₩ 3,000,000-

467
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,540
Hey, don't determine the value of beauty through money.

468
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,180
If you're going to buy me clothes, you can buy me clothes from somewhere else.

469
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,020
You must be mistaken or something, I'm not buying these clothes because I like you.

470
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,860
Ah, really. If I treat well, you surely try to presume on me.

471
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,380
No, I was just sorry to Ahgassi.

472
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,340
You're sorry to me, right?

473
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:02,120
Good. Then, from now, you're going to try on the clothes that I like for three hours.

474
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,860
Go, go, go!

475
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,060
Since she is well proportioned, try new clothes on her.

476
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,960
Now, hurry up. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

477
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,160
Hello?

478
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,700
<i>Did you find where the book is?</i>

479
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,920
<i>I couldn't ask because I don't know what that book is about.</i>

480
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,800
<i> They are calling that book a coordinate book.</i>

481
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,420
<i>A coordinate book...they call it that?</i>

482
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,300
<i>Before Kang Seok Hyeon's condition gets any worse, hurry up and find that book.</i>

483
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,420
<i>We don't have much time left.</i>

484
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,020
What do you mean?

485
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,580
<i>The longer you hesitate,</i>

486
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,030
<i>That your child may be in danger.</i>

487
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,850
This looks good on you.

488
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,530
You looked cheap but now you look good when you wear this. You are beautiful.

489
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,570
- She isn't as good as you, Ahgassi.<br>-Hey!

490
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,010
How could you compare me and her?

491
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,070
-No, that's not what I'm say- <br> -I don't want to hear what you want to say.

492
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,810
This. That. That. Pack those for me.

493
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,890
Next round, go!!

494
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,030
Let me see...

495
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,010
<i> These seem kind of old, right?</i>

496
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,530
What is it? You like these?

497
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,630
No.

498
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,090
Yeah, why don't you get some glasses?

499
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,910
You need to look like intelligent.

500
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,370
Originally, the intelligence belongs to be. I am intelligence itself.

501
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,130
Well. Show me the new ones.

502
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,370
Excuse me.

503
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,630
<i>Jin Hyeong Woo: Come to the hospital.</i>

504
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,340
Eun Soo.

505
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,460
So it was Il Joo husband's doing?

506
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,920
Yes, thankfully our suspicion was wrong.

507
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,830
Kang Seok Hyeon isn't the culprit.

508
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,770
But still you've to be careful.

509
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,190
For now, just pretend to follow the orders the man over the phone is giving you.

510
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,170
I'm looking into it.

511
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,280
Don't approach Kang Seok Hyeon recklessly either.

512
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,700
Il Joo's husband,

513
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,650
does he know about you and Il Joo getting married?

514
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,940
You must've heard from Il Joo.

515
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,040
You aren't in any position to worry about me.

516
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,840
You know how much Il Joo loves you.

517
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,900
It's not right to worry about other things and to hurt Il Joo.

518
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,540
She got married with a man whom she doesn't like to save your life.

519
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,330
I don't think it's right for you to be worrying about me.

520
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,280
I'll handle my own problem.

521
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,830
Don't worry about me.

522
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,220
That's why I told you to leave that house!

523
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,810
How many times have I told you to disappear, so I don't have to worry about you?

524
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,040
You've made me this concerned.

525
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,400
How could you ask me to not worry now?

526
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,370
I'm sorry. Just,

527
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,020
think of me as a person that's not there, and ignore me.

528
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,360
I'm so mad, really! What kind of world has a crazy person like that?

529
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,760
Now, she treat me beneath a maid ahjumma.

530
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,560
Did I study in a secretary major to be treated like this way?

531
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,080
Honey, still if you please that idiot on your side well,

532
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,520
you will receive something.

533
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,040
The crazy bastard on my side uses fists whenever he gets angry.

534
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,280
Aigoo. Since such a person was born with silverware, he can be an assemblyman and a president of foundation.

535
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,730
Looking at that, hey, it's Korea!

536
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:21,060
I guess you have a lot of stress too.

537
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,160
Still I've to endure it.

538
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,210
Even though it's dirty and cheap, there isn't a job as good as this one.

539
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:31,510
I'm sorry. I only whined without thinking of you at all.

540
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,810
Today, I'll get rid of your stress.

541
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,780
What are you doing? Why aren't you wiping it? It'll leave a stain on my clothes.

542
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,680
I'm sorry.

543
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,620
Hey, how can you ask your classmate to do it?

544
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,320
Your class is dropping.

545
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,870
Even if they were in the same class in high school,

546
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:13,140
their status is different when they come out into the society. She has no choice.

547
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,790
Hey, since when was your status high?

548
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,620
I've only been classmates with this woman for a month.

549
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,040
Also, being classmate and friend is different.

550
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,760
Father, why aren't you eating?

551
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,630
<i>They call it the coordinate book.</i>

552
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,270
<i> Coordinate book? They call it that?</i>

553
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:52,320
<i>Before Kang Seok Hyeon's situation gets worse, find that book.</i>

554
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,650
<i>We don't have much time left.</i>

555
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,850
<i>What does that mean?</i>

556
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:01,940
<i>It means that the longer you take, the more danger your child is in.</i>

557
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,200
How is it?

558
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,890
The voice was changed not to reveal it's characteristics.

559
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,410
Each voice has its own characteristics like the fingerprints.

560
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,730
Can you check the voice before it was changed?

561
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,780
It's possible with a vocal analysis, but it'll take some time.

562
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,160
I'm hungry, will you make me some ramen?

563
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,560
Not bibimbap?

564
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,570
No, I'm thinking ramen.

565
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,570
Yes, I understand.

566
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,910
Cheong Mi.

567
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:40,630
<i>From now on, we might have to only eat ramen.</i>

568
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,790
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

569
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,170
<i>I left my house today.</i>

570
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,270
<i>With this bag.</i>

571
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,390
<i>Assemblyman.</i>

572
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,950
<i>Don't call me that from now on.</i>

573
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,670
<i> Tomorrow, I will retire from the assembly position.</i>

574
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,020
<i>It's my last time being in this office.</i>

575
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,020
<i> I will throw away all of what father-in-law gave to me.</i>

576
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,280
<i> I will start a new life with you. </i>

577
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,770
<i>Go back to your house right now.</i>

578
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,560
<i> Cheong Mi. </i>

579
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,980
<i>This is the path into a pit of fire.</i>

580
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,210
<i>Who am I to block you from reaching your destination?</i>

581
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,360
<i>You're not blocking my path,</i>

582
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,940
<i>we're just going in a new path together.</i>

583
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,130
<i>If Minister or your wife finds out this,</i>

584
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,080
<i>we'll die together.</i>

585
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,730
It doesn't matter, you know it.

586
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,960
How sick of this life I feel!

587
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:43,690
Politicians who grabbed the power after slaughtering people! My job is to extort money from business and fill their stomach with it.

588
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,310
Don't you think I studied so hard to do this?

589
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,960
Not anymore, even if I've to die.

590
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:55,230
<i>I can't survive any longer under these people.</i>

591
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,600
<i>Don't worry.</i>

592
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,760
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

593
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,810
<i>No.</i>

594
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:06,560
<i>Assemblyman have other things to protect than me.</i>

595
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,330
<i>Assemblyman, you just go your way.</i>

596
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,450
Why are you doing like this to me, Cheong Mi?

597
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:23,150
I said I don't need anything else.

598
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,790
You,

599
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,110
Can you live without me?

600
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,850
Answer me.

601
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,550
Can you live without me?

602
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,100
No.

603
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,660
I don't think I would be able to live, either.

604
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,730
That's right.

605
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:15,460
But, I have something I want to ask.

606
00:57:54,990 --> 00:58:01,380
Love is stronger than fear of death.

607
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,720
Why are you all like this?

608
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,750
Shin Eun Soo.

609
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,800
Last night, what did you speak to my father about?

610
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,480
Excuse me?

611
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,130
For what reason did you wear scarf and even glasses, and approach my Father?

612
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,940
Why are you being like this?

613
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,540
I bought her the glasses. Why did you gather all these people for that reason?

614
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,590
Disguising as my Mother,

615
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,190
I'm saying this because she approached Father.

616
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:54,890
Omo. Isn't this woman trying to confuse Father's mind,

617
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:59,460
and take money? She is an ex-convict.

618
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,860
No, it's not like that.

619
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,120
Ahjumma. Give me your bank book.

620
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,900
I don't carry that around.

621
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,460
Then, it would be with phone banking. Try calling the bank.

622
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,890
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

623
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,220
Because I watched something.

624
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,440
Where is it?

625
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,360
In the bank.

626
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,860
Can't you give it to me?

627
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,340
Why do you need it?

628
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,530
I'm Cheong Mi.

629
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,920
Are we not in the type of relationship to share secrets?

630
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,540
Did I see and hear wrong?

631
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,750
With what intent did you approach my father?

632
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:57,030
What are you doing? I told you to call the bank.

633
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,110
<i>To check the deposit, press 1...</i>

634
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,320
Honey, put it on speakerphone.

01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,740
<i> Because of you I could get divorced. </i>

641
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:50,090
<i>If I become like that, then be prepared as I won't leave you alone.</i>

642
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,800
<i> The moment I let go of your hand...</i>

643
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,520
<i>If I didn't that time, you wouldn't be like this right now.</i>

644
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,530
<i>Will I be able to hold your hand again?</i>
