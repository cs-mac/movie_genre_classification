1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
He's a civil servant.
He works for the Government.

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,000
You're not taking my kids.

3
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:08,525
Hope never dies!

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,760
We go get Al and the others,
we head for the coast.

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,080
I close my eyes and I see...
What?

6
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,360
.. what might happen.

7
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:15,800
I wish that...

8
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,320
What?

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,080
Who we were before,
all the things we did...

10
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:25,400
All that matters...
is who we are now.

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you think they're OK in the back?

12
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:25,720
Yeah.

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,960
What do you think they're doing?

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,160
They're... probably talking.

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Hmm. We could've stopped.

16
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,400
Speak for yourself.

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,205
I meant the truck.

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,480
Well, they'd get a big surprise.

19
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,525
Not that big.

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
Excuse me?

21
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,440
They've guessed.

22
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,240
No way.

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
Trust me.

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,800
Our secret is safe.

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
Come on.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,205
Is she OK?

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,420
Yeah. We stopped to help.

28
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:33,565
What about the driver?

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,480
He's all right. He's alive.

30
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,600
We'll look after him.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
You OK?

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,445
Let her go.

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
Poke your nose in?

34
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,485
Yeah? Yeah?

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,280
Get down! On your knees!

36
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,400
On your knees!

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,240
Hands on your head!

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
What have you got?

39
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,897
Keep hold of her.

40
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,520
Let me check it out.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,720
What are you looking at?

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,360
Hey, come and see this!

43
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,160
What is it?

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,165
Argh!

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Len? Lenny?!

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
Get in there.

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,940
What's in there? Huh?

48
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,160
Give me your knife.

49
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
What's going on?

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,800
Argh!

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
Are you all right?

52
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,880
Are you OK?

53
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,880
They drove us off the road.
We were going back home.

54
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:22,205
Home? The valley...

55
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,845
That's where we live now.

56
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
There are 16 of us
and we're working the land.

57
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,760
How far is it?
About 20 miles.

58
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,400
OK. We'll take you home.

59
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,885
Come on.

60
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,080
Come on, let's go.

61
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,240
Do all four tyres.

62
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,400
Stop 'em going anywhere.

63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,960
It's just about two miles
down the road.

64
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,645
Well, we said we'd take you.

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,800
You've got an injured man. We
should leave the lorry here, though.

66
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,605
We don't want to mark the turning.

67
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,600
It's OK. I'll drive it on a bit. There's
barely a mile of fuel in there, anyway.

68
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,680
Come on.

69
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,520
We, er... We don't have
vehicles in the valley.

70
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
I'll go back for the others.
Hmm.

71
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,000
This is where we live.

72
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,325
Pinch me.

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Did we have an accident? Cos I think
I have died and gone to heaven.

74
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,205
Come on.

75
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,760
It's so beautiful.

76
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,920
Judy!

77
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,205
Hey, Clare.

78
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,760
You go for seeds
and come back with eight people.

79
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,485
You all right, Mark? I'm fine.

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,640
I had to put in a couple of
stitches. You should take it easy.

81
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,005
We were attacked.
We weren't followed.

82
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,080
These people,
they've saved our lives.

83
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:19,285
Thank you.

84
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,600
Do you keep any weapons here?
What for?

85
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,845
To defend yourselves.
We don't need to.

86
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,140
No-one's going to invade.
No-one can find us.

87
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,400
We did. Oh, don't worry.
We're not invading you.

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,885
You must stay a bit, though, eh?
Stay the night.

89
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah, there's plenty of room
and we're having a party later.

90
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,317
Really? Six months together.

91
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:39,045
That'll be great, thanks.

92
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,000
Please celebrate with us. It's
the least we can do. Follow me.

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,760
She sews. Can she cook, too?

94
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,400
The perfect woman.

95
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,525
We're heading for the coast.

96
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,300
Some wine?
No, thanks... Yeah, settle down.

97
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:03,040
Like you've done here.
Make a new start.

98
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,565
Thank you.

99
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,480
I hope you're not going to
run out of wine.

100
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
How much are you going to drink?

101
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,605
I didn't mean tonight.

102
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,240
No. We will run out of this stuff,
but we're making our own now.

103
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,925
We don't want to have to forage.

104
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,045
Well, you saw what happened
out there today.

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
Hey, there's a girl here
that's about your age. Where's Izzy?

106
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,525
Oh, Izzy? That sounds nice.

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,765
Oh, they've got a cold up there,
early night.

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Just cos you're in love doesn't mean
everyone else has to be!

109
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,880
Do you want to say something?
No, you can.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,685
Er, I...

111
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Me and, um... Sarah are...

112
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,245
We know, we know.

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,360
We're very, very happy for you.

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,400
Al and Sarah.

115
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,125
Cheers.

116
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,680
It's the closest we're going to get
to a wedding.

117
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,320
Listen, I was thinking,
before we make this new start,

118
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,960
I'd like to go home... one more time.

119
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:20,845
Well, you can.

120
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,045
It would take a day.

121
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,880
Well, what's a day?
Everyone seems very happy here.

122
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah.

123
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,760
So, yeah, it'd be good.

124
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,805
Good. I'll go with you.

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,560
In case I get lost, yeah? Yeah.

126
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,525
Come on!

127
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,680
# All those people

128
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,765
# Gathered round

129
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,760
# Flocked to view that lovely sight

130
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:55,005
# All the maidens came to town

131
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,260
# They waved her out into the night

132
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,445
# Her lonely heart setting free... #

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,360
Are you sure you're
a fully qualified doctor?

134
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,640
You seem too young...

135
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,157
.. and glamorous.

136
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,605
You can talk. Me?

137
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Yeah. You're running
this community...

138
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:16,360
No, I'm not, it's a co-operative.

139
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,080
You calling me glamorous?

140
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
Yeah.

141
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,725
I'm glad you came.

142
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
You should get back to your friends.

143
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah.

144
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Night. Goodnight.

145
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,800
What are you doing?

146
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,285
What do you mean?

147
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,360
What are you doing? Nothing.

148
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:51,645
Don't lie to me.

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,365
I was saying goodnight.

150
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
What are you doing? Stalking me?

151
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:58,125
Don't do that. Do what?

152
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
Walk off when I'm talking to you.

153
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,560
SHE SIGHS
Come 'ere!

154
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,640
Ow!

155
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,480
You like her, don't you?

156
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
Yeah, I like her.

157
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,040
Like that.

158
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,565
Like what?

159
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,725
Like that.
You know what I'm talking about.

160
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,920
No, I don't know!
You're hardly Mr Articulate, are you?

161
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,045
What are you talking about?

162
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,800
I meet someone, I get on with them,
and you go ballistic.

163
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,457
You think this is ballistic?

164
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, you can go further, can you?

165
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Are you threatening me?

166
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,605
Night, Tom.

167
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,245
The happy couple.

168
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
You should get some sleep, Tom.
It's been a long day.

169
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,280
She'll dump you, pal,
soon as she gets a better offer.

170
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:01,080
No. You're wrong.

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
You can't change.

172
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
Goodnight. Goodnight.

173
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm going with Greg in the morning.

174
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:19,480
There's something he needs to do.

175
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,925
Sure.

176
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,445
And you are wrong, you know.

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,000
You can change.
You are what you are.

178
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:28,080
Oh. So it's hopeless?

179
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,285
Well done.

180
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,460
And you'll die alone?

181
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,565
A killer and a thief.

182
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Put it on my gravestone. No.

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Feels blessed, this place.

184
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,605
Hi. You going for a walk?

185
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,600
Yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Yeah. Do you want a bike?

186
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,245
Great! Thanks.

187
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,160
If you head up the valley, will you look
in at the farm where the chickens are,

188
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,497
see if they need anything? Sure.

189
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,800
And bring us back a few eggs.

190
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,320
So this was your life?

191
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,680
Mmm.

192
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,085
Frozen...

193
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,760
Mind you, it froze
months before the virus hit.

194
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,960
When she left?

195
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,445
Mmm.

196
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
With them.

197
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,840
I just need to go upstairs
for a second.

198
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,880
OK, I'll wait here.

199
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:01,840
You OK?

200
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,285
Yeah.

201
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,360
Just one more thing.
It's been playing on my mind.

202
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,040
Have a look at this.

203
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,925
"Hope never dies. "

204
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,045
Yeah, and what are these numbers?
Who's it from?

205
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,960
I don't know. It was weird. It came
by courier just before the virus hit.

206
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
They're co-ordinates.

207
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,480
I don't know
why I didn't see that before.

208
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,720
Greg, does this,
um, really matter now?

209
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,937
I don't know. It might.

210
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:44,085
Yeah. South... It's here!

211
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,120
It's an airfield.
It's only an hour or so away.

212
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,925
You want to go there? Mmm.

213
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
It's probably just some marketing
thing. Yeah? Selling what?

214
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:52,725
I don't know.

215
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,280
I need to find out.

216
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,680
OK.

217
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
Hello?

218
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
Anyone here?

219
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,685
Oh, my God.

220
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,880
You shouldn't be here!

221
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,400
You're ill...
Keep away from me.

222
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,400
The chickens died yesterday.

223
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:56,000
Izzy always looked after 'em.

224
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,240
She died in the night.

225
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,125
Virus.

226
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,760
Took her so fast.

227
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,180
Now you'll get it.

228
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:08,005
Oh, no, don't worry.

229
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,400
I've been exposed
loads of times before.

230
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm immune.

231
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,005
So were we.

232
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,380
And our families all died.

233
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,720
We survived, like you.

234
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,685
This is different.

235
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,000
Our immunity... no longer applies.

236
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,525
I'll go and get your friends.

237
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,560
You can't!
You might infect them.

238
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,600
This has to be contained.

239
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,720
What's your name?

240
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,100
Sarah.

241
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,440
Sarah...

242
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,120
.. was my daughter's name.

243
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,720
It's... It's going to be OK.

244
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,845
I'll stay

245
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,080
and we'll get through this together.

246
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,037
We'll help each other.

247
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:57,960
Do you have water here?

248
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,405
Kitchen.

249
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,480
I'll get some.

250
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,920
Where are we going?
Good question.

251
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,520
Sorry. I said, good question.

252
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:39,440
I know. I said, sorry.

253
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,000
Watching you with her last night...

254
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:50,977
you looked so...

255
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,726
I don't know.

256
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,440
Very beautiful.

257
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
And I was thinking...

258
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
"Why does she look so beautiful?"

259
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,497
It's because you looked happy.

260
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,240
It made me want to... Kill me?

261
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
I love you.

262
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
Tom...

263
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,165
I'm...

264
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
really... flattered...

265
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,320
Flattered?

266
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,240
You mean a lot to me.

267
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,760
A lot...

268
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,760
And I owe you so much.
I'd be dead if you hadn't...

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,820
But last night,

270
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,640
with Judy...

271
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,280
You're right.
I was attracted to her.

272
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:57,725
I felt that spark.

273
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,520
But there is something
between you and me,

274
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,045
I'm not denying that,

275
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,600
and, yeah, we could have sex,
but that would make it worse,

276
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,165
for both of us,

277
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
because we are so different.

278
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:15,325
Yeah.

279
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,220
Men and women.

280
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,080
You and me.

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I can change, if you can.

282
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,325
Ohh.

283
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,920
You're an angel.

284
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,800
Hi. Hi.

285
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,405
You OK?

286
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,920
Man trouble.

287
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,565
Ah.

288
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,365
Morning! You seen Sarah?

289
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Yeah. She went for a bike ride.
To the end farm.

290
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:07,200
Right.
Go up there, it's a nice walk.

291
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:08,560
It's only a mile or so.

292
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,040
Cheers.

293
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,920
I... I think I'll go with them.

294
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,440
Sure.

295
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
Stay where you are!

296
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:52,205
Stop!

297
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,365
OK. Anya, the people here,
they're sick.

298
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
That girl, Izzy, she died last night
but the chickens, they died first.

299
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:01,445
The man and the woman here,
they're really sick...

300
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,040
OK, Sarah. It's OK. It's all right,
don't worry about it. Al, wait.

301
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,085
Sarah, what are the symptoms?

302
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,445
Well, like the virus, lumps
under the arm, nausea, fever...

303
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,400
But they were exposed to it before,
in the beginning, like the rest of us?

304
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,365
Yeah.

305
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
And you've been in the house?

306
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,240
In the same room?

307
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,080
How close?

308
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,805
Close.

309
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,360
Right. They say I have to stay.

310
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,080
No. No way!

311
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,800
It's possible the virus has mutated.

312
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:45,617
Whatever it is,
it has to be contained.

313
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,400
You have to wait it out,
in quarantine.

314
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,040
You understand?

315
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
How are you feeling?

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,560
I don't know. OK.

317
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:00,045
Temperature?

318
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
I don't think so.

319
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:02,845
Good.

320
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,520
Good, good.
So let's go now, while we still can.

321
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:08,760
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

322
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,660
Yeah. Um... keep your fluids up.

323
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:17,280
Do you need any food or water?

324
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,165
No, there's enough here.

325
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,280
Well, um,
I'm going to go back with Naj.

326
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,520
Let everyone know what's happening.

327
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,200
OK?

328
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,245
Let's go.

329
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,400
Come on, together. That way.

330
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,525
Tempting...

331
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,245
But I think I better stay.

332
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,085
And, you know,
I'm going to be all right.

333
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,800
In a few days, well,
you'll be fighting me off.

334
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,480
Can't get rid of me that easily.

335
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,040
Better late than never.

336
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,600
This the right place?

337
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,280
Abby...

338
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:25,800
Give us a hand.

339
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,040
What are you looking for?

340
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:35,560
I don't know.

341
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
Greg, more postcards.

342
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,560
What does it mean?

343
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,920
It could just have been
a corporate day out, or something.

344
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,840
It'll be OK, Naj.
How do you know?

345
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,040
You don't know that!

346
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,640
What are we going to do?
We're going to keep calm.

347
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:18,725
Izzy died!

348
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,680
We know that, Mark,
just give us a second, OK?

349
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,520
Did she have any
underlying conditions?

350
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:26,765
Possibly.

351
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,680
But none that you are aware of?

352
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:29,925
No.

353
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,200
OK. Everyone, listen.
Anya, do you want to...?

354
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,360
Did anyone have any contact
with them yesterday?

355
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,325
Don't be shy.

356
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,960
No-one went to the end farm?

357
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:45,325
The day before?

358
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,485
I spoke to Ted outside for a minute.

359
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,280
But he said not to come close because
they were coming down with a cold.

360
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,645
OK.

361
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,900
Well, hopefully,
it's been contained.

362
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:59,120
They just have to stay
in quarantine.

363
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,445
We can't just leave them there.

364
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,120
We're not leaving them, Clare.
But listen, we cannot go in there.

365
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:08,760
We have to just wait
and just pray that they'll survive.

366
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,405
It's the second wave.

367
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,080
It's come to kill off everyone
who survived the first.

368
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:14,325
We're all going to die.

369
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,885
Hey, did you listen?
We're containing it.

370
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,200
We need to keep calm
and carry on as normally as possible.

371
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:22,857
All right?

372
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:24,480
Let's eat.

373
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
Anything I can do?

374
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:35,645
Um...

375
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,440
No, I don't think so.

376
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,300
You got it all under control?

377
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,800
What is your problem? What?

378
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:45,365
Don't.

379
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,360
Don't?! You telling her, don't?
Don't what? Provoke him?

380
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,217
I'm not scared of you.

381
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,040
Are you scared of me?

382
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
There's nothing else here.

383
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,565
Oh!

384
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,645
I'm ready.

385
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,880
Mr Stevens.
You've come to take me away.

386
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,360
You're the pilot.

387
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,240
You're the pilot?

388
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,685
Um...

389
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,440
Well, it's one of you.
It isn't me. I can't fly.

390
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:27,160
Listen, it's OK...
If I could fly, I'd have flown.

391
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:29,560
Sorry...

392
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,805
Where are we going? We're...

393
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,480
No, no, don't tell me. You can't tell
me, can you? No, of course you can't.

394
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:43,240
Classified.

395
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,240
Mr Stevens?

396
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,080
Been waiting long?

397
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,160
Um...

398
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,520
My fault. I missed the flight.

399
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,700
Or flights.

400
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,520
Lot of people.

401
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Were there two?

402
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:07,200
Or one?

403
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,960
Or three?

404
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,645
Um...

405
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,240
Pretends he doesn't know.
He's very good, isn't he?

406
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,520
You're very good. Better than me.

407
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,880
Misread the email.

408
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,520
What email?

409
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,240
The time! The departure time.

410
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:32,937
So I was late.

411
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:34,600
Missed the flight.

412
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,640
Yeah, the... the flight.

413
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,760
So did they. Missed their flight.

414
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:44,360
The unlucky eleven.

415
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,440
So they didn't hang around?

416
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
They died.

417
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,440
I buried them.

418
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,005
OK, so you're immune. That's good.

419
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Do you know who else was
on the flight?

420
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,960
The chosen few. The saved.
Is this a religious thing?

421
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,460
Who needs religion?
We've got science.

422
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:18,720
What's...? What connects the people?

423
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:21,397
Who chose them? Who chose you?

424
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:24,040
Greg... Tell us. We'll take you.

425
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,725
I don't know.

426
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,845
It's OK, it's OK. Come on.

427
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Oh, come on. It's OK, Mr Stevens.
Please...

428
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:38,520
Look... Look, you need to sit down.

429
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,400
OK. And we'll get you
something to eat, OK?

430
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,520
Has she come out again?

431
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
I brought you some food.

432
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,645
Thanks.

433
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,960
You don't want it?
No, I'm not that hungry.

434
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,640
The thing is... you have to
keep your strength up.

435
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
Good point.

436
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,760
Thanks.

437
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,100
You eaten?

438
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,520
A bit.

439
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,640
Good.

440
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,000
You want a drink?

441
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:53,000
No, it's OK.

442
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,765
Thank you for the food.

443
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,520
You're welcome.
We're going to sleep here.

444
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,925
And take me in the morning.

445
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,360
Cos you don't want to
fly in the dark, do you?

446
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,200
No.

447
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,600
The lucky ones...
that caught their flights.

448
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:46,117
There are hundreds.

449
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,956
We'll meet them.

450
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:49,760
On the other side.

451
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,320
OK, I think we should all get some rest.
See you in the morning, Mr Stevens.

452
00:34:58,355 --> 00:34:59,600
My last night.

453
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,000
Time to wake up.

454
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:16,165
Morning.

455
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,680
You know who I am?

456
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:19,845
Yeah.

457
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,165
I'm Mr Stevens.

458
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,720
And you haven't come for me,
have you?

459
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,920
Hang on. I've hung on.

460
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,725
Too long.

461
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,720
He didn't send you, did he?

462
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:38,240
Who?

463
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
Who didn't send us?

464
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
I wish you knew.

465
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,640
No!

466
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,280
She's gone.

467
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
Sorry.

468
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,040
How are you feeling?

469
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,320
Fine.

470
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,120
Me too.

471
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,600
Laura was, um...

472
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,640
She had asthma.

473
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,000
You're made of sterner stuff.

474
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,040
Do you believe him?

475
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,200
That people got away?

476
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,325
Natalie's new partner
worked with the Government.

477
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,680
Maybe she got me on the list
to get a postcard, to get away.

478
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,845
But no email?

479
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,040
Maybe something
went wrong with that.

480
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,920
So she could've escaped with...
with your kids?

481
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:56,200
They might be alive somewhere.

482
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm kidding myself.

483
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,160
Hope never dies...

484
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:11,920
until it kills you.

485
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,400
Let's get back to reality.

486
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
Morning.

487
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Morning. Hi.

488
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:46,617
How are you?

489
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,440
Well, thanks.

490
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,160
How are the others?

491
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,285
Laura died. Sorry.

492
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,840
She had other things wrong with her,
you know?

493
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,200
Fight it, Sarah!
I will, Naj, I will. Don't worry.

494
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,280
Come on, let's go back to the barn
and get some breakfast.

495
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:12,560
Give them some privacy.

496
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,080
See you soon, Sarah.

497
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm going to get off, mate,
if that's OK with you.

498
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
You're not going to do
anything stupid, are you?

499
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,320
I won't let him.

500
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,320
We should make some plans.
Er...?

501
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,725
For the future.

502
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,320
Right. Unless you don't want
to be pinned down?

503
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:56,840
No, no, no.
Yes... Yes, pin me down.

504
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,245
OK.

505
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,565
House or flat?

506
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,720
A flat, definitely.
Cool new apartment building.

507
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,085
Wrong. House. Older the better.

508
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,240
Older the better? You're joking?
With a garden.

509
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:11,365
With a pool? No pool...

510
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,320
With wildflowers and a plum tree.
You'll get wasps.

511
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:18,045
Don't be negative.
I'm not being negative.

512
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,840
You're the one who keeps saying no
to everything I suggest.

513
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,520
Only the bad ideas.

514
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,820
Yeah, try crying.

515
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:31,365
Good strategy.

516
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,565
I still won't give in.

517
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
If I knew you were so, um...
So what?

518
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,117
You'd have gone with someone else?

519
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:39,400
Too late. You're stuck with me now.

520
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,640
To the bitter end.

521
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,880
So, kids. How many?

522
00:41:46,915 --> 00:41:48,397
Two?

523
00:41:48,432 --> 00:41:49,776
Three.

524
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,225
Boys?

525
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,640
First.

526
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,280
Um... we've made a good start, but...

527
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,960
.. I need to go inside now.

528
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,165
I was dreaming about Peter.

529
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,160
I'm sorry.
That was me, talking about kids.

530
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,040
It was nice to see him.

531
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,240
It's so peaceful.
Maybe we should stay here for ever.

532
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,500
Where is everyone?

533
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,800
Hi. Hi, there.

534
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:03,320
Hey.

535
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,880
What's going on?
Sit down, Abby.

536
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:13,845
Where's Al?

537
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,320
He's all right. But...

538
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,560
Where's Sarah?

539
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,160
They're all dead?

540
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:28,685
Yeah.

541
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,520
Cos they're not as tough as you.

542
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:33,377
You think I'm tough?

543
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,200
I think you're perfect.

544
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,760
Thank you.

545
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,100
For making me glad to be alive.

546
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:45,205
I have to go and lie down now.

547
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,680
I need you
to do two things for me.

548
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:51,480
I need you to look after Najid.

549
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:54,480
And leave me... alone.

550
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,845
Al!

551
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,080
Just stay out of it!

552
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,605
It's none of your business!

553
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,520
Didn't you hear what she was saying?
She doesn't want you to die.

554
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,640
You could have saved her!

555
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:41,440
There's no cure!

556
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:43,760
No cure...

557
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,405
Tom.

558
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,800
Are you OK?

559
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,840
Yeah.

560
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,340
The virus is spreading
through the birds.

561
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,760
We'll all get it, won't we,
sooner or later?

562
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:34,165
There's so little time.

563
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,920
It was his own fault,
for going soft on her.

564
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,960
Your face is cut.

565
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,640
It's all right.

566
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:47,280
Let me look at it.

567
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,405
Why now?

568
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,080
Now is all there is.

569
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,220
Want an apple?

570
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:51,965
No, thanks.

571
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,720
You've been sitting there all day.
You should eat something.

572
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:58,205
Why?

573
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
All right.

574
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:02,240
I'll just...

575
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,320
I wish I'd gone in instead of Sarah.

576
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,280
I might have got it and survived.

577
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,565
Hi, Tom.

578
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,240
You all right?

579
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,805
Yeah.

580
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,200
I was just thinking.

581
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,280
We need a plan.

582
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Abby?

583
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,040
I think we should wait one more day.
Let the virus burn itself out.

584
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,885
Al.

585
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,120
I'm going to go in there now.
It's less of a risk for me.

586
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,440
She looked... at peace.

587
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,160
Beautiful.

588
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,360
To every thing there is a season
and a time

589
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:08,877
To every purpose under the heaven

590
00:52:08,912 --> 00:52:11,956
A time to be born and a time to die

591
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:15,035
A time to kill and a time to heal

592
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,045
A time to mourn and a time to dance

593
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,200
A time to embrace and a time
to refrain from embracing

594
00:52:23,235 --> 00:52:25,960
A time to get and a time to lose.

595
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Thanks to Sarah and her courage
and self-sacrifice,

596
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:52,920
this outbreak's been contained.

597
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,120
But it's only a matter of time
before it surfaces again

598
00:52:57,155 --> 00:53:00,125
and kills more of us...

599
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
unless we can find a way to
fight it.

600
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:05,077
So, I'm going back to the lab,

601
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:08,085
but this time on my own terms.

602
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,920
They'll have to release all the
people that they've locked up.

603
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:14,320
Then I'll co-operate and let them do
whatever's necessary

604
00:53:14,355 --> 00:53:16,720
to find the vaccine
they've been looking for.

605
00:53:16,755 --> 00:53:18,797
When do you want to do it?

606
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,805
Now. There's no time to lose.

607
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,540
And I'll go alone.
No, you won't.

608
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,240
No, you won't.
No, you won't.

609
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:28,800
You're outvoted, Abby.

610
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,600
Al?

611
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,160
Let's stick together.

612
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,480
The lorry's parked up on the road,
about a mile from the turning.

613
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:48,640
Just take what you want from it.
Good luck.

614
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,360
See you.

615
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,660
Look after her. Bye. Bye.

616
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,760
See you soon. Good luck.

617
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,165
Whitaker, is that his name?

618
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,325
Yeah.
If he doesn't agree to your terms,

619
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,720
what's to stop him and his guards
taking you by force?

620
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,360
Do you regret it?

621
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,520
No.

622
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,457
Do you?

623
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:22,360
No.

624
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,320
Is that it?

625
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,280
Yeah.

626
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,040
It's open.

627
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,000
Something's happened.

628
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,840
Power's still on.

629
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,045
Don't.

630
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,125
What's in there?

631
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,120
The people they experimented on.

632
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,760
Come on.

633
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,680
The scientists.

634
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,720
The virus finally
broke through their defences.

635
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,760
Let's get out of here.

636
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,280
Peter!

637
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,760
Abby?!

638
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,320
Peter!

639
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,720
Where did they go?
Are you sure it was Peter?

640
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:59,120
I know my own son.
Where's her kid?

641
00:57:59,155 --> 00:58:01,045
Abby...

642
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,680
We're not animals.
Why are you doing all this to me?

643
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:05,085
I was a friend of your mother's.

644
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,680
I don't care what you do to him,
just get me my son.

645
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:10,480
Like I said,
you're going to tell me.

646
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:11,845
We have to test it again.

647
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,400
I'll do it.
.. I'll see you on the other side.

648
00:58:14,435 --> 00:58:15,405
I have the boy.

649
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,680
Well, then, we must get you out.
I'll prepare an evacuation team.

650
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,720
Do it! Do it!

651
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:24,280
Stop!

652
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
