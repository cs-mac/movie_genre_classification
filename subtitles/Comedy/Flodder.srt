1
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:41,380
It seems like a ridiculous idea!

2
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:44,261
We should give them a chance.
They have to go somewhere

3
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:46,659
They are criminals,
Their file says so.

4
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:53,750
Is that also the opinion of this
parole board?

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:59,596
Well sir, they are not exactly
a family rolemodel,

6
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:04,577
But... there are clear signs that they
want to better themselves.

7
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:07,030
It's our duty to offer them
a better place to live.

8
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,599
They've lived on a toxic waste dump
for years without knowing it.

9
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,538
The city was not aware of that either.

10
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,248
But we have a responsibility

11
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,481
If it had taken a bit longer they
would not be alive to talk about it.

12
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,775
Don't bring us to ideas

13
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:22,111
There are various examples that
show us...

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,175
OUCH

15
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,866
Say Milly, can you get a plaster.

16
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,494
This man has hurt himself by his own report

17
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,188
Hey you sonofabitches,
Watch out what you do with that clock.

18
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,273
It belonged to your grandma!

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,297
Easy, Kees
Are you ok?

20
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:44,352
Yeah I got it. Lower it down.

21
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:57,251
Are there any more crates coming?

22
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,293
Just the boiler.

23
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:04,383
Hurry up guys. This truck has to
be back at 5 o'clock.

24
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:07,393
Mom...
You want him to come too?

25
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:10,806
Where did you find him?
I didn't see that ugly face in 10 years.

26
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:11,901
It was under your bed.

27
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,143
Get rid off it. I dont want anything
to do with your father.

28
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,571
Is that my father?

29
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,271
His father, not yours.

30
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:21,754
I'm sorry

31
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:39,628
I've no idea what you want to proof
with these kind of experiments

32
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,676
I think... the city can't ignore
their responsibility

33
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,974
But putting them in a villa in the
better part of our city...

34
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,876
a place with a high status

35
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,264
Isn't there a more suitable place
for these people?

36
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,330
They rather be among their own kind.

37
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:59,132
Verschuur. There are more empty
houses in other districts, right?

38
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:04,588
There's not much choice.
Our files have become pretty thin.

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,708
In some districts that were available
people were protesting against their arrival.

40
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,107
- Nobody wants them
- But that's crazy!

41
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,746
The only option that we have left
is the villa in district Zonnedael

42
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:19,875
That house has been empty for years.
It can finally be used for what it is meant for.

43
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:23,066
- To have people inside.
- People?!?

44
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:30,125
No reading now grandpa, we are moving.
Take it to the truck.

45
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,477
You want to poop, old man?

46
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:42,856
Yeah yeah, I'll be careful with
those trains of yours.

47
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,422
CATCH!

48
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,792
There, almost finished.

49
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:59,303
It could be that a completely different
living environment in a...

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,253
totally different society...
direct or not direct...

51
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:12,907
and fully or partially being forced in
patterns that are acceptable for our society.

52
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,775
I'm glad that you are so confident
in your case.

53
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:21,124
- In my report I discover...
- Yeah yeah I've read your report.

54
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:27,901
During my observations with the family
I've noticed they are willing to co-operate

55
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:30,425
We cannot let them down.

56
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:34,595
Deep inside...
they are very sensitive people.

57
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:41,863
And you really have to fuck off, little shit.

58
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,715
- Mom!  Someone here from the newspaper.
- Newspaper?

59
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,862
- Yeah they want to write something.
- What about?

60
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:55,672
- What do you want?
- Peters, Daily Breaker.

61
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,807
- Are you from a newspaper?
- Yes, can I ask you a couple of questions?

62
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:03,020
What do you want to ask?
How do you feel after living for years on a toxic dump.

63
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:07,410
Are you not extremely happy that you can leave?
Well, we didn't know about that toxic waste.

64
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,214
You knew nothing?
We always have tearing eyes.

65
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:12,241
And we were itchy.
Especially when it had rained.

66
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:16,252
- And that smell... It's awful eh?
- What smell?

67
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,048
Nobody protested against their arrival?
Not that I know of.

68
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:25,480
Well, having criminals as neighbours
Isn't a very appealing prospect.

69
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,900
- We didn't tell them.
- Didn't tell them?! They know nothing?

70
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:39,389
I think the press will love it.
The city giving a chance to the poor people.

71
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:44,684
Well gentlemen... and lady...
we have to make a decision.

72
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:49,065
It's almost lunchtime...
Millie, what do you think?

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,850
I dont know... it seems nice for these
people to have... a villa like that.

74
00:05:55,677 --> 00:06:00,139
Yeah showing our good will can't hurt.
And the elections are arond the corner.

75
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,186
Alright, we'll try it for half a year
and after that we will see what happens.

76
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:10,472
- Have you seen the new house yet?
- No, we only heard yesterday where we are going.

77
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:14,018
So, a big surprise then.
Shall we make a picture?

78
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,343
- A picture? of what?
- Well, of the entire family....

79
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,786
- Well eh paying...
- a hundred bucks!

80
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,957
- A hundred euros?!!
- No, a hundred bucks. Otherwise no picture.

81
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,493
You understand you are going to
carry a heavy burden on your shoulders.

82
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,548
I know for sure they wont hurt my trust.

83
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:36,175
I hope you are right.

84
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,645
A little more to the right. Yes.
a bit more.

85
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,138
Quiet you guys

86
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,641
Shut up and sit still

87
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,922
- Hey you will behave, right?
- What do you mean??

88
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:54,097
- I stay the way I am.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

89
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,088
Watch it, pops.

90
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,525
What a stiff place

91
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,501
Hello ladies!

92
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,834
Hi neighbour!

93
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:02,827
I feel at home already

94
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,584
- Are you the new neighbour?
- No I'm eh...

95
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:25,828
a friend of the family.
I have the keys.

96
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:30,444
It's about time.
This place was empty for a while now.

97
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,999
Do you hear that, Pipita.
You are getting new neighbours.

98
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:36,893
- What kind of people are they?
- Ehm...

99
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,105
- Just normal.
- If it isn't another doctor.

100
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,180
We already have 4 of them here.

101
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:48,217
- Always those bloody stories, it makes you sick.
- Well, don't worry about it.

102
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,827
Ah, that must be them.

103
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:02,022
This must be the place, number 13.
Our lucky number.

104
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:03,503
Awesome!

105
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:08,711
What are that?

106
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,992
Hello Johnny.
Hi Sjaak, old wanker.

107
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,951
- Everything went well with the movement?
- No problem at all, Sjakie.

108
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,175
I like this place.
You did a fine job.

109
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,995
- Well Mrs. Flodder, what do you think?
- We dont have much choice, eh.

110
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:39,455
Well eh, a lot of people would jump
a hole in the air for a house like this.

111
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:44,252
Get that old fart out of the truck.

112
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,219
Henkie, go get that suitcase.

113
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,616
Look at this Johnny, a swimmingpool!

114
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,770
And the people here?
Is this a good neighbourhood?

115
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:16,899
- A good neighbourhood?!
- Yeah, I dont want to lower myself.

116
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,865
This is the best neighbourhood of the city.
All kinds of doctors and directors

117
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,511
Nah, we will see.

118
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,635
Everything is provided for.

119
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:35,660
Swimmingpool.

120
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:42,748
Big carpet.

121
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,736
Always sun.

122
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:49,133
Get out of my way, little bastard!

123
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:54,340
Gimme those keys.

124
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,374
I already took care of the residence permit.
It can be picked up before 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.

125
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,101
11 o'clock!!
Everybody is still snoring at that time.

126
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:18,513
Hey what the fuck is going on in here!

127
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,645
- This is my room!
- I was here first.

128
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:23,612
- I'm the oldest.
- Both of you, get lost!

129
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,500
This will be MY room.

130
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:30,295
- Are you ok, Sjakie?
- Yes... I'm fine.

131
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,269
These boys are so playful.

132
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:39,220
Mrs. Flodder, you know how much trouble
I went through to get you here, right.

133
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:43,600
It cost the city a lot of money.
It wasn't very easy.

134
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:50,873
You will do your best to... adapt a bit.
I mean, you wont let me down.

135
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,255
You make sure that it stays.... nice here.

136
00:14:55,258 --> 00:15:01,205
Dont worry Sjakie. We wont be a bother.
I swear it.

137
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,908
Hurry up, lazy bastards!

138
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:11,124
Hey dont drop those fuckers!

139
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,768
Come on!

140
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,017
Watch out!

141
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,481
Stop bitching around.

142
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,282
That truck has to be back at five.
Hurry up!

143
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,013
- It is scum.
- What are you saying, my dear?

144
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:19,972
Our new neighbours.
It's unbelievable.

145
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:26,667
- How is it possible that they came right here.
- Yeah, they are indeed...  different.

146
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:39,726
*Praying*

147
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:40,635
Amen.

148
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:42,316
Dinner

149
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,114
Look, for you.

150
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:08,461
Come on grandpa.
Eat a bit faster.

151
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:12,940
Dont make a mess.

152
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,045
There you go.

153
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,510
On a moment like this I think it's
time to say a few good words.

154
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,684
I think so too

155
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:36,210
I want to thank the city counsel...
The mayor himself...

156
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:41,685
That they were able to let us, simple citizens,
live in a simple house like this.

157
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:48,961
- Also I want to thank one person specially...
- oh yeah, who?

158
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:53,811
Who stole all our hearts and could not...
unfortunately, be here with us tonight.

159
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,055
Sjaak....  old wanker.

160
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,827
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

161
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,189
Hey pass that bottle to me.

162
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:07,232
Johnny, look at that house,
it's full of antique stuff.

163
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,866
- That's worth a lot.
- Wanna take a look?

164
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,769
Hey no fooling around now.
We promised mom not to pull any stunts...

165
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,166
...for now.

166
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:25,553
Johnny, look at those horny chicks.
Slow down a bit.

167
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:29,324
- Hello ladies, how are you doing?
- None of your business.

168
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:30,898
Can I pick up your balls?

169
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:33,790
- You watch your own balls...
- If you have any.

170
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,195
Aahh those chicks.

171
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,477
- A bit too young.
- Yeah maybe for you.

172
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:40,045
Hey wanna have fun tonight!

173
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,151
For 25 bucks I'll arrange a date.

174
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:55,045
That's too much around it.

175
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:57,544
*talking gibberish*

176
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,665
There are no trains there.

177
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,905
*More gibberish*

178
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,412
You are not the one that is pushing!
I'm really tired.

179
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,730
*gibberish*

180
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:06,195
Alright then, just one more block.

181
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,950
- Hi.
- Hello.

182
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:16,311
Morning Mrs. Wijnberg. Morning Mrs. Frцbel.
How are you doing?

183
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,424
- You're looking good, Mathilde.
- Thank you.

184
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:23,790
Five days Hawaii with Arend-Jan is wonderful.
Going away is just great.

185
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:27,496
- It's just that awful jetlag...
- Yes they should do something about that.

186
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:28,350
Yes exactly.

187
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,778
Van Putten, did you get those snails
I asked you about?

188
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:38,717
Ofcourse Mrs. Frцbel. Look, ordered especially
for you. Here you go.

189
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,245
- Thank you.
- Goodmorning Mrs. Neuteboom.

190
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:41,933
Morning.

191
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:45,983
You dont look so happy.
New people have moved in next door.

192
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:49,647
- Oh yes? I have to meet them then.
- I wouldn't do that.

193
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:50,859
How come?

194
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,331
Well well, that's damn easy.

195
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,097
- Ehm, are you looking for something?
- Bloodsausage, 3 pounds... my son loves it!

196
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,023
Look at that.

197
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,121
- Wanna get her?
- Yeah let's go.

198
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,085
Hey, fuck off!

199
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,868
Asshole, give it back!

200
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,267
Give me that cap.

201
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,604
- What are you doing here? This is our neighbourhood
- None of your business.

202
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,674
- You are anti-social people, you dont belong here.
- Give me that cap.

203
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,268
Hey hey, watch your mouth, little bitch.

204
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,562
What did you say buddy.

205
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:55,355
- Anything else?
- No.

206
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:58,992
Now fuck off!

207
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,854
What the hell did you do?

208
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:54,175
He fell into the water.

209
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,454
He always has something.
Well put him in the sun so that he can dry.

210
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:21,120
- U,h oh.
- What's wrong?

211
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:22,746
The police, put it away.

212
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,889
Put it away!

213
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:43,437
- Good afternoon officer, we weren't speeding, I think.
- Papers!

214
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,514
- Give this gentleman the papers.
- Papers?

215
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,012
In the cupboard there.

216
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:05,615
- Is there a problem, officer.
- Who are they?

217
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,451
These are my brothers.

218
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:10,600
- And what are you doing here?
- What do you mean, officer?

219
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,134
We are just driving around.
That's not legal, is it?

220
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,565
- Aren't you a bit lost from home?
- I dont think so. We live behind there.

221
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:21,840
Oh yeah, that's true.
There's the garbage dump, eh.

222
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:24,982
Did you hear that, Kees.
These gentlemen live here, hahaha.

223
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:32,311
- I know you... And your family as well.
- Oh really, sir?

224
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:35,452
And dont think you can pull some shit here.

225
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,244
I'm gonna pay attention to your family.
You in particular!

226
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:43,914
And if I notice something, I will get ya!

227
00:26:44,623 --> 00:26:46,886
And then you wont get off again so easily.

228
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:51,683
And I know plenty of colleagues that appreciate
a good private conversation with you.

229
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:56,562
I like a good conversation.

230
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,700
And now, get lost.

231
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,124
- The neighbourhood is getting worse.
- What?

232
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:56,414
- The Blommenstein residence has new people in it.
- Oh yes?

233
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:58,187
I bumped into Mr. Wijberg

234
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:02,086
According to him they are complete anti social.

235
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:05,101
How can that be?
How did they get here?

236
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,032
The city seems to be behind it.
Some kind of arrangement.

237
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:15,145
They didn't ask us anything,
while Mr. Frцbel knows everyone there.

238
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,562
I will call Bredero.

239
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,139
Bredero?

240
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:25,984
As chairman of the tennisclub it seems like he's
the right person to mobilize the neighbourhood.

241
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:31,329
We must prevent infiltration of
people that dont belong here.

242
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,753
Maybe something would happen here at last.

243
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:37,914
Tomorrow I will check it out and see
the nature of the threat.

244
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:41,688
We can determine our strategy then.

245
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:44,587
Aye aye sir.

246
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:36,983
Dirty bastard, dont touch your sister!

247
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:45,248
From now on everybody stays in their own bed!

248
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:03,927
- When are we getting a new car?
- When we win the jackpot.

249
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:08,151
Everyone is driving fancy cars here.
Only we have an old piece of shit.

250
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,556
There has to be a difference.

251
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:13,113
The guy next door has a car dealership.
Did you know that?

252
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:16,279
- What, the guy of that CX?
- Yeah, he sells them.

253
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:19,750
What do you want to do.
Ask for a new car?

254
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:24,157
Well... Maybe I will do that.

255
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:02,839
Easy, nice doggy.

256
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,484
Calm down calm down.

257
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:13,445
Can you start it?

258
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:19,231
There, for now it works.

259
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,805
Move over. We're gonna get some icecream.

260
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,579
What did you find in the garbage?

261
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:20,586
Hey you!

262
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,846
Are you deaf?!?

263
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:27,502
Ah, so you can hear me speak correctly.

264
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:29,926
Yeah, but I doubt if he'll understand it.

265
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:30,973
What are you doing here?

266
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:32,940
I'm just looking. Is that against the law?

267
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:38,675
- Are you a member here?
- I can't remember seeing that ugly face before.

268
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:42,461
- Is that him?
- Yeah he's been look at us whole afternoon.

269
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:46,235
- With that stupid grin on his face.
- It's just a dirty bastard.

270
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,084
- Hey we're not done talking yet.
- He wants to walk away.

271
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:54,842
- Dont think that we are afraid of you.
- I didn't do anything!

272
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,862
We dont like it when our girls
are being harrassed.

273
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,546
Maybe we should teach you some manners.

274
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:12,795
So, that will teach him a lesson.

275
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,806
Ok guys, let's have a drink.
Are you coming?

276
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:29,766
Does it hurt?

277
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,880
Are you sure you dont want to call Van Zwol?

278
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:36,406
- Otherwise it will get infected.
- No, there's no need for that.

279
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,444
It's not so bad as it looks.

280
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,035
He really got you bad.

281
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,588
It was trained to kill.

282
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,070
Those people are really dange...
dangerous.

283
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,220
I wont let it rest.

284
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,691
In a while our children wont be
able to be safe on the streets.

285
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:57,592
We dont have children.

286
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,339
I wont have it that a minority
can terrorize us like that.

287
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,507
History has taught us enough already!

288
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:16,492
Look, there's Kees!

289
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,561
Hey Kees!

290
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,288
- What happened to you?
- You're bleeding.

291
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,170
That tennis club

292
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,200
- A few of those guys kicked my ass.
- Why?

293
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:31,369
Just like that. I was just looking.

294
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:32,911
What a bunch of fags.

295
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,198
I would like to talk to those gentlemen

296
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:02,830
Look out, it's that guy again.

297
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,917
There they are.
Get them, Johnny!

298
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:06,578
Back!

299
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,215
They are catching up to us!

300
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:07,069
Hey!
He's crazy!

301
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:15,410
Isn't it time to refresh the water?
It doesn't look very clean.

302
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,519
Honey, I refreshed the water two days ago.

303
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,166
Well, it looks very dirty to me.

304
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,673
- The water is crystal clear!
- But...

305
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:42,125
- Guys, next time at our place?
- They wouldn't dare.

306
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:08,797
Kees! Kees! Give them a round.
Put it on my tap.

307
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:10,120
Do you have one?

308
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:13,875
They dont mess with me.
And they certainly dont mess with my family.

309
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:16,724
Because then they can refreshen
themselves in their own pool.

310
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,016
Ha, they dont get us, right Kees?

311
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:20,911
- Hey Johnny!
- Hey Animal!

312
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:24,575
- Why dont you call me anymore?
- You didn't think I'd forgotten about you.

313
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,827
- What happened to you?
- Ow, just a little accident.

314
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,810
Comfort him. He really needs it.

315
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:32,895
- Can I talk with you Johnny?
- Hey Kareltje, what's up?

316
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:35,292
- Wanna do a job?
- What kind of thing?

317
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,965
- Purses.
- Purses, I'm not a fag!

318
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:40,860
Crocodile leather.
Worth a fortune, man.

319
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:43,916
Someone tipped me from the hague.
5000 purses!

320
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:48,159
Are you holding them? No way I'm doing it.
With those shoes last time it went totally wrong.

321
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:52,101
- I thought that went well?
- It was a bit hard stashing all those left shoes.

322
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,669
But this is different.

323
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,418
Hey are we keeping things nice there!

324
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:02,392
Sorry Kareltje, I'll pass on this one.
No problem, I will find someone else.

325
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:07,283
Hey, I thought you were away from here, Johnny

326
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,691
I am, but I'm not abandoning my friends.

327
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:11,920
- How is that new house of yours?
- I'm getting used to it.

328
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:13,341
He has a big ass house, man.

329
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,469
- A lot of rooms, a swimming pool in the backyard.
- A swimmingpool?!!

330
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,704
Yeah the house isn't so bad.
The neighbourhood is not so nice.

331
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:21,662
- A lot of stiff people.
- I'd like to see it.

332
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:25,489
- Yeah exactly, we have to see that house of yours.
- Yes we have to officially open it.

333
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,300
Well, why dont you all come over tonight
to have a swim!

334
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:30,128
YEAAAAAHH!!!!!

335
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,349
These are the last ones.

336
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,581
We can make it through the night with these

337
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,277
Who wants some more?

338
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:23,619
What a noise.

339
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,742
If they dont stop you must call the police.

340
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:28,883
- They are having a party.
- All those damn drunks.

341
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:31,693
It's outragious.
What are they thinking!

342
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:34,256
- Just take your sleepingpill.
- I already did that.

343
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:38,197
What did you think. I took two!
Otherwise I wont sleep at all.

344
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:50,125
I ehm, I've to take out the... garbage.

345
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:53,180
Well you better watch out
With that scum outside.

346
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,011
Shhhttttt!

347
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:19,064
- Hi, Toet. How are...
- MOM! it's for you!

348
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,810
Yeah yeah yeah

349
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:42,089
- Ha Mrs. Flodder, How are you doing?
- Brewing.

350
00:43:42,095 --> 00:43:45,364
I was just seeing how things were going.
I even picked up your house permit.

351
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:46,082
Great.

352
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:49,951
- Are you cooking?
- Just a little bit. Sit down please.

353
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:54,107
- It sometimes takes a while to get in order.
- You shut up with that music!

354
00:43:56,504 --> 00:43:57,331
Coffee?

355
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,838
A glass of milk, please.

356
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:03,364
We had a party last night.

357
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:06,634
- Ah, a house warming party.
- Uh?

358
00:44:07,218 --> 00:44:10,054
- Ehm... a party.
- That's what I said.

359
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,870
Hey hey hey, take it easy.
My head hurts.

360
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:29,512
Did you get the aspirine.

361
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:33,088
- Do you still have a headache?
- Man, my head is like shit.

362
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,949
Yeah doesn't surprise me.
Last night you were drunk as hell.

363
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,098
Watch out!

364
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:58,186
Fuck.

365
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,223
- What did you do? Were you sleeping?
- I'm sorry, I didn't see you.

366
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:16,569
- You didn't see me?
- No.

367
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:20,750
- You had shit in your eyes then!
- Hey easy, you dont talk like that to a lady.

368
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:24,337
- Do you have a lot of damage?
- No, not so much.

369
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:27,382
If I hadn't moved out of the way
I would have been on top of you.

370
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:28,925
I can have a bump.

371
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:36,015
- And you didn't see us either?
- No, otherwise I would have taken another route.

372
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:47,589
- Jolanda, they are waiting for us.
- Laura, this is John.

373
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,627
- Hello, how are you?
- How much you want?

374
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:52,521
- What?
- He wants money. Give him 200, we have to go.

375
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:55,330
- He doesn't want any money.
- Sure he does, they all want that.

376
00:45:55,331 --> 00:46:00,133
- Is 300 enough?
- Do I look like I want to be a few bucks richer?

377
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,815
- There's more in life than money.
- Clean clothes for example.

378
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,995
Put the money away.
Everything is taken care of.

379
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:12,509
Are we going, Johnny?

380
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:19,079
- It's nearby.
- I'm sure we can work this out.

381
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:24,835
Stupid bitches.
Are we going, Johnny?

382
00:46:26,013 --> 00:46:27,004
Johnny?

383
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:38,088
- You are up to something.
- Who? Me?

384
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,393
You're not going to
do something stupid, right.

385
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,492
You are going to do something stupid.

386
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:52,112
I always thought you
were a little bit... ordinairy.

387
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:59,895
It's about time that the children...

388
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:10,015
It's about time that the children
go to their... new school.

389
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:13,380
- New school?
- Yes, we agreed on that.

390
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:17,429
- The Judas College
- They could stay home because of the movement.

391
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:22,267
That was a week ago.
It really is about time that...

392
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,815
School is not for them.
It's not healthy.

393
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:28,203
You know what they did
to that teacher, right.

394
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:35,364
They are just like their fathers.

395
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:39,826
I dont know, Wim.
Aren't you rushing into things?

396
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:43,247
We have to do something, Max.
those people are extremely dangerous.

397
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:47,605
- We shouldn't lose our heads.
- they are the first, who knows what's coming.

398
00:47:47,626 --> 00:47:51,703
Before we know it they are a member here.
Does that sounds nice to you?

399
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:55,425
Maybe you are right, Wim.

400
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,336
I'm chairman of this club for 23 years now.

401
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:04,080
I've seen how it started. One court.
Two courts, now we have 12 tennis courts.

402
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,199
We cannot lose what we have build.

403
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,229
We put it on our agenda
for our next meeting.

404
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,158
Seems like a good plan

405
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:18,372
The tennisclub can be our headquarters.
The centre where we coordinate things.

406
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,495
Are you sure that you are going
to play tennis with that... ehmm

407
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:26,759
It takes more than that to take me down.

408
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:55,152
Well Mrs. Flodder, I will see how
things are doing next week.

409
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:56,364
Sure thing, Sjakie.

410
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,036
Hey Sjakie!

411
00:49:07,137 --> 00:49:10,057
It still drives well?
Ofcourse Sjakie, what do ya think.

412
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:22,317
- Shit!
- Did you know those people?

413
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,639
I've seen them around.

414
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,949
You must see my report as temporary.

415
00:50:03,441 --> 00:50:08,037
It's impossible ofcourse after a week
to see how the situation will develop.

416
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:12,417
But so far my impressions are... positive.

417
00:50:12,437 --> 00:50:16,921
I understood your wounds were caused
by several visits at their house.

418
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:22,760
Little accidents, not so important.
They can happen anywhere.

419
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:26,584
According to the police it was
caused by a molotov cocktail.

420
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:31,936
I have to admit that the interaction
with the neighbours is not going perfectly yet.

421
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,695
We have to create a way
to motivate them...

422
00:50:36,777 --> 00:50:39,891
a constructive way to bring these
people together.

423
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:44,850
You are aware that the ministry is following
this experiment with unusual interest.

424
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,845
I hope that your labrats will
soon know how to adapt themselves.

425
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:52,646
I'm sure of it that the relationship
with the neighbours will be better soon.

426
00:50:53,032 --> 00:50:55,626
I'm very optimistic myself.

427
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,176
Hello!

428
00:51:27,304 --> 00:51:28,451
Good afternoon.

429
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:31,851
I saw you arrive and I thought
I should get to know you.

430
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,603
- That's very friendly.
- Are these for your wife?

431
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:35,750
Eh... yes.

432
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:38,436
Mmmmmmm, nice!

433
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,521
- What is your name?
- Kees, just like my brother.

434
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,220
- You eh, dont look like your brother.
- Lucky for me I dont.

435
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:52,662
- Beautiful car!
- That's a CX 25 GTI with fuel injection.

436
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,139
Injection?

437
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:57,887
That's an engine that injects fuel
under high pressure into the cylinder

438
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:02,294
- You know a lot about it.
- I'm in the car business.

439
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,554
Oh really?

440
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,815
But sir, what are you doing?

441
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:12,929
I want you. You turn me on.

442
00:52:12,956 --> 00:52:15,988
- But what about your wife?
- Oh we have plenty of time.

443
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:47,896
Do you like it?

444
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:51,140
It could use a bit more lemmon.

445
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,763
You know your stuff.

446
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:57,246
Yeah, I've been a bartender for years.

447
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:01,416
That's great.
You can make your own drink then.

448
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:13,616
Nice brand of Whiskey.
The house of experts.

449
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:15,832
- That's Wim's favorite brand.
- Wim?

450
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:18,780
My husband.

451
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,195
He doesn't like it when other
people drink from his bottle.

452
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,253
I dont mind.

453
00:54:34,783 --> 00:54:36,109
A bit more lemmon.

454
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:41,069
Cheers.

455
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:46,826
- Mmmmm, excellent!
- Thank you

456
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:51,758
- I heard there was an accident with your car?
- Yeah.

457
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,540
So we dont have to talk
about the damage then.

458
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,889
No, I just came by to see
how you were living.

459
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:00,959
There is our Wim.

460
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:03,219
Cheers, Wim.

461
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,282
Does he have a high rank?

462
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,142
- Commander of a tank battalion.
- Pooh pooh.

463
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:12,529
A real collector.

464
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,105
That is nothing. Come with me.

465
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:23,770
Here is his army.

466
00:55:25,204 --> 00:55:27,684
Damn, that's a big battle.

467
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:32,918
- He can spend nights in here.
- Like there's nothing better to do.

468
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:34,113
Oh.

469
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,076
- And what do you do?
- I follow my instincts.

470
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:42,559
- They can bring you into troubles?
- Really?

471
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:53,857
Hold on.

472
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,101
Nice tune.

473
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,679
- Here?
- Especially here.

474
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:02,466
That's my favorite rabbit.

475
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:04,754
Oh, yeah?

476
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:08,087
I had another one,
but it was smelling bad.

477
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,126
My father got rid of it.

478
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:13,692
My father works at a bank.
He's in the board of directors.

479
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:15,152
What does your father do?

480
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,419
He's doing something... somewhere

481
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:23,443
- Stephanie!
- I've to go. I've my violin lessons now.

482
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:26,776
Do you like Paganini?

483
00:57:26,851 --> 00:57:29,958
I ehm, I like Chinese.

484
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,169
STEPHANIE!

485
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:45,390
- That is not a girl for you, Stephanie
- I can talk to her, can I?

486
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:48,560
- You talk to your friends.
- I have no friends.

487
00:57:50,653 --> 00:57:54,592
- Christine is a good friend of yours.
- She moved away last year.

488
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:57,653
Well I dont like it.

489
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:24,485
- Where the hell were you all afternoon?
- Business.

490
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:26,496
You didn't do anything stupid, did you.

491
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:38,287
- How did you become so sweaty?
- Why are you in a bath at this time.

492
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:41,208
- I worked hard.
- So did I.

493
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:44,303
Johnny, we have a surprise for you.

494
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:57,442
You look like a model, you know.
And our neighbour doesn't look bad as well.

495
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:24,969
A big sausage. Very greasy.
That one there.

496
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,930
I dont think it's your turn yet.

497
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:29,139
Three pieces of that pie, Van Putten.

498
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:32,424
- That's a big mouth you got there.
- Ladies, Calm down.

499
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:35,840
If you want to live here...
You should learn some manners.

500
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,420
That son of yours has already
learned his lesson.

501
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:44,259
Three pieces of that pie, Van Putten.
Or are you sleeping?

502
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,657
Here's your pie, bitch!

503
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:47,909
Ladies, please!

504
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:00,108
Out of my way!

505
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:05,843
Please wake up.

506
01:00:14,384 --> 01:00:16,092
Let me... let me go.

507
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,409
OH NO!

508
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:02,358
Dont touch me!

509
01:02:39,747 --> 01:02:41,531
*Gibberish*

510
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,274
That way?
But we are far already!

511
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,438
- I wanna go home.
- *more gibberish*

512
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:51,551
Another time ok.

513
01:02:51,587 --> 01:02:55,224
I'm very tired now.
Tomorrow we will watch the trains.

514
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,704
*Gibberish*

515
01:02:58,145 --> 01:03:01,957
No, you are an idiot!
You are on your own... Whiskey, lets go.

516
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:50,130
- I'm sorry Mr. Neuteboom, but these...
- It's okay Van Dijk.

517
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,463
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
What can I do for you.

518
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:02,955
- We want a car.
- That red one there.

519
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:08,205
- Ah, the BX Sport. That's a nice car.
- We thought so too.

520
01:04:09,693 --> 01:04:14,488
Like that it's pretty standard.
What do you think of ehm... some extras?

521
01:04:15,755 --> 01:04:18,317
Sport wheels, front and rear spoiler?

522
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:20,576
Nice seats, sport steeringwheel.

523
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:23,392
- Yeah why not, do that.
- Yeah, that's very sportive.

524
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:27,601
- Electric roof, buffalo leather seats.
- Buffalo?!

525
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:33,788
It's a bit more expensive, but
that wont be a problem for you gentlemen.

526
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,929
No problem at all.

527
01:04:35,696 --> 01:04:39,392
And maybe a complete hifi audio set.
That wont make a difference now.

528
01:04:39,393 --> 01:04:43,112
- I like a nice piece of music, right Kees.
- Yes, do that too, no problem.

529
01:04:43,856 --> 01:04:45,915
How do you want to pay?

530
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,294
Cash, Diners Club, American Express, Visa?

531
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:51,546
Polaroid.

532
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:05,414
- Where's grandpa?
- Oh he didn't want to come

533
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:08,750
He always got something.
If he's not home in time he wont get food.

534
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,866
*Gibberish*

535
01:06:04,056 --> 01:06:05,296
What the hell.

536
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:08,268
- Where did you get that car from?
- A present.

537
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,152
From our neighbour.

538
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:12,100
- What did you do?
- Nothing, he just likes us.

539
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,883
- Yeah, right.
- What an awesome car.

540
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:16,474
Are we gonna drive a bit?

541
01:06:16,526 --> 01:06:19,550
- No driving, put the plates on the table
- I already did that!

542
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,951
Oh dear, here we go.

543
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:38,163
Toet!

544
01:06:40,144 --> 01:06:41,666
Make it one plate less.

545
01:06:47,227 --> 01:06:48,550
Yeah, I liked him.

546
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:55,211
I wasn't so close though.

547
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:58,756
We actually didn't even know
if he really was family.

548
01:06:59,132 --> 01:07:02,718
He came along  with an aunt.
He stayed ever since.

549
01:07:03,918 --> 01:07:06,733
- Hey, how you like my new car?
- It's nice.

550
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,079
- How did you get it?
- Someone gave it to me.

551
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,885
- You got it in an honest way?
- Do I look like a crook to you?

552
01:07:13,703 --> 01:07:17,588
- You look great... for a criminal.
- You are okay.

553
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:21,941
You are not like the others.
You have ehm... class.

554
01:07:22,165 --> 01:07:23,051
You think?

555
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,081
Are you romantic?

556
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:27,087
Sometimes.

557
01:07:27,504 --> 01:07:30,194
On a moment like this,
With the sunset...

558
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:34,260
Something happens...
inside here.

559
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,441
I'm in fact a very sensitive person.

560
01:07:39,683 --> 01:07:42,446
I love to travel to far away countries.

561
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:45,607
But Wim doesn't allow me.
He never goes on holiday.

562
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:49,536
He's always afraid that a war
starts when he's out on vacation.

563
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:53,290
I dont understand why you are
married with this moron.

564
01:07:54,124 --> 01:07:58,399
- He used to look handsome.
- It's never too late to start all over.

565
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:02,883
You are right...
We do have a bit of time left.

566
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:05,802
Well, tiger.

567
01:08:06,324 --> 01:08:09,441
- Is there life left inside.
- Yep, for sure.

568
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:37,136
How was your bridge evening.

569
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:39,065
What are you doing up so late?

570
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:41,640
Did you win?

571
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:44,122
Dont you have to defend the country tomorrow.

572
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:48,032
You were not at Laura's this evening.

573
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:51,786
- Oh, really?
- You were with a man!

574
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:55,905
- Tell me!
- Let me go, you are drunk.

575
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,004
You are fucking someone else.

576
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:05,289
You dont think I'm crazy, do you.

577
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:08,365
Who was it?
Do I know him?

578
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,256
- I order you to answer!
- Order, order? We are not in your army.

579
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:18,740
- I'm your husband, I've my rights.
- My husband? You are joking.

580
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:21,764
The only thing you can get up
is the barrel of your tank!

581
01:09:22,577 --> 01:09:23,495
Bitch!

582
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:46,528
Jolanda, what's up with that suitcase.
What are you doing?

583
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,865
Jolanda, I'm sorry.

584
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:51,585
I didn't mean for that.

585
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,571
Jolanda!

586
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,409
Jolanda...

587
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:36,057
What do you want!

588
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:37,934
Who's there?

589
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:41,844
- I came for Johnny.
- Oh, Johnny.

590
01:10:44,294 --> 01:10:47,422
Johnny!
There's a lady here to see you.

591
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:50,342
- A lady?
- She's carrying a suitcase.

592
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:54,721
- What have you done now?
- Suitcase? I know nothing.

593
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:03,751
Jolanda?

594
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,087
What happened?

595
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,006
A small fight.

596
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:10,883
That soldier of yours?

597
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:16,827
Can I stay here?
Ehhh, yeah... of course, come in.

598
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:25,772
Who's that Johnny?

599
01:11:25,773 --> 01:11:29,444
Well mother, this is Jolanda.
Jolanda, this is my mother.

600
01:11:29,445 --> 01:11:30,382
How are you doing.

601
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:35,283
- What do you want from my son?
- Jolanda will be ehm, staying for a bit.

602
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:38,161
What do you mean? You know I dont
want people to fool around here.

603
01:11:38,162 --> 01:11:40,913
- She can stay in grandpa's room.
- Is that her, Johnny?

604
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:42,477
Go to bed, now!

605
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:49,599
That doesn't look so good, child.
Come with me and I will patch you up.

606
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:52,904
And you pour a drink for her.
She's soaking wet.

607
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:38,367
- She has grandpa's plate.
- Shut up and eat.

608
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,945
What the hell!
What is she doing here, Johnny?

609
01:12:43,946 --> 01:12:46,291
Shut up, she's staying here for a while.

610
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:49,941
Jolanda? What the...

611
01:12:54,998 --> 01:12:57,031
Give Jolanda a glass of water.

612
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,833
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

613
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:37,697
Stop making a mess and eat.

614
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:52,347
Ahem, general. Gentlemen.

615
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:57,842
The success of the mission Charlie
will mainly depending on...

616
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,712
Right

617
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:07,017
Operation Stanley...

618
01:14:07,018 --> 01:14:11,590
is depending on the speed of the
Leopard Squadrons can move out...

619
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:15,891
To the coцrdinates... seven.. ehm.

620
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:18,884
Twenty four and nine eighteen...

621
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:20,916
In the Alpha sector.

622
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:26,829
In sector Kilo at the moment will
be our infantry, which...

623
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:31,657
Colonel, in the sector Alpha will
be our field hospital.

624
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:34,787
Of course I meant to say the sector Delta.

625
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:42,449
Because of this the road will be
cleared for the 7th and 12th...

626
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:49,592
Armour infantry.
With some support of helicopters.

627
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:55,170
- Everything okay, Wim?
- Oh yeah, fine.

628
01:14:55,796 --> 01:15:01,061
- Everything okay at home, with your wife.
- No, great, excellent, it's going well.

629
01:15:01,635 --> 01:15:04,293
We know eachother for a long time, Wim
And you know...

630
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:07,526
If something is bothering you,
you can tell me about it.

631
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:09,768
- Everything is alright, Emile.
- Are you sure?

632
01:15:10,752 --> 01:15:13,574
I will do everything to make
Operation Charlie a succes.

633
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:16,168
Stanley... Operation Stanley.

634
01:15:17,354 --> 01:15:18,538
Yes, Stanley.

635
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:24,992
This is the last one.

636
01:15:25,513 --> 01:15:26,816
I can go on again.

637
01:15:27,025 --> 01:15:29,474
I need some new labels.
We have a few left.

638
01:15:31,196 --> 01:15:33,500
- Next week. I'm making new ones.
- Good.

639
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:37,556
- Hey Johnny, who's the lady?
- that's eh, my fiancee.

640
01:15:37,588 --> 01:15:40,841
Fiancee? Dont make me laugh.
That must be someone from the parole.

641
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:45,429
I can't hide anything from you eh.
Keep it quiet, you know that people talk.

642
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,410
My lips are sealed.

643
01:17:33,088 --> 01:17:34,288
You got talent.

644
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:40,857
- You got some more songs?
- I eh, I've to go now.

645
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:44,141
Didn't you forget... something.

646
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:11,199
- Who's your new boyfriend?
- Do you like him?

647
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,076
Ehmm he's interesting.

648
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:16,434
A bit primitive, but interesting.

649
01:18:16,674 --> 01:18:19,698
- Like usual.
- This is different.

650
01:18:20,115 --> 01:18:22,669
You're not going to tell me
that you are in love.

651
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:23,983
Are you shocked?

652
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,110
You always surprise me.

653
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:29,551
- It keeps my life interesting.
- And Wim?

654
01:18:30,595 --> 01:18:34,243
- He's getting excited about it.
- Oh that explains your face

655
01:18:34,504 --> 01:18:37,424
- I moved out.
- Isn't that a bit too drastic.

656
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:41,229
I couldn't be there anymore.
It was like someone...

657
01:18:41,803 --> 01:18:45,870
..was choking me. I had to do something.
- I hope he makes you happy.

658
01:18:46,704 --> 01:18:48,424
We are getting along great.

659
01:18:55,025 --> 01:18:58,340
We have to do something.
The situation is out of control.

660
01:18:58,486 --> 01:19:01,979
I talked to Wim about it.
It's better to act fast.

661
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,856
The sooner they leave the better.

662
01:19:03,857 --> 01:19:06,192
We have to protect the neighbourhood
against the agression of those people.

663
01:19:06,193 --> 01:19:09,643
We should have a meeting tomorrow
here in the club.

664
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:14,529
My wife almost had a nervous breakdown.
Can you imagine not being able to buy groceries.

665
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:18,497
- You don't look well yourself.
- Ofcourse not. With all that noise.

666
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,727
It goes on all day and night.
There's no quiet moment.

667
01:19:20,728 --> 01:19:24,840
Alright, I will call them all and
we will see if we should take some action.

668
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:41,863
What the fuck?!

669
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:55,053
WHAT THE FUCK?!

670
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:59,641
- What the fuck?!
- 825.000 bucks.

671
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:02,769
- Inside those trains of him?
- Nice inheritance.

672
01:20:03,353 --> 01:20:04,803
That sonofabitch.

673
01:20:04,959 --> 01:20:08,400
- All this time he was living from our money.
- Now we can have a nice holiday.

674
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:11,372
- Or buy stocks.
- We are rich now, Johnny.

675
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:13,196
Welcome to the club.

676
01:20:21,955 --> 01:20:23,771
- Hello?
- Hello...

677
01:20:23,772 --> 01:20:24,432
HELLO?

678
01:20:29,515 --> 01:20:32,487
- Hello.
- Hello, Wim? Is that you?

679
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:35,771
- Who's this?
- It's Max.

680
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:37,700
Ooooh, hi Max.

681
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:42,392
We have a meeting tomorrow at the
club around 7.30, can you make it?

682
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:43,956
Meeting?

683
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:48,231
Yeah what we discussed last time.
About the rotten elements in our neighbourhood.

684
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:51,047
Oh yes, ofcourse. Get rid of it.

685
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:55,562
- We must have a meeting then.
- Tomorrow at 7.30pm

686
01:20:57,459 --> 01:21:02,100
That's a damn good plan, man.
We must determine our tactics.

687
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:04,133
Everybody is coming.

688
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,026
Good. Wonderful.

689
01:21:07,626 --> 01:21:10,858
- Are you going to tell it to Jolanda?
- Jolanda?

690
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:17,115
- Of course I will.
- Ok then, I will see you tomorrow.

691
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:21,285
Yeah

692
01:21:28,668 --> 01:21:33,277
I dont like it, you will get in trouble
with those purses.

693
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:36,008
The purses are good, real crocodile leather.

694
01:21:36,009 --> 01:21:39,095
- Crocodiles
- Mom, crocodiles.

695
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:40,732
- Johnny, you want more?
- Yeah, thanks.

696
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:00,491
- I dont know, Johnny.
- What, mom?

697
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:03,880
- That girl inside our house.
- Jolanda?

698
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:07,373
- It's a different kind of people.
- But that's not her fault.

699
01:22:07,498 --> 01:22:08,958
We should give her a chance.

700
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:14,620
- Are you sure she's not after our money.
- How could she know about that money?

701
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,322
I hope you know what you're doing, son.

702
01:22:18,822 --> 01:22:21,632
She loves me, mom.
And I love her too.

703
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,147
And who are you?

704
01:22:32,231 --> 01:22:33,597
Where's my wife?

705
01:22:34,692 --> 01:22:37,090
Oh, I didn't recognize you without
your silly outfit.

706
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:39,384
I know she's here.
Jolanda!

707
01:22:39,385 --> 01:22:41,522
- What do you want from her?
- Who's this, Johnny?

708
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,963
I want to talk to her.
I'm still her lawful husband.

709
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:48,769
Jolanda! Your lawful husband
wants to speak with you.

710
01:22:49,029 --> 01:22:52,251
- I dont want to see him.
- Jolanda, we should talk.

711
01:22:52,252 --> 01:22:53,919
She said that she doesn't want to see you.

712
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,442
Is everything okay with you?
Did they abuse you?

713
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:58,570
I think it's better if you get lost.

714
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:06,182
Dirty sonofabitch.
I will get you for this.

715
01:23:10,144 --> 01:23:13,585
- Wim Kruisman?
- They threw him out of the house.

716
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,713
- What was he doing there?
- I've no idea.

717
01:23:17,183 --> 01:23:19,424
I will ask him at the meeting tomorrow.

718
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,387
- Maybe he was trying to negotiate.
- That's brave of him.

719
01:23:23,647 --> 01:23:26,515
That woman... is extremely dangerous.

720
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:28,392
You can see how stubborn they are.

721
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,520
They have to leave our neighbourhood.
There's no other way.

722
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:52,791
Hey Van Kooten!

723
01:23:56,649 --> 01:24:00,611
That situation with the family
seems to be getting out of hand.

724
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:03,792
I've heard that the neighbours
are organizing themselves.

725
01:24:04,157 --> 01:24:06,659
I thought you had everything under control.

726
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:11,664
- I assumed there was a bit of motivation...
- Stop talking nonsense.

727
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,792
The mayor himself is also
breathing down my neck.

728
01:24:15,626 --> 01:24:18,129
One of the neighbours is
a close friend of him.

729
01:24:18,546 --> 01:24:22,029
And we cannot take a risk
concerning our city policy.

730
01:24:22,508 --> 01:24:24,177
I'm going to that meeting tonight.

731
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:26,575
I'm convinced they are just overreacting.

732
01:24:26,992 --> 01:24:30,120
These are smart people that can
be reasoned with.

733
01:24:30,124 --> 01:24:32,205
You understand that this
is your last chance.

734
01:24:32,216 --> 01:24:35,004
I can't help you anymore.
Only one small thing has to happen...

735
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:37,210
And we all lose our head.
You understand.

736
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:54,488
- Mom?
- Yeah.

737
01:24:55,249 --> 01:24:58,273
- Me and Jolanda want to tell you something.
- Oh yeah?

738
01:24:59,775 --> 01:25:02,861
We eh, decided today to become engaged.

739
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,364
That's nice, son.

740
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,752
I'm 27 and I want something steady.

741
01:25:09,524 --> 01:25:13,184
- To lose my wild hairs.
- That's nice, son.

742
01:25:13,601 --> 01:25:16,136
We want to celebrate it tonight
and we will invite everybody.

743
01:25:16,137 --> 01:25:17,735
- Everybody?
- The whole neighbourhood.

744
01:25:17,928 --> 01:25:19,388
Is that a smart thing to do?

745
01:25:19,753 --> 01:25:23,090
Tonight is going to be one big party.
We forget what has happened.

746
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:24,445
Alright, son.

747
01:25:34,559 --> 01:25:36,019
It will always be my son.

748
01:25:47,802 --> 01:25:50,982
I hope someone is home here.
- The lights are on.

749
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:20,470
That was the babysitter, everyone
is to a meeting at the tennisclub.

750
01:26:20,471 --> 01:26:23,775
Aint that something, what kind of meeting?
- She didn't know that.

751
01:26:23,776 --> 01:26:25,590
Let's check it out then.

752
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,809
The radical behaviour of these people
is really out of control.

753
01:26:37,435 --> 01:26:42,179
As the nextdoor neighbour
I know what I'm talking about.

754
01:26:42,784 --> 01:26:48,957
Since their arrival there hasn't been
a minute that we could enjoy our rest.

755
01:26:49,009 --> 01:26:51,668
My wife has to take pills to fall asleep.

756
01:26:51,929 --> 01:26:55,380
They search through other people's garbage.
Their behaviour is obscene.

757
01:26:55,381 --> 01:26:58,706
The stench around that house is unbearable.

758
01:26:59,853 --> 01:27:01,313
And the worst thing is...

759
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:05,275
That they, without any motivation,
hit my wife...

760
01:27:05,692 --> 01:27:08,716
and other of our fellow neighbours.

761
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:12,105
Mr. chairman, I really dont
want to discriminate...

762
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:15,679
but we dont tolerate this
behaviour in our neighbourhood.

763
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,641
Thank you.

764
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:30,144
Mr. chairman, I think we are
rushing into things here.

765
01:27:30,175 --> 01:27:33,793
I think it's a little out of line
to start a witch hunt already.

766
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:37,495
They come from a different social class.
But they are still human beings.

767
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:40,089
They drove my son off the road
with his new car.

768
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:41,631
And destroyed my garden.

769
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,846
They bothered my daughter.
They are filthy people.

770
01:27:44,847 --> 01:27:46,619
And they walk around with weapons.

771
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,477
They threated my son with a knife
and destroyed his bicycle.

772
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:52,322
Our houses are dropping in value.

773
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:56,055
They just lived here and my
golden pen was missing already.

774
01:27:56,201 --> 01:28:00,017
But Victor, it was in your other jacket.

775
01:28:00,695 --> 01:28:04,418
It's not about that.
It's the principle that counts.

776
01:28:04,419 --> 01:28:08,797
Please, let us try to see
the case in the right form.

777
01:28:08,798 --> 01:28:12,764
They are criminals! My cousin is a
police officer and knows all about them.

778
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:16,290
- They should get at least 25 years.
- They are extremely dangerous!

779
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,630
- They are scum.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

780
01:28:19,568 --> 01:28:23,478
Let's proceed this meeting
without any problems.

781
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:27,255
I want to give the word to Mr. Wijberg

782
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:30,673
As the neighbour across the street
he knows the family best. Mr. Wijnberg.

783
01:28:32,133 --> 01:28:37,242
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I will keep it short...

784
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:44,666
- It seems like everybody is here.
- Great, then we can invite them all at once.

785
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,504
I want to see their faces.
Do you think they will be surprised?

786
01:28:47,506 --> 01:28:48,816
I think they will.

787
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:57,366
And yesterday they threw
Wim Kruisman out of the house.

788
01:28:57,742 --> 01:29:01,902
Wim. We know him for years
as a reasonable person.

789
01:29:04,248 --> 01:29:09,045
Mr. Chairman, I think this tyranny
should not be tolerated any longer.

790
01:29:09,046 --> 01:29:11,652
And... and... that...

791
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:22,850
Hey Sjakie, I didn't know you
were a member of the tennisclub.

792
01:29:22,851 --> 01:29:25,001
Johnny, this is not the right moment...

793
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:27,292
- This is Jolanda
- Hello.

794
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:30,733
I've a surprise for you Sjakie
after the meeting is over.

795
01:29:30,754 --> 01:29:32,193
Shhtt Johnny.

796
01:29:32,819 --> 01:29:36,885
Sorry for interupting you, neighbour.
Please continue.

797
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:37,949
Eh yeah...

798
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:46,530
Maybe it's ehm... indeed better
Mr. Chairman.

799
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:51,275
That we dont raise the
contribution this year.

800
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:53,214
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

801
01:29:54,507 --> 01:29:55,550
Wonderful.

802
01:29:56,019 --> 01:29:58,052
Everything becomes so expensive always.

803
01:29:59,725 --> 01:30:01,180
- Johnny, I must tell you...
- Later Sjakie, later.

804
01:30:02,275 --> 01:30:06,550
I believe eh this was our
last speaker for now.

805
01:30:06,561 --> 01:30:07,332
Good!

806
01:30:11,169 --> 01:30:14,537
Well then eh...
ehm.

807
01:30:15,007 --> 01:30:18,698
I wanted to use this oppertunity
to make an announcement.

808
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:26,257
Jolanda Kruisman and I decided
today eh... to be engaged.

809
01:30:31,419 --> 01:30:34,651
I wont interupt you any longer.
You're still in a meeting. I know.

810
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:38,561
There were some problems with us and the
neighbourhood, but let's forget about it.

811
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:43,744
Tonight, there will be a
big party at our house.

812
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:46,642
And everyone here is invited.

813
01:30:47,477 --> 01:30:48,467
Thank you.

814
01:30:53,243 --> 01:30:55,839
- See you later, Sjakie.
- Ehhh Johnny.

815
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:08,644
Does Wim know about this?

816
01:31:08,956 --> 01:31:11,198
- Where is Wim?
- I did call him.

817
01:31:11,463 --> 01:31:13,753
A party. What are they thinking.

818
01:31:13,754 --> 01:31:16,443
It's out of the question that
we go to that party.

819
01:31:16,444 --> 01:31:18,317
- Why not? Free booze.
- Yeah!

820
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:22,407
It's outragious that someone like that
is getting engaged with one of our people.

821
01:31:22,408 --> 01:31:25,807
- I didn't even know that Wim had a divorce.
- That woman is not normal.

822
01:31:26,109 --> 01:31:28,664
Last year she was driving naked
through our neighbourhood.

823
01:31:28,665 --> 01:31:32,147
I want to see if it is really
as bad as people are saying.

824
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:34,214
I dont want to be involved with that scum!

825
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:36,639
It's interesting to see how
these people are living.

826
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,944
Ladies and gentlemen!

827
01:31:38,361 --> 01:31:42,229
I dont know if it is a good
idea to go there later...

828
01:31:42,688 --> 01:31:45,660
because of the nature of our meeting.

829
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:47,328
It seems like a nice gesture.

830
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:50,821
A sign that they want to live
in harmony with the neighbourhood.

831
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:53,167
I dont think we should reject this offer.

832
01:31:54,106 --> 01:31:57,964
Also, I dont think the city will
appreciate a rejection like this.

833
01:31:58,329 --> 01:32:01,613
They wont see this as
an example of good will.

834
01:32:02,343 --> 01:32:06,827
I wont say that the yearly subsidy
of this club will be cancelled.

835
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,789
But I'll advise you to reconsider
this matter for sure.

836
01:32:13,552 --> 01:32:17,567
Maybe it's not such a bad eh... idea

837
01:32:17,568 --> 01:32:21,529
to accept their invitation, but
everyone should know for themselves.

838
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:38,421
For godsake, let's do this.
But no longer than 5 minutes.

839
01:32:39,067 --> 01:32:41,549
At least we've showed our good will.

840
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,755
- I rather have a glass of red wine.
- Sure, we have got everything.

841
01:33:06,756 --> 01:33:09,389
Can you get a bottle of red wine
for the lady here.

842
01:33:09,401 --> 01:33:13,612
The men will drink a glass with me, right.
After all, it's a party.

843
01:33:39,107 --> 01:33:41,922
- Hey Sjakie, are you doin' well?
- Yeah!

844
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:44,424
You can see that we also
know how to throw a party.

845
01:33:44,633 --> 01:33:49,012
- I'm glad everything came out okay.
- Ofcourse Sjakie, what did you think.

846
01:33:49,534 --> 01:33:51,932
You gave everyone quite a scare.

847
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:55,686
- That was harmless.
- But to get engaged so fast.

848
01:33:56,103 --> 01:33:59,179
Your problem is that you take
everything too seriously.

849
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,378
Perhaps.

850
01:34:00,847 --> 01:34:05,643
- And Wim? Did you invite him?
- He doesn't like parties.

851
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:15,600
Your papers!

852
01:34:16,435 --> 01:34:18,312
I'm sorry colonel.
I didn't recognize you.

853
01:34:25,351 --> 01:34:28,896
- What's he doing here so late?
- It must be about that training tomorrow.

854
01:34:29,522 --> 01:34:31,451
He must be afraid that
they start without him.

855
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:47,613
You dont want to try a glass?

856
01:34:47,614 --> 01:34:49,719
- Are you sure I should do that.
- Just to be nice.

857
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,199
Alright, just one glass.

858
01:34:51,418 --> 01:34:53,660
- Ooh, Pepita!
- She's not going anywhere.

859
01:35:02,471 --> 01:35:04,765
- Hello.
- Hi.

860
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,325
How's your eye.

861
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:09,092
Great, the doctor says I'm
allowed to see everything again.

862
01:35:09,144 --> 01:35:11,334
I'm sorry about what happened.

863
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:13,732
We got you back pretty bad as well.

864
01:35:14,202 --> 01:35:16,078
You didn't get me.

865
01:35:18,668 --> 01:35:24,420
- It must hurt a lot to make that, right.
- No, taking it off, that hurts a lot.

866
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:27,548
You are one awesome woman, you know that!

867
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:30,051
Is that fun, being a surgeon?

868
01:35:30,322 --> 01:35:35,056
The human body is one of
the most fascinating...

869
01:35:35,473 --> 01:35:37,454
... things that exist.

870
01:35:50,436 --> 01:35:54,242
- I'm starting to feel more at home.
- Oh yeah?

871
01:35:54,243 --> 01:35:58,465
- I really enjoy it here.
- I thought it was temporary.

872
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:02,166
Hey you...
I dont like your face.

873
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:04,356
Get the fuck out of here!

874
01:36:09,205 --> 01:36:11,759
Let's keep it nice in here.

875
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:22,499
What's that?

876
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,750
What?

877
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,731
That rumbling noise.

878
01:36:35,283 --> 01:36:36,753
What the hell?!!

879
01:36:38,453 --> 01:36:39,620
WATCH OUT!

880
01:37:44,456 --> 01:37:45,499
Pepita?

881
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:49,565
Where are you?

882
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:52,016
Pepita!

883
01:38:40,397 --> 01:38:41,805
Thanks, Johnny.

884
01:38:42,222 --> 01:38:45,142
If I can do anything back.
A second hand car.

885
01:38:45,402 --> 01:38:47,748
Neighbour, this is Kareltje.
A friend of mine.

886
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:48,635
How are you?

887
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:53,314
Are you interested in some
real crocodile leather purses?

888
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:54,422
Who's this?

889
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:58,082
Sjakie!
Hey Sjakie!

890
01:38:58,879 --> 01:39:00,423
Telephone for you.

891
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,338
For me?

892
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:08,603
Hello?

893
01:39:10,281 --> 01:39:13,316
Hey you, keep it clean in here!

894
01:39:17,935 --> 01:39:21,428
Mrs. Flodder, I have a big
surprise for you later.

895
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:24,777
Oh really Sjakie? I've a big
surprise for you later on.

896
01:39:33,924 --> 01:39:35,467
Do you think there's
something going on?

897
01:39:36,443 --> 01:39:38,320
Hello precinct, here's 507.

898
01:39:38,841 --> 01:39:41,365
507, what's up Kees?

899
01:39:41,448 --> 01:39:44,472
Herman, do you know anything
about a party on the Netelroad...

900
01:39:44,514 --> 01:39:48,330
- At the house of that Flodder scum.
- We know nothing about that.

901
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:52,032
I want to check it out
because I dont trust it.

902
01:39:52,136 --> 01:39:57,287
Hold on Kees, I just got a call.
A tank has been spotted on the Klaprooslaan.

903
01:39:57,349 --> 01:39:59,695
- That's near you guys.
- A tank?!

904
01:40:01,385 --> 01:40:04,127
Ehm, okay Herman, we will check it out.

905
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:20,028
- What the hell?!!
- Let's have a talk with him.

906
01:40:44,453 --> 01:40:46,437
Hello, papers please.

907
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,122
Say Kees, did you eat Chinese or what.

908
01:41:50,685 --> 01:41:52,308
Pepita.

909
01:41:56,062 --> 01:41:59,242
Little Pepita, where are you hiding?

910
01:42:13,631 --> 01:42:15,540
Like eh, this?

911
01:42:21,973 --> 01:42:22,891
Nice eh!

912
01:42:22,892 --> 01:42:25,398
- Does it take long to feel something?
- No, not so long.

913
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:26,561
I dont feel anything yet.

914
01:42:32,609 --> 01:42:34,792
Do you want another whiskey?

915
01:42:34,793 --> 01:42:37,666
No, I've to perform a
transplantion tomorrow.

916
01:42:38,604 --> 01:42:40,794
Okay, just a small one then.

917
01:42:53,828 --> 01:42:57,302
Ho ho, you have to pay first.
I've no money with me.

918
01:42:57,304 --> 01:42:59,354
You'll have to pay otherwise
you wont get in.

919
01:42:59,368 --> 01:43:00,856
American Express?

920
01:43:03,525 --> 01:43:05,715
First a nice trip to celebrate.

921
01:43:06,184 --> 01:43:08,634
- I want to go to a warm country.
- Well not too warm.

922
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:10,980
A country far away.

923
01:43:11,971 --> 01:43:14,995
And I've to get a job.
Something for the long term.

924
01:43:15,829 --> 01:43:18,957
With the police or something.
With sirens. I'd like that.

925
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:50,656
I ehm, I will be right back, Kees.

926
01:44:01,187 --> 01:44:04,211
- What's going on here, Van Kooten?
- They are having a party.

927
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:07,756
- For all the neighbours.
- You didn't tell me about this!

928
01:44:08,851 --> 01:44:11,718
And it seems you are having
a good time yourself.

929
01:44:12,396 --> 01:44:15,420
Mr. Flodder, this is the chairman
of the city council.

930
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:18,266
- He has a surprise for you.
- What kind of surprise?

931
01:44:18,287 --> 01:44:19,956
Mrs. Flodder...

932
01:44:20,686 --> 01:44:24,168
It's my pleasure to tell you that
the city has succeeded...

933
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:26,629
in finding suitable accommodation for you.

934
01:44:26,631 --> 01:44:29,236
If you want, you can settle in tomorrow.

935
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:32,729
I dont need another house.
I've just bought this one this afternoon.

936
01:44:32,737 --> 01:44:33,812
An inheritance.

937
01:44:33,928 --> 01:44:36,222
- But, eh.
- I like this neighbourhood.

938
01:44:36,378 --> 01:44:37,838
Bought it?!!

939
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,018
Why didn't you tell me?

940
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:44,147
What the hell is going
on here, Van Kooten!

941
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:18,720
Wake up, Arie!  Arie!

942
01:46:19,919 --> 01:46:21,118
BOOM!

943
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:48,177
I got you!

944
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:20,553
Is everybody here?

945
01:47:21,231 --> 01:47:22,951
Hey, look at that!

946
01:47:25,297 --> 01:47:28,373
Typically Sjakie,
never knows when to quit

947
01:47:30,438 --> 01:47:33,483
Parties are nice, but they
always leave such a mess.

948
01:48:03,513 --> 01:48:06,953
Hey watch out with that clock,
it belonged to your grandmother.

949
01:48:07,266 --> 01:48:09,769
- Mom!  Someone here from the newspaper.
- Newspaper?

950
01:48:10,082 --> 01:48:12,793
Peters, Daily Breaker.
You must remember me.

951
01:48:14,305 --> 01:48:18,945
- Ehm, must have been quite a party.
- We enjoyed ourselves.

952
01:48:18,945 --> 01:48:22,803
- You are leaving again?
- Yeah, it's a rough neighbourhood.

953
01:48:23,793 --> 01:48:26,556
- Shall we make a picture?
- Picture?

954
01:48:30,258 --> 01:48:33,438
Kids, come here!
They want to make a picture!

955
01:48:36,254 --> 01:48:37,713
A bit more to the left.

956
01:48:38,756 --> 01:48:40,216
a bit to the right.

957
01:48:41,624 --> 01:48:42,718
Smile.

958
01:48:49,757 --> 01:48:50,956
Dear Sjakie...

959
01:48:51,477 --> 01:48:53,771
We are doing well.
How are you?

960
01:48:54,449 --> 01:48:57,838
We want to thank you a lot for
all the things you've done for us.

961
01:48:58,046 --> 01:49:02,947
We really appreciate that we can stay
in your summerhouse in the South of France.

962
01:49:03,312 --> 01:49:05,868
Everyone wishes you well
and give their regards.
