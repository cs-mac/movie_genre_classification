1
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:28,223
Lackawanna 8-799.

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,374
Hello. Hello.

3
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:42,875
I'm so afraid to close my eyes

4
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:44,341
Afraid that I'll find

5
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,607
- That was mighty pretty, honey.
- Oh, hello.

6
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:53,945
Say, are you doing anything
tomorrow after the matinee?

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,610
- No.
- How would you like to get married?

8
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,189
- Well, you got someone in mind?
- Yes. Me.

9
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:03,691
Well, best offer I had today.
Suppose I think it over?

10
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,124
All right, you take your time.
I'll hold on.

11
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,024
OK.

12
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:14,499
This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion

13
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:20,065
With my eyes wide open

14
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:27,843
Do I deserve such a break?

15
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,484
You know, I think I can make it.

16
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:39,451
Good. Oh, by the way,
what was that name again?

17
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,214
- Miller. Bill Miller.
- Oh, how nice.

18
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,721
- Well, good night, Mr. Miller.
- Now, one minute.

19
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:48,226
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm Mary Turner.

20
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,894
Good night, darling.
See you in church.

21
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,054
See you in church.

22
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:09,471
Mighty pretty. Mighty pretty.

23
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,668
Thank you, sir.

24
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,479
The agent's slice, Leo.
The usual ten percent.

25
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:18,411
Looks like a small cut to me.

26
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,643
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, honey.

27
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:25,013
And to you and Mary, the best of luck,
forever and a day.

28
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,656
- I'll miss you, Bill.
- I'm gonna miss you too, Ben.

29
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,313
You've been swell.
We had great years.

30
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:32,427
Why the gloom, boys?
This is a wedding, not a wake.

31
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,961
For the act, it's a wake. Bill's leaving.

32
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,293
Well, I want to play the big time
on my own, as a single.

33
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,093
Oh, is that so?

34
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:44,759
I tell you, you're out of your head,
quitting a great comic like Ben Bailey.

35
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,631
I did a single before.

36
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,466
I know a lot more now.
I've learned from Ben.

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,936
Listen, Bill,

38
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,099
when I found you in Scranton,
you were making a fast 60.

39
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:56,006
You had those flashy two-pants
suits and ragged underwear.

40
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,078
Who got you to play
that chest piano?

41
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,613
Who built you up to 1250?

42
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,908
Who bought you your first tuxedo?

43
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,018
- I did!
- Bill,

44
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,346
the trick in show business
is to be a hit.

45
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:11,012
With another guy, with a girl,
with a kangaroo, anything.

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,953
Look, you're my friend,
but I don't think you can make it alone.

47
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,117
Now, don't try to talk me out of it, boys.
I'm gonna start again in Scranton.

48
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:21,196
Alone. If I have anything,
I'll be back here again, alone.

49
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,264
My name will be on top, alone.

50
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,764
Maybe you should have
got married, alone.

51
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:29,131
I don't think you can stand two
talented people in the same family.

52
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,237
I'm sorry, fellas. I'm doing a single.

53
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,396
A singing, dancing, talking comedian.

54
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,542
I love you, Leo, but since an hour ago,
I have a wife to take care of.

55
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,499
I gotta start sometime.

56
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,577
OK. Start.

57
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:44,237
Well, what do you say, Leo,
do I make any sense?

58
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:47,644
If you really mean what you just said,
you make sense.

59
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,580
I think any man has a right
to do what he wants to...

60
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,347
...providing he doesn't hurt anyone.

61
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:55,887
But you've got to
have material, jokes.

62
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:58,957
Well, I have Al Borden writing
an act for me right now.

63
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,151
He's the greatest gagman
in America.

64
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:03,192
- You think so?
- I do.

65
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,626
That makes two of you. You and Al.

66
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,924
Now, look, Leo,
will you leave that to me?

67
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,159
All I want you to do is get the bookings
and you can start now.

68
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:16,862
Oh, there you are.
Say, isn't there something

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,507
about the groom dancing with
the bride on their wedding day?

70
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:23,633
I'll bet you made that up.
Will you excuse us, Leo?

71
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,239
- Well, Al Borden!
- Congratulations.

72
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,977
Glad you came.
Excuse me, will you, honey?

73
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,313
Say, are you serious?
You just got married.

74
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:39,785
Thank you, Mr. Borden,
for my first wedding present.

75
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,818
Leo.

76
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:45,620
- Mary needs a partner.
- Mary isn't the only one.

77
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,228
Al, listen...

78
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,498
You don't think he's doing
the right thing, do you?

79
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,293
You mean quitting Ben?

80
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,697
As an agent, no.

81
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,295
As a friend...

82
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:02,803
And what about me
leaving Sutherland?

83
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,674
Mary...

84
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:08,470
...you leaving Sutherland after
all your hard work? And mine?

85
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,136
Bill doesn't want me
to work anymore.

86
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,713
Love, he can handle, but I wish he'd
leave the business end of it to me.

87
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,818
You'll keep on looking out for him,
won't you, Leo?

88
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,886
For ten percent, I'd look after
my own mother-in-law.

89
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,794
Well, I wouldn't say she had buckteeth,
but she was the only girl I knew

90
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,624
that could eat an apple
through a picket fence.

91
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,398
That was funny.

92
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,624
And so I said to the fellow,

93
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:44,293
"If that's your wife, buddy,
you're in a lot of trouble."

94
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,301
That was funny, wasn't it?

95
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,567
- Yeah, that was funny 20 years ago.
- Well, don't worry.

96
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,200
Once Bill starts to warm them up,
the audience will really go.

97
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,870
They're going now.
Out of the theater.

98
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:59,072
"Short, short story.

99
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,615
"Ben Bailey broke in new partner,

100
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,776
"socko Baltimore, ditto Boston,
ditto Washington."

101
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:06,854
Here's the important part:

102
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,756
"Bill Miller, single, 12 minutes.

103
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:12,256
"Lays egg in Newark,

104
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:15,293
"ditto Camden, ditto Wilkes-Barre,
ditto Scranton."

105
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:17,725
- That wiseacre! I'll call those guys...
- Shut up!

106
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,797
- What?
- I said, shut up.

107
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,093
You've got yourself in a spot
because you got a swellhead.

108
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,996
Some fairy godmother
must have whispered to you

109
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:27,865
and told you that you
don't need nobody.

110
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,768
Well, you better stop listening
to pixies and listen to your agent.

111
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,271
You're not a single,
you never will be.

112
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,774
You're a nice guy, and you got talent,
and you got a nice wife,

113
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,638
but you're gonna blow them all off
if you don't start listening!

114
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:41,404
Want to hear what's wrong
with your act?

115
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,049
Well, sit down,
because I'm gonna tell you.

116
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:47,845
You think that you can come out
and sing and be cute.

117
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,486
Well, cute songs
are a nickel a dozen.

118
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:53,180
You need a new opening.
A comedy song and two funny stories.

119
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:56,155
Not those broken-down jokes
from Al Borden.

120
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,725
And a finish.
Did you ever hear about that?

121
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,760
A "San Francisco" finish.

122
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,489
Cohan did it with a flag.
It's the most important thing of all!

123
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,930
- Well, it's easy to tell me about it.
- Yeah? Well, here's how you do it.

124
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,763
You go down to any
music publishing house,

125
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,666
and you get one of those
schnook song pluggers.

126
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,170
You put him out in the audience,
then you introduce him.

127
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,807
- But I don't want any...
- Yes, there you go again!

128
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,876
He's not your partner, he's a stooge!

129
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:22,878
All you have to say is,

130
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,412
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're very
lucky to have in the audience

131
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:28,982
"this afternoon a Mr. Sam Jones
or Mr. Bruce Anybody,

132
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,381
"the author of that big song hit,
'Your Father's Mustache'

133
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,884
"or 'Your Uncle's Pistol'."

134
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:37,649
Then you roust the guy around.
The audience laughs. It's sock.

135
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:39,189
You think that'll be good?

136
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,758
What do you want,
a sworn affidavit?

137
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:45,129
I'll call Sam Robertson
and get you a guy.

138
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,463
Now, get out of here, I'm busy.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,158
Hello?

140
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:54,495
Hello, Leo.

141
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,467
Yeah. Song plugger?

142
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,333
Oh, no, Leo, I need all I've got.

143
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,772
Wait a minute, Leo, wait a minute.

144
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,380
I think I've got just the boy for you.

145
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,912
Yes. Oh, you'll love this kid.

146
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,712
Sure, you can pay him
what I pay him, 15 dollars a week.

147
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:20,787
Yeah, he loves to sing
and he's smart as a whip.

148
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,322
That's right.

149
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:25,392
OK, Leo. Goodbye.

150
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,551
Miss Reagan,

151
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,821
what did that idiot do this time?

152
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,396
He dropped a stack of records.

153
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,691
- Is he bleeding?
- No, I don't think so.

154
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,334
Oh, too bad.

155
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,368
Well, anyway, I think
we're going to lose him.

156
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,600
You mean they're gonna come
and take him away?

157
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:45,105
No, but I've just put over the biggest
business deal of my career.

158
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,801
- Where is he?
- He's on his lunch hour.

159
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,945
He's allowed 30 minutes.

160
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:53,308
Well, take his head out of the feedbag
and tell him I want to see him.

161
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:55,846
He's very insistent
on that full half-hour.

162
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,314
He puts great stress
on proper nourishment.

163
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,452
You tell him I want
to see him right away!

164
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,281
- Yes, sir.
- Miss Reagan.

165
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:05,218
Tell me the truth.
Do you honestly think he's human?

166
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,484
I've heard people bet both ways.

167
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,570
Stick around, mister.
There'll be a spot in just a minute.

168
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,104
Never mind.

169
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,339
I would like to have...

170
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,506
Could I...?

171
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,149
Could I get a...?

172
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,712
I would like to have a... A glass...

173
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,183
What'll it be, bud?

174
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,344
Oh, I'd like a glass
of hot water, please.

175
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,790
- Hot water.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:06,932
Thank you.

177
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,400
- What'll you have with it?
- Oh, that's all.

178
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,096
That's all?

179
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:15,072
- Just hot water?
- Yeah, I want it for my tea.

180
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,016
You've got a nerve.

181
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:32,314
Driving away my customers
and making your own tea!

182
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,479
Now, get out here! Beat it!

183
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:38,148
You take your hands off me! I'll pay
you for the hot water, here's a nickel.

184
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,395
Now, get out of here
and quit taking up space!

185
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:42,756
Don't you put your hands on me!
I'll call a policeman!

186
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,988
I paid for the hot water
and this a public restaurant

187
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:48,157
and I've got a perfect right to sit here.
That's the law.

188
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,733
- The law?
- You heard me.

189
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:52,530
Look it up yourself in the code book
of the City of New York!

190
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:55,298
Article nine, paragraph six, revised.

191
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:59,408
And I got friends on the force.
Don't you give me no trouble.

192
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:03,174
Excuse me.

193
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,820
Well...

194
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,882
...you got everything.

195
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,889
That saves me a lot of trouble.

196
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,621
Yeah, my mother makes
my lunch every morning,

197
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,058
so I don't ruin my stomach
in these sloppy hash houses.

198
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,596
Don't you touch me,
I got friends on the force!

199
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:46,872
Thank you.

200
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,849
I don't use pepper.

201
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,652
Sugar?

202
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,550
Oh, thank you. I beg your pardon.

203
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,725
Cream or lemon?

204
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,361
Oh, I always use cream.

205
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,861
- Cream.
- But don't bother. I brung my own.

206
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,531
I'm just trying to be helpful.

207
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,635
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

208
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,469
That sandwich.

209
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,709
Wouldn't you like me
to toast it for you?

210
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,776
Oh, would you?

211
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,804
That's it!

212
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:31,849
Oh, you broke the whole hand!
You deformed me!

213
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,424
Now, I won't be able to play
with the other children!

214
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:37,857
What are you yapping about?
You still got four fingers left.

215
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:41,121
Yeah, but when I grow up,
I might want to play the piano, maybe.

216
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,232
You're running a very
unsanitary establishment.

217
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,993
You can rest assured, I'm going to
report you to the Board of Health!

218
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,192
Ted! I've been looking
all over for you!

219
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,270
Mr. Robertson wants to see you
right away. Come on.

220
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,699
Why didn't you find me sooner?

221
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:55,433
I'm never coming back here again!
You just lost a customer!

222
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,409
Oh, Ted, here's that
phonograph handle you wanted.

223
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,379
Oh, thanks, Duzik. I'll give you the
money for it on payday. Miss Reagan...

224
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,642
Hurry up. You're three minutes
past your half-hour.

225
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:10,342
- Yeah, but Miss Reagan...
- Ted!

226
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:27,932
I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson.
I'll give you the money for it on payday.

227
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:32,865
Careful, Ted, don't cut
your throat on my time.

228
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,831
Mr. Robertson, it was an accident!
I didn't mean to do it.

229
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:37,666
I had Duzik's phonograph handle

230
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,740
and I was just gonna knock
on the door, that's all.

231
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,569
- Come in, boy.
- Don't pick on a little guy.

232
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,540
It's all right, don't get excited.

233
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:45,906
Sit down, son.

234
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,446
- Me?
- Yes, sit down.

235
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,876
Well, Bill, there's your man.

236
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,612
Hit where there's padding.
Hit where there's padding!

237
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,186
- Come on, kid.
- What do I do?

238
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,186
Just go right ahead with him,
that's all.

239
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,881
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
- Grab those, huh, kid?

240
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,256
- You want I should go with him?
- More than anything in the world.

241
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:12,561
I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson.
I'll pay you for that on payday.

242
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,935
He sings too, huh?

243
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,938
Good luck, Mr. Miller.

244
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,243
Hello, sweetie.

245
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,915
Myrtle Theatre, Brooklyn.

246
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,691
How are you, sweetheart?

247
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:55,093
You wouldn't mind telling me
where you were the last hour?

248
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,130
I was working, doll.
I was getting some new jokes.

249
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:59,029
- I'll bet.
- From Al Borden.

250
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,726
Why don't you marry him?

251
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,360
- That's not funny.
- Neither are his jokes.

252
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,542
Mary. Mary...

253
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,275
...I'm sorry.
- That's very nice of you.

254
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,540
Well, I am. You know how
important this is to me.

255
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,013
Well, I'm pretty fed up.

256
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,583
Ever since the day we were married,
all I've heard is Al Borden

257
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,879
and his jokes and the act.

258
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,989
That's a fine way to talk.
You know I'm trying to make good.

259
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:31,148
All right, then, let's not talk.

260
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:37,887
Mary!

261
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,162
Hey!

262
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,927
Oh, take care of this, will you, kid, and
I'll see you in the dressing room. Mary!

263
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,002
Six dollars, buster.

264
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,161
Oh, that's very reasonable
for such a nice cab.

265
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,431
Now, hold it.
That's the fare, birdbrain.

266
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,405
Now, pay me or
I'll charge you for waiting.

267
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,118
You don't believe in keeping
all your eggs in one basket, do you?

268
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,118
Wait a minute, that's only five.
I said six, didn't I?

269
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,435
- Could I have some back?
- What?

270
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:33,401
Well, then could I just have a nickel
for carfare or a cup of coffee?

271
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:36,507
You panhandler.

272
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:46,774
Hey!

273
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,280
Lover, when I'm near you

274
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:56,115
And I hear you speak my name

275
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,689
Softly...

276
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,415
Quiet!

277
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:03,527
Oh, please get out of the way.
Our cue is on.

278
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:08,095
Lover, when we're dancing

279
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,926
- Quiet.
- Quiet, schmiet.

280
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,566
You try and be quiet.

281
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,135
You try and be quiet,
carrying these bags.

282
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:19,104
...entrancing music dies

283
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,508
Still mad?

284
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,541
No, how can I stay angry with you?

285
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,145
I'm sorry about last night,
but it's like I told you, honey.

286
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,247
I want to get up there
where you'll be proud of me.

287
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,974
And sometimes I'm in such a hurry,
I just get carried away.

288
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,946
- Oh, come on in, kid.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Miller,

289
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,748
- But if you won't need me anymore...
- Put the big one up there.

290
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:45,382
Watch that. Easy!

291
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,791
- Yes?
- Five minutes, Mr. Miller.

292
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:51,625
OK.

293
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,766
Mr. Miller, would you like
me to put this away?

294
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,628
Yeah.

295
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,829
Come on, let's go, Mary.

296
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,639
Come on, kid!

297
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:07,370
Mr. Miller, I better be getting back.
Mr. Robertson's gonna miss me.

298
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:09,374
- See that box?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,410
- You go on up there.
- Oh, to see the show?

300
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,945
Thanks, Mr. Miller.

301
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:17,146
- For free?
- Yeah. Go right through there.

302
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,579
Good luck, darling.

303
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,183
And good luck to you too.

304
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,051
You're on.

305
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,623
Oh, I'm sorry, lady!

306
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,901
Oh, that's all right.

307
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,264
Ask the sky above

308
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:54,997
And ask the earth below

309
00:20:55,173 --> 00:21:00,166
Why I'm so in love
And why I love you so

310
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:04,503
Couldn't tell you though I try, dear

311
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,240
Just why, dear, I'm yours

312
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:12,008
When you went away

313
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,983
You left a glowing spark

314
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:19,921
Trying to be gay
Is whistling in the dark

315
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:24,221
I am only what you make me

316
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,589
Come take me

317
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,025
I'm yours

318
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,529
How happy

319
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:33,466
I would be to beg and borrow

320
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:37,230
Or sorrow with you

321
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:40,703
Even though I knew tomorrow

322
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:45,207
You'd say we were through

323
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:49,345
If we drift apart

324
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:52,004
Then I'll be lost alone

325
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:57,085
Though you use my heart
For just a stepping stone

326
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:02,348
How can I help dreaming of you

327
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:05,490
I love you

328
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,220
I'm yours

329
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,196
You brought me out for this?

330
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,629
Take it easy, Frank.

331
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,595
Thank you. And now, ladies...

332
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:25,900
Thank you. All right, all right.

333
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,632
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

334
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,300
Now I have a treat for you.
Something you're getting for nothing.

335
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:32,672
Did you ever hear of a fellow
named Jimmy Lyons?

336
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:34,710
For your information,
Jimmy Lyons is the fellow

337
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,940
that wrote one of the
greatest hits around today.

338
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,605
A song called "For You".

339
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:40,911
- Is he kidding?
- Give him a chance.

340
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:43,679
And it just so happens we have
Jimmy Lyons in our audience today.

341
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:47,448
Let's have him take a bow.
House lights!

342
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:55,888
- No, you!
- Me?

343
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,157
Come on, stand up,
take a bow. Don't be shy.

344
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,300
Get up. Come on.

345
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, lady! Lady!

346
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:08,933
Lady! Lady! Oh, lady!

347
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:11,075
Mr. Miller!

348
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,787
- Gee, you're strong.
- You're cute.

349
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:32,916
- I'm getting out of here!
- Oh, no!

350
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,889
Come on, let's get him to sing, huh?
Come on, applaud.

351
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:43,055
Go on. Don't be stuck up. Sing.

352
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,894
All right.

353
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,102
Nothing came out.

354
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,033
Hit it.

355
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,637
Ask the sky above

356
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,278
And ask the earth below

357
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:04,837
Why I'm so in love

358
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,348
And why I love you so

359
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:13,111
Couldn't tell you though I try, dear

360
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,553
Just why, dear

361
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm yours

362
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:22,026
When you went away

363
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,924
You left a glowing spark

364
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,531
Trying to be gay

365
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,826
Is like whistling in the dark

366
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:36,064
I am only what you make me

367
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:39,498
What are you laughing at?

368
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,734
Say, what kind of a voice
do you have?

369
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,435
Until I was 18, I was a soprano.

370
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:46,443
Soprano?

371
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:49,446
Yeah, but then my mother
told me I was born a boy.

372
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,049
Don't tell me you were born.

373
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,852
What do you think,
I came from an egg?

374
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:55,452
No, the chicken would have buried it.

375
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,315
Ha-ha. Well, my mother loves me.

376
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,888
I'll bet she was disappointed,
I'll bet she wanted a child.

377
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:04,684
She got one! Look up the records.
I was born at the Mercy Hospital.

378
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,591
- What's the matter, were you sick?
- No, I wanted to be near my mother.

379
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:11,329
Mercy Hospital.
That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

380
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,295
What's wrong with Brooklyn?

381
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,992
Any big men born in Brooklyn?

382
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,069
No, just babies.

383
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,929
How about "For You"?

384
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,537
- For you? How about for me?
- No, what about it?

385
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,006
How about what?

386
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:27,940
"For You".

387
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:30,971
- You said that!
- I know it.

388
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:32,546
What about it?

389
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:35,275
- Sing it.
- Sing what?

390
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:38,644
- "For You".
- I don't know it!

391
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,287
Well, "Who's Your Little Whozis?"

392
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,751
None of your business!

393
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,549
No, I mean, sing it!

394
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,953
All right, but stop hollering.

395
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,783
- I'll start it.
- Go ahead.

396
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:51,853
Hit it.

397
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,193
Who's your little whozis?

398
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,856
Who's your little whozis?

399
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,661
Who's your turtledove?

400
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:01,326
Who's your turtledove?

401
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:03,300
Who's your little whozis?

402
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,997
- Who do you
- Who do you

403
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:08,266
You don't wanna help me?

404
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,908
Who's your little whatzis?

405
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:11,566
Who's your little whatzis?

406
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,406
That you're dreaming of

407
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,103
That you're dreaming of

408
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,578
Who's your little whozis?

409
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,341
Who do you love?

410
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,280
Who do you love?

411
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:25,148
Tell me who has you aflutter

412
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:28,552
Whenever they're passing by?

413
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:31,556
Melts your heart like butter

414
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:35,354
Oh, me! Oh, my! Say

415
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,861
- When you get the blueses
- When you get the blueses

416
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,555
Who you thinking of?

417
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,461
Who you thinking of?

418
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,331
Who's your little whozis?

419
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,972
Who do you...

420
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,233
Who do you...

421
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,172
- Who do you...
- Love, love!

422
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,812
Oh. Love

423
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,379
Gee, you're cute!
Where you gonna play next week?

424
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:06,610
What are you, a wise guy?

425
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:14,719
- Just listen to them!
- Don't you think you should have...?

426
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,689
- The fellow take a bow?
- Who?

427
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,623
- The fellow in the box.
- Oh, sure.

428
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,895
See what I mean.
If you just keep punching...

429
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,499
Darling...

430
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:30,432
I don't know whether
I'll let you book him now.

431
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:35,566
Come in.

432
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:36,901
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Leo.

433
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:39,066
That's more like it.
Congratulations, Bill.

434
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,507
- You know Frank Darling here.
- Oh, hi, Frank.

435
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,305
- Mrs. Miller.
- Mrs. Miller, how do you do?

436
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,607
Well, Frank here wants to book you
on the Orpheum Circuit

437
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:46,806
for about ten or 12 weeks.

438
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:49,348
- What did I tell you, Mary?
- That's right.

439
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,145
You and what's-his-name.

440
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,083
- Who?
- The stooge in the box.

441
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,789
That's right. Where is he?

442
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,622
- Did you see him, Mary?
- No, dear.

443
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,854
- By the way, what's his name?
- What?

444
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,930
- What's his name?
- What's his name?

445
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:10,328
Well, no one told me.
I never saw him before.

446
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,331
That's fine. Leo...

447
00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:14,493
How should I know,
I've never seen him before either.

448
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,763
- Somebody better find him.
- You're not kidding.

449
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,498
And when you do,
put a ring through his nose.

450
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:25,509
Gee, Ma, I didn't know
he was gonna ask me to sing.

451
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,340
And everybody laughed at me.

452
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:31,142
Now, don't worry. It's all over.

453
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:34,874
I ran all the way home.

454
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,020
It's a wonder I didn't get
runned over.

455
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:41,054
Theodore, it's done with.
Don't make a big thing of it.

456
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:44,317
Big thing of it.
You should see this guy, Ma!

457
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:47,758
Boy, if he ever got his hands on me,
he'd probably choke me to death.

458
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,960
Ma! Ma! The man. The man's coming!

459
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,659
Who's coming?
What are you talking about?

460
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,498
- The guy! Ma, the guy with the act!
- Theodore!

461
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:04,436
Oh, Ma, I gotta get out of here!

462
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:08,472
Ma. Ma, don't say nothing. Ma.

463
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:10,202
Theodore. What are you doing?

464
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:12,642
Don't say a word.
Give me your glasses, Ma.

465
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:14,645
He won't know me.

466
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:16,109
Theodore!

467
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:21,008
- Coming!
- Theodore, where are you?

468
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,755
Wrong apartment.

469
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:32,254
- Does Ted Rogers live here?
- Ted Rogers?

470
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:35,864
Mother, didn't Ted say he was going
to South America this afternoon?

471
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:38,465
Oh, who do we know there?

472
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,659
Yes, that's right.
Yes, he left this afternoon.

473
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:43,736
Fine boy, fine boy, that Ted.
Smart as a whip.

474
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,166
Hey, what are you trying to do?

475
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:47,704
You wouldn't hit a man wearing
his mother's glasses, would you?

476
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:49,102
Now, look...

477
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,073
Why, Uncle Sholum,
how did you get here?

478
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:58,874
- No, Ma, it's me, Theodore!
- Oh.

479
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,908
Now, look here, mister, it wasn't my
fault those people laughed at me.

480
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:04,609
You should never have
got me to stand up

481
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:06,811
and you shouldn't have had them
put that light on me.

482
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:08,649
I didn't mean to...

483
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,256
- Well, I apologize.
- You apologize?

484
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:13,722
And you don't have to give me
the $6 for the cab back, even.

485
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:16,453
Oh, I nearly forgot. I brought it
over for you. There you are.

486
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,392
- Oh, thank you.
- And here's your cap.

487
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,989
No, look, I had the orchestra
play the song up high

488
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,794
so the people would laugh at you.
I had it planned that way.

489
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,870
- You wanted they should laugh at me?
- Sure.

490
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,768
You hear that, Ma?
I was supposed to be funny.

491
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:39,703
Look, how much does
Mr. Robertson pay you a week?

492
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,507
Oh, 15 dollars a week.

493
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:43,808
But I owe him for the glass
in the office,

494
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:46,177
and I owe him for the glass
in the bookcase,

495
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:49,514
and this week, I think
for three stacks of records.

496
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:54,914
Mom, take a look at a
$40-a-week man, all expenses paid.

497
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,956
- What?
- That's right.

498
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:00,959
I'm paying you 40 dollars a week
and expenses. You're working for me.

499
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:04,062
Now, look here, sir, I am not
going to do anything dishonest,

500
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,493
even for that kind of money!

501
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,997
No, you do exactly
what you did today.

502
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,635
- Sit in the box and say those things?
- Right.

503
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,465
- Do I get to sing?
- You bet.

504
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,631
- Even if I sing, I still get paid?
- Well, sure.

505
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,702
Ma...

506
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,275
I'll ask him.

507
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,422
Mister, my mother and I
would like to know something.

508
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:41,423
- Yes?
- Are you for real?

509
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:45,460
Yeah, I'm for real.
We got a deal, kid?

510
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,899
- We got a deal.
- OK.

511
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:54,331
Here, save the gags for the act.

512
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:58,101
Well, I guess the only thing that
can come between us is dough.

513
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:15,446
Hey, how many of those carrots
you eat before going to bed?

514
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:17,984
Oh, lots of them.
They're very good for your eyes.

515
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:19,745
Good for your eyes?

516
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,890
Sure. Did you ever see
a rabbit with glasses?

517
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,355
- Oh, you want one?
- No, thank you.

518
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:31,321
I've never been away
from home before.

519
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,997
I don't know whether my mother
was crying because she was happy

520
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,465
or because she was upset.

521
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,767
You know, you have
a wonderful wife, Mr. Miller.

522
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:44,997
She's so beautiful and so nice.

523
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,902
Aren't you gonna brush your teeth
before you go to bed?

524
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:50,169
Well, of course.

525
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,713
Mr. Miller, there's crooks
on the train!

526
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:06,914
- What do you mean?
- Well, somebody stole the sink!

527
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:09,786
I better go tell the conductor.
They'll make us pay for it.

528
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:14,759
Take it easy. All you do is press the
button, pull the handle and it's there.

529
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:27,214
Oh, Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller!

530
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:32,380
Mr. Miller!

531
00:34:32,555 --> 00:34:35,455
Oh, Mr. Miller!

532
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:44,352
You'd better get to bed
before you drown yourself.

533
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,922
Good night, Mr. Miller.

534
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:28,825
You, go up there.

535
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,429
You, up there.

536
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,171
Well, how am I supposed
to get up there?

537
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:51,541
Use the steps. Use the steps.

538
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,414
Put this up there.

539
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:22,128
- Mr. Miller?
- Yes?

540
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,829
How do you put these lights out?

541
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:27,099
There's a switch up there, kid.
Use it.

542
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,913
- Mr. Miller.
- What?

543
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:22,743
How far are we from New York?

544
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:26,109
Oh, I don't know. About 200 miles.

545
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,421
- Gee, I'm homesick.
- No, that's just the carrots.

546
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:34,749
No. From carrots, I get nauseous.
I'm just lonely.

547
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,756
Mr. Miller, my mother sings
me to sleep.

548
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:39,961
I am not your mother.

549
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,961
Isn't that silly?
I know you're not my mother

550
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:44,655
because my mother's a woman,

551
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,698
and you don't look
anything like my mother.

552
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,960
Besides, my mother
isn't married to Mary.

553
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,468
That's the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard, Mr. Miller.

554
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,037
You could no more be
my mother than...

555
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:56,266
All right, go to sleep. I'll sing to you.

556
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,409
Gee, thanks.

557
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,976
With my eyes wide open

558
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:13,552
I'm dreaming

559
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:18,719
Can it be true
I'm holding you

560
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:21,883
Close to my heart?

561
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:27,756
With my eyes wide open

562
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,596
I'm dreaming

563
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,998
You're with me now
Sharing a vow

564
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,236
Never to part

565
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:45,234
I'm so afraid to close my eyes

566
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:48,142
Afraid that I'll find

567
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:53,014
This lovely thrill is just

568
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:55,778
A silly illusion

569
00:38:57,654 --> 00:39:01,783
With my eyes wide open

570
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,953
I'm dreaming

571
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:10,323
Do I deserve such a break?

572
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,555
Pinch me to prove I'm awake

573
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:20,896
I can't believe that you're really

574
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:26,136
Mine

575
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:51,616
I feel a song coming on

576
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,859
And I'm warning you, it's a victorious
Happy and glorious strain

577
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:16,701
I feel a song coming on

578
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:22,312
It's a melody full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain

579
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,156
- And now
- And now

580
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:42,055
- That our troubles are gone
- That our troubles are gone

581
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:45,628
Let those heavenly drums
Go on drumming

582
00:40:45,797 --> 00:40:51,495
'Cause I feel a song coming on

583
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,742
Now, you'll be all right.

584
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,500
There.

585
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:10,847
Hi, Pop. Did Mr. Miller get back
from the party yet?

586
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,983
He sure did.

587
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,142
Bill. I got him.

588
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,880
- There you are.
- Take your hands off of me.

589
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:21,990
I'll take care of him, Pop.
How much time we got?

590
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:24,091
About six minutes. Heinz is on now.

591
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:25,886
We don't have much time.
We gotta work fast.

592
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:27,960
- Let go of me...
- I'll get some black coffee.

593
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:29,561
OK.

594
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:34,493
Come on, stop. I know it,
I gotta get dressed and I gotta go on.

595
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,861
Don't "shush" me.
What, are you taking over?

596
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,434
What, are you head man
or something?

597
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:40,695
Bill, take it easy, Bill, will you?
Snap out of it.

598
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,396
- We're going on in five minutes.
- I'm ready right now.

599
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:45,564
Here, I'll help you.

600
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:51,806
I'll help you dress, Bill.

601
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,106
- Here's the coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

602
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,882
- Coffee, Mr. Winston?
- No. Fine.

603
00:41:58,051 --> 00:42:01,144
- Stewed to the gills.
- Oh, no, sir. He's just tired.

604
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,720
Tired? He's paralyzed.
Tell Heinz to stall. Hurry up.

605
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,153
- Come on, snap out of it, Bill.
- Rogers, he'll never make it.

606
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,087
You'll have to go out there alone
and do something.

607
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,693
Me, alone? I can't. What'll I do?

608
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,385
Do anything.
You're an actor, aren't you?

609
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:15,554
I am?

610
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:17,860
What're you gonna do with that?

611
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,365
Well, in case anyone throws anything,
I can hide behind it.

612
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:23,469
Gee, Mr. Winston, I'm sorry about
Mr. Miller. He's never...

613
00:42:23,637 --> 00:42:25,263
- What is it?
- Heinz stole three more bows.

614
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:28,669
- He can't stall any longer.
- Come on, boy.

615
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,105
He's never done that before.

616
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,874
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

617
00:42:43,052 --> 00:42:44,576
Never mind. Get out there.

618
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:52,150
Hello.

619
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:56,091
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I call you ladies and gentlemen.

620
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:58,957
You know what you are.

621
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:03,755
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing.

622
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,298
Stop that!

623
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:10,268
You're not supposed to laugh at me.
I'm not Bill Miller. He sings like a bird.

624
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:12,964
I sing like a bird too, a vulture.

625
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:15,541
I said, stop it.
You're not supposed to laugh at me.

626
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,904
I only came out here to tell you
what Bill Miller does.

627
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,340
He tells a lot of funny jokes,

628
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,777
like the one about living over at
the hotel. He has a beautiful room.

629
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:25,212
I have one too,
that overlooks the park.

630
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:27,647
As a matter of fact,
it overlooks it completely.

631
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:33,887
It's a lot like from where
I come from, in Brooklyn.

632
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:36,115
I come from a very tough
neighborhood in Brooklyn.

633
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:38,191
I was sort of head of the block.

634
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,419
Yeah, they all called me "Blockhead".

635
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:47,833
Would you like to hear me
sing a song?

636
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:53,095
Would you please play
some music for me?

637
00:43:56,908 --> 00:43:58,169
Wait a minute.

638
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:03,037
Hey, you. Where do you think
you're going, mister? Sit down, there.

639
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:05,009
- You can't walk out of here.
- But I have...

640
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:08,343
No, you can't walk out on Bill Miller's
act, even when he isn't acting.

641
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,506
What do you want to do,
give us a bad name? Sit down.

642
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:14,676
- But I have to...
- Oh, I don't care. You sit down there.

643
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,518
There too. Now, you stay there,

644
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:23,456
and nobody else try and walk out of
the theater, while I sing for Bill Miller.

645
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,117
Where's my accordion?

646
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:28,162
Don't shush, quiet me.
I've got to go on there.

647
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:30,662
You're on now, and doing great.

648
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:33,029
What?

649
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:40,138
Every little breeze
Seems to whisper "Louise"

650
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:45,005
Birds in the trees seem
To twitter "Louise"

651
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:49,510
Each little rose
Tells me it knows

652
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,148
I love you

653
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,317
Love you

654
00:44:55,485 --> 00:45:00,080
Every little beat
That I feel in my heart

655
00:45:00,255 --> 00:45:05,521
Seems to repeat
What I felt from the start

656
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:07,660
Each little sigh

657
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:10,387
Tells me that I

658
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:14,589
Adore you, Louise

659
00:45:15,366 --> 00:45:19,461
Just to see and hear you

660
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:23,299
Brings joy I never knew

661
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:32,371
But to be so near you

662
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:36,910
Thrills me through and through

663
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:42,676
Anyone can see
Why I wanted your kiss

664
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,344
It had to be

665
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:48,923
But the wonder is this

666
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,953
Can it be true

667
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:55,559
Someone like you

668
00:45:55,731 --> 00:46:00,928
Someone like you
Could love me

669
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:04,027
Louise?

670
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:07,297
Louise!

671
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:14,805
- Where's Bill?
- Bill's OK.

672
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:18,772
- Smoke?
- No, thanks. They make me cough

673
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:21,745
- Even when I look at them.
- Say, you're a pretty funny fellow.

674
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:23,851
- What's your name?
- Rogers. Ted Rogers.

675
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:26,009
I've been wondering.
I didn't see you billed anywhere.

676
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:28,313
- Oh, I don't care.
- You make the act.

677
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:30,718
- How much does he pay you a week?
- Enough.

678
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,084
Does he get plastered
like this very often?

679
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,193
He never gets plastered,
and he ain't plastered now.

680
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,796
Boy, you sure are touchy.
I'm just trying to pay you a compliment.

681
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,592
I figured that sometime if you ever get
tired of no dough and no billing,

682
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,233
- You can always...
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Heinz,

683
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,993
you can't say anything
against Bill Miller.

684
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:50,626
He took me out of a stockroom, see?
I was only getting $15 a week, see?

685
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:53,773
- But I'm only trying to...
- And now I'm getting $40, see?

686
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,870
- How are you, Bill?
- Get your hands away from me.

687
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:02,639
You know where you're going?
You're going back to Brooklyn.

688
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:05,941
That's where you're going.
Back to Brooklyn.

689
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:09,283
- Take it easy, Bill.
- Get your hands away from me.

690
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,579
I know what I'm doing.

691
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:14,654
Take it easy.

692
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:26,962
He's resting.

693
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,164
Boy, can he use it.

694
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:32,730
Do you think we should call
a doctor or something?

695
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:36,134
Why not use a blotter? I'll call a cab.

696
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:38,899
Thanks. Mr. Winston...

697
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:41,834
...you won't tell anybody...

698
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,800
...that he was sick, will you?

699
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:46,674
Don't worry, I've had actors
getting sick on me before.

700
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:48,212
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

701
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:50,440
Good thing you went out there.

702
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,484
You sure you never did
a single before?

703
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:56,777
I never did nothing before...

704
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:59,823
...and I'm never gonna
do nothing again.

705
00:48:10,732 --> 00:48:13,326
Just a minute.
Just a minute, buddy.

706
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,196
What do you think you're doing?

707
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:26,634
Just a second, buddy.
What do you think you're doing...?

708
00:48:30,014 --> 00:48:33,039
Well, shut up.
I'm having enough trouble.

709
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:36,210
Hello. Hello. Who?

710
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:41,617
- I feel like a feather in the breeze
- No, he isn't in. Wait just a minute.

711
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:48,351
Hello? Mary?

712
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,619
Hello, how are you?

713
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,626
Just a minute. Just a minute.

714
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:06,571
Hello, Mary, how are you?
This is Ted.

715
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:09,709
Hello, Ted. Fine, thanks.
Say, I've bean reading about you.

716
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:12,174
Oh, yeah.

717
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:15,905
- Is Bill there?
- Bill? Oh, he's fine.

718
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:19,113
- Is he out?
- Is he out?

719
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,446
Yeah, he's out.

720
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,319
Oh, I mean, he's out playing a benefit,
Mary, for some society.

721
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:31,548
Yeah, he's fine.

722
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:34,158
All right, I'll tell him.

723
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:38,559
All right, Mary. Bye.
Good night.

724
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:02,546
"Sensational. Bill Miller,
exclusive management, Leo Lyman."

725
00:50:02,717 --> 00:50:07,380
That's a beautiful ad,
and the picture looks just like you.

726
00:50:09,655 --> 00:50:11,781
What did Mary say last night?

727
00:50:12,123 --> 00:50:15,684
Oh, nothing. I mean, she just wanted
to know how you were,

728
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:17,884
et cetera, and so forth.

729
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:20,460
- What did you say?
- I said that you hadn't come in yet,

730
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:22,756
that you were playing a benefit.

731
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,365
Oh, you mean you covered for me?

732
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:29,362
I hope I didn't say the wrong thing.

733
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:32,629
- Wrong thing?
- You're not mad?

734
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:36,535
- No, I'm not mad. Thanks.
- We're friends?

735
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:39,176
We're friends.

736
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:43,305
- Get that, will you, kid?
- Yeah.

737
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:47,246
- What happened?
- My leg fell asleep.

738
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:51,685
- Hello.
- Surprise.

739
00:50:51,854 --> 00:50:53,150
Well, Leo, what's the good word?

740
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:54,913
I was gonna send you a wire
but I figured it would be better

741
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:57,522
if I came down myself to Pittsburgh
to tell you the good news.

742
00:50:57,691 --> 00:50:59,420
You know, you're not the only
one that's a ham.

743
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:01,355
The Palace, New York.

744
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:03,461
That's right. Next Thursday.

745
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:06,620
Oh, boy, now my mother can come
and see me for free.

746
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,330
Oh, yes, there's another thing,
in case you're forgetting it.

747
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:14,800
- Thursday is also Mary's birthday.
- That's right.

748
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,302
What other agent could arrange
for things like that?

749
00:51:17,606 --> 00:51:20,166
How did you arrange to have
Mary born on Thursday?

750
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:26,238
Give me the coat.

751
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:29,244
- Let go. Let go.
- I'm not touching it.

752
00:51:29,414 --> 00:51:31,473
Are you crazy?
You sewed it to the jacket.

753
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Miller.
It'll only take a second.

754
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:38,182
I'm sure glad you reminded me
of Mary's birthday.

755
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:39,754
Yeah.

756
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:45,625
Listen, kid, when you get that button
straight, send this off to Mary.

757
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:49,194
- And send some roses too.
- Yes, sir.

758
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:53,623
Leo, let's get some coffee
and talk money.

759
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,894
How could you find a subject
so close to my heart?

760
00:52:01,505 --> 00:52:05,907
"Mrs. Bill Miller, 115 East 54th Street,
New York, New York.

761
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:11,341
"Home for your birthday.
Big surprise. Bill."

762
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:22,042
"Darling Mary.

763
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:25,848
"Home for your birthday.
Big surprise.

764
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:29,684
"I love you. Bill.

765
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,896
"P.S.

766
00:52:34,597 --> 00:52:37,760
"Love from the kid."

767
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:46,937
All right, open your eyes.
Happy birthday.

768
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:50,370
Oh, Bill, what a wonderful present.
You're playing the Palace.

769
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,170
- I'm so proud of you.
- And they said I couldn't do a single.

770
00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:55,869
Well, there you are.
Oh, by the way, honey,

771
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,038
I want you to have
a big birthday party tonight.

772
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,707
Invite all the guys that said I couldn't
make it, and some of your friends.

773
00:53:02,384 --> 00:53:05,046
- How about that?
- That's fine, just fine.

774
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:09,486
Oh, and I have something else, Mary.
I wrote a song for you on the train.

775
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:11,950
I wrote the words.
Bill wrote the music.

776
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:16,660
"A Girl Named Mary".
Why, thank you, Ted. I know I'll love it.

777
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:18,819
Come on, let's go, Mary.

778
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:22,567
- Oh, yes.
- Come on, kid.

779
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:23,722
- William.
- Well, Ben.

780
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,061
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Ben.

781
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:27,226
- What are you doing here?
- Here's where I lost you.

782
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:29,701
Here's where I pick you up again.
Hello, Ted.

783
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,500
You've developed into
quite an actor.

784
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:35,870
Look, Mary, I'm going back to take
a look at my dressing room.

785
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:37,635
- Now, you stay here with Ben.
- All right.

786
00:53:37,812 --> 00:53:40,780
When I come back, I'll buy you lunch.
Come on, kid.

787
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:45,678
Wanna tell Uncle Ben?

788
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:49,684
Well, don't you think he should have
Ted's name around here somewhere?

789
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:53,050
Well, you know, I've got a sneaking
feeling he's saving that grand gesture

790
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:54,690
until he's a big hit
here at the Palace.

791
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:57,485
- You really think so?
- Sure.

792
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:03,026
Yeah, this looks all right.
Put the stuff here.

793
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,994
Now, get some lunch
and I'll see you later, kid.

794
00:54:05,165 --> 00:54:06,723
Thank you.

795
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:14,467
Come in.

796
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:21,203
- Oh...
- Hello, handsome.

797
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:23,403
Gee, I'm glad you made good.

798
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,742
- Is that so?
- Sure. I've been following your tour.

799
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,679
- What for?
- Because I think you're cute.

800
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:37,350
Why isn't your picture in the lobby?

801
00:54:38,624 --> 00:54:41,956
You're pretty fresh, ain't you?
How did you get in here?

802
00:54:42,127 --> 00:54:44,560
I told the doorman I was your girl.

803
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:47,356
My girl. What are you trying to do,
ruin me? You get out of here.

804
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:49,998
It ain't right for you to be
in my dressing room.

805
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,531
I mean, Mr. Miller's dressing room.

806
00:54:52,768 --> 00:54:54,895
OK, I'm going.

807
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:59,964
But when you start thinking about girls,
I want you to think about me.

808
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:03,166
- I ain't gonna think about girls.
- You shave, don't you?

809
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:05,037
Yeah, I started to shave.

810
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,337
You'll be thinking about them.

811
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,173
So long.

812
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:20,917
Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome.

813
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:25,525
Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome.

814
00:56:16,898 --> 00:56:19,627
Come with me to the Casbah.

815
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:24,966
Come with me to the Casbah.

816
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:42,913
"Hi, cutie, in case you want to return
this handbag,

817
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:46,541
"my phone number is Dewey 6-9098.

818
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,382
"My address is

819
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:51,580

"Get off at Havenhurst.
Then walk three blocks south.

823

825
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:10,069
"But for the next hour, I'll be in
the drugstore around the corner."

826
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:35,380
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What is it?

827
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:36,990
Don't you want your soda?

828
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,626
This is a very funny way for a lady
to try and meet a fellow,

829
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:41,785
leave her purse on the seat
and then come next door...

830
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:44,191
Well, I just wanted to meet you.

831
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:47,332
Well, why don't you get
yourself introduced?

832
00:57:47,566 --> 00:57:48,794
Oh, excuse me.

833
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,624
My name's Jennie Tait
and this fellow's name is...

834
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:53,395
What did you say your name was?

835
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:54,867
Ted Rogers.

836
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,529
Would you please introduce us?

837
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,938
- Mr. Rogers?
- Yeah?

838
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,771
May I present Miss Genevieve Tait.

839
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:06,913
Pleased to meet you.

840
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:09,613
Now, will you have your soda?

841
00:58:13,886 --> 00:58:16,217
How did you know I like chocolate?

842
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:21,388
Did anyone ever tell you
you're adorable?

843
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:23,381
No.

844
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,460
Well, you are.

845
00:58:26,563 --> 00:58:30,123
You might not believe this,
but I was a very ugly child.

846
00:58:54,784 --> 00:58:58,617
Stop looking at the watch, Mary.
He'll be here.

847
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:03,451
Look at the kid.

848
00:59:12,396 --> 00:59:14,762
Oh, Frecklehead... I mean, Miss Tait,

849
00:59:14,932 --> 00:59:17,399
this is Mrs. Miller
and this is Mr. Lyman.

850
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,932
Hello.

851
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,966
- Did I do it all right?
- You certainly did.

852
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,367
- Happy to know you, Miss Tait.
- Hello.

853
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,028
Her name is really Genevieve,

854
00:59:25,206 --> 00:59:27,504
but I think it best we all call her
Frecklehead.

855
00:59:27,675 --> 00:59:29,073
- OK, Frecklehead.
- Frecklehead.

856
00:59:29,243 --> 00:59:31,040
Is it all right that I brought her
to the party?

857
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:32,802
Of course. I'm delighted to have her.

858
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:36,414
I'm glad of that, Mrs. Miller.
Congratulations on your birthday.

859
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:38,515
Why, thank you. Have a nice time.

860
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:40,650
Thank you, we will.

861
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,883
Genevieve... Frecklehead.

862
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:49,482
- Gee, she's nice.
- And pretty.

863
00:59:49,658 --> 00:59:51,558
You're pretty too.

864
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,661
- Did you always have freckles?
- Yes, and I hate them.

865
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:57,953
I think they're very becoming.

866
00:59:58,165 --> 01:00:00,792
It just goes to show what you know.

867
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:03,500
What do you wanna do,
start something?

868
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,265
I'm sorry, Leo.

869
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,371
You know he wouldn't stay away
unless it was someone

870
01:00:17,546 --> 01:00:19,741
or something very important, Mary.

871
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:22,940
It's always someone or something.

872
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:27,951
Leo, you've known him for so long.
Why is he so thoughtless of everyone?

873
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:30,016
He's just going through
a stage now, Mary.

874
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:31,884
He just hit "Ol' Man River" success,

875
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:34,081
and maybe the water's a little bit
too deep for him.

876
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:36,385
But don't worry.
They all come ashore.

877
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:39,794
I know this is just ambition.

878
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:43,898
Down deep inside,
there's a wonderful, sweet guy.

879
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,091
I found it once
and I'll bring it out again.

880
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,759
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's have a drink.

881
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:53,202
To Mary and Bill.

882
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:56,398
He wouldn't like the billing.

883
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,172
This is where I live.

884
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:16,117
Well...

885
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:18,858
...good night.

886
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,425
I had a wonderful time.

887
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,587
Well, good night. I'll see you.

888
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:27,128
I hope so.

889
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:29,323
Thanks for everything.

890
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,399
That's all right.

891
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:34,937
Frecklehead, you know I...

892
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:37,264
- I wonder...
- Yes?

893
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:40,672
Well, I never kissed
a girl before, and...

894
01:01:41,142 --> 01:01:43,336
- Well...
- You never what?

895
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:47,308
You heard me. I never kissed a girl
before in my whole life.

896
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,880
- You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

897
01:01:51,683 --> 01:01:54,083
- Never mind.
- Just a minute.

898
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:06,884
- I'm never gonna do that again.
- Did it do something to you?

899
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:10,428
It had no effect on me whatsoever.

900
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:36,869
Mary.

901
01:02:38,147 --> 01:02:39,636
Mary.

902
01:02:40,015 --> 01:02:42,506
I'm sorry I missed the party, honey,
but I couldn't help it.

903
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:47,545
Oh, Mary, please don't cry.

904
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,621
I love you, honey. Honest, I do.

905
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:54,190
But I was so excited. I want to tell you
about Sutherland and everything.

906
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,953
I don't care about you
or Sutherland or anyone.

907
01:02:58,129 --> 01:03:02,531
But he wants me in the revue, honey.
He gave me a contract to look over.

908
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,665
Here, look under the door.
I'll show it to you.

909
01:03:13,774 --> 01:03:16,606
- OK.
- What's the matter?

910
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:18,208
She locked me out.

911
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,867
Really? Is that legal?

912
01:03:21,046 --> 01:03:24,310
I'm sorry. You don't have to get sore.
I was just asking.

913
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:28,678
You know, you may not think that
in this head anything can happen,

914
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:31,878
but it can. I got an idea. Listen.

915
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:38,756
- You got it?
- Yeah.

916
01:03:41,928 --> 01:03:43,623
I'm sorry.

917
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:47,093
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

918
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:49,358
a new song written by
two very talented boys,

919
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,730
especially for the birthday
of Mrs. Bill Miller.

920
01:03:56,273 --> 01:04:00,299
The world looks rosy

921
01:04:00,475 --> 01:04:03,672
Up on Sweetheart Hill

922
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:08,909
For a girl named Mary

923
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:12,440
And a boy named Bill

924
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:18,752
"Come on, get cozy"

925
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:22,449
Says the whippoorwill

926
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:27,418
To a girl named Mary

927
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,597
And a boy named Bill

928
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:37,592
Where there's a sky
That's full of moonlight

929
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:41,500
And a Mary full of charms

930
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,869
There ought to be a William

931
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:49,910
Snuggled in her arms

932
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,173
So if I kiss you

933
01:04:54,483 --> 01:04:57,713
And I think I will

934
01:04:59,253 --> 01:05:03,848
Believe me, it's the only thing

935
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:07,257
To do

936
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:12,119
For you're my Mary

937
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:15,459
And I'm your Bill

938
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:21,325
And it's wonderful

939
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:27,839
To be in love with you

940
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:42,384
Oh, Bill.

941
01:05:42,586 --> 01:05:44,611
Mrs. Miller, we're going out
and celebrating.

942
01:05:44,788 --> 01:05:46,982
- At this hour?
- Sure. I'll find a club open

943
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:48,987
- Or I'll open one.
- Now, what would people say?

944
01:05:49,158 --> 01:05:52,354
A big star seen out in public
with his own wife. It's too normal.

945
01:05:52,527 --> 01:05:55,188
We'll take Ted along
as a chaperone.

946
01:06:02,734 --> 01:06:05,828
Oh, I can't help it, it's so romantic.

947
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,274
Waiter, some more
champagne, please.

948
01:06:17,446 --> 01:06:18,707
Yes, sir.

949
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:21,342
Excuse me.

950
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:24,881
- Don't you think Ted's had enough?
- He's all right.

951
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:28,520
- Are you whispering about me?
- Oh, no. What gives you that idea?

952
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:32,383
I don't know.
Am I being very extraordinary?

953
01:06:32,557 --> 01:06:35,548
"Hextraordinary", that's a funny one.

954
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,286
How do you feel?

955
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,930
I feel very...

956
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,062
...glingglong, thank you.

957
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:45,256
Glingglong?

958
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:52,632
Thank you, thank you very much.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

959
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:54,331
We don't usually do this,

960
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:57,066
but there's a young man
here I'd like to have you meet.

961
01:06:57,242 --> 01:07:00,733
He's just scored a terrific hit
at the Palace Theatre. Mr. Bill Miller!

962
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:05,312
Thank you.
Excuse me, will you, honey?

963
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,078
Thank you, Tommy.

964
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:12,344
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you,
but this isn't my night at all.

965
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,716
We have a young lady in the audience
who's celebrating her birthday.

966
01:07:16,023 --> 01:07:17,991
And by a very strange coincidence,

967
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:20,523
I have written a new song,
especially for her.

968
01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:23,058
And maybe we can get her up here
to sing this song.

969
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:26,954
She happens to be my wife,
and also the great

970
01:07:27,132 --> 01:07:30,726
Sutherland Revue star,
Miss Mary Turner.

971
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,530
- Hiya, Big Shot.
- Hiya, Heinz.

972
01:07:37,706 --> 01:07:39,435
Pardon me.

973
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,638
Mary, you say something sensational
to the people

974
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,871
and I'll talk with the piano player.

975
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,976
Thank you. It's very gracious
of my husband

976
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:57,086
to ask me to sing a song, particularly
this song, "A Girl Named Mary".

977
01:07:57,254 --> 01:08:02,213
Music by Bill Miller,
words by Ted Rogers.

978
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:11,427
- The world looks rosy
- Oh, what a rosy-colored hue

979
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:15,363
- Up on Sweetheart Hill
- Even a cabaret will do

980
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:19,493
- For a girl named Mary
- Mary is what I answer to

981
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:21,103
And a boy named Bill

982
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:23,069
Well, what do you know,
that must be you

983
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,970
- "Come on, get cozy"
- Oh, what a wonderful idea

984
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:30,703
- Says the whippoorwill
- How did he ever get in here?

985
01:08:30,879 --> 01:08:34,644
- To a girl named Mary
- My, what a most peculiar sky

986
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:38,410
- And a boy named Bill
- Pardon me, did you drop a sigh?

987
01:08:38,585 --> 01:08:43,112
Where there's a sky
That's full of moonlight

988
01:08:44,023 --> 01:08:46,081
And a Mary full of charms

989
01:08:46,257 --> 01:08:50,283
There really ought to be a William

990
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:53,918
- Right!
- Snuggled in her arms

991
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:57,532
- So if I kiss you
- What makes you think you won't?

992
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:01,496
- And I think that I will
- You're crazy if you don't

993
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:07,401
Believe me, it's the only thing to do

994
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:09,666
So true

995
01:09:09,842 --> 01:09:12,936
For you're my Mary

996
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:15,306
And you're my Bill

997
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,242
Your Bill

998
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:23,352
And it's wonderful
To be in love with you

999
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:33,385
Hello, Heinz.

1000
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:36,289
Oh, you'd better not drink any more.

1001
01:09:36,763 --> 01:09:41,926
If I want to celebrate for my pal Bill,
I can celebrate.

1002
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:44,231
This is for your own good.

1003
01:09:44,402 --> 01:09:48,064
Come over here with me.
I want to tell you something, alone.

1004
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,762
Come on, come on, come on.

1005
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:58,269
Believe me, it's the only thing do

1006
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:03,474
- For you're my Mary
- Mary, yes

1007
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:06,708
And you're my Bill

1008
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:22,456
And it's wonderful

1009
01:10:23,164 --> 01:10:28,692
To be in love

1010
01:10:28,868 --> 01:10:34,702
With you

1011
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:41,572
- Where's Ted?
- I don't know.

1012
01:10:43,412 --> 01:10:45,437
Look, get smart, will you, kid?

1013
01:10:45,614 --> 01:10:49,242
If anything happens to you, your pal
Bill, he's gonna starve to death.

1014
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:53,113
Why, he's nothing but a third-rate,
broken-down ham.

1015
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,258
Hey, what happened?

1016
01:11:06,397 --> 01:11:08,057
Are you all right, kid?

1017
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:10,665
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1018
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,891
He never touched me.

1019
01:11:21,374 --> 01:11:25,070
I took care of him pretty good.

1020
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,939
You were wonderful.

1021
01:11:27,112 --> 01:11:30,842
Yeah, but I had to hold back a little.
I didn't want to hurt him too bad.

1022
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:33,209
- Sure, sure.
- Here, off with the coat.

1023
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:34,748
- Come on.
- Off with the coat.

1024
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:39,183
A girl named Mary
Is not contrary

1025
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:42,016
- I'll turn the covers down.
- She'll turn the covers down.

1026
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:47,092
- You'll go right to bed.
- Bed? What's playing there?

1027
01:11:49,395 --> 01:11:51,885
You think I'm drunk.

1028
01:11:52,564 --> 01:11:55,590
Well, as they say in the Klondike,

1029
01:11:55,867 --> 01:11:59,564
- "Fara-a-lito-garn-a-lendo."
- Garn-a-lendo.

1030
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,795
You know what that means?

1031
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,873
"Stinking drunk."

1032
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:10,066
- So let's have a little drink.
- Oh, no, oh, no. You're going to bed.

1033
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:11,871
- Going to bed?
- Sure, you're going to bed.

1034
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:13,103
I don't know anybody in bed.

1035
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,043
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1036
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:17,148
- Here we go...
- Come on, come on.

1037
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:19,375
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1038
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:23,520
- That's a wonderful song.
- Oh, a beautiful song.

1039
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:26,247
A boy named Mary

1040
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:30,017
And a girl called Joe

1041
01:12:30,193 --> 01:12:32,456
- Joe?
- That's a wonderful song.

1042
01:12:33,028 --> 01:12:35,087
Bill love Mary?

1043
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:38,789
That's right.

1044
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:41,325
Mary love Bill?

1045
01:12:42,769 --> 01:12:46,260
That's right.
Because I love the both of you.

1046
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:50,298
Don't you believe me?

1047
01:12:50,475 --> 01:12:51,942
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1048
01:12:54,778 --> 01:12:56,938
Bill, you're the luckiest fellow
in the whole world

1049
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:58,740
- Because Mary loves you.
- Yeah, I'm lucky.

1050
01:12:58,915 --> 01:13:01,815
If Mary loved me,
I wouldn't ever leave her.

1051
01:13:01,983 --> 01:13:03,883
- I wouldn't either.
- Never leave her.

1052
01:13:04,052 --> 01:13:05,211
I'll never leave her.

1053
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:09,050
Even if I was on the stage,
I wouldn't ever leave her.

1054
01:13:09,222 --> 01:13:10,655
And I know that.

1055
01:13:10,823 --> 01:13:13,655
Because Mary's wonderful, Bill.

1056
01:13:14,793 --> 01:13:17,226
- You're wonderful, Mary.
- Thank you, Ted.

1057
01:13:17,428 --> 01:13:19,419
Yeah, Mary's a champ.

1058
01:13:19,764 --> 01:13:22,061
And you'll never ever
you'll leave her?

1059
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,632
I'll never you'll ever you'll leave her.

1060
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:27,166
- You're sure, Bill?
- I'm sure, Bill.

1061
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,928
- No, I'm Ted.
- Yeah.

1062
01:13:48,586 --> 01:13:53,147
A girl named Mary

1063
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:06,261
Ted.

1064
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:08,498
Ted.

1065
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:10,058
- Wake up.
- I'm up.

1066
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:11,531
- Come on.
- I'm up.

1067
01:14:11,703 --> 01:14:14,170
- Get up. Come on, let's go.
- All right.

1068
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,101
- Let's go, Ted.
- Let's go, Ted.

1069
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:18,206
- Come on, Ted, let's go.
- Let's go.

1070
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:19,568
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1071
01:14:19,742 --> 01:14:20,766
OK.

1072
01:14:20,943 --> 01:14:22,773
- No, here we go.
- Here we go.

1073
01:14:22,944 --> 01:14:25,378
- Come on, here we go. Wake up.
- Come on, here we go.

1074
01:14:25,547 --> 01:14:27,878
- Come on. Here we go.
- Here we go.

1075
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:30,072
- All right, now, are you OK?
- Here we go.

1076
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:33,741
OK. Ted. Here we go.
Come on, now.

1077
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,986
- What's the matter?
- What's that?

1078
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,188
Oh, that's your head. That's OK.

1079
01:14:38,356 --> 01:14:40,586
Now, stay right there. Hold it.

1080
01:14:40,758 --> 01:14:43,419
Here's some coffee. It'll fix you up.

1081
01:14:43,593 --> 01:14:45,993
Ted! Here we go, now! Come on, up.

1082
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:49,927
- Upsy-daisy, here we go.
- Oh, my head!

1083
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,690
That's mine.

1084
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:54,164
Now, come on. I gotta see Sutherland
and I'm late now.

1085
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,631
- Oh, who?
- Sutherland.

1086
01:14:55,836 --> 01:14:57,736
- Now, come on, let's go.
- All right.

1087
01:14:57,904 --> 01:15:00,303
- Are you all right? OK!
- OK.

1088
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:02,463
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm sure I'm all right.

1089
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:04,006
- You feel fine?
- I feel fine.

1090
01:15:04,175 --> 01:15:05,767
- You feel OK?
- I feel OK.

1091
01:15:05,944 --> 01:15:10,141
- All right.
- All right. I'm OK. I'm OK!

1092
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,516
Sorry, gentlemen.

1093
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:24,246
- Excuse me.
- Oh, excuse me, Mr. Sutherland.

1094
01:15:24,424 --> 01:15:25,755
It looks OK to me, Bill.

1095
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:27,414
- OK?
- Yeah.

1096
01:15:32,997 --> 01:15:35,624
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

1097
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:38,594
Don't you want to read it first?
Check on your salary?

1098
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:42,568
There'll be no checks.
I want all my money in cash.

1099
01:15:48,442 --> 01:15:50,376
I'm nervous.

1100
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:54,175
- What's my name?
- Ted Rogers.

1101
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,177
I forgot.

1102
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:01,707
Excuse me, Mr. Sutherland,
but could I use your phone, please?

1103
01:16:01,886 --> 01:16:03,114
Certainly.

1104
01:16:03,287 --> 01:16:05,550
Thank you. Here.

1105
01:16:06,556 --> 01:16:07,544
Thanks.

1106
01:16:07,723 --> 01:16:13,126
Hello, operator, would you be good
enough to get me Greenpoint 7-9970?

1107
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:20,229
Hello, Ma! Hey, Ma, look at me.
I'm in Mr. Sutherland's Revue.

1108
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:25,396
No! No, Ma, I'll keep my clothes on.

1109
01:16:29,373 --> 01:16:32,307
And a boy named Bill

1110
01:16:33,076 --> 01:16:35,636
- Well, hi.
- Hi. What's all the excitement?

1111
01:16:35,812 --> 01:16:39,338
Oh, I... What are you hiding?
What is that?

1112
01:16:39,514 --> 01:16:42,744
Oh, it's just a telegram
from C.B. Cochran in London.

1113
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,508
He wants me to star
in his new revue,

1114
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,515
just in case you think
I'm an old has-been.

1115
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:49,677
Well, you tell Mr. Cochran
to go peddle his papers.

1116
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,414
Happy day-after-your-birthday.

1117
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:57,860
Oh, Bill!
This must have cost a fortune!

1118
01:16:58,028 --> 01:16:59,325
Well, you know
what everybody says:

1119
01:16:59,496 --> 01:17:02,464
"Money isn't everything,
and I'm the guy that keeps proving it."

1120
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:04,961
You know something?
You've got your arms around a guy

1121
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,760
who's gonna star
in Sutherland's Revue.

1122
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:07,924
Really?

1123
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:09,831
Signed, sealed and delivered
this afternoon.

1124
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:11,129
- Ted too?
- Well, sure.

1125
01:17:11,305 --> 01:17:13,101
Everywhere I go, Ted goes too.

1126
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:16,002
- I hope so.
- What do you mean, "I hope so"?

1127
01:17:16,209 --> 01:17:17,470
Well, I...

1128
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:19,541
I thought after you opened
at the Palace

1129
01:17:19,711 --> 01:17:22,508
it would've been nice if you'd
given him some kind of recognition.

1130
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,807
Look, honey, will you leave the kid
to me? I know how to handle him.

1131
01:17:25,982 --> 01:17:29,610
He's happy, I'm happy, you're happy.
We're a big hit.

1132
01:17:29,818 --> 01:17:32,184
I guarantee I'll always take care
of the kid.

1133
01:17:32,354 --> 01:17:35,413
You promise?
You won't ever treat him like a...

1134
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:37,819
- Like a what?
- You know...

1135
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:40,881
Like a nobody. A stooge.

1136
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,755
I promise.

1137
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:47,930
A boy named Mary
And a girl named Bill

1138
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:49,429
- Hello.
- Hi.

1139
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,624
Hello, Ted.

1140
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:52,598
Listen, I wanted to
ask you something.

1141
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:55,294
Since the both of you are practically
my mother and my father

1142
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:57,495
and I wouldn't do a thing
without consulting you,

1143
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:59,970
and after we open
and we're a big hit...

1144
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,769
After we open and we're a big hit,
and after I'm married,

1145
01:18:02,943 --> 01:18:05,467
what should I do,
buy a house or rent an apartment?

1146
01:18:05,745 --> 01:18:07,736
Well, whom are you going to marry?

1147
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:10,581
Whom am I going to marry?

1148
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:13,240
I am going to marry
Miss Genevieve Tait.

1149
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:15,647
Frecklehead, that's whom.

1150
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,684
Well, I suggest you ask
Miss Frecklehead

1151
01:18:17,854 --> 01:18:20,254
whether she'd rather live
in a house or an apartment.

1152
01:18:20,423 --> 01:18:22,481
Oh, no, I have to disagree
with you there, Mary,

1153
01:18:22,658 --> 01:18:25,252
because I feel it is
the husband's place to decide.

1154
01:18:25,427 --> 01:18:27,326
She's gonna live there with you.

1155
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,659
She is? I mean, she is.

1156
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,127
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1157
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,625
- Would you do me a favor, Mary?
- If I can.

1158
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,267
The next time you see Frecklehead,

1159
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:39,665
will you ask her to ask me
to ask her to marry her?

1160
01:18:39,838 --> 01:18:42,032
Because I'm gonna ask her.

1161
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:46,400
- Well, I'll do my best.
- Gee, thanks, Mary. Bye.

1162
01:18:46,576 --> 01:18:48,373
My best too.

1163
01:18:56,417 --> 01:18:57,975
Freckle...

1164
01:18:58,418 --> 01:19:00,978
- Frecklehead?
- Yes?

1165
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:05,689
- I wanted to ask you...
- Yes?

1166
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:08,485
Well, I thought that maybe
you and me could...

1167
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,218
Yes?

1168
01:19:10,794 --> 01:19:14,889
- I mean, if the two of us were...
- Yes?

1169
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:18,789
Here.

1170
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:23,702
How about it?

1171
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:25,498
Not until you ask me.

1172
01:19:27,173 --> 01:19:30,142
Would you consider marrying
a fellow who sits up in a box?

1173
01:19:35,713 --> 01:19:38,443
Well, what are you bawling about?

1174
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:41,842
Try it on.

1175
01:19:42,852 --> 01:19:44,149
Go ahead, try it on.

1176
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,083
I'd love to marry you...

1177
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:49,384
...but I gotta tell you something first.

1178
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,148
Can't you tell me
after we're married?

1179
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:54,886
No, it's very important.

1180
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:57,395
I think you're a big dope

1181
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:59,791
because you're letting Bill Miller
make a fool of you.

1182
01:19:59,965 --> 01:20:02,092
- Wait a minute!
- I won't wait a minute!

1183
01:20:02,267 --> 01:20:03,790
He's making a fool of you!

1184
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:07,232
Frecklehead, Bill Miller is my friend.

1185
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:10,133
And besides, whatever we do
is no business of yours!

1186
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,705
If I'm gonna marry you,
it's a lot of my business!

1187
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,070
Well, wait until
after we're married, then!

1188
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:17,800
OK!

1189
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:20,871
OK!

1190
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:38,287
- Curtain going up.
- First aisle to the right.

1191
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,652
- Curtain going up.
- Straight ahead, please.

1192
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,126
First aisle to the right.

1193
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:48,962
Well, I'm happy, so happy
When you're near

1194
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,864
My troubles just disappear

1195
01:20:52,036 --> 01:20:55,699
As soon as you're by my side
Well, I'm satisfied

1196
01:20:55,873 --> 01:21:00,502
I feel like a feather in the breeze
Having my fun, kissing the sun

1197
01:21:00,676 --> 01:21:03,201
And it's because you're the one

1198
01:21:03,546 --> 01:21:06,412
So I'm singing
Like the birdies in the trees

1199
01:21:06,581 --> 01:21:09,549
And feeling like a feather
Feeling like a feather

1200
01:21:09,717 --> 01:21:13,652
Feeling like a feather in the breeze

1201
01:21:20,925 --> 01:21:22,950
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
If there's any song you'd like to hear,

1202
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:24,991
just call it out and I'd be glad
to do it for you.

1203
01:21:25,162 --> 01:21:27,289
- "Just One More Chance".
- What?

1204
01:21:27,464 --> 01:21:30,432
"Just One More Chance", and I'd like
to hear you play it on that zither.

1205
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:33,294
"Thither"? This isn't a zither.

1206
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:36,164
- No? Then what ith it?
- What ith it?

1207
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,937
- Well, thith ithn't a thither.
- Yeth, what ith it?

1208
01:21:40,107 --> 01:21:43,371
Thith ith a... Thith ith...
Now he's got me doing it.

1209
01:21:43,609 --> 01:21:46,338
This is an Italian lavaliere.
This is a burden around my neck.

1210
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:47,876
You know what a burden is,
don't you?

1211
01:21:48,346 --> 01:21:51,872
Sure. A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

1212
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,312
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to sing a song...

1213
01:21:54,484 --> 01:21:55,974
- Thanks for the warning.
- Hear, hear.

1214
01:21:56,152 --> 01:21:59,746
I'll have you know that my aunt gave
me $10,000 to cultivate my voice.

1215
01:21:59,922 --> 01:22:01,218
Really?

1216
01:22:01,722 --> 01:22:06,158
- Just one more chance
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

1217
01:22:06,827 --> 01:22:08,419
- To...
- Hey!

1218
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,528
- What is it?
- You said your aunt gave you $10,000

1219
01:22:10,696 --> 01:22:12,459
- To cultivate your voice?
- That's right.

1220
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:13,961
What did you do with the money?

1221
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:19,962
You still wanna hear
"Just One More Chance"?

1222
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,966
Yeah, and I'd like to hear it today.

1223
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,507
- You like my playing?
- Sure, cut the cards.

1224
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,334
I mean, do you like the music?

1225
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,944
Oh, it's fine. All you need now
is a monkey and a tin cup.

1226
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:35,978
Come around tomorrow,
I have the tin cup.

1227
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:40,910
Look, you keep this up
and I'm gonna have you evicted.

1228
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:46,021
- What's the matter?
- You said a dirty word!

1229
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:47,349
I only said "evicted".

1230
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:50,756
You said it again!

1231
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:53,394
- You keep this up and I'm gonna...
- Don't you say that word again!

1232
01:22:53,562 --> 01:22:55,586
It only means "ejected".

1233
01:22:56,698 --> 01:22:58,164
That's dirtier than the other one!

1234
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:02,358
That does it. Usher!

1235
01:23:02,535 --> 01:23:04,628
- Get him out of here...
- You're not gonna let me sing?

1236
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:07,533
Why don't you stop it? If you have
any talent, come on down here.

1237
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:11,607
OK. It's easier looking
at the audience than at you.

1238
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:22,172
Get off the stage.

1239
01:23:22,383 --> 01:23:24,442
I hope you're satisfied with the way
you embarrassed me

1240
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:25,711
in front of everybody.

1241
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,046
Lookit, the whole audience
is staring at me.

1242
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:30,086
Stare back at them.

1243
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:31,917
No, better they stare at you.

1244
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:34,820
Go on, get off the stage,
and take this with you.

1245
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:36,821
- All right, I'll go.
- Get off.

1246
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,189
- But you'll be sorry.
- Get off!

1247
01:23:38,362 --> 01:23:40,091
- I'll get even with you.
- Get off the stage!

1248
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:41,856
I don't know how or when,
but I will, boy.

1249
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:50,796
Just one more chance

1250
01:23:52,406 --> 01:23:56,637
To prove it's you alone I care for

1251
01:23:57,277 --> 01:24:00,302
Each night I say a little prayer for

1252
01:24:02,014 --> 01:24:04,982
Just one more chance

1253
01:24:05,383 --> 01:24:07,043
I'm busy!

1254
01:24:07,217 --> 01:24:10,947
I've learned the meaning
Of repentance

1255
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:16,179
Now you're the jury at my trial

1256
01:24:16,491 --> 01:24:20,859
I know that I should serve
My sentence

1257
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:26,096
Still I'm hoping all the while
You'll give me

1258
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:30,130
Just one more word

1259
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:34,065
I said that I was glad
To start out

1260
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:39,970
But now I'm back
To cry my heart out

1261
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:43,736
For just one more chance

1262
01:24:53,252 --> 01:24:58,450
Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller,
get me down! Help me down!

1263
01:24:58,623 --> 01:25:02,114
Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller!

1264
01:25:40,121 --> 01:25:43,783
- Just one more chance
- Look what I got for you.

1265
01:25:43,957 --> 01:25:46,823
To prove it's you alone I care for

1266
01:25:46,993 --> 01:25:48,516
I picked it just for you
out of my garden

1267
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,355
Each night I say a little prayer for

1268
01:25:51,529 --> 01:25:53,325
Look at all the trouble
I went through to get it

1269
01:25:53,497 --> 01:25:55,590
Just one more chance

1270
01:25:55,766 --> 01:25:58,734
Just one more night

1271
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:02,427
To taste the kisses that enchant me

1272
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:07,135
- I'd want no others if you'd grant me
- What?

1273
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:10,743
Just one more chance

1274
01:26:11,645 --> 01:26:14,306
I've learned the meaning
Of repentance

1275
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,505
I'm glad because I spoke
to the fellows last year

1276
01:26:16,682 --> 01:26:17,841
and how they felt...

1277
01:26:18,016 --> 01:26:22,452
- Now, you're the jury at my trial
- Your Honor, this man had a murder...

1278
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:25,416
I know that I should serve
My sentence

1279
01:26:25,588 --> 01:26:28,318
It's gonna be all right, Rockie.
You gotta have faith in your attorney

1280
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:31,254
I spoke to Fred Sunday and he said
if he can get you out...

1281
01:26:31,426 --> 01:26:35,327
Still I'm hoping all the while
You'll give me

1282
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,428
What, what?

1283
01:26:37,597 --> 01:26:40,395
- Just one more word
- Word.

1284
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:43,295
W-O-R-D.
Spelled backwards, "Drow".

1285
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:45,992
Spelled backwards, "Drow".

1286
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:50,706
I said that I was glad
To start out

1287
01:26:50,874 --> 01:26:53,240
- What made you come back?
- Well, Mother said if I came back,

1288
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:55,206
she'd give me the car, so I...

1289
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:58,402
But now I'm back
To cry my heart out

1290
01:26:58,579 --> 01:26:59,876
I know how you feel. Don't cry,

1291
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,448
because it's those feelings
of a man who certainly...

1292
01:27:04,084 --> 01:27:07,018
Oh, just one more chance

1293
01:27:07,186 --> 01:27:09,484
I hear you talking, babe

1294
01:27:09,654 --> 01:27:12,817
Say just one more chance

1295
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:22,220
I'm sorry.

1296
01:27:23,298 --> 01:27:25,095
Excuse me.

1297
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:29,629
- How are they?
- How are they, how are they?

1298
01:27:29,804 --> 01:27:32,670
Wait till you see
what they said about me.

1299
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:37,301
Look at this.
"New Revue Smash Hit."

1300
01:27:37,876 --> 01:27:40,844
Here. "One of the highlights
of the evening was the box act

1301
01:27:41,012 --> 01:27:43,206
"of Bill Miller and Ted Rogers.

1302
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,076
"It's a long time since Broadway
has seen a fellow

1303
01:27:46,248 --> 01:27:47,875
"as funny as the man in the box.

1304
01:27:48,884 --> 01:27:50,908
"And, incidentally,
though he wasn't billed anywhere

1305
01:27:51,086 --> 01:27:53,554
"in the theater last night,
his name is Ted Rogers.

1306
01:27:53,722 --> 01:27:55,746
"Make a note, everybody:
Ted Rogers."

1307
01:27:55,923 --> 01:27:57,584
Well, how about a drink, everybody?

1308
01:27:57,758 --> 01:28:00,555
That's a good idea.
Go ahead, Bill, you make the toast.

1309
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:04,458
I'd like to propose a toast
to a wonderful guy:

1310
01:28:04,763 --> 01:28:06,559
Mr. Sutherland.

1311
01:28:10,334 --> 01:28:12,801
Well, anyone like to dance
with an agent?

1312
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:14,993
Yes, I'd love to.

1313
01:28:22,143 --> 01:28:24,975
Hello, Mary. Sit down.

1314
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:30,344
What's on your mind?

1315
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,944
Leo, do you think Bill
has any intention

1316
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:36,575
of putting Ted's name up
and recognizing him as a partner?

1317
01:28:39,455 --> 01:28:41,047
I don't either.

1318
01:28:41,224 --> 01:28:44,192
Never found that sweet, wonderful
guy underneath, after all, huh, Mary?

1319
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:48,226
Maybe there is a nice guy underneath,
but I'm tired of digging.

1320
01:28:50,164 --> 01:28:51,721
Yes?

1321
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:55,392
- It's Bill. He's outside.
- I don't want him to know I'm here.

1322
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:58,730
Just a minute. Come in here.

1323
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:07,476
All right, send him in.

1324
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:13,406
Well, Leo, looks like I hit the jackpot.
You ever read such reviews?

1325
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:15,242
Tell you what I want, Leo:

1326
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:17,941
Full page ads, back page.

1327
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:22,383
Variety, Billboard, all the trade papers
in the country. Shoot the works.

1328
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:23,782
Full-page picture of me...

1329
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:26,048
- What about the kid?
- What about him?

1330
01:29:26,224 --> 01:29:28,555
I think you ought to have his picture
and his name on the ads,

1331
01:29:28,726 --> 01:29:31,126
- Right alongside of yours.
- Well, I don't.

1332
01:29:31,295 --> 01:29:35,754
Everybody else does: critics,
all your friends, even your wife.

1333
01:29:35,931 --> 01:29:38,695
Look, Leo, no critic's gonna tell me
how to run my business.

1334
01:29:38,867 --> 01:29:40,390
Neither are my friends or my wife.

1335
01:29:40,701 --> 01:29:42,896
This is my act. Bill Miller, single-O.

1336
01:29:43,638 --> 01:29:46,105
The kid's all right.
Nobody likes him better than I do.

1337
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:48,933
There's something you wise guys
don't understand.

1338
01:29:49,108 --> 01:29:52,076
Once that kid's name is mentioned,
then he's no more part of the audience.

1339
01:29:52,243 --> 01:29:54,108
And when that happens,
he stops being funny.

1340
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:56,375
You're right, and I'd agree with you
100 percent

1341
01:29:56,547 --> 01:29:58,981
if the kid was an ordinary stooge.
But he's not.

1342
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:00,308
He's half your act.

1343
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:01,711
Sure, and he's gone over that way

1344
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:04,182
because he's still a member
of the audience. Unknown.

1345
01:30:04,352 --> 01:30:05,944
Look, Bill, you're a phenomenon.

1346
01:30:07,155 --> 01:30:10,885
I've handled hundreds of actors
in my time but you take all the prizes.

1347
01:30:11,392 --> 01:30:13,791
You're a ham with a double M.

1348
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:17,158
- What's that?
- It's our contract.

1349
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:19,528
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

1350
01:30:20,765 --> 01:30:22,756
I woke up this morning
and it suddenly occurred to me,

1351
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:24,764
you have to let the other fellow live.

1352
01:30:24,968 --> 01:30:27,960
Unless you do,
the whole thing is nothing.

1353
01:30:28,271 --> 01:30:32,865
All my life, I've wanted to do one thing
as a matter of principle.

1354
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:36,041
Well, today, I am a man.

1355
01:30:38,345 --> 01:30:40,438
That was a mighty pretty speech
you just made.

1356
01:30:40,614 --> 01:30:43,013
- What's going on here?
- But yours wasn't.

1357
01:30:43,182 --> 01:30:45,615
Your little speech was petty
and kind of cheap.

1358
01:30:45,784 --> 01:30:48,218
I'm surprised you didn't cancel him
a long time ago, Leo.

1359
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,387
Well, if that's the way he feels,
I don't need him.

1360
01:30:50,554 --> 01:30:52,613
You're right, Bill.
You don't need him, either.

1361
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,689
And every day it'll be someone else
you don't need.

1362
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:57,189
And one night, you'll be
sitting around all by yourself

1363
01:30:57,359 --> 01:30:59,190
in front of a pile
of your own photographs.

1364
01:30:59,528 --> 01:31:02,519
Well, from now on, you may consider
our contract at an end.

1365
01:31:03,064 --> 01:31:05,531
Mary, you don't mean that.

1366
01:31:32,686 --> 01:31:34,983
Well, what's the matter with you?

1367
01:31:35,555 --> 01:31:39,422
- Oh, nothing.
- Come on. What is it?

1368
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,089
- I don't know if I should say it.
- Go ahead and say it.

1369
01:31:48,732 --> 01:31:50,392
What are you gonna do
about Mary, Bill?

1370
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:54,126
- You got any ideas?
- No.

1371
01:31:54,602 --> 01:31:56,763
Except I don't think you ought to
let her go away.

1372
01:31:56,938 --> 01:32:00,600
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- Sure, Bill.

1373
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:03,173
But she loves you,
and if there's something wrong,

1374
01:32:03,342 --> 01:32:07,141
I think you ought to go to her
and try and straighten it out.

1375
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,106
Maybe it's none
of my business, but...

1376
01:32:10,281 --> 01:32:13,808
That's right.
It's none of your business.

1377
01:32:16,085 --> 01:32:19,542
- Yeah, maybe it's not.
- So shut up.

1378
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:27,654
You know, I think you had
a lot to do with Mary leaving me.

1379
01:32:27,827 --> 01:32:29,055
Oh, don't say that, Bill.

1380
01:32:29,229 --> 01:32:33,665
All that stuff about
anything I do is OK with you.

1381
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:37,464
I knock my brains out trying
to make something of myself.

1382
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:41,468
And you, you with
your checkered suit.

1383
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:43,103
What do I get for it?

1384
01:32:43,272 --> 01:32:45,968
You're talking crazy, Bill.
You shouldn't be thinking that way.

1385
01:32:46,142 --> 01:32:48,666
- I don't like to hear it.
- You don't like it?

1386
01:32:48,877 --> 01:32:51,572
Well, that's tough. I don't like it.

1387
01:32:51,745 --> 01:32:54,373
I'm sick and tired
of looking at you anyway.

1388
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:59,516
You really mean that?

1389
01:33:03,087 --> 01:33:04,987
OK, Bill.

1390
01:33:08,758 --> 01:33:10,521
I'll move out of
the apartment tonight.

1391
01:33:10,694 --> 01:33:13,093
That makes two of us.

1392
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:16,491
Bye, Bill.

1393
01:33:17,765 --> 01:33:19,595
Don't drink too much.

1394
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:22,394
Remember, you've got
a show to do tonight.

1395
01:33:26,839 --> 01:33:30,205
You bet I've got a show to do.
I'll show everybody.

1396
01:33:33,811 --> 01:33:36,108
Gee, Mary, I wish you weren't
going to Europe.

1397
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:40,009
Thanks, Frecklehead,
but it'll be good for me to get away.

1398
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:43,310
Doctors say
nothing like an ocean voyage...

1399
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:47,782
- Answer it, please.
- Sure.

1400
01:33:50,857 --> 01:33:52,414
Hello?

1401
01:33:52,891 --> 01:33:55,791
Oh, just a minute, Mr. Sutherland.
It's Sutherland.

1402
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,552
I'll take it.

1403
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,260
Hello, Mr. Sutherland.

1404
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:04,229
Mary, I hate to bother you,
but we've quite a problem.

1405
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,460
Bill's insisting upon going on,
but there's no Ted.

1406
01:34:07,636 --> 01:34:10,695
He and the kid have broken up.
I can't find him anywhere.

1407
01:34:10,905 --> 01:34:12,462
And Bill wants to do a single.

1408
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,164
Bill's all right. He's just been trying
to prove something

1409
01:34:15,342 --> 01:34:17,400
since the day he was born.

1410
01:34:17,977 --> 01:34:21,104
Mr. Sutherland,
would you do me one big favor?

1411
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:22,938
Let Bill do his single.

1412
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:24,945
But, Mary, that's too risky.

1413
01:34:25,683 --> 01:34:29,209
One act would never make or break
the Sutherland Revue,

1414
01:34:29,386 --> 01:34:32,253
but it might make or break
a great guy.

1415
01:34:32,454 --> 01:34:34,922
Please, Mr. Sutherland. For me?

1416
01:34:35,124 --> 01:34:38,615
For his sake? Let him go on.

1417
01:34:39,193 --> 01:34:41,387
So this panhandler walked
over to me and said,

1418
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:44,586
"I haven't had a bite in three days."
So I bit him.

1419
01:34:45,498 --> 01:34:48,331
Which reminds me, I was standing
in front of the Hotel Astor...

1420
01:34:48,501 --> 01:34:51,333
That's where I live,
in front of the Hotel Astor...

1421
01:34:52,003 --> 01:34:53,230
When my wife came up
to see me.

1422
01:34:53,404 --> 01:34:55,235
You know, my wife and I
were gonna get a divorce,

1423
01:34:55,406 --> 01:34:57,896
but we couldn't figure out who got
the custody of her mother.

1424
01:34:59,809 --> 01:35:02,038
Which reminds me, I took my
mother-in-law to the beach,

1425
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,235
but the only thing that got sunburned
was her tongue.

1426
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:23,185
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to apologize.

1427
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:28,020
This is the Sutherland Revue...

1428
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,490
...which is supposed to bring you
the finest entertainment

1429
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,360
that can be offered.

1430
01:35:33,034 --> 01:35:35,263
You've heard of an act, Bill Miller.

1431
01:35:35,436 --> 01:35:37,460
And Bill Miller is me.

1432
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:39,564
But I'm only half an act.

1433
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,603
The fellow that made the act work
is a little guy by the name of...

1434
01:35:44,876 --> 01:35:46,740
...Ted Rogers.

1435
01:35:46,977 --> 01:35:49,207
And he isn't here tonight.

1436
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:53,506
I can play an accordion
and sing a song.

1437
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:57,180
But I need that spark,
that something...

1438
01:35:57,352 --> 01:36:00,878
...the chemistry that makes two men
a successful team.

1439
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:06,351
I've bored you,
and I've imposed upon you.

1440
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:10,088
I've done an injustice
to an audience.

1441
01:36:11,129 --> 01:36:14,222
This is the biggest sin
in show business.

1442
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:16,229
To be a ham.

1443
01:36:17,234 --> 01:36:19,633
I humbly apologize.

1444
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:24,696
- Who's your little whozis?
- None of your business...

1445
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:30,702
Who's your turtledove?

1446
01:36:37,116 --> 01:36:39,583
Who's your turtledove?

1447
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:46,778
- Who's your turtledove?
- Who's your turtledove?

1448
01:36:46,956 --> 01:36:52,052
Who's your little whozis?
Who do you love?

1449
01:36:52,227 --> 01:36:54,024
You mean you finally learned
the words?

1450
01:36:54,195 --> 01:36:55,252
Listen to this.

1451
01:36:55,496 --> 01:36:57,987
Who's your little whatzis?

1452
01:36:58,165 --> 01:36:59,756
Not bad, huh?

1453
01:36:59,932 --> 01:37:02,025
That you're dreaming of

1454
01:37:02,201 --> 01:37:04,134
I've been paying attention too.

1455
01:37:04,302 --> 01:37:09,796
Who's your little whozis?
Who do you love?

1456
01:37:09,974 --> 01:37:11,998
- Take it, boy.
- No, you take it.

1457
01:37:12,175 --> 01:37:17,043
Tell me who has you aflutter

1458
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:21,443
Whenever they're passing by

1459
01:37:23,717 --> 01:37:27,447
Melts your heart like butter

1460
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:31,578
Oh, me, oh, my

1461
01:37:31,756 --> 01:37:34,691
Say, when you get the blueses

1462
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:37,019
When you get the blueses

1463
01:37:37,194 --> 01:37:41,391
- Who you thinking of?
- Who you thinking of?

1464
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,464
- Who's your little whozis?
- Who's your little whozis?

1465
01:37:44,633 --> 01:37:47,499
Who do you love?

1466
01:38:33,536 --> 01:38:36,299
Who's your little whozis?

1467
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:39,531
A girl named Mary

1468
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:44,077
And a boy named Bill

1469
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:48,244
Who's your turtledove?

1470
01:38:50,316 --> 01:38:54,308
- It's so wonderful
- It's so wonderful

1471
01:38:54,485 --> 01:38:58,147
- To be in love
- To be in love

1472
01:38:58,322 --> 01:39:02,655
- With you
- With you
