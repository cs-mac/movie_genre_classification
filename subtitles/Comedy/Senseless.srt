1
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:59,004
Good afternoon, freshmen,

2
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,240
freshwomen and, uh,
people of freshness.

3
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,887
Welcome to Stratford University's
freshman orientation.

4
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,771
I'm your tour guide,
Darryl Witherspoon.

5
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:11,487
I got another tour group in about
a half hour, so let's get to tourin'.

6
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,858
Come on. Come on.
Speed walk. Speed walk.

7
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,739
It's good for your soul.
That's it. You got it.

8
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,043
So, as an economics major,

9
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,451
this is where I spend
the majority of my time.

10
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,997
And thanks to Stratford University's
top-notch financial aid program...

11
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:33,633
Bullshit... I spend the rest of my time
giving tours, working food services...

12
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,668
and delivering campus mail.

13
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,036
Now, this package has brought us
to the administration building.

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,061
And here, encased in this glass...
No, it's not Superfly's pimp cane.

15
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:48,256
This is the Truman Scepter.
This next package will be taking us...

16
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:50,845
to the neuropsychology building.

17
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,916
Let's go. Neuropsychology.
Let's go.

18
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,192
Let's go. Here you go.
Hold that for me. Thanks, baby.

19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,228
Hey, we're gonna stop over
at the cafeteria and bust a little suds.

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,602
Girls wash. Guys dry.
Whoo!

21
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,017
And here we have
Stratford University's prizewinning...

22
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,613
neuropsychology department.

23
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:11,645
Oh, I just wanted to thank you
all for helping me out with
my campus maintenance duties.

24
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:15,011
I think it's a beautiful thing.
But remember,

25
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:17,597
plastic goes in the blue,
paper in the green.

26
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,003
Be back in a jiff.
Whoo!

27
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,947
Hello?

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,850
Dr. Wheedon?
Got a package for you.

29
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,372
Um, right there's fine.

30
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,746
Thank you.

31
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:39,042
Wow. That little fellow glows
in the dark, huh?

32
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,443
I wish the ones at my mom's house
would glow in the dark.

33
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,451
Um...

34
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,235
Thank you.

35
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,111
There's a building, building, building.

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,831
That building's old.
That building got windows.

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,635
And here we are,
back at Albert Lovett Library.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,043
And that, my friends,
is the end of your tour.

39
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:11,202
And the beginning of yours.
Welcome.

40
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,716
Gaining 13 and three quarters,
utilities up about a fifth of a point.

41
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:17,952
And the big-board composite
up.6 and 45236.

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,501
There were over 115 million
shares traded on the big board.

43
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:24,060
- Yeah.
- Hi. Darryl?

44
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,205
Hey, Ma. How you doin'?

45
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:28,611
Oh, same old, same old.
Blase, blase.

46
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,873
The kids are drivin' me crazy,
stove don't work and the roaches
are gettin' attitude.

47
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,177
So, when do you start
your new job on Wall Street?

48
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:36,349
Well, I don't exactly
have the job.

49
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,973
There's a lot of competition
for that Smythe-Bates job.

50
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,946
My oldest son is gonna starve.

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,955
- I'm not going to starve.
- How are you gonna pay your tuition?

52
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,450
Ma, I'll just get
another job, okay?

53
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,859
Well, you know,
I didn't want to say anything,

54
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,194
but they threatened to turn off the gas.

55
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:55,163
Just send me the bill.
How much is it?

56
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,171
- $223.
- Damn, what you cookin'?

57
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,954
Well, baby, we got to eat.
And you know I like to cook
everything down nice and slow.

58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,508
- You know.
- Uh, just send it, Ma.

59
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,686
I didn't wanna tell you this,

60
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:10,205
but, uh, you know I'm front-runner
for that Smythe-Bates job.

61
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:12,316
I'm so proud of you.

62
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,138
And the job pays $60,000 a year.

63
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:19,612
- Oh, baby.
- So, you, Darius, Lyndell,
Brandon and April...

64
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,052
Y'all don't have to worry.

65
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:25,466
I love you, Darryl.

66
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,243
Hello?

67
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,952
This is the Stratford University tuition office.
May I speak to Darryl Witherspoon?

68
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,599
Uh, no, uh, Darryl's not
with us anymore.

69
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,090
He, uh, he die.

70
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:48,059
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, th-they killed my baby.

71
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,238
He got involved with that whole
East Coast/West Coast thing,

72
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,440
and being that he is from Chicago,
they both banged on him.

73
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,796
Hi. Darryl Witherspoon.

74
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:20,156
Sammy Davis, Jr. Jr.

75
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:33,088
Lza Kill D. Wipe.
Thank you.

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,534
I am Ishmael Achmel
Mohammed Hach-tooey...

77
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:57,059
Ooh!

78
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:03,421
Have you donated sperm before?

79
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,110
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. And you're familiar
with the procedure?

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,285
Well, I've been doing it
since I was 12.

81
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:12,415
The payment procedure. Fifty dollars
upon procurement of the sperm.

82
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:17,569
Cool. Um, do you have
any of those procurement aids?

83
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:21,182
Oh, certainly.
Dirty, Beaver Hunt, Big Butt.

84
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,075
- Damn!
- Bondage Cheerleaders.

85
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,419
Ooh, four.

86
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm good for one more.
Just give me somethin' really freaky.

87
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:39,324
- Like some Siamese midget twins
menaging a goat or somethin'.
- Okay.

88
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:44,260
Ah, what's up?
What's happenin', my man?

89
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,331
- Hey.
- Got some more hair for you.

90
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:49,404
Hey, look man, I can't do nothin'
with them naps. You're back too soon.

91
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,258
- Come on, man. I need this money, man.
- I can't help you.

92
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:55,456
Please. Come on, man.
Hey, brother, look. I got some
real good hair for you, man.

93
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,182
- Look at the bush.
- Hey, look.

94
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,107
- It ain't that kind of party, man, hey.
- Come on. Look, brother.

95
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,692
- I'll throw in the ass hair for free.
- Step!

96
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:11,328
Oh, hey, dog. Landlord came by again,
looking for your part of the rent.

97
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:14,243
- God, it must be nice having a...
- A hockey scholarship?

98
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,789
Look, I'm not in the guilt game,
all right? My heart is light.

99
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,122
- What's with the X?
- That's, uh...
That's a symbol of my pledge.

100
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,097
See, I'm denying myself
certain pleasures, eh?

101
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:25,081
Eating meat.
Drinking alcohol. Sex.

102
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:28,452
- Sex?
- Yeah, all forms of sex.

103
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,450
Consider this.
Without pain and deprivation,

104
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:35,321
one can never experience
true pleasure.

105
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:39,073
You know, this is just like when you
converted to Buddhism freshman year.

106
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,962
Uh-huh? Then you went premed,
then Republican and then
the Tony Robbins tapes.

107
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,556
And let's not forget
your little bisexual stage.

108
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:50,654
Well, that just lasted two hours.
Well, two and a half.

109
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:54,466
You try watchin' Brad Pitt
in Interview With A Vampire
and not feel a little conflicted.

110
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:58,689
Look, man, all I'm sayin'...
pick an obsession, stay with it.

111
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,447
- All right?
- Mmm.

112
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:04,094
Okay, what's the new chiming sound?

113
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,164
Oh, uh, that's my Prince Albert.

114
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,756
- A what?
- Yeah, I got a piercing through my urethra.

115
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:13,124
And I run a chain
from that to my scrotum.

116
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,871
Listen.

117
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,329
Ohh.

118
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:23,932
With piercing, uh,
it's about pain and pleasure.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,932
Like you, for instance, right?
You got that inner pain,
that hunger for success.

120
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:32,739
And when you get it,
it's gonna be all the more sweet, dog.

121
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:47,007
Hello, Darryl.
Runnin' low on bacon bits over here.

122
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,378
- Hi, Scott.
- No emergency.

123
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:51,332
Just somethin' to keep
in the back of your head.

124
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,495
Oh, well, thank you for the pork report.
Appreciate it.

125
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:57,084
- You going up for that Smythe-Bates job?
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:08:57,156 --> 00:09:00,003
I'm kind of the pace car
in this Employment 500.

127
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:05,250
3.8 G.P.A. Varsity sailing.
Kappa House social chairman.

128
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:08,448
Your dad runs the third-largest bank
in Manhattan.

129
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,687
Oh, yeah, and that.
Right.

130
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:14,716
Ahh-Ahh-Ahh

131
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:18,268
Ahh-Ahh-Ahh

132
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,399
- Ahh-Ahh-Ahh
- Ooh, lookie, lookie,
Darryl sees a cookie.

133
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:26,178
- Ahh-Ahh-Ahh
- Is that Hidden Valley?

134
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,626
Or are you just happy
to see me?

135
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,410
Ahh-Ahh-Ahh

136
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:36,029
- Ahh-Ahh-Ahh
- Uh, ah, da...

137
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,512
Smythe-Bates has
long enjoyed a reputation...

138
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,915
as one of the world's premier
investment firms.

139
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,682
That is why each year we choose our new
junior analysts with tremendous care.

140
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:50,530
The Smythe-Bates man or woman
has a high G.P.A.,

141
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:55,167
a record of athletic achievement
and ties of tradition
to our firm through some...

142
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,692
of the more prominent
fraternal organizations on campus.

143
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,474
Because we regard the junior analyst
position not as a stopping point,

144
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,995
but as a stepping stone to greatness.

145
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:09,629
Now, class, I would like for you
to extend a very warm welcome
to my old friend,

146
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,634
Mr. Randall Tyson
of Smythe-Bates Brokers.

147
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,450
- Randall?
- Thank you, Professor Engel.
Good to see you.

148
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:21,502
Uh, well, this old room holds
many memories for me.

149
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:26,012
I logged quite a bit
of nap time in that back row.

150
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,728
I sincerely wish that we had a place
for all of you,

151
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,738
but that's not the case.

152
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:35,642
Five of you will be chosen,
and out of the five finalists,

153
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:39,163
the student who most closely resembles
the ideal employee...

154
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:43,611
will be chosen for the position
of junior analyst at Smythe-Bates.

155
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,692
Good luck to all of you.

156
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:49,856
All right, class, in the case study
that we were examining last week...

157
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,706
Now, the markets are up,
but consumer spending...

158
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,074
and corporate profit margins are down.

159
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,996
- Now, how would the social
planner remedy this, huh?
- Ooh!

160
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,402
- Sir?
- Downsize the labor force.

161
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:04,923
- What?
- This increases profit,
and the resulting price cuts...

162
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,363
stimulate consumer spending.

163
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:12,250
- Yo, difference of opinion here.
- Uh, Mr. Witherspoon...
and we can do without the yo-ing...

164
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,390
What he's sayin' is
let's help people by firing them.

165
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,038
Now, this seems to me,
ebonically speaking, whack.

166
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:22,174
Perhaps Darryl does have
a special insight into the blue collar,

167
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:26,173
or, should I say,
hairnet mentality.

168
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:28,251
Oh!

169
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:31,041
Look...
Wicks Morton Industrials, okay?

170
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:35,712
In 1988, their wages exceeded
their profit margins,
but instead of firing people,

171
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,872
what they did was they offered
employee contracts with wage givebacks.

172
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,991
And guess what. Their employees
spent 50 percent more
than they did the previous year.

173
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,995
Now, what that proves is what the
average Joe on the street already knows.

174
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,199
The more money they have,
the more money they can spend.

175
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:54,912
He's absolutely right. Wicks Morton did
do the right thing by their employees.

176
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,810
But then again, instead of
laying off workers, they took
out a $20 million loan...

177
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,917
from a certain bank here in Manhattan,
and from what I hear,

178
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,476
- From your dad?
- They're on the verge of defaulting.

179
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:09,152
So what happens to your average
workin' Joe when Wicks Morton goes down?

180
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,162
I don't think they're gonna end up
in the checkout line.

181
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:14,051
I think it's gonna be
the unemployment line.

182
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:17,629
And the president of the company
is gonna be right there with them.

183
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:23,388
Ebonically speaking,
you don't know shit.

184
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,934
Dare I say,
you're out of your league.

185
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:37,821
Darryl, although carrying water
is technically an aerobic activity,

186
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:42,048
it does not qualify you
to play college-level hockey.

187
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:45,116
Coach, please. Look, I need this time.
Please, Coach.

188
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:48,003
Look, I'm just a brother from the hood
with a simple dream to play hockey.

189
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,923
Don't make me turn
to drugs or gangs...

190
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,377
LaFlour!

191
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,814
- He's on your team.
- Just following through, Coach!

192
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:01,601
- Yeah. Sure, Tim.
- Hey, Tim.

193
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,937
When was the last time
you had sex?

194
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:06,852
- Why?
- You're just a little jumpy,
that's all.

195
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,015
Hey, can you do me a favor?

196
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:13,248
Can you please talk to the coach and try
and get me some time on the ice?

197
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,763
I need a sport, or I'm not gonna get
the Smythe-Bates job.

198
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,771
Please. I need it
for my family, man.

199
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:21,916
Right, yeah,
I'll talk to Coach for ya, eh?

200
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:24,290
Thanks, Tim.

201
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:27,138
Uh, these things
are too tight!

202
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,803
Nice shot!

203
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,130
The outside!

204
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:48,193
Come on. Come on.

205
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,633
Wait. Wait.

206
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,038
Uh, wait!

207
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,818
Uh, oh... Oh, my ass!

208
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,735
Wait.
My sack, my sack, my sack!

209
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,281
Hip-Hup-Zip-Hup!
Freshmen.

210
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,250
- Hey, what's up?
I got somethin' to show you, eh!
- I don't wanna see it.

211
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,364
No, no, no. You know how I always lose
my apartment key, right?

212
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:24,891
I always lose it.
But look... look wh...

213
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,778
It's new.
I call it my key to happiness.

214
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:31,389
Oh, my God. You know what you are?
You're a freak show.

215
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,454
Hey, the landlord called again.
I'm worried about you, right?

216
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:38,753
Don't worry about it, dog.
I'll get the rent.

217
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,722
Hey, it's all good, dog.
Listen, you may not have faith in fate.

218
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,446
But, my man,
fate has faith in you.

219
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:56,355
Welcome. You are here to participate
in the first round of human testing...

220
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,395
of Protocol 563.

221
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:01,599
You'll be the first people
to take this drug.

222
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:06,370
Federal regulations require me
to list all possible
side effects of this experiment.

223
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:11,072
Please listen carefully. This drug has
not been shown to be toxic in rats...

224
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,646
and should be similarly nontoxic
in human beings, theoretically.

225
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:19,513
Potential side effects
may include nausea,

226
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:22,173
insomnia, headaches,

227
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:25,408
flaking of the scalp,
intestinal cramping,

228
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:29,054
constipation, rectal burning,

229
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:33,052
rectal itching, rectal swelling...

230
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:36,318
and dizziness.

231
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:40,098
- Sir?
- Yes.

232
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:43,939
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah. Rectal itchin'. No problem.

233
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:46,971
- And you are willing to participate?
- It's paying, right?

234
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,268
This is a model of the drug
we've created here.

235
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,706
It is designed
to increase the senses...

236
00:15:56,772 --> 00:16:00,895
far beyond levels ever experienced
by a human being before.

237
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,818
Are you following this?

238
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,534
Yeah. What are you sayin'?
I'll be able to see better?

239
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:08,986
- Like an eagle.
- How 'bout my hearin'?

240
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,762
- Ultrasonic.
- Taste, smell and feelin' too?

241
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:17,625
The five senses will be magnified
ten times over.

242
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,915
Wow! Supersenses.

243
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,674
This is the drug.

244
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:30,650
How you take it is
of the utmost importance.

245
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:35,001
You must take exactly six cc's
every single day.

246
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,523
And you must inject it
into the buttocks.

247
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:42,589
- These are your instructions.
- How much do I get paid?

248
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,653
You must also take it when your
serotonin levels are at their lowest,

249
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,579
just before you go to bed.

250
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,554
How much do I get paid?

251
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:55,362
If and when your senses
become heightened,

252
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:59,770
the initial phase will be
disorienting and disturbing.

253
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,718
Deep breathing may help.

254
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:10,170
- Are there any questions?
- How much do I get paid?

255
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,277
Um, well, since you're
the only person,

256
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:17,374
after the experiment's over,
you get $3,000.

257
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,386
$3,000?

258
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,933
Whoo! $3,000.

259
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:27,746
Doctor, look, for $3,000...

260
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,200
you can inject me
with the Ebola virus, okay?

261
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,829
$3,000.

262
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,537
Doctor, for $3,000, I'm gonna be
your little Outbreak monkey, okay?

263
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,448
Hey what's with all the bongs
and the booze?

264
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,371
Going to a party
at Rick James' house?

265
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:49,851
No, just doin' a little winter cleaning,
purifying the apartment, eh?

266
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:53,404
Oh, that sounds fine. Me, I'm gonna
go in there, eat a little pig,

267
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,712
smoke a little crack,
masturbate a little bit.

268
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,627
- Care to join me?
- No, all I'm doing tonight is soaking...

269
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,179
little limp Timmy
in some rubbing alcohol.

270
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,772
- Oh.
- Turns out the Prince Albert
was a bad idea.

271
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:07,804
Yeah, I could've told you that one.
Hey, dude, I wanted to thank you, man.

272
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:12,185
I got a little bit of time on the ice.
I think my game is improving.

273
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,319
Uh, about that, the thing is...
I've been practicing how to say
this all night, dog...

274
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,493
'Cause the thing is, the last
thing I would want to do
is hurt your feelings, right?

275
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,735
- You got your key?
- Oh.

276
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:23,651
'Cause sometimes, you know,
sometimes when it comes to hockey,

277
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,570
sometimes people suck.

278
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:27,578
Look, I don't care, okay?

279
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:30,172
The only reason I'm playing hockey
or doin' this stupid frat...

280
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:32,316
is to get
the Smythe-Bates job.

281
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:35,071
Oh, I know that.
But to suck at hockey the way you suck,

282
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,362
you know, suck the way
that fat kids or old people
might suck... I mean, you suck.

283
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:42,559
Hey! I mean,
you really suck.

284
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,213
I mean, it's like, you know, you get
on the ice and you're horrifying.

285
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:47,323
- You just watch.
You're like a hoser on there...
- Would you give me that?

286
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:51,230
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:02,145
Do you wanna freak

288
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:04,830
Do you wanna freak

289
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,071
Do you wanna freak

290
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,311
- Do you wanna freak
- Damn. Mmm.

291
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:12,762
I'm gonna freak it for ya

292
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,323
- I'm gonna freak
- Ooh, what's up, baby?

293
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,851
Do you wanna freak

294
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,345
Do you wanna freak

295
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,235
Oh, man!

296
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,918
Ooh, you like that?

297
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,834
You wanna see
some more of this later?

298
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,769
Whoo! Hey, hey, you got pull
around here, right?

299
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:36,154
Hey, why don't you pledge me? I wanna
be a Kappa. Come on, man. Pledge me.

300
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:41,694
Look, you can beat me, spank me.
Look, you could brand the inside
of my crack. Please.

301
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,673
Excuse me?

302
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:48,025
Oh, no. I was just, um...
I'm... Hi.

303
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,074
You're high.
Well, that would explain it.

304
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,962
No, I'm not high as in, you know, high.

305
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,002
I mean "hi" as in "hello."

306
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:58,043
How are you? Hi.
Darryl.

307
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:00,571
Hey, I was wondering if maybe,
you know, me and you could...

308
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:04,506
Let me guess. Maybe we could
get together a little later.

309
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,489
Get to know each other
a little better...

310
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,636
over a glass of something
with alcohol in it, right?

311
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:13,049
If you don't drink,
we could have a Yoo Hoo or somethin'.

312
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,162
Janice.

313
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:20,929
- Could I call you?
- Maybe.

314
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,955
- Witherspoon.
- Hey, Scott.

315
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:28,094
- Rushing as a senior, huh?
- Hey, just trying to join a frat, man.

316
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,433
- Right on. Have a seat.
- Cool.

317
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,242
By the way, it's "fraternity,"
not "frat." You wouldn't call
your country a...

318
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,282
Hey, whoa.
Not since the Bush years.

319
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:39,387
You know what I'm sayin'?

320
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:42,426
- Ooh.
- I know why you're here, buddy.

321
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,507
You see what you want and you go
after it, and I like that.

322
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,962
But we're not here for you
to put on your resume so you
can get the Smythe-Bates job.

323
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:52,029
Oh, I get it. You're here
so you can put it on your resume.

324
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,612
- You know what I'm sayin', brother?
- Darryl, you little table turner.

325
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,236
The truth is, you're too good
for us here, man.

326
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,762
You're too cool.
We're a bunch of nerds.

327
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:04,512
You wouldn't fit in. Like Stan here.
He's captain of the wrestling team.

328
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:08,802
He wins all the time. He's a bore.
Or Thomas, class president.

329
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,795
What's up, baby? Still can't get a hang
of the whole "bad means good" thing.

330
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,071
Doesn't make sense to him.

331
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,856
Bottom line is,
you're an MTV video.

332
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,120
Everybody say, "Hey, ho."

333
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:24,416
And we're VH1 on James Taylor weekend.

334
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,956
We're a bunch of phonies,
Darryl, but you're keepin' it real.
Don't let us ruin that.

335
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:33,304
- Scott. Come on, man.
- You're just not Kappa material.

336
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,370
But, Scott, I'm sayin'...

337
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:40,161
But thanks for tryin'.

338
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:52,698
- Bye-bye.
- Darryl.

339
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,066
Darryl.

340
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:59,230
Darryl.

341
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:55,392
Can't get no worse than this.

342
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,347
Okay, thanks.

343
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:02,016
This exam counts very heavily
toward your midterm grade.

344
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:05,379
So if you are going
for that Smythe-Bates job,

345
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,964
I suggest you take it very seriously.

346
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:16,830
Excuse me. Somebody isn't
zestfully clean this morning.

347
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,874
Screw you.
I'm clean.

348
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,882
Ooh.

349
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,813
- All right, people.
- Aah.

350
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,272
You have one hour
to complete this examination.

351
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:44,162
And you may begin now.

352
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:54,210
Aah. Ohh.

353
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:27,453
Hey, Darryl, why don't you pull over
to the nervous breakdown lane?

354
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,497
Hey, Queasy Jefferson,
bring it down a notch.

355
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,458
- Will you all just cut this shit!
- Oh, my God!

356
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,378
Oh, my God.

357
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:16,477
You!

358
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,914
You better fix that damn watch.

359
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:23,518
And you, rich girl. We know you
got money. Put that damn diamond away.

360
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:26,849
And, eh, British guy,
if you gonna live in this country,

361
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:29,370
you'd better go see a damn dentist
about that stink-ass breath.

362
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:32,029
You smell like hot garbage!

363
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,994
Now, please, I'm tryin' to take
a test here! This is my future!

364
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,882
Mr. Witherspoon, sit down!

365
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:43,290
And one more outburst from you,
and you are out of my classroom!

366
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:46,233
Oh, I'm sorry, professor.
That was my Tourette's syndrome.

367
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:48,445
Piss on me, I'm on fire!
I just... I just can't help it.

368
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:52,574
Michael Jackson's a Puerto Rican!

369
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:55,709
O.J.'s on welfare. I seen him
on the line. I just can't help it.

370
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,234
You look like Bob Hope.

371
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,576
Dennis Rodman got a coochie!

372
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,491
I just really can't help it.
I can't.

373
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:07,352
I failed my test.
My dream is gone.

374
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:12,577
And this itching is tearin' my ass,
and it keeps gettin' worse and worse.

375
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:15,196
- You did this to me.
- Darryl, calm down. Calm down.

376
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,918
- Sit down. Come on.
- Get off.

377
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,834
Sit down.

378
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:24,194
- Excuse me.
- Now.

379
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:27,390
- Oh, Mama. Ahh.
- Follow the light with your eyes.

380
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:30,209
Okay.

381
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,609
What are you tryin'
to do, blind me?

382
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,294
Oh, my God,
I wanna kill you so bad.

383
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,633
This is excellent.

384
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,936
Excellent?
No, Doctor, this is not excellent.

385
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:52,378
This is an outrage. I'm gonna sue
your ass. I'm gonna sue you.

386
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:57,536
Darryl, you are experiencing
advanced rectal irritation.

387
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:02,360
But the pain will pass
as your neural pathways adjust.

388
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:06,843
Doc, you got nice nails.
Can you scratch this for me, please?

389
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,825
Right there. Ahh.

390
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:10,907
- Oh, yeah.
- To gain control...

391
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,874
over your senses,
you have to exercise them.

392
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:20,610
Your brain is trying to cope with
heightened human perception.

393
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,683
- You have to help that process.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,827
Concentrate.

395
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,634
Focus, and you will gain control
over your supersenses.

396
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:33,889
Ow! God. Oh, spread it.
Ohh!

397
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:37,697
Hey, Doctor, can I borrow these?

398
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,097
Thank you.

399
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,455
Ahh.

400
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:45,410
Oh, yeah.

401
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,330
Ooh!

402
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:49,566
Ahh.

403
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:00,217
What's the matter?

404
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:04,634
Uh... I got a snag.

405
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,554
Yeah.

406
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,562
Yeah.

407
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:12,734
- You are weird.
- I'm weird?

408
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:17,794
Look at you.
Are you all right?

409
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:22,049
- Oh, I'm just not feeling well.
- That's too bad.
I'm going over to the hockey rink.

410
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:24,188
Ah, I gave up on hockey.

411
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,047
- It's stupid.
- You gave up?

412
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:28,929
I heard back
from Smythe-Bates today.

413
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:35,063
I'm not even a finalist.

414
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,811
- Not a what?
- I'm not a finalist.

415
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, you don't want to be hanging out
with those Wall Street losers anyway.

416
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:48,314
What am I gonna tell my mom?

417
00:28:48,387 --> 00:28:51,616
Oh, dog. I'm sorry.

418
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:01,538
Aah.

419
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:06,076
Focus, concentrate.

420
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:08,962
Find the control.

421
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,018
Oh, my God.

422
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,600
Normal.

423
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,715
Super.

424
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:46,108
Normal.

425
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:50,496
Super.

426
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,799
Damn.

427
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:06,650
Stratford University would like to
welcome our five excellent finalists,

428
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,959
their families
and the distinguished executives...

429
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:13,250
of the Smythe-Bates company
to this very special banquet.

430
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:15,486
Hear, hear.

431
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,569
You look so sexy
in that bow tie.

432
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:24,155
Do you want to come
on over after?

433
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:27,707
- Oh, that'd be great.
I just wanna lick you up and down.
- Shh.

434
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,146
I'm gonna tie you
to the bed post...

435
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,414
and beat the shit out of you
with my black leather whip.

436
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:39,548
Hey, Darryl, you eat this kind
of crap, right?

437
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:42,488
- Yeah.
- Okay, tell me if it's sweet enough.

438
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,922
Mmm.

439
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:52,059
Mmm, good. Mmm.

440
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:53,986
Mmm.

441
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:56,986
Where you get this from?
This is the best thing I ever tasted.

442
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,968
Mmm. Mmm.

443
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:01,531
Mmm. God.
Mmm. Delicious!

444
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:03,458
Wait, wait.
Your button's all messed up!

445
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,792
- You're always looking out for me.
- Ooh.

446
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:08,161
- Eh, what table you got?
- The dais.

447
00:31:08,227 --> 00:31:11,042
Well, now you got table four and six.
Thank you.

448
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:13,376
Now I have to toss more salads.

449
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:17,436
Good evenin', Mr. Tyson and student.

450
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:20,223
- Economics.
- Darryl Witherspoon. How are you, sir?

451
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,008
- This is Robert Bellweather.
- Hey, Mr. Bellweather. Nice to meet you.

452
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:24,962
- Pleasure.
- Hello, Darryl.

453
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:26,914
- I will be your server this evening.
- Good.

454
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,150
Yippee.

455
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,227
You're an impressive candidate,
Mr. Thorpe, and I'm curious...

456
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:34,495
to hear about your opinions
on the current state of the market.

457
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:36,668
Certainly.
I, uh...

458
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:42,685
Uh, Darryl, is it... Can you be a buddy
and go fill that with somethin'?

459
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:55,003
What's your opinion
of Shamada Technology, Scott?

460
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:57,214
- Shamada.
- Shamada.

461
00:31:59,427 --> 00:32:02,427
Oh, uh, Shamada Tech.
Right. They...

462
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,248
- That's a good question. They're, um...
- Here you are, Mr. Tyson.

463
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:07,835
An extra salad for you.
Just keep it on the download, okay?

464
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:10,111
- That's very generous,
but I've got plenty.
- Mr...

465
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,034
Mr. Tyson, please,
it's the least I can do...

466
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,961
for the man who's buyin' up Deauville
Publishin', settin' the trend for LBO's.

467
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,890
I mean, Mr. Tyson, you a genius.

468
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:19,810
Thank you.

469
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:24,348
No, Mr. Tyson, thank you.
Do you realize that all these
other companies follow your lead?

470
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,347
Let's take Shamada, for example.
They're gonna drop precipitously
in the fourth quarter.

471
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,808
Well, that's very odd.
We were just talking about that.

472
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,792
Get the...
Out of here!

473
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,842
You know about this?
How?

474
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,769
Mr. Tyson, economics is my life.

475
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:40,380
Actually, I read in the papers,
there's this Japanese firm
coming out with this new chip.

476
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:42,491
It's supposed to be twice
as fast and twice as cheap.

477
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:45,530
And with the debt that Shamada's
carrying from that last buyout,

478
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,425
I don't think
they're gonna make it.

479
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,563
If I was you guys,
I'd sell and sell fast.

480
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,602
- I already have.
- You did?

481
00:32:52,675 --> 00:32:55,490
You see, and that is
why this man is a genius.

482
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:58,588
- You a genius.
- Hey, uh, waiter,
could I get some wine, please?

483
00:32:58,658 --> 00:33:01,724
- Sure, my little friend.
What would you like?
- Who cares? Just go.

484
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:05,918
- Night Train it is.
- Uh, Darryl, some butter without salt.

485
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,255
That's a very bright young man.

486
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:16,194
Butter.
Butter, butter, butter.

487
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,088
Hey, where'd you guys
hide the butter?

488
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:35,745
Whoo!

489
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,474
Yes, it's so nice.
It really seems wonderful.

490
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:50,914
Go ahead.
Name a stock.

491
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:55,289
Okay, I got one.
Haskell Growth Fund.

492
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,784
Haskell Growth Fund.

493
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:00,799
341/8.

494
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:05,406
Am I right? Come on. Am I right?
Come on. Give it up. Give it up.

495
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:08,736
- Brasilia Unified.
- Brasilia Unified.

496
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:11,770
Brasilia Unified is...

497
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,592
146 flat, down from a high of 180.

498
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,513
- Ha-ha!
- Ha-ha!

499
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:19,034
Fielding Industrials.

500
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,856
Fielding Industrials.

501
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:24,344
Uh, you know, I'm just gonna throw
this one out there.

502
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:27,136
You know, I'm just gonna...
just throw it out there.

503
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,407
Fifty-five.

504
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:32,093
- And a half.
- That's it.

505
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:34,367
Huh? Huh?
The kid is nice, huh?

506
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:38,013
- How'd you memorize all this?
- It's kind of like your wife's bra size.

507
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:41,596
If you love it, you'll remember,
huh, tiger? Come on.

508
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,016
Come on, Mr. Tyson.
What's your wife's bra size?

509
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:47,033
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-six what?

510
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,212
- C.
- Thirty-six C!

511
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:59,297
Well, young man, I haven't had
such an informative meal in some time.

512
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:03,803
- I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.
- How did you fail to qualify
for the final competition?

513
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:06,362
You know, I've been workin' four jobs
just to pay my tuition,

514
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:09,598
and, uh, I don't know,
I just blew my final exam.

515
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,350
Why should such a hard worker
be punished?

516
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:16,542
- You know, I feel
like bending the rules here.
- Too bad there's already five.

517
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,334
What do you think, Bellweather?

518
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:20,508
He's certainly qualified
for the competition.

519
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,368
Good. Congratulations, Darryl.
You are now the sixth finalist.

520
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:27,809
Mr. Tyson, thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

521
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:29,947
And thank you, Mr. Bellweather.
Thank you, sir.

522
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,158
I-I promise you,
you will not regret this.

523
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:34,201
For your sake, I'd better not.

524
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:37,089
But, uh, Mr. Tyson, uh...

525
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:39,609
Yes!

526
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:42,716
F-D-P-L-T-C-L.

527
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:45,634
Okay, other eye, bottom line.

528
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:48,665
The Hilsinger Company,
Plainville, Massachusetts,

529
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:52,600
02762, printed in the U.S.A.

530
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:55,970
Over in the corner is a fingerprint.
Right there.

531
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:59,646
It looks like a smudge
of jelly... strawberry.

532
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:04,155
It's the no-frills brand.
Somethin' real cheap.

533
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:08,002
Your five senses
are operating at levels...

534
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,969
no human being
has ever experienced.

535
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,752
- We have a lot of tests to do.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, Doc.
We can't do tests today. I'm late.

536
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,950
Just hook me up with my drugs,
and let me be on my way.

537
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:21,052
Just remember,
follow the regimen exactly.

538
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:24,635
- Do not exceed the dosage.
- Okay.

539
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:28,121
Oh, Doc, uh, I wanted to apologize
'cause, you know,

540
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:30,715
I came down really hard
on you the other day.

541
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:35,259
It's just that this drug, man, it's
the best thing that ever happened to me.

542
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,851
I mean, I feel like for the first time
in my life, I'm on top of the world.

543
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:42,811
Darryl, I realize that you feel
very powerful right now.

544
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:47,771
Just remember, power is a drug
all its own. Be careful.

545
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,330
Okay.

546
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:55,137
Oh, yeah. And, Doc...
Thank you.

547
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,274
Whoo!

548
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,411
Hey, it's the little engine
that could.

549
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:12,825
- Hey, what's up, Scott?
- This party's invite only.
No invitee, so good nighty.

550
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,379
Oh, what's the matter, Scott?
You feel that Smythe-Bates job
slippin' through your fingers?

551
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,003
- Huh?
- Dude, your last name
could be Smythe-Bates,

552
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:21,562
and you still wouldn't get this job,
'cause it's mine.

553
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:24,056
- Darryl!
- Hey, how you doin', Mr. Bellweather?

554
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,105
How are you?
Mr. Tyson.

555
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,561
- Hey, didn't know you were a Kappa.
- Actually, I'm not.

556
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:32,122
Darryl's the one that got away.
Now, if you'll excuse us.

557
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:36,123
Well, I think he's the sort of Kappa man
we should be pledging.

558
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:39,041
- Absolutely. I agree.
- Well, uh, Darryl's case...

559
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:41,212
has already been decided,
I'm sorry to say.

560
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:46,520
Scott, uh, we sit on the board of this
fraternity, and we endow it as well.

561
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:48,929
I think we've earned
some input, don't you?

562
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:51,198
- Hear, hear.
- Brothers, listen up!

563
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:54,081
Brother Bob Bellweather and I
would like you...

564
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,146
to reconsider the pledgeship
of Darryl Witherspoon.

565
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,389
All in favor of Darryl say "aye."

566
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,880
- Aye.
- All opposed?

567
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:05,403
The ayes have it, Pledge Witherspoon!

568
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,210
Thanks, Scott.

569
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:17,111
Welcome aboard.

570
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:26,048
Ooh, baby's got back.

571
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:28,929
Oh, my God, Tanya,
I can't believe you said that.

572
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:36,507
This place is so packed.

573
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:39,961
- I don't know why you drag me
to these parties.
- Girl, you come to meet a man.

574
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,889
Anybody in this stall?

575
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:45,849
The problem, Tanya, is that the kind
of guy I wanna meet is never here.

576
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:48,769
- Oh, and what kind of guy is that?
- I don't know.

577
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:52,795
- Ooh, this seat is cold!
- Respectful, intelligent,

578
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:55,038
confident without being
full of himself.

579
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:58,718
Ooh, I tell ya. I'm full
of somethin' right about now.

580
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:02,561
- Damn.
- It's like everybody wants
to be the big man on campus.

581
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:06,817
But nobody wants to be
the real man on campus.

582
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:10,817
Oh.

583
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:21,121
Goddamn, girl, you smell like
somethin' crawled up in you and died.

584
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:24,634
- Not you.
- I'm beginning to feel
having standards is a curse.

585
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:27,554
Damn. What did you eat?

586
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:31,164
Corn?
I don't remember eatin' no corn!

587
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,624
Oh! Ech! Ach!

588
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:40,510
- Are you okay in there?
- Girl, I feel like I just gave birth.

589
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,928
Somebody smack its ass!

590
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,525
- Darryl.
- Hey.

591
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,976
I'm surprised to see you here.
Encore performance in the lion's den.

592
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,155
- I'm impressed.
- Well, thank you.

593
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:59,161
Oh, Darryl, this is my friend Tanya.

594
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:01,306
- Hey.
- Hey.

595
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,550
Chaka Khan.

596
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:09,118
Well, Janice, I'm gonna leave
you and your friend alone
so y'all can get better acquainted.

597
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:11,390
You're not here for me, are you?

598
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,808
'Cause I'm not worth the humiliation
these guys are gonna...

599
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:17,697
- Is that a pledge pin?
- Yes.

600
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:20,762
- Where'd you get that?
- Girl, I earned it.

601
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:24,511
Look, when you want something, you gotta
be persistent in your passions.

602
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,802
Damn, you smell good as hell.

603
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:31,329
Is that a little bit of oak...

604
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:34,362
Some flowers,
a little bit of vanilla?

605
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:37,402
Wow, that's exactly right.

606
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,962
Anyway, I should be going.

607
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:42,042
Hey, I'll walk you home.

608
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:46,178
- Good night.
- Good night.

609
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:50,847
- Whoa, comin' through.
- Hey, watch yourself.

610
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:55,165
So?

611
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:58,201
I really don't give a damn about
them fraternities, you know?

612
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:00,663
I'm just doin' it
'cause it's a means to an end.

613
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm just tryin' to get this job
and help my family out.

614
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,150
See, I've always been
like a father...

615
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:07,193
to my little sister
and my brothers.

616
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:10,168
Well, my father's pushing me
to take pre-law classes,

617
00:41:10,242 --> 00:41:13,591
but what I really love is
my 20th century poets course.

618
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,633
Hey, you know what.
I think my boy Tim is in your class.

619
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:19,553
White guy. Lanky.
Tall. Piercings.

620
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,204
- Ah, the pincushion kid.
- Yeah.

621
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:27,322
What?

622
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:31,006
Where are we going?
Darryl, what are you doing?

623
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:38,937
Sometimes you find
the most amazing thing...

624
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,807
in the most unexpected places.

625
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:48,638
- What?
- I'm just trying to decide...

626
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,870
whether I should break
my "no kissing on the first date" rule.

627
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:53,880
- Oh, so this was a date?
- No.

628
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:56,343
- Oh.
- Just planning ahead.

629
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,523
That's good.
Hey, don't worry.

630
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:02,009
I don't want you to think that I'm just
tryin' to get into your panties.

631
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:05,595
I mean, I'm pretty sure
they're really nice panties,

632
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,765
but I just wanna take it
a little slow.

633
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:11,551
How 'bout dinner at my place?
I'll call you.

634
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:14,007
- I'll answer.
- Okay.

635
00:43:01,506 --> 00:43:05,183
- Ooh!
- Say, Jack!

636
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,585
What wrong with you?

637
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:15,706
Junkie gun.
Darryl, no.

638
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:17,851
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:21,370
I was, uh, just in there taking
some special medicine.

640
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:24,540
- Yeah. It's all yours.
- Thanks.

641
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,196
- Good night.
- Good night, eh?

642
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:35,808
Yo, Coach! Coach!

643
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:37,914
- Witherspoon,
what are you doin' in pads?
- I've been practicing.

644
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:40,474
- When did you learn
to skate like that?
- Uh, I watch Ice Capades videos.

645
00:43:40,546 --> 00:43:43,480
But please, Coach, let me go out
there on the ice and show you
what I can do. Please?

646
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,562
Just give me one good reason
why I should?

647
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:52,346
Holy mother of crap.

648
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:57,274
Ooh!

649
00:43:59,074 --> 00:44:02,686
Ya-Ya!
Come with it.

650
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:05,056
Whoo!

651
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:49,055
This is Stratford University radio
coming to you live...

652
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:51,424
from Baxter Rink,
where the Panthers are set...

653
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,010
to open their season
against Brownstone U.

654
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:57,246
That's right, Chet,
and the only questions this year are...

655
00:44:57,314 --> 00:45:00,794
how badly will they stink,
how consistently will they stink...

656
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:04,478
and will they ever not stink?

657
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:08,287
Whoo! Whoo!

658
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:10,720
That's the new stopper,
Darryl Witherspoon, who's the first...

659
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:12,957
African American to play for Stratford.

660
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,489
Bender takes a face-off,
passes over to Avery.

661
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:21,921
Avery back to Bender.

662
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,921
- Stay down!
- Ooh, Flushing checked by LaFlour!

663
00:45:24,994 --> 00:45:27,361
- What got into him?
- Stratford recovers now.

664
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:30,361
Pass ahead to LaFlour on the floor now,
chases it down behind the net.

665
00:45:30,434 --> 00:45:34,230
Ooh, Brownstone regains control as...
Oh, Chet!

666
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:36,477
They're really bringin'
on the pain tonight.

667
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:39,164
And here comes Bender.
Bender over to Avery.

668
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:41,438
Avery back to Bender.
Shot! Save!

669
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:45,946
Oh, what a stop by the newcomer, uh,
Darryl... Wither... spoon.

670
00:45:46,018 --> 00:45:48,189
All right.
Bender now kicks it off.

671
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:51,935
Speeding down center ice.
Shot. And the glove save!

672
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:55,996
Hard to believe anybody could've
stopped that shot,
let alone someone on our team.

673
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:59,514
And the Panthers now charge back.
Up ahead to LaFlour.

674
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:04,157
LaFlour smoothing down center ice.
Shot! Score!

675
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:08,961
And Stratford takes the lead
for the first time in my life!

676
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:11,547
And LaFlour wins the face-off
for the Panthers.

677
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:15,262
And with just two minutes left
in the game, Stratford still has
a one-point lead.

678
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,559
And rookie Darryl Witherspoon is
just this close to a shutout.

679
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,212
Ooh, nasty check!

680
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:26,584
Brownstone regains control. Pass to
Bender, who shoots! Save, Witherspoon!

681
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,665
Everyone's gonna be asking
the same question, Chet.

682
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:31,488
Where'd this kid come from,
and who the hell is he?

683
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:34,424
Ten seconds now left in the game,
and here comes trouble.

684
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:39,447
Bender over to Avery. They've drawn
out Witherspoon. The net is wide open.

685
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:43,712
Avery to Bender. Shot!

686
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:47,073
- Save!
- Stratford wins!

687
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,145
Stratford wins!
I don't believe it!

688
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:51,487
Go, baby!
Whoo!

689
00:46:51,554 --> 00:46:53,725
I love that kid.

690
00:46:53,794 --> 00:46:57,755
The Panthers are back,
and, baby, they're black!

691
00:47:14,721 --> 00:47:18,518
What do you think
of this possible Irving Genetic
Wilcom merger, Scott?

692
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:21,082
Well, uh, Irving stock
just hit a five-year high,

693
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,488
so I'd say the outlook's
pretty rosy.

694
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:26,721
Scott, you're
a very impressive young man.

695
00:47:26,786 --> 00:47:28,925
Very impressive, indeed.

696
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:31,066
- Hello, Darryl.
- Hi, how you doin', Mr. Tyson?

697
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:33,407
Darryl, I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
but Mr. Tyson...

698
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:35,513
and I were just interfacing
about some things.

699
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,658
Oh, really.
You wouldn't happen to be interfacing...

700
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,486
about the Irving Genetics merger,
would you?

701
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:42,969
- Yes, we were.
- Well, I hope you mentioned
that the CEO of that company...

702
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:47,614
is known for bluffing to drive
up his stock prices right before
he sells his own shares.

703
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:50,551
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

704
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:53,790
Come on, Darryl.
Thank you, Scott.

705
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:55,713
Oopsy.

706
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,847
Sir, I realize
that I'm last on your list,

707
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:06,013
but I want you to know I would
do absolutely anything to get
this junior analyst position.

708
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:07,609
It's gonna take a lot to convince
that board of mine...

709
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:10,071
to pick you over
the other five candidates.

710
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:12,731
You know, playing hockey
and becoming a Kappa,

711
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:16,347
that helps, but now they have
such high expectations.

712
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:20,760
- You think you can match that?
- Match and exceed.

713
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:25,144
The board's gonna make its decision
five days after the final competition.

714
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:29,625
Bob Bellweather wants
to spend some quality time
with each of the candidates.

715
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,692
So, here you go.
Floor seats, Knicks game, Friday night.

716
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:36,893
Floor seats?

717
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:38,871
Oh, wow.

718
00:48:38,945 --> 00:48:41,117
We'll be joined by Arlo Vickers.

719
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:43,673
- From Vickers Mining?
- That's right.

720
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:46,167
He's considering becoming a client.

721
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:51,293
Now, if you can impress him
as much as you've impressed us,
that would help quite a bit.

722
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:54,013
Sir, say no more.
No problem.

723
00:48:54,082 --> 00:48:56,635
Not another word, babe

724
00:48:56,706 --> 00:49:01,114
Oh, that may have been
the best meal I've ever had.

725
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:04,087
- Well, thank you.
- Where'd you learn to cook like that?

726
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:06,878
Oh, I've just been experimentin'
a little lately.

727
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:11,517
See, cooking, it's all about balancing
your taste and smell and texture.

728
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,440
It's magic.

729
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:17,409
Is there anything you can't do?

730
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,568
Take my eyes off you.

731
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:25,944
Why no one wants
to be in love anymore

732
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:32,352
Don't know what you feel
or think, baby

733
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:35,679
You can overlook the doubting

734
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:38,047
And trying to be perfect

735
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,969
"Love is a ripe plum
growing on a purple tree."

736
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:52,027
"Love is a ripe plum
growing on a purple tree."

737
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:56,091
"Taste it once, and the spell of its
enchantment will never let you be."

738
00:49:56,161 --> 00:50:00,090
"Taste it once, and the spell of
its enchantment will never let you be."

739
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:02,812
Langston Hughes.
You know Langston Hughes?

740
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:06,045
Yeah, I know Langston Hughes.

741
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:09,245
"Love is a bright star glowing
in the far southern skies."

742
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:14,049
"Love is a bright star glowing
in the far southern skies."

743
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:17,278
"Look too hard, and its burning flame
will always hurt your eyes."

744
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,451
"Look too hard,
and its burning flame...

745
00:50:19,522 --> 00:50:22,969
will always hurt your eyes."

746
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:26,173
"These feelings of love,
truth be told,

747
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:29,755
All I want is..."

748
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,476
"All I want is to..."

749
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:34,368
Score!

750
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,954
Score!

751
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:49,793
Oh.

752
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:52,575
Oh, God. Uh.

753
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:55,489
No touch...
No touching.

754
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,750
Whoo!

755
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,807
You the best.

756
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:04,824
You've got to be kidding.

757
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:11,191
Excuse me, how much will I get
for filling this?

758
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,786
Oh, um, ooh...

759
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:21,176
Hey.
Ha-Ha.

760
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:23,900
What a surprise.

761
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:26,238
Hey, relax,
I just saw you last week.

762
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:30,235
Everybody, hi.
This is Janice.

763
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,160
Hi!

764
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:35,193
- This is April, my beautiful little sister.
- Hi.

765
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:37,754
- And this is my little man, Darius.
- Hi.

766
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:39,997
And that's Brandon.
And this right here is...

767
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,073
Hello there, my beautiful sister.

768
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:44,001
Hey, man. Watch out.
This one's mine.

769
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:47,001
You better watch your back.

770
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:52,409
Let me get a good look at my Darryl's
girl. Oh, you are a pretty thing.

771
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:54,751
Hey, come here.

772
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:56,858
- Hey, hey. You been smokin' cigarettes?
- Uh-uh.

773
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,937
Don't lie to me. Yes.
Yes, you have.

774
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,214
Menthol. Let me tell you something.
If I catch you smokin' cigarettes,

775
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:03,070
I'm gonna put somethin' on you,
you understand me?

776
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:06,203
- We good? All right.
- Mm-hmm. We good.

777
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:08,216
- Come here.
- Oh, man.

778
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:12,664
Uh-huh. Go on.
Now we good.

779
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:15,006
So, Janice, were you
in the gifted class?

780
00:52:15,074 --> 00:52:18,107
- Oh, we had a program at sc...
- 'Cause you know my Darryl
needs a gifted woman.

781
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,527
After all, he was the smartest child
in his high school class.

782
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,936
Except for that Korean girl.
What was her name, Darryl?

783
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:26,205
Fat Crack Ho, or somethin' like that.

784
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:32,062
Hey. About in the hall, I heard Mom
talking with your teachers on the phone.

785
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,449
- You messing up in school again?
- No.

786
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,693
I didn't do nothin'.
Where'd you hear that from?

787
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,412
I got magic ears
like a superhero, see?

788
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:43,165
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, look.

789
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:46,049
I make you a deal. I'll give you
a quarter for every "A" you get.

790
00:52:46,114 --> 00:52:49,430
- A quarter?
- Okay, all right. A dollar.

791
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:52,538
Man, you're an economics major.
Ain't you heard of inflation?

792
00:52:54,113 --> 00:52:56,797
- Hey, Ma. Here.
- Uh-uh, honey.

793
00:52:56,866 --> 00:53:00,444
Take it.
You need it more than I do.

794
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:03,164
Thank you, Darryl.

795
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:04,990
Normally I wouldn't take this.

796
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:09,564
When I get this job, gonna be
a whole lot more where that came from.

797
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:13,212
You know, Janice, whenever I get angry
about their daddy leaving,

798
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:17,853
I just remember
what he left behind.

799
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:22,977
What's up, dude?

800
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:32,026
Hello, baby.

801
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:44,408
Aah!

802
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,712
Hey.

803
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:52,891
- Taking more medicine?
- Yep.

804
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:54,685
How's that goin', eh?

805
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:58,201
Dude, it's going great. It's like
the best thing that ever happened to me.

806
00:53:58,273 --> 00:54:00,891
Ever since I started taking
this medicine, I feel so focused.

807
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,809
I mean, things are absolutely great
between me and Janice;

808
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:07,322
I'm this close to getting into a frat;
I'm a shoo-in for the Smythe-Bates job...

809
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:10,655
- You're playing like an
all-star hockey goalie, huh?
- It's the medicine!

810
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:13,536
You act like you're invincible.
That medicine doesn't make you
a different person.

811
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:16,318
- You're still the same old Darryl.
- Yeah?

812
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:20,542
Well, tomorrow, I'm gonna be
the same old Darryl... times two.

813
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:23,391
A double dose won't kill me.

814
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:03,902
What the hell's wrong with my arm?

815
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:08,598
My arm is asleep.

816
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,912
You didn't...

817
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:45,246
exceed the dosage, did you?

818
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:47,615
What? Exceed the...

819
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:51,391
Come on, Doctor.
What am I, stupid? Yes, I did.

820
00:55:51,457 --> 00:55:53,432
Darryl, what were you thinking?

821
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:55,448
I don't know.

822
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:57,791
I have to generate all new data.

823
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:01,119
To hell with your data.
What is my problem?

824
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,409
A flood of serotonin...

825
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:06,554
has desensitized your receptors.

826
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,730
The neural plasticity...

827
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:11,223
Of your brain has compensated...

828
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:15,608
by allowing you the use of only four
of your given senses at any given time,

829
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,853
with the missing one
constantly switching.

830
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:21,238
So, if you can see,
smell, taste and hear,

831
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:23,288
you can't feel anything.

832
00:56:23,361 --> 00:56:27,322
And if you can feel, smell,
taste and hear, you can't see.

833
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:29,848
- And if you can see, feel...
- Okay, okay!

834
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:34,012
Doc, I get the point.
Just tell me, how do you fix it?

835
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:36,187
It's nothing I can fix.

836
00:56:36,258 --> 00:56:39,105
The drug just has to...
Pass through your system.

837
00:56:39,169 --> 00:56:41,591
Trust me.
You'll know when it's gone.

838
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,706
And how long will that take?

839
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:48,185
Three days.
And I suggest you stay in bed.

840
00:56:48,257 --> 00:56:51,606
Doc, the next three days
are going to decide my life.

841
00:56:51,681 --> 00:56:54,299
The Smythe-Bates competition
is on Monday.

842
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,239
- God, this is like a bad dream.
- Darryl.

843
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,030
Your condition is...
highly unstable.

844
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:03,414
With your senses
switching on and off...

845
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,791
without warning, anything...

846
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:09,403
Doctor, I'm pretty sure
what you're saying...

847
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:13,051
would make a whole lot more sense
if I could hear you!

848
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:22,753
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Madison Square Garden,

849
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:25,883
the home of your New York Knicks.

850
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:27,863
Man, I love the Knicks.

851
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:30,654
You know, when I was little,
I used to always watch the game on TV...

852
00:57:30,721 --> 00:57:34,366
and I used to always say,
"I wonder who all those lucky
people are sitting courtside."

853
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:36,921
- Now you're the lucky one, huh?
- Thanks to you.

854
00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:39,165
- Hey, you the man.
- I am.

855
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:42,909
Gentlemen.

856
00:57:42,977 --> 00:57:45,563
- Tyson.
- Glad you could make it.

857
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:47,608
Mr. Vickers.
I'm Darryl Witherspoon.

858
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:50,431
- It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, sir.
- Nice meeting you too, Darryl.

859
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:53,628
It's a pleasure.

860
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:56,697
- ...the group discount ticket...
- Hey, Darryl.

861
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:59,420
What say we get some beers and nuts?

862
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:07,009
Uh... Hey, I have a great idea.

863
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:09,495
What do you say we all
get something to drink?

864
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,798
Wait.
Let's get some beers!

865
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:14,905
Huh? Huh?

866
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:17,694
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please rise...

867
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,616
for the national anthem.

868
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:22,267
Hey, wait. Sit down!
I'll grab 'em. Sit. Hey!

869
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:24,508
Beer!

870
00:58:24,577 --> 00:58:26,682
Hey! Beer!

871
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,819
Why is everybody standing?
Excuse me. Cuckoo!

872
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:31,897
Excuse me!
Beer, please!

873
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,839
There must be a fight or something.
Everybody's standing up.

874
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:36,953
Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh!

875
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:39,446
- Hey!
- Beers!

876
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:42,041
Thank God one of you's
got a goddamn pulse.

877
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:44,960
Beer!

878
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:48,091
Beer! Beer!

879
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:04,984
Beer!

880
00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:12,446
No. No, not now!

881
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:23,680
I'm sorry. Excuse me. My bad.
I'm sorry. My bad.

882
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:27,706
Damn it. Hey, Arlo.

883
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:31,389
Move over.

884
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:36,061
Don't tell me. Knicks are losing.
Man, they suck!

885
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:41,149
That Patrick Ewing,
boy, he's a bum.

886
00:59:41,217 --> 00:59:44,730
I mean, 7' 10", and can't make an easy
layup. That's just a waste of height.

887
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:47,703
You seen Patrick Ewing's
"Got Milk" commercial?

888
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:52,512
Man, "Got Milk"? I had milk since I seen
Patrick Ewing's ugly ass drinking it.

889
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:55,097
He make a mother lactose intolerant.

890
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:59,775
He look like a Haitian Sasquatch!

891
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:03,928
Jamaican.

892
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,008
Jamaican?

893
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,885
Hi, Mr. Ewing.

894
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:20,987
Mr. Ewing, I think you're beautiful.
No! Mr. Ewing, wait. Mr. Ewing.

895
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:23,741
Mr. Ewing!

896
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:29,057
You're still ugly, motherfucker.

897
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:37,724
So, how bad did I do?

898
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:41,721
- Well, Vickers is signing
the papers tomorrow.
- Vickers is gonna sign?

899
01:00:41,793 --> 01:00:44,510
You're gonna get the account?

900
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:50,558
You don't look happy.

901
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:53,472
If it weren't for the fact
Arlo Vickers is one-quarter man,
three-quarters pig,

902
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:55,425
you'd be gone.

903
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,718
I'll see you Sunday at the hockey game.

904
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:02,713
- I expect, for your sake,
you'll be at your best?
- Yes, sir.

905
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:05,851
Don't worry about it.

906
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:08,343
I can't smell a thing.

907
01:01:12,577 --> 01:01:15,261
Tell me again
Be my baby again

908
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:21,275
Pusher lady.

909
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,319
Yeah?

910
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:26,806
- Hey! Uh...
- Lorraine.

911
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:39,040
I've been watching you
around campus,

912
01:01:39,105 --> 01:01:41,276
and I like what I've seen.

913
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,711
Oh, I ain't mad at you, girl.

914
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:46,591
Wait. Aren't you
Janice's sorority sister?

915
01:01:46,657 --> 01:01:49,504
You know Janice, right?
My girlfriend Janice?

916
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:51,424
I know her.

917
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:55,578
I thought we'd listen
to a little music...

918
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:59,031
and drink a little wine,
get to know each other better.

919
01:01:59,105 --> 01:02:01,472
You know...

920
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,633
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

921
01:02:04,705 --> 01:02:07,803
I'd like to get
out of these clothes...

922
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:12,477
and into... you.

923
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:15,741
- They smack who's 'ho?
- Excuse me?

924
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:18,394
Sushi?
No, I don't know him.

925
01:02:18,465 --> 01:02:22,077
Little brother, I don't know why you're
trippin', okay? Because I am the bomb.

926
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:24,862
And I can have any man I want,
go anywhere I want, and I came here.

927
01:02:24,929 --> 01:02:26,936
I can hear you.

928
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,879
I mean, I'm here with you.

929
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:32,919
But I'm not supposed to be.

930
01:02:32,993 --> 01:02:35,360
Lorraine, you gotta go.

931
01:02:35,425 --> 01:02:38,142
I will... when I'm done.

932
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,798
- Come with me.
- Okay.

933
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:47,679
Oh, no. Ouch!

934
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:49,817
- Where are you going?
- Um...

935
01:02:49,889 --> 01:02:53,238
I just, uh, came over here to...
to get this.

936
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:55,168
Ooh, a stapler!

937
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:58,200
- That's so freaky!
- Oh, yeah, that's me...
Freaky Deeky, girl.

938
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:01,273
- Mmm! Show me some more.
- Okay, get on...

939
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,487
Do you like these?

940
01:03:07,553 --> 01:03:11,197
Uh... yeah, that's nice.
You make 'em yourself?

941
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:14,527
No, silly.
I had a doctor do 'em for me.

942
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,459
Wow!

943
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:22,871
- And what a mighty fine
physician he was. God!
- Go ahead and touch 'em.

944
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:25,433
You know you want to.
Don't be afraid. Touch 'em!

945
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:31,097
Ooh!
Ooh, you like it rough.

946
01:03:31,169 --> 01:03:34,071
Oh, God.

947
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:36,000
That's different.

948
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:37,952
Oh, oh, God.

949
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:39,871
Mm.

950
01:03:39,937 --> 01:03:42,936
Mm.

951
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:46,294
What's happening?

952
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:49,593
What's the matter, baby?

953
01:03:49,665 --> 01:03:51,934
I can't feel my mouth.

954
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:54,718
- Is it asleep?
- Yes, my mouth is asleep.

955
01:03:54,784 --> 01:03:56,639
Let me wake it up.

956
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,591
- You like this, don't you?
- Yes.

957
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:10,780
Oh! No, wait, wait.

958
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:13,697
- This is your first time?
- Well, actually, not my first time.

959
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:15,648
My first time,
I was about 17...

960
01:04:15,713 --> 01:04:17,622
Oh, it's... it's okay.

961
01:04:17,697 --> 01:04:21,145
I think you're sexy, and besides,
you always remember your first.

962
01:04:21,216 --> 01:04:23,704
Oh, God.

963
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:28,000
I can't feel nothing.
I can't feel no...

964
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,487
- Uh... Th-That... No, that's good.
- You feel this, huh?

965
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,797
Oh, yeah, that's good.

966
01:04:32,865 --> 01:04:35,800
What about this?

967
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:39,036
Oh, yeah. I feel that...
Take me.

968
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:44,957
I would love to, but it looks like
little homey's asleep.

969
01:04:45,025 --> 01:04:46,813
Huh? Oh, no.

970
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,695
No. Wake up!
Wake up!

971
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,313
He's gonna wake up.
He'll wake up.

972
01:04:52,384 --> 01:04:55,035
Wake up.
Lorraine! No.

973
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:57,691
Hold on! Don't leave!
Wake up!

974
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:00,248
Wake...

975
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,557
I thought you liked women.

976
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,927
I love women.

977
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:10,550
- Good luck.
- I love women.

978
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:13,079
Oh, really?

979
01:05:13,152 --> 01:05:16,218
Hi, Janice.
I'm glad to see you, baby.

980
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:19,605
You cheated on me
with that piece of trash?

981
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:23,739
Baby, I didn't do anything.

982
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:26,624
I couldn't even get it up.

983
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,592
Ow.

984
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:49,248
Oh, my God!
He's OD'd!

985
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,647
No, dog!
Don't leave us, dog!

986
01:05:51,712 --> 01:05:54,134
Don't you go down that tunnel!

987
01:05:54,209 --> 01:05:56,096
Let me check his eyes.

988
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,015
Damn it!
His pupils are dilated.

989
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,764
Dude, you gotta turn his head. If he
pukes, he's gonna choke on his barf.

990
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:03,288
Just back up, okay?
He's gonna shit on himself.

991
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:06,656
This is an epinephrine shot
straight to the heart.

992
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,728
It's the only way.

993
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,972
No, let me do it.

994
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:13,375
I love him.

995
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:19,740
Call it an intervention. We were just
trying to help you out, Darryl.

996
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,321
Help me?
Tim, let's say this gets out.

997
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:25,814
People are gonna think
I'm a smackhead.

998
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:29,085
The word's "addict." And I think
you should respect the problem, eh?

999
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,487
- I don't have a problem!
- Don't yell at me.

1000
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:33,560
I don't have a problem.

1001
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:38,368
It was an experimental medicine
given to me by the university,
and it messed up my senses.

1002
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,320
That and heroin?

1003
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:42,523
- I am not on heroin!
- Don't yell at me.

1004
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:44,600
I'm not yelling at you.

1005
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:46,844
Understand, I'm in a bad state.

1006
01:06:46,913 --> 01:06:49,401
And you, my friend,
you're making it worse, okay?

1007
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,091
My private life is a mess,
and God knows what the hell's
happening with my career.

1008
01:06:52,161 --> 01:06:54,070
And I'm not yelling at you.

1009
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:57,528
To get Hell Night
started off with a bang.

1010
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,041
I'd like you little plebes to join me
in a putrid bowl of liquid shit.

1011
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:04,055
Sounds good.

1012
01:07:04,129 --> 01:07:06,016
- I'm buying.
- Hey.

1013
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:10,462
Witherspoon.
There's my favorite jackass.

1014
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,863
Hi, Scott.
Sorry I'm late.

1015
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,547
Oh, wow. Is that punch?
Looks good.

1016
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:18,203
It is good.
Have a sip.

1017
01:07:18,273 --> 01:07:20,607
- Thanks, Scott.
- You're surely welcome.

1018
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:32,221
Yuck.

1019
01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:36,538
Holy crap.

1020
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:41,053
A little bland.

1021
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:45,277
Your final test before you enter
the Kappa brotherhood is a tricky one.

1022
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:48,640
Remember, a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

1023
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:51,836
And, Witherspoon, everybody knows
you're the weakest link.

1024
01:07:51,904 --> 01:07:55,734
- Move it, scum!
- Weak links must be forged in fire.

1025
01:07:55,808 --> 01:07:58,940
- Hold on, Scott. Scott...
- Get over there, buddy. Come on now.

1026
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:00,951
Let's go.
Take the hits.

1027
01:08:01,025 --> 01:08:03,359
Aah! Yeah, like that.

1028
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:05,726
- I don't feel anything.
- Aah! You suck!

1029
01:08:05,793 --> 01:08:07,484
Aah!

1030
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:09,014
- Aah!
- Jesus.

1031
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:10,976
Yeah!

1032
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:15,581
My mama hits harder
than that.

1033
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:20,092
Yeah!

1034
01:08:29,312 --> 01:08:31,833
Tonight, your Panthers
face off against the mighty team...

1035
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:34,490
from Astoria University for
a chance to lead the division...

1036
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,949
in something other than tuition.

1037
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:39,991
Chet, the Panthers haven't
beaten Astoria in 30 years,

1038
01:08:40,064 --> 01:08:42,650
but with Witherspoon in net
this charged-up Stratford crowd...

1039
01:08:42,721 --> 01:08:45,688
has found a reason to believe.

1040
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:48,827
And Astoria takes
the face-off and races down the ice...

1041
01:08:48,897 --> 01:08:51,166
towards star goalie Witherspoon.

1042
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:58,460
Oh! Witherspoon takes out
one of the good guys!

1043
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:00,950
And Astoria picks up a gimme.

1044
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:03,801
Yeah!

1045
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,782
Whoo!

1046
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:08,955
- Goddamn!
- Ah, God! Come on!

1047
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:12,090
I'm gonna get outta here. Let's go.

1048
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,477
With five minutes left,
Astoria leads by 12.

1049
01:09:18,272 --> 01:09:20,858
Where is it? Where is it?

1050
01:09:20,929 --> 01:09:23,580
This sucks!

1051
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:29,270
Janice, baby, please be home.

1052
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:35,196
Don't say anything, please.

1053
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:40,221
Oh. God, this is
so hard for me.

1054
01:09:40,288 --> 01:09:43,965
I'm sorry. You believed in me
when nobody else did.

1055
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:47,032
You made me feel special,
and I let you down.

1056
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:49,973
I betrayed you;
I hurt you.

1057
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,830
And because of that, I might
lose something that I want so much.

1058
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,068
I'm not gonna lose it
without a fight.

1059
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:57,504
Look, I know this sounds crazy, but...
I think I love you.

1060
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,758
I love the way you feel; I love the way
you smell; I love your body.

1061
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:04,792
Damn, baby, your breasts got big!
Ohh!

1062
01:10:04,864 --> 01:10:07,352
No!

1063
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:09,977
Daddy, what...

1064
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,285
Darryl?

1065
01:10:12,353 --> 01:10:15,517
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

1066
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:17,592
Darryl?

1067
01:10:17,665 --> 01:10:19,999
Mr. Tyson?
What the hell are you doing here?

1068
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:22,748
- This is my daughter.
- That's your father?

1069
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:26,294
So your mama must be black.

1070
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:29,335
Mr. Tyson, are you dipping
in the chocolate?

1071
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,914
Is this the young man
you've been seeing?

1072
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:36,570
Save your breath.
I've already given myself the lecture.

1073
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,706
Now I'm gonna give you
the lecture, Darryl.

1074
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,582
Next time you wanna pull that whole
sweet, honest, decent young man con,

1075
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:49,110
do it on someone else.

1076
01:10:49,185 --> 01:10:51,640
It wasn't a con.
I am that man.

1077
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:55,422
- Spare me, Darryl.
- I'm just going through a whole
lot of stuff right now, okay?

1078
01:10:55,488 --> 01:10:58,390
- What stuff?
- Well...

1079
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:00,603
You know, I don't want to hear it.

1080
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:04,120
Look, it doesn't matter, okay?
Lt'll all be over soon, I promise.

1081
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,298
Look, I'm every bit
the man I said I was.

1082
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:09,914
- Why should I believe you?
- Because I need you to.

1083
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,615
Come on.
Trust me.

1084
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:16,793
I wish I could.

1085
01:11:16,864 --> 01:11:19,548
J...

1086
01:11:31,744 --> 01:11:33,653
Hey.

1087
01:11:39,009 --> 01:11:42,304
Tim. Where you been, man?
I've been looking all over town for you.

1088
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:44,702
- Look, I need your help, bro.
- Yeah, anything.

1089
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:48,064
All right. Look. Tomorrow's the final
competition for the Smythe-Bates job.

1090
01:11:48,128 --> 01:11:50,998
Dude, I gotta study.
Will you help me?

1091
01:11:52,288 --> 01:11:54,143
Hell, yeah.

1092
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:58,367
I appreciate you helping me
study like this, Dad.

1093
01:11:58,432 --> 01:12:01,334
I'm not going to help you; they are.

1094
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,067
- When growth funds do well,
value funds do what?
- Not so well.

1095
01:12:15,137 --> 01:12:17,787
- As you can see...
- Mm-hmm.

1096
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:20,791
Is perfect competition possible?
The analytic model...

1097
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:25,272
- When growth funds do well,
value funds do...
- Not so well.

1098
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:28,890
- Because?
- Because I said so.
Can we move on?

1099
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,222
That isn't enough, Scott.
What you're missing is the reason why.

1100
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:36,478
No, what I'm missing is the latte
I ordered ten minutes ago.

1101
01:12:40,992 --> 01:12:43,414
Well, I drink like a squid.

1102
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,977
The NASDAQ rebounded sharply
from last week's slump...

1103
01:12:46,048 --> 01:12:49,082
Hey, my stocks are up.

1104
01:12:49,152 --> 01:12:52,381
That doesn't make sense. Hey, smack him
on the ass with that thing, will ya?

1105
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:54,936
Yeah, do it. No, don't do it.
I'm kidding.

1106
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:57,343
- You really know this stuff.
- Yeah.

1107
01:12:57,408 --> 01:13:00,704
Yeah, I like it rough. But you
gotta speak up. I can't hear you!

1108
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,123
Janice? Baby?

1109
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:19,323
Janice, it's me, Darryl.
Come on, baby. Pick up.

1110
01:13:24,544 --> 01:13:28,319
No, I don't think the vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve
would do that in this case.

1111
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:30,937
Uh-huh.
And who are you to say that?

1112
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:33,561
The, um, vice chairman
of the Federal Reserve.

1113
01:13:33,632 --> 01:13:36,731
- Ouch.
- But the bottom dropped out
of the market...

1114
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,793
- In 1976 because of a hurricane
that destroyed the crops.
- All right!

1115
01:13:40,864 --> 01:13:43,679
In between manufacturers
of gross media parts is ignored,

1116
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:45,719
as is the chain
of events that goes...

1117
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:49,272
"l" equals delta...

1118
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:51,678
Dog, you gotta go, eh?

1119
01:13:51,745 --> 01:13:54,363
I can't go, man.
I still don't have this chart down.

1120
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:57,596
Dude, you've been studying
your ass off all night.

1121
01:13:57,664 --> 01:14:01,919
- Put some faith in fate. You're the man.
- All right.

1122
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:05,596
I think this Protocol 563
is finally leaving my system.

1123
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:11,770
Hey, dog, I just wanted to thank...

1124
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,077
- Forget it.
- I'll take care of the tip.

1125
01:14:14,144 --> 01:14:15,999
All right.

1126
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,909
Oh, no!

1127
01:14:30,976 --> 01:14:32,831
No!

1128
01:14:34,144 --> 01:14:35,999
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

1129
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:38,813
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1130
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,855
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hey.

1131
01:14:40,928 --> 01:14:42,783
- How you doing?
- Hey, listen.

1132
01:14:42,848 --> 01:14:45,466
I was wondering if you could show me
where the Smythe-Bates building is.

1133
01:14:45,536 --> 01:14:47,424
- You can't see?
- Mm-mm, no.

1134
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:51,285
- You visually in-com-paired?
- Impaired.

1135
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,499
Yeah, I can help you out, man.

1136
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:56,470
- Oh, thank you, man. Thank you, brother.
- Brothers gotta stick together.

1137
01:14:56,544 --> 01:14:59,741
- Oh, definitely. Thank you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah.

1138
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:01,663
- You know, I know a shortcut.
- Oh, really?

1139
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,583
- Yeah. This way.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1140
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:06,332
- Quick, hurry.
- Thank God I met someone like you.

1141
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,051
- No, thank God I met somebody like you.
- Huh?

1142
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:38,365
No, I don't have it.
Please, please...

1143
01:15:38,432 --> 01:15:41,498
Just leave me alone.
Go away! Stop it!

1144
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,637
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1145
01:15:50,816 --> 01:15:54,973
Excuse me, sir. Can you show me where
the suits are? The drawers? Something.

1146
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,461
- This guy is on break
right here, brother.
- Oh, how you doing?

1147
01:15:57,536 --> 01:16:00,503
- Maybe I can help you.
- I've got this interview
across the street in ten minutes.

1148
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:03,293
I just got robbed. That's why
I'm sitting in your store assed out.

1149
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,321
- Look! Literally!
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
This way. Follow me.

1150
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:10,142
Listen, my man.
I got $50 in my right sock.

1151
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,023
I need this suit. I will come back
tomorrow and pay you, I promise.

1152
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:16,317
- Okay. Young blind brother,
I'm gonna fix you up real good.
- My man.

1153
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:19,068
Smythe-Bates. May I help you?

1154
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:22,432
Excuse me.
Is this the 12th floor?

1155
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,463
- Yes. Sir, may I help you?
- Yes.

1156
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:27,391
Where's the men's room?

1157
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:32,317
What the...

1158
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:35,417
No! I'll kill him!

1159
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:38,238
Aw, shit!
Oh, what else can go wrong?

1160
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,339
No! No!

1161
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:47,994
No!

1162
01:16:48,064 --> 01:16:50,301
No!

1163
01:16:50,368 --> 01:16:52,921
The drug just has to pass
through your system.

1164
01:16:52,992 --> 01:16:54,934
Trust me,
you'll know when it's gone.

1165
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:56,918
Oh, no.

1166
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,004
Together.

1167
01:17:07,072 --> 01:17:10,204
Get... your shit together.

1168
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:15,164
I'm gonna pay you guys back.

1169
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:20,669
Can you believe me and the boys in
Leverage Buyout got into a water fight?

1170
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,997
No. They're ready
for you... now.

1171
01:17:24,064 --> 01:17:27,893
- What time is it?
- Twenty after.

1172
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:31,677
I made it. You're going to have
to excuse the suit.

1173
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:34,558
Come to find out, I'm allergic
to everything but polyester.

1174
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:37,885
My, uh, doctor prescribed
this suit for me.

1175
01:17:39,552 --> 01:17:41,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to welcome you...

1176
01:17:41,888 --> 01:17:44,060
here on this day
of final competition...

1177
01:17:44,128 --> 01:17:46,397
for the position of junior analyst.

1178
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:49,530
And we'll begin our questioning
with you, Mr. Thorpe.

1179
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,699
Now, in structuring a portfolio
for your client,

1180
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,102
what are the three
most important rules?

1181
01:17:55,168 --> 01:17:58,365
Well, first thing I'd do is talk to
my client about his long-term goals.

1182
01:17:58,432 --> 01:18:00,985
- Once those are explained to me...
- Goods and services...

1183
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,838
are exempt from the discounting
which classical theory demands.

1184
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:07,287
The effect of taxes defined
by the Laffer Curve cannot
be considered as valid...

1185
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,117
The leverage gained by buying on
the market will multiply your returns...

1186
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:14,778
For our primary analysis,
equity can't be considered in
the same tier as secured debt.

1187
01:18:14,848 --> 01:18:18,197
Small cap funds overpower
high cap funds over time...

1188
01:18:18,272 --> 01:18:21,055
If the poison pill doesn't work,
you got a proxy war that's
gonna depress your price.

1189
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,487
At this point, we would
excuse three of our contestants.

1190
01:18:23,552 --> 01:18:26,814
Fine job.
Show them our appreciation.

1191
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,727
Mr. Auseppe, why would the Federal
Reserve have resorted to this?

1192
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:33,273
I believe that would be in order to
maintain a constant rate of growth...

1193
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:37,621
while avoiding incurring
any excess inflation.

1194
01:18:37,696 --> 01:18:40,794
Thank you, Mr. Auseppe.
You may step down. And fine job.

1195
01:18:42,944 --> 01:18:45,082
Now, we are down
to our final two contestants:

1196
01:18:45,152 --> 01:18:47,519
- Mr. Scott Thorpe...
- You lost your bitches, pimp daddy?

1197
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,202
- And Mr. Darryl Witherspoon.
- What's up?

1198
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:52,443
Mr. Thorpe, if you were
to be given control...

1199
01:18:52,512 --> 01:18:55,163
of the Smythe-Bates
venture capital fund,

1200
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:57,501
where would you take it
over the next five years?

1201
01:18:57,568 --> 01:19:00,056
Well, I think start-up industries
in emerging markets...

1202
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:02,943
are the kind of low-risk,
high-gain strategy I would pursue.

1203
01:19:03,008 --> 01:19:06,139
Ah, so the rich get richer
off the sweat of the poor, right, Scott?

1204
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,063
Maybe you should pay a visit...

1205
01:19:08,128 --> 01:19:10,201
to one of those emerging markets
you're so eager to exploit.

1206
01:19:10,272 --> 01:19:12,792
I summered in Cancun.

1207
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:16,955
If that were me, I'd start
a community-based bank
and invest in areas...

1208
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,934
that these larger banks abandon.

1209
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:22,304
Abandon for good reason.
That's why the poor get poorer.

1210
01:19:22,368 --> 01:19:25,881
- Who taught you that? Your father?
- Where's your father tonight?

1211
01:19:25,952 --> 01:19:28,373
I'm about to kick your little ass.
That's where he's at.

1212
01:19:28,448 --> 01:19:30,782
Gentlemen, please.
Let's keep it civil.

1213
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:33,215
We've got two excellent answers.
Looks like we have a tie here.

1214
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,167
- Mm-hmm.
- Professor Engel?

1215
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:38,079
All right, gentlemen.
This last question is not a simple one,

1216
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:41,439
so I suggest that you choose
your answers very carefully.

1217
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:46,654
Now, looking at this chart, what should
the Federal Reserve choose to do?

1218
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,233
If I were, say,
vice chairman of the Federal Reserve,

1219
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:52,278
I'd raise rates.

1220
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:54,327
Excellent.

1221
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,571
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

1222
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,488
Hmm? "Why"?

1223
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:04,989
Because...That's a good question.

1224
01:20:05,056 --> 01:20:07,096
l...

1225
01:20:07,168 --> 01:20:10,463
Uh, I have to say that I...

1226
01:20:10,528 --> 01:20:12,415
don't know the answer.

1227
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,138
Mr. Witherspoon?
Mr. Witherspoon?

1228
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:21,695
Yo!

1229
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,411
Oh. Why raise the rates?

1230
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,604
Well... because of this chart
reflecting Simon's theory.

1231
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,519
John Simon, born in 1908
in Westbridge, Indiana,

1232
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:34,748
predicts the future of inflation
with the formula:

1233
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:38,132
I = delta MP
over the square of T.

1234
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,793
Thus, requiring
federal correction...

1235
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:45,435
as evidenced by the board
in 1958, '67 and 1984.

1236
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:58,072
Darryl, you've got the job.

1237
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:03,198
Wow!

1238
01:21:03,264 --> 01:21:05,533
Thank you.

1239
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,731
Ebonically speaking,
I know my shit.

1240
01:21:10,752 --> 01:21:13,240
Thank you!

1241
01:21:25,983 --> 01:21:30,107
Wait. Hold up, people, please.
I have something to say.

1242
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:34,517
I cheated.

1243
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:40,216
No, not today. I studied very hard
for this test today.

1244
01:21:41,824 --> 01:21:44,922
But I had an extra edge
in becoming a finalist.

1245
01:21:44,992 --> 01:21:48,253
Not my athletic talent
and not money.

1246
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:52,278
And it wasn't my daddy.

1247
01:21:52,352 --> 01:21:54,457
- It was an experimental drug.
- Oh!

1248
01:21:54,528 --> 01:21:57,528
But it wasn't heroin!

1249
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,397
- He's not on the horse.
- Tim, shut up.

1250
01:22:01,472 --> 01:22:04,025
Sorry, but he's not using.

1251
01:22:05,824 --> 01:22:08,606
It's all right.

1252
01:22:10,336 --> 01:22:12,441
Mr. Tyson, Mr. Bellweather,

1253
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:14,967
I'm sorry.

1254
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,855
I was just willing to do anything
to become a Smythe-Bates man,

1255
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,571
even the wrong thing.

1256
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,956
I want you to know
I do deserve the job,

1257
01:22:24,032 --> 01:22:27,327
even though I
didn't earn it honestly.

1258
01:22:29,184 --> 01:22:33,439
And that's the whole story.
Look, I'm sorry if I let you guys down.

1259
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:36,733
You can't cut me off!
I'm your son! You love me!

1260
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,134
Remember that time
you almost said it?

1261
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,974
Well, folks, the board
has come to a decision.

1262
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:46,901
There will be no junior analyst position
awarded this year.

1263
01:22:46,976 --> 01:22:50,238
But you still proved yourself
the most impressive candidate.

1264
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,606
Come on, kids.

1265
01:22:52,672 --> 01:22:56,284
Darryl, do you think that I was
a junior analyst right out of Stratford?

1266
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:58,359
Yeah.

1267
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,727
- Darryl, Daddy started in the mail room.
- Get outta here!

1268
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:05,239
I tried to be the junior analyst, but...
I didn't come from money.

1269
01:23:05,312 --> 01:23:08,127
I didn't play sports, so...
Sound familiar?

1270
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:11,192
So what are you saying? That you wasn't
a Smythe-Bates man either?

1271
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:13,981
But I am, because I know
my job and I work hard.

1272
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,863
Do you know who
that reminds me of?

1273
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:20,508
- Me.
- That's right.

1274
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:23,478
You are a Smythe-Bates man too,

1275
01:23:23,552 --> 01:23:26,235
so you're going to have
a second chance.

1276
01:23:26,304 --> 01:23:29,173
At the point of graduation,
you'll be given a job in the mail room.

1277
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:31,582
Doesn't sound like much,
but if you work hard,

1278
01:23:31,647 --> 01:23:33,982
in a year you'll make
a fine junior analyst.

1279
01:23:35,904 --> 01:23:38,238
Maybe a great son-in-law too?

1280
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:40,159
Don't push it.

1281
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,980
- Heh-heh!
- Cool.

1282
01:23:53,056 --> 01:23:56,984
Everybody, a toast to my baby Darryl.

1283
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,904
Thank you for everything
that you've done for us.

1284
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,269
And good luck tomorrow...

1285
01:24:02,336 --> 01:24:05,500
on your first day as a junior analyst
at Smythe-Bates.

1286
01:24:05,568 --> 01:24:07,477
Darius!

1287
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:11,513
Touch that champagne bottle
one more time, I'm gonna use
your little ass as a cork!

1288
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,756
Tim, let me take the camera so I can
shoot you and your new girlfriend.

1289
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:19,678
Go stand over there.

1290
01:24:19,743 --> 01:24:22,558
I just wanna make a toast, eh?

1291
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:25,885
Uh... Come here, honey.

1292
01:24:25,952 --> 01:24:28,254
- I hate those things too, but...
- Get in there, Lorraine.

1293
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,207
Ahsalam, Mrs. W.

1294
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:32,214
To... To Darryl.

1295
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:35,583
To your continued success
on Wall Street, eh?

1296
01:24:35,648 --> 01:24:38,463
Thank you.

1297
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,375
Ma, are you gonna take me up
on my offer?

1298
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,952
Darryl, I've lived here all my life.
Besides, the place looks so nice now.

1299
01:24:45,023 --> 01:24:47,031
But it's such a bad neighborhood.

1300
01:24:47,104 --> 01:24:51,326
Why don't you let me move you
over to the East Side,
to a deluxe apartment, hmm?

1301
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:54,740
- Well, we're movin' on up
- Movin' on up

1302
01:24:54,815 --> 01:24:57,663
- To the East Side
- Movin' on up

1303
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:02,005
To a deluxe apartment in the sky

1304
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,179
- Movin' on up
- Movin' on up

1305
01:25:05,248 --> 01:25:07,669
- To the East Side
- Movin' on up

1306
01:25:07,743 --> 01:25:11,289
We've finally got
a piece of the pie

1307
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:15,573
Fish don't fry in the kitchen

1308
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,135
Beans don't burn on the grill

1309
01:25:18,207 --> 01:25:20,574
Took a whole lotta tryin'

1310
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,127
Just to get up that hill

1311
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,589
Now we're up in the big leagues

1312
01:25:25,664 --> 01:25:28,828
- Gettin' our turn at bat
- Good morning, Mr. Witherspoon.
How are ya?

1313
01:25:28,896 --> 01:25:32,092
It's you and me, baby
There ain't nothin' wrong with that

1314
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,014
- We're movin' on up
- Movin' on up

1315
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:36,796
- Hi. How are you?
- Fine.

1316
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:42,654
We be movin' on up

1317
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,200
- La la la-la-la la la
- To the East Side

1318
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:49,981
- La la la-la-la la la
- Trying to do business
is cramping my style

1319
01:25:50,047 --> 01:25:55,099
- We be movin' on up to the East Side
- La la la-la-la la la

1320
01:25:55,168 --> 01:25:59,772
- And it looks like we're
gonna get some of the pie
- La la la-la-la

1321
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:02,108
Always aim at the right gate
Make you bite eight

1322
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:04,347
Run the jugs on the lightweight
Monopolize green

1323
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:06,652
Front lawn, home of thieves
Baby, burners get squeezed

1324
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,988
Move up, move in
Apartment 22-N

1325
01:26:09,056 --> 01:26:11,543
Forty-four's for the man
Trip's put into it

1326
01:26:11,615 --> 01:26:13,786
Shady broad's off to a friend
Who hate us

1327
01:26:13,855 --> 01:26:15,961
Little Kevin double jammed
On the lam now in Vegas

1328
01:26:16,032 --> 01:26:18,333
Playin' Biggie, mo' money, mo' jiggy
Pick me

1329
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:20,439
The mo' stones the mo' iffy
Top ten

1330
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:23,228
Smokin' pain in the range
with my nigga Sharkaine
Rose fair

1331
01:26:23,295 --> 01:26:25,150
People on the street
Broken nose, red

1332
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:27,452
All of us we be tough
If you ain't eatin' this up

1333
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,008
Like we might fold
Several niggas runnin'
like it's white gold

1334
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,705
Dyin' hope, denying
it ain't the right gold

1335
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:34,109
- Where you from
- Brooklyn, baby Brooklyn, baby

1336
01:26:34,176 --> 01:26:36,347
El Capitan
Call me John if you call, baby

1337
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:40,693
- Movin' on up
- Looks like you'll be moving up

1338
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:44,957
- Hey, hey
- La la la-la-la la la

1339
01:26:45,023 --> 01:26:49,879
- We be movin' on up
- Looks like you'll be moving up

1340
01:26:49,952 --> 01:26:51,675
Hey, hey

1341
01:26:51,743 --> 01:26:55,289
- And it looks like you're
gonna get some of the pie
- La la la-la-la

1342
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,531
You ain't fresh
Uh-uh, naw, baby

1343
01:26:57,599 --> 01:26:59,868
Everybody wanna be
a superstar, baby

1344
01:26:59,935 --> 01:27:02,652
I didn't get the dough to act
like I'm better than you

1345
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,629
I just got things to do

1346
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,678
Ooh-la-la, oui, oui
Freak freak

1347
01:27:06,751 --> 01:27:08,988
You say you want trim
You say you want chic

1348
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,063
And honey dips rubbin' on
your money clip

1349
01:27:11,135 --> 01:27:13,655
Hangin' at your place
Boardwalk and Park Place

1350
01:27:13,727 --> 01:27:15,735
Acting all cool
Look at you higher livin'

1351
01:27:15,808 --> 01:27:18,263
Meanwhile, your style's
played out like racism

1352
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:20,507
Me, I'm fresh out of love
It's quite tragic

1353
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,878
When all they wanna do
is inspect my gadget

1354
01:27:22,944 --> 01:27:25,148
And change a Superman
to Clark Kent

1355
01:27:25,216 --> 01:27:27,223
All for the sake
of fake amusement

1356
01:27:27,296 --> 01:27:30,711
She said
What do you consider fun

1357
01:27:30,783 --> 01:27:32,922
- Consider yourself done
- Movin' on up

1358
01:27:32,992 --> 01:27:35,926
- Looks like you'll be movin' up
- To the East Side

1359
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:38,006
- Hey, hey
- Come on, baby

1360
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:40,600
- La la la-la-la la la
- Trying to do business
is cramping my style

1361
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:45,494
- Oh, hey
- Looks like you'll be movin' up

1362
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:48,153
- Baby, looks like we
gonna get some grief
- La la la-la-la

1363
01:27:48,223 --> 01:27:50,678
Hey, said I

1364
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:53,882
Been trying this rocky road
for so long

1365
01:27:53,951 --> 01:27:55,806
Still I had to hold on

1366
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:58,457
I'm trying to make that dough
to move on

1367
01:27:58,527 --> 01:28:00,382
Papa told me
Stay strong

1368
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:03,447
The time has come
to make that change

1369
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,059
Whoa, here comes the sun
There goes the rain

1370
01:28:08,127 --> 01:28:12,634
Hey, hey
Take that first step to tomorrow

1371
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:17,243
Hey, hey
Life may bring you joy or sorrow

1372
01:28:17,312 --> 01:28:21,884
Whoa, now I'm dotting my I's
and crossing my T's

1373
01:28:21,952 --> 01:28:25,945
Lord, yeah, I'm movin' up
and takin' care of my biz

1374
01:28:26,015 --> 01:28:27,990
Whoa-oh

1375
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:30,966
- Looks like you'll be movin' up
- To the East Side

1376
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:35,415
La la la-la-la la la

1377
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:37,375
Whoa, oh, yeah

1378
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,629
- Hey, hey, hey
- Looks like you'll be movin' up

1379
01:28:41,695 --> 01:28:43,899
La la la-la-la

1380
01:28:46,304 --> 01:28:50,843
- Looks like you'll be movin' up
- Hey, hey

1381
01:28:50,912 --> 01:28:54,228
La la la-la-la la la

1382
01:28:54,303 --> 01:28:55,732
We be movin' on up

1383
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,710
- Looks like you'll be movin' up
- To the East Side

1384
01:28:58,784 --> 01:29:04,185
- Hey, hey
- La la la-la-la

1385
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,460
You ain't fresh
Uh-uh, naw, baby

1386
01:29:06,528 --> 01:29:08,764
Everybody wanna be
a superstar, baby

1387
01:29:08,831 --> 01:29:11,482
I didn't get the dough
to act like I'm better than you

1388
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:13,439
I just got things to do

1389
01:29:13,503 --> 01:29:15,608
Ooh-la-la, oui, oui
Freak freak

1390
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,883
You say you want trim
You say you want chic

1391
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:19,958
And honey dips rubbin' on
your money clip

1392
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:22,551
Hangin' at your place
Boardwalk and Park Place

1393
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,598
Acting all cool
Look at you higher livin'

1394
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:27,126
Meanwhile, your style's
played out like racism
