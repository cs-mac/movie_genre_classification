1
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,745
One of my favourite presentations.

2
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,962
Will you excuse me one second?

3
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,939
...floating oil, submerged oil...

4
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,196
...contaminated soils...

5
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,263
...shifting submerged oil...

6
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,389
...and recovery of
additional environments.

7
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,112
<i>Just the physical damage alone.</i>

8
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,755
<i>A pregnancy is brutal on your body.</i>

9
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,991
<i>There's also a risk
from the hormonal changes:</i>

10
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,769
<i>Mood disorders, depression.</i>

11
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,937
<i>Are you sure you still
wanna be a surrogate?</i>

12
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,528
<i>Yes. I am.</i>

13
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:52,065
<i>If more than two embryos take,
the couple may choose to abort some.</i>

14
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,307
<i>Well, that's their choice.</i>

15
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:57,116
Now, he's gonna keep pushing her here.
It's deliberate.

16
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:00,385
The girls always think they've made
their decision to be a surrogate...

17
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:03,627
...but a lot of them change their mind
after about an hour with Carl.

18
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,294
Hey, John.

19
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,316
It's fine, I'm here.

21
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,103
I'm here.

22
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,005
- So we found someone?
- Yeah...

23
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,897
...possibly. Anna Walsh.

24
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,371
She's 21. She lives here in the city,
she's a waitress.

25
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:24,265
And she is brand-new.
Just walked in today.

26
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,752
<i>- What would your choice be?
- If the children were mine?</i>

27
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,186
<i>Oh, come on, Anna.</i>

28
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,851
<i>Aren't they? In a way?</i>

29
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,237
<i>Life can take an unexpected turn.</i>

30
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:35,781
<i>You could lose the baby.</i>

31
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>If life worked out the way it was
supposed to, I wouldn't be here.</i>

32
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,417
<i>Anna, why are you really doing this?</i>

33
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:47,441
<i>Because I have the opportunity
to help someone who can't have a child.</i>

34
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,516
Look at her eyes.

35
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,561
She means it.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,076
I don't like your interview guy.
He is a bully.

37
00:02:57,116 --> 00:03:00,082
But I do like her.

38
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:02,859
I like her.

39
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,145
Okay.

40
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,114
If we submit...

41
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,793
Martin.

42
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,526
- Todd.
- Is Grafton gonna settle?

43
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,597
Oh, they're gonna wish they did.

44
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,889
I want you to bring Todd up to speed.

45
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,480
If we go to court on this,
it'll be the firm sticking its neck out.

46
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:33,201
Now, this is still your baby,
but I want a second pair of eyes.

47
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,984
Right. Of course.

48
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:37,513
No problem.

49
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,021
Hey, babe.

50
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,781
Cooper was just in here.

51
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:49,037
He's putting Todd frigging Decker
on my case.

52
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:52,155
- I'm with her.
<i>- You're with who?</i>

53
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,949
Anna.

54
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,542
It took forever to fill out the paperwork,
and I was starved...

55
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:02,203
...so I dropped into that little diner
where she works and she was here...

56
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,313
<i>...waiting for her fiancé to pick her up.</i>

57
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,389
She's great.

58
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,471
I know, I know, I know.

59
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,648
There are a million things
that can go wrong...

60
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,373
...and we still have to do
the health checks and just everything.

61
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,137
Exactly. It's...

62
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,434
I just don't want us to spend
another two years looking...

63
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,532
...and maybe missing,
and the whole time, she was the one.

64
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,464
She's so shy.

65
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,185
But there's something else there, like...

66
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,244
...I know she can take care of herself.

67
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:44,145
I invited her and her fiancé Michael
over for dinner tomorrow night.

68
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,314
- Oh, babe.
- Is it okay?

69
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,639
Well, I'll tell you,
when you move, you move.

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,160
I'm sorry, but I just wanna do it right.

71
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,300
I really want them to like us.

72
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:31,319
I'm sorry if I overdid this.
We could've just gone out.

73
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,343
No, are you kidding?

74
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,395
This... This is real nice.

75
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:38,202
It's what I do, actually. I'm a chef.

76
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,195
I know it's just a meal...

77
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,402
...but I meant it to show you both
how committed we are.

78
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,975
The baby is your business.

79
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,160
- One hundred percent.
- But you will be carrying it.

80
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,090
In the service, I know a lot of guys
who've done this before.

81
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,764
When you're deployed, it just makes sense.

82
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,557
When I'm gone, you two, you know,
you come see her whenever you want.

83
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,888
I understand you'll be using the money
to buy a business.

84
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,895
Oh, from my uncle.
Residential and commercial roofing.

85
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,579
He had quite the run here after Katrina.

86
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,547
Owning the company means you get
a piece of everybody's take-home.

87
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,704
Plus markup, overhead.

88
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,339
Mike's always been real smart about money.

89
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,762
With my deployment bonus...

90
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:27,432
...we'll be able to put together
almost $40,000.

91
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,151
And that's enough to buy the whole thing.

92
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:35,127
Anna, I'm sure there are probably
some questions that you have for us?

93
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,025
Can I smoke somewhere?

94
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,055
Nice home you got here.

95
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,890
These renovations must have
cost you a pretty penny.

96
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,825
Well, the house was part of Laura's
inheritance from her grandmother.

97
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,458
The renovations, they came later.

98
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,065
Must be nice to lay out that kind of cash.

99
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,980
Working by windows, you see a lot
of things that nobody else would see.

100
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,503
Weird shit, you know?

101
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,398
Housewives, whatever.

102
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,890
Act like they're alone...

103
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,701
...but they know we're there.

104
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,248
Right.

105
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,723
Benefit of the job, right?

106
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:38,481
That, there, isn't the right material.

107
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,795
That gutter's leaking at the splice.

108
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,524
Gonna mess up that window.

109
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,894
Yeah?

110
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:51,867
Look, if we do this...

111
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,722
...we just wanna make sure that
you and Anna are comfortable with it.

112
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,835
We are. Of course.

113
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,939
See, it's just that we're down
to our last viable embryo, right?

114
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,721
And we wanna make sure that you know
how serious our intentions are.

115
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,871
I get it.

116
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,574
Right?

117
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,341
One hundred percent.

118
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,133
We tried for a long time to get pregnant.

119
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:20,746
I had three miscarriages.

120
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,566
It really put the two of us through hell.

121
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,833
You actually start to hate...

122
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,473
...your own body.

123
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,716
I've never had anything...

124
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,907
...that anybody wanted before.

125
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,196
Except for the obvious.

126
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,189
I've never been able
to give anybody anything.

127
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,050
Okay, just spill it, Taylor,
you didn't like them.

128
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,189
Okay, him. I mean, we go outside, right?

129
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,522
And he's talking to me about...

130
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,302
...looking at housewives
undressing through windows.

131
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,932
Maybe that's his way of bonding.

132
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,555
I don't know, babe.
I mean, we can keep looking.

133
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,075
I think doing something like this
is really important to her.

134
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,857
Yeah, I know, it's kind of cute.
I mean, you see...

135
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,178
...the way she left a price tag
on the dress?

136
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,864
She's taking it back tomorrow.

137
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,078
She wanted to wear something nice
to impress us.

138
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,476
I did that on our first date.

139
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,421
Oh, yeah, I remember that dress.

140
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,916
Matter of fact, I remember undoing it,
like this.

141
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,278
Did I let you?

142
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,655
On the first date?

143
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,209
I was bad.

144
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,894
You were so bad
that you were, oh, so good.

145
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,062
John.

146
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,906
I want to.

147
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:09,245
Having them here...

148
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:12,225
...it just brings it all back.

149
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:16,450
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

150
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,676
It's okay. It's okay, babe.

151
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:19,940
It's all right.

152
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,678
We're gonna do this, aren't we?

153
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,084
She's the one.

154
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,719
Ready?

155
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,967
All right, hold still.

156
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,985
It's gonna feel like a little stick.

157
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,876
All right. Don't move.

158
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:38,376
I'm placing the embryo. Don't move.

159
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,278
You're doing good.

160
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,235
And there.

161
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,416
All right. Here we go.

162
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,306
- I'll take that.
- Thank you.

163
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,178
All right, we're done. You did great.

164
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,360
Thank you.

165
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,613
Good job.

166
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:16,125
People always talk about
how they know the moment...

167
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,255
...when their child was conceived.

168
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,506
A wedding night or a special date.

169
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,089
But I will know for sure...

170
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,409
...it was this moment.

171
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,793
The baby could be starting
its life right now.

172
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,669
It's strange.

173
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,948
It just keeps hitting me
how strange it is.

174
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,478
I mean, it's against the law
to pay someone to have sex...

175
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,077
...but you can pay a woman to get
pregnant with your child?

176
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,353
- Imagine how it is for the boyfriend.
- She said she loves him.

177
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,350
She doesn't hesitate,
doesn't question it...

178
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,609
...she just loves him.

179
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,719
She asked if it was the same with us.

180
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,176
But it wasn't, was it?

181
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,086
We worked hard.

182
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,796
And we hung in there.

183
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,394
But it was worth it.

184
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,404
Yeah, it was.

185
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,462
When I was working on this room...

186
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,150
...sometimes I would just...

187
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,220
...close my eyes
and imagine you in here...

188
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,577
...playing with our baby.

189
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,141
It's gonna work this time.

190
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,673
Hey.

191
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,027
We're gonna have a family.

192
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:25,534
We need to do more research
on that section of pollution, 11.62.

193
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,768
Once we have that going on...

194
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,443
- You guys go ahead. I gotta take this.
- All right, John.

195
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,732
- Hey, babe. Just got out of court.
<i>- John.</i>

196
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,458
<i>John, you're gonna be a father.</i>

197
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,625
What?

198
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,782
Anna's here and...

199
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,258
She took a home test.
She took three of them...

200
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,925
<i>...and all three of them were positive.</i>

201
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,058
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be a father.

202
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,783
Anna's sitting here watching me
bawl my eyes out.

203
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,391
- Babe.
- Yeah.

204
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,852
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, Daddy.

205
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,820
- I want her to go to Yale.
- No, no. He is gonna go to LSU.

206
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,358
- Law review.
- First female president.

207
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,346
Okay.

208
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,337
Anna's in the shower. She's gonna
come say hi when she's done.

209
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:17,206
- Okay. You guys going to yoga together?
- Yep.

210
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,129
I didn't know how I'd feel
about somebody else's body...

211
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,314
...going through everything
but I really like this girl.

212
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,473
I really like you.

213
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,913
- I really like you.
- I really love you.

214
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,911
I didn't know he was here.

215
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,326
- He came home early.
- No, Anna, this is... Oh, it's...

216
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,015
This is great news.

217
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,953
It's great news.

218
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,679
This is good work, John.

219
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,882
If this is right, they got nowhere to run.

220
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,144
Well, unless they draw
Judge Steve Paulson.

221
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,262
He doesn't believe in
corporate negligence.

222
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,080
Invite him to your charity event
next month.

223
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,905
The man loves cocktail shrimp
and the Saints.

224
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,680
Done.

225
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,732
Will you guys just excuse me for a minute?

226
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,376
She's here for you?

227
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,020
She's a relative.

228
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,402
I called Laura.

229
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,283
She told me to come. I'm sorry.

230
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,541
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:09,132
I had a doctor's appointment.
Mike didn't pick me up.

232
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,959
Okay, let's go.

233
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,955
Come on, honey.

234
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,280
I grew up in a neighbourhood
just like this.

235
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,703
My father, he worked so hard,
he didn't have that many days off...

236
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,291
...but when he did...

237
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,744
...he used to pick me up from school.

238
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,125
God, I can't wait to do that.

239
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,845
You're welcome, John.

240
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,131
- So you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks for the ride.

241
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,424
Quiet. Quiet!

242
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,216
Guess you forgot to pick her up.

243
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,639
Everything good?

244
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,534
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,136
I'm great.

246
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,254
How's this one working out?

247
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,350
Anything you need me to talk to her about?

248
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,166
Everything's fine.

249
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,506
Go in the house right now.

250
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,011
Now.

251
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,055
Let's go.

252
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,696
It's been a long day, cat.

253
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,859
Move.

254
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,889
Mess with me?

255
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,751
That's what I'm talking about.

256
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,997
What's troubling that
pretty little head of yours?

257
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,407
Anna said she'd call me, and she hasn't.

258
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,077
She's young. She probably just forgot.

259
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,800
Told you.

260
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,744
Hello?

261
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,290
What?

262
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,374
- You must be John Taylor?
- Yes.

263
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,576
Right over here.

264
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,023
I'm fine.

265
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,766
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,372
- The baby's okay?
- Baby's fine. I'm sure.

267
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,262
The perpetrator,
Mr. Mitchell, he'll be taken in...

268
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,363
...and charged with domestic battery.
He acknowledged striking Miss Walsh.

269
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,707
- You're not gonna let him out, are you?
- He makes bail, we can't hold him.

270
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,014
- But he'll hurt me.
- He tries to harm you...

271
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,483
...you call us, we'll arrest him again.

272
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,191
You may wanna try to find
another place to stay.

273
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,428
I don't have another place to stay.

274
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,784
Yes, you do.

275
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,973
He hurt my face.

276
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,823
I am so sorry.

277
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,331
- It's okay.
- I am so sorry.

278
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,557
- No, it's okay.
- Anna!

279
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,820
- Anna!
- Hey.

280
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,589
- Anna!
- Let's go!

281
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,082
- Anna!
- Don't move!

282
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,954
- Hey, hey!
- Get down. Get down!

283
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,154
I got him. All right. Get him in the car.

284
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,969
- Come on. Come on! Get in the car!
- Anna.

285
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,923
Oh, my God.

286
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,843
You're okay, all right?
We're gonna take care of you.

287
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,401
You're gonna be fine.
Let's get you inside.

288
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,123
Hey, John.

289
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,602
How the hell are you?

290
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,195
I need you to listen to me, Mike.

291
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,560
I need you to really understand
what I'm about to say.

292
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,700
This is a restraining order.

293
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,473
It's already happened.

294
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:03,152
This is a case for domestic abuse...

295
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,347
...battery and child endangerment.

296
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,840
This is a letter to the DA...

297
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,558
...who's a friend of mine...

298
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,905
...recommending no less
than seven criminal counts.

299
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,785
These haven't been filed yet.

300
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,155
So, what's gonna happen now is this:

301
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,697
You're gonna stay away from Anna.

302
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,433
We're never gonna see you again.
She's never gonna see you again.

303
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,901
In 10 days, you're gonna be shipped off
to the Middle East.

304
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,176
And when you return,
your money's gonna be waiting for you.

305
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,551
But if you ever...

306
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,997
...come near Anna again...

307
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,454
...I'm gonna bust your head open.

308
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,959
Then I'm gonna make sure
your punk ass is sent somewhere...

309
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,421
...that's gonna make the Middle East
look like Club Med.

310
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,233
Have I made myself clear?

311
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,065
Oh, yeah.

312
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,099
- Crystal.
- Good.

313
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,371
Opening 3.

314
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,809
Have a nice life.

315
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,170
Counsellor.

316
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,109
Thanks for the visit.

317
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,466
How is she?

318
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,948
She's sleeping in the guest house.

319
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:57,475
- Where'd you go?
- I just went to...

320
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,330
...make sure Mike wouldn't be
a problem anymore.

321
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,536
I was watching her sleep.

322
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,325
She looks so pretty.

323
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,559
John, it's okay. You can admit it.
She's beautiful.

324
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,719
Yeah, well, I don't know.

325
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,976
I guess if you're the type of guy...

326
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,167
...who likes...

327
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,069
...soft, young...

328
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,974
...pert breasts.

329
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,751
An ass that you can bounce
a quarter off of.

330
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,708
But I hadn't really noticed,
I have to tell you.

331
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,248
Oh, sometimes I forget
how good of a liar you are.

332
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,682
I love you.

333
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,963
I love you so much.

334
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,464
You know that, right?

335
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:28,203
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

336
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,777
- Good morning, hon.
- Good morning.

337
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,211
Thank you.

338
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:43,350
Anna, we'd like you to stay here
with us in our guest house.

339
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,437
We'd like you to take time off of work.

340
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,086
We'll pay you whatever you were making.

341
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:51,773
We'll get you a car so you don't feel
trapped. Come and go as you please.

342
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,167
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

343
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,574
We talked about it.
We feel more comfortable...

344
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,940
- ...knowing you're here most of the time.
- And knowing that you're safe.

345
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,165
It's just... I think Mike...

346
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,066
Anna, Mike hurt you.

347
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,261
And he's not gonna be around anymore.

348
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,507
Not for a very long time.

349
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,427
Now, you are doing
this incredible thing for us.

350
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,761
It's the least we can do.

351
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,745
Let us do something nice for you, okay?

352
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,062
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,015
Thank you.

354
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:02,075
Well, she is now officially
better than me in yoga.

355
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,558
Well, she's 10 weeks pregnant.
Give it another five weeks...

356
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,937
...you'll be able to take her down.

357
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,953
Because yoga's all about who wins, right?

358
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,780
She says it's got her body going crazy.

359
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,711
For sex, for men.

360
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,086
I guess it's the hormones.

361
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,844
Anything from the boyfriend?

362
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,794
No. Nothing.

363
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:27,481
He just shipped out
without even contacting her.

364
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,294
I'm glad he's gone.

365
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,137
- Ready for the associate's dinner?
- All set.

366
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,900
Laura, sweetie, come on, let's go.

367
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,663
I'm coming!

368
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,136
Sometime tonight, sweetheart.

369
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,516
Oh, my God.

370
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,592
You look like a movie star.

371
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,458
You like?

372
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,921
I love that dress.

373
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,177
You look absolutely stunning.

374
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:07,887
Can I take your picture?

375
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,278
All right.

376
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,072
Listen, you have both of our cell numbers.

377
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,721
And we'll be home by midnight.

378
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,690
Okay, 1.

379
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,241
I'll get the car.

380
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,259
So beautiful.

381
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,462
It's amazing the way he is with you.

382
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,084
You are so lucky.

383
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,694
Thank you. Thank you, Anna.

384
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,039
And you have a good night.

385
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,260
- You too. Have fun.
- All right. We will.

386
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,178
<i>"Today...</i>

387
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,763
...I am happy.

388
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:50,419
I am in control of my life.

389
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:55,061
I will experience the joy of pure love."

390
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,070
Sorry.

391
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,518
I was watching TV.

392
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,813
- I guess I fell asleep.
- No problem.

393
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,592
I fall asleep there all the time.

394
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,627
I'd like a cup of coffee.

395
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,444
Doctor says I'm allowed one cup a day.

396
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,559
Okay.

397
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:34,248
- One cup.
- Thank you.

398
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,906
- God, it's so old.
- Miss Havisham.

399
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:42,134
She's not old, she's ancient.

400
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,054
I was never really a cat person,
but Laura loves her.

401
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:49,346
All these years, she treated that cat
just like she was her baby.

402
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,209
But when the real baby comes...

403
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,990
...we'll have to see how old
Miss Havisham reacts then, huh?

404
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,103
I told Laura she's lucky to have you.

405
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:05,088
A husband who really loves his wife.

406
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,322
Well, I like to think
that I'm the lucky one.

407
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,832
I knew you would say something like that.

408
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,292
Do you wanna feel?

409
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,002
Here. Give me your hand.

410
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,606
I'll show you what it feels like.

411
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,304
Wait, I shouldn't say "it."

412
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,201
It's not an it.

413
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,511
He's your baby boy.

414
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:31,823
You think it's a boy?

415
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,006
I know it's a boy.

416
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:35,186
I can feel him.

417
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,620
He isn't even an inch long yet.

418
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:47,454
But you can feel where
my tummy's starting to change.

419
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,044
Feel that?

420
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,982
How it's harder?

421
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,285
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can feel it.

422
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,539
He's growing.

423
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,593
Changing every day.

424
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,949
Can I admit something to you?

425
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:17,010
It's a little weird that
I'm pregnant with your baby.

426
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,343
That you're inside of me...

427
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,215
...in that way.

428
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,380
Yeah, yeah, that is strange, isn't it?

429
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,164
Yeah.

430
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,189
But we're grateful for that.

431
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,819
Because without you,
we couldn't do any of this.

432
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,902
I like it.

433
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,651
Yep.

434
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,175
Hey, listen, next week we're
having our annual charity event...

435
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,856
...here at the house. You should join us.

436
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,133
- What's it for?
- We like to raise money...

437
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,602
...for the Boys and Girls Club of America.

438
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,342
You're amazing. Yes, I will come.

439
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,652
What's so important?

440
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,658
Good to see you too.

441
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,652
I missed you, baby.

442
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,344
I'm so glad you miss me.

443
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,226
You look nice.

444
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:38,741
I mean, living up there in that beautiful
big house, that must be nice.

445
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:42,221
Did you know that you have
their only embryo?

446
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:46,446
- It's a baby now.
- And they don't have any more.

447
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,767
And in the eyes of the law...

448
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,655
...since it's inside of you,
it belongs to us.

449
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:58,094
We can decide to keep it for ourselves
anytime we want.

450
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:01,399
- But I... I thought...
- Don't think.

451
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,955
It's not your thing, baby.

452
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,291
I'm the brains on this.

453
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,012
You're just the uterus.

454
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,469
So here's what you're gonna do.

455
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:22,094
Every single month, you're gonna say...

456
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,804
...that you're changing your mind,
and you're keeping it.

457
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,673
And they'll pay.

458
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,023
Maybe four grand, maybe more.

459
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,885
Mike.

460
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,435
They've been really good to me.

461
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:40,479
John really wants to be a father.

462
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,693
Does he?

463
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,745
Does he really?

464
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,648
You're into him.

465
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:26,297
What do you think is gonna happen, Anna?

466
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:33,387
You'll live happily ever after
with him in that big house?

467
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,675
He doesn't care about you.

468
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,818
You are like a cow to him.

469
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:47,720
I'll do it. I'll do it, Mike. I'll do it.

470
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,180
I know you will.

471
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,563
I'll do it. I'll tell them.

472
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:01,339
I'll do it for you, baby.

473
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,216
Anything you want.

474
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,824
It's from the firm. And tell Laura
she absolutely tops herself...

475
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,449
- ...every time you guys do this.
- I'll do that. Thanks.

476
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,675
Nobody knows this yet,
but Grafton Industries...

477
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:34,649
...is unofficially
floating settlement offers.

478
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,498
- You're not gonna settle with them?
- You kidding me?

479
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:40,201
All this time, you've been telling me
we had them by the balls.

480
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,222
I just wasn't sure.

481
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,760
But now I am.

482
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,382
This is gonna lock up partner
for you, John.

483
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,056
You take them to trial.

484
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,601
Gut them like a fish.

485
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,786
I'll do that.

486
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,540
Look, I was talking to Anna earlier.

487
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,022
I didn't realise she was
your second cousin, man.

488
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,050
- She is amazing.
- Todd, she's 21.

489
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,800
My calculation, that's...

490
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,064
That's legal plus three, right?

491
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:17,877
I'm just checking with you. You wouldn't
mind if I asked her out, would you?

492
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,544
No. You can ask her out.

493
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,184
Normally, this is the part
of the evening...

494
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,009
...where John asks all of you
to reach for your chequebooks.

495
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:33,202
And I'm sure he'll manage
to get that in still...

496
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,578
...but first, I wanted everyone to know...

497
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:40,441
...how important the Boys and Girls
Clubs of America is to us.

498
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,757
Especially to my husband.

499
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,164
John loves children, and they love him.

500
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,338
Thank you, John.

501
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,685
I'd also like...

502
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,817
I'd also like to thank all of you here...

503
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,801
...for coming tonight and...

504
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

505
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,311
Thank you.

506
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,731
Now you can all take out your chequebooks.

507
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,118
Is that the dress you gave her?

508
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,153
No. It's not.

509
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,290
You want me to go talk to her?

510
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:25,148
No, I will.

511
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,743
Excuse me, gentlemen.

512
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,436
- Anna.
- What's the matter?

513
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,987
That's not the dress I gave you.

514
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,598
God, I'm so sorry.

515
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,417
It's just, the one that
you gave me didn't really fit.

516
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:48,506
I was gonna ask you,
but you were so busy with the party.

517
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,827
I can... I can go change...

518
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,275
- ...right now.
- No, it's fine.

519
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,982
You look great.

520
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,453
Thank you for staying late.
I appreciate it.

521
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,970
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

522
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,401
Well, no one fell in the pool.

523
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:50,937
The rain stayed away.

524
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,171
I'd call that a win.

525
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,393
I found it in your record collection.

526
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,515
Where's Laura?

527
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:05,116
Oh, yeah, she crashed about an hour ago.

528
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,919
Has to catch a flight
at 6 in the morning for work.

529
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,898
So how'd our little story hold up?

530
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,366
It was great.

531
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,528
I was acting out a part.

532
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,312
I had a secret in me that no one knew.

533
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,171
Except you.

534
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:27,074
You know everybody loves you?

535
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,488
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

536
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:34,299
It made me think that I made
a good choice for the baby.

537
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,489
Well, I thought that we were
the ones that made the choice.

538
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,246
I could've said no.

539
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,239
True.

540
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:45,890
You're gonna make a great dad.

541
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,982
Well, I'm glad it was you.

542
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:03,408
I am gonna take a bath before bed.

543
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:12,155
Thank you for everything, John.

544
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,694
Is everything okay?

545
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:57,075
Something's knocking
against the guest house.

546
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:44,612
Is there coffee?

547
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,719
Yeah. Coming right up.

548
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,685
When does Laura get home?

549
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,706
Tuesday.

550
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,919
So, look, about last night...

551
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:09,245
Todd Decker, he was...

552
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:10,698
He was asking about you.

553
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,170
The guy in the Grey suit? You know,
he was staring at me all night.

554
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,889
Had to be uncomfortable for you.

555
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,288
Can't blame a person for staring.

556
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:24,306
It just means they like what they see.

557
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,402
Actually, I prefer older guys.

558
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,603
I always have.

559
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:33,474
Mike was the youngest guy I ever dated.

560
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,825
- Is that your phone?
- They'll leave a message.

561
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,118
So I have to go into the office today.

562
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,655
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah.

563
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:44,651
I got an important deposition.
You can order out.

564
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:46,201
I'm not gonna be back until late.

565
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:59,709
How about we go out to the lake house?

566
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,206
Just you and I, a weekend
before the baby comes.

567
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,280
<i>As soon as you
get back from Houston.</i>

568
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:05,804
I'd like that.

569
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,047
<i>John, you're not gonna like this...</i>

570
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:10,363
...but Chef Folse wants me out here
tomorrow as well.

571
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:14,886
- You're right. I don't like it.
<i>- Should I say no?</i>

572
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,527
Should I just come home now?

573
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,599
No, go ahead and stay. It's okay.

574
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,206
- Hey.
<i>- I hope you're sitting down.</i>

575
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:32,979
Chef Folse is offering me
a major promotion.

576
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:34,164
<i>Really?</i>

577
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:36,397
That's the reason he brought me down,
so he could offer me...

578
00:48:36,437 --> 00:48:40,032
- ...the CEO position.
- Congratulations.

579
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:43,966
But I thought we talked about, you know...

580
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,891
We have six months before the baby's born.

581
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:49,299
I told him I could run the company while
we look for a permanent replacement.

582
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:50,760
Why not just turn it down, sweetheart?

583
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,920
I think I should take it
even if it is only for six months.

584
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,436
<i>But that's assuming you agree.</i>

585
00:48:55,476 --> 00:48:57,844
<i>I mean, I'd have to spend
a few days a month up here.</i>

586
00:48:57,884 --> 00:48:59,635
<i>But that wouldn't be
until later in the year.</i>

587
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,849
<i>And you could come up for some weekends.</i>

588
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:03,862
Babe, are you happy for me?

589
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:07,322
- I really wanna do this.
- Yeah, no, sweetheart. Definitely.

590
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,597
I'm... I'm definitely happy for you.

591
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,076
- It's unbelievable.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

592
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,898
<i>And you like spending time
with Anna, right?</i>

593
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:17,791
<i>She might even have
a little thing for you.</i>

594
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,558
It's cute. Whatever.

595
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:21,957
I mean, you're a big boy,
you can handle a little attention.

596
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:24,114
<i>Just congratulate me.</i>

597
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:27,868
- Jesus. What the...?
- What?

598
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:31,911
No, congratulations, sweetheart.
I am so proud of you.

599
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,292
I love you.

600
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,360
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

601
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:38,535
I love you too, babe.

602
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,746
Anna!

603
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:10,187
- Hi, John.
- What are you doing?

604
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:12,764
Look, do you see this?

605
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,061
This is me and Laura.
She is my wife, okay?

606
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:18,716
This is our home.
Do you not understand that?

607
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,880
I don't wanna have to say anything to her.

608
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,157
Maybe I should go.

609
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:27,504
No, wait, hold on. No, no. Please, please.

610
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,697
Okay, look.

611
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:34,386
Maybe... Maybe I said something
to encourage you in all this.

612
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,919
And if I did do that, then I am sorry.

613
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:40,443
Hello!

614
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,633
- Hey.
- Hi.

615
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:46,356
Didn't wanna wait until tomorrow,
so I grabbed the next flight.

616
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:49,702
Good. That's... That's good.
Congratulations on everything.

617
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,634
Hello, Laura.

618
00:51:56,656 --> 00:52:00,086
Laura just got a promotion at her company.

619
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,112
Well, it's only until the baby comes.

620
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,740
- How are you?
- Everything is fine.

621
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:12,047
- Welcome home.
- It's good to be back.

622
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,334
It's good to have you back.

623
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,304
Hey, baby.

624
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:10,759
Is anybody home?

625
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,303
Anybody wanna make me a goddamn quiche?

626
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,122
Mike, stop it!

627
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:22,681
You're drunk. Okay? I was gonna call you.

628
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:29,177
Before they find out
this whole thing's a scam...

629
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:32,000
...you're gonna tell them
that you changed your mind.

630
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:33,846
- You'll get them to give you money.
- No.

631
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:35,765
Shut up!

632
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,500
You're gonna take that money.

633
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:43,864
And you and I are heading to Arizona...

634
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,117
...because there is a guy there...

635
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,108
...that's gonna give us another $15,000...

636
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:54,211
...for a nice, new baby.

637
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:01,124
If you don't...

638
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,668
...I'm gonna come back here later...

639
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:08,581
...and I'm gonna tell Laura and John...

640
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,517
...you wanted to take
their last baby from them.

641
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,503
No.

642
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,078
They'll hate you.

643
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,611
Clean this up.

644
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,220
Here you go.

645
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:22,016
Hey! Hey!

646
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:25,320
Get... Get back here!

647
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,387
<i>Leave a message
and I'll call you right back.</i>

648
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,226
God.

649
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:47,133
It's so goddamn typical of you.

650
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,630
Some asshole buys you some fancy shit...

651
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:52,257
...and you fall head over heels for him.

652
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,286
Call me.

653
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:58,811
Stupid bitch.

654
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:51,493
Yeah.

655
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,430
You're the brains, Mike.

656
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:18,789
<i>I am happy.</i>

657
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:23,544
<i>I am in control...</i>

658
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:26,008
<i>...of my life.</i>

659
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:30,815
<i>I feel the joy...</i>

660
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,996
<i>...of pure love.</i>

661
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:54,517
<i>Hi, this is Laura Taylor.
Leave a message, and I'll...</i>

662
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,280
I can't hold the room. I'm sorry.

663
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,948
You know what, let's just go ahead and...

664
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,366
- Should we?
- I...

665
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,945
- Okay. All right.
- I left a message.

666
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,263
That's the femur.

667
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,731
It's a boy.

668
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:14,612
I told you.

669
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,664
She's right.

670
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:18,589
That's definitely a boy.

671
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:25,541
Honey. No, wait.

672
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,431
It's a boy.

673
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,544
- It's a boy.
- No, babe...

674
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:32,043
...just get down here as soon as you can.

675
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,572
That's my son.

676
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,643
I'm looking at my son.

677
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:46,080
Look at his head.

678
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,586
That's my son.

679
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:52,177
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

680
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,564
I'm sorry. I had it in my schedule
as 2:00.

681
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:06,136
- Maybe you just entered it wrong.
- No, I didn't enter it wrong. I...

682
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:07,797
Damn it. I know I didn't. I... I...

683
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,701
Someone changed it in my phone!
I know that I put it in right.

684
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:14,889
I booked my flights around it!
I know that I did! Damn it!

685
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,122
- I... I...
- Laura. Stop it. Please.

686
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,719
Please.

687
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:26,608
This is the only time
we're ever gonna be able to do this.

688
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:29,996
It's all right. Just don't worry about it.

689
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:42,215
Let's just go somewhere.
I don't know, lunch.

690
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,186
I can't.

691
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:51,103
I left a client at the airport.

692
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,408
I have to go back.

693
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:12,580
<i>Anna Walsh on 2.</i>

694
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:13,776
<i>Hello?</i>

695
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:17,263
<i>I'm so excited. A boy.</i>

696
01:00:17,303 --> 01:00:21,124
<i>I knew it. Let's have lunch today.
To celebrate.</i>

697
01:00:21,662 --> 01:00:23,873
<i>Just you and me. I promise it'll be fun.</i>

698
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:26,082
- Anna, is there anything actually wrong?
<i>- Why?</i>

699
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,877
Because you shouldn't
be calling me at work.

700
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,533
Okay? I cannot sneak away,
I will not have lunch with you.

701
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,637
I have appointments all afternoon.
Like I said earlier...

702
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:43,628
Mr. Taylor's office. Please hold.

703
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:47,426
- Anna Walsh.
- Tell her I left for the day.

704
01:00:56,872 --> 01:01:00,096
- What is it?
<i>- Why are you lying to me?</i>

705
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,328
What are you talking about?

706
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:05,242
<i>I'd never lie to you, John.</i>

707
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,339
<i>I've always told you the truth.</i>

708
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:12,201
<i>But not you.</i>

709
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,631
Why are you saying that?

710
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,122
Because I'm right here.

711
01:01:28,675 --> 01:01:30,869
This is for you.

712
01:01:31,279 --> 01:01:33,679
A congratulations.

713
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:36,554
All right. No, we're not gonna do this.

714
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:39,402
We're not gonna do this.

715
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:41,317
Let's do something fun.

716
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:48,913
Nope. We're not doing anything fun.

717
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:58,396
What a surprise.
Laura's working late again!

718
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,351
Why did you think
she would make a good mother?

719
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:03,084
- Enough!
- We're so different.

720
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:04,900
She couldn't even stay pregnant.

721
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:07,084
I wonder if she actually even wanted to.

722
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:08,677
Are you sure she had miscarriages?

723
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,478
Because you know there are ways
to fake that, right?

724
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:15,651
- Are you out of your mind?
- You need to be nicer to me, John.

725
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,225
I will leave. The law says I can.

726
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,748
This is my baby. Mike says we can sell it.

727
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,712
- John!
- You know what?

728
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,890
Leave. Go. Get out of the house!

729
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,317
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do.

730
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,725
I'll tell Laura everything.
It will kill her. It will break her heart.

731
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:40,115
But you know what? We'll survive it.

732
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,782
We'll pick up the pieces and move on
because that's what we do.

733
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:47,234
But what about you? You'll be alone.

734
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:51,086
You'll be broke,
with a kid that's not even really yours.

735
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,238
So go for it.

736
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:55,249
Leave.

737
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:03,030
I just want you.

738
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:27,503
- White here.
<i>- Hey, Roland, it's John.</i>

739
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:31,027
Hey, what's up? What, the old man
needs another rock looked under?

740
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:34,191
No, actually, I need a favour.
And it's not business.

741
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:35,950
<i>- It's personal.</i>
- Sure, John.

742
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:39,771
There's a guy I'd like you to look into.
His name is Mike Mitchell.

743
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,946
<i>He's Navy, based in Louisiana.</i>

744
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,866
<i>He's been deployed about two months.
Just need a history on him.</i>

745
01:03:44,906 --> 01:03:47,224
<i>Anything you can find would be great.</i>

746
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:50,308
I'm on it. Anything for you, John.

747
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:51,893
My man.

748
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:05,652
You wanted to see me?

749
01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:08,163
Have a seat, John.

750
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,665
Look, you know
the firm monitors computer use...

751
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,409
...and e-mail accounts.

752
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:21,893
The system's set up
to automatically snag...

753
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:24,909
...certain types of files,
things that could...

754
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:28,137
...embarrass the company.

755
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,665
Todd recognised her from your party.

756
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:53,782
She's not your relative, is she?

757
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:56,981
No. She's our surrogate.

758
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,039
And I don't see
how this is company business.

759
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:01,505
Anna has been getting
prenatal care from a clinic...

760
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,966
...that happens to be a subsidiary
of Grafton Industries.

761
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,901
She is a patient of the very people...

762
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:10,212
...we're about to take to court.

763
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:13,323
That's a big deal, John.

764
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,665
I'm giving the case to Todd.

765
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,891
I hope you understand.

766
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:22,951
I'm sorry, John. That video got bounced
straight to the old man.

767
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:25,404
I think I just lost my job.

768
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,927
You ready for things to get worse?

769
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,854
I don't think that's possible.

770
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,586
Remember that guy you asked me
to run a check on? Mitchell?

771
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:36,894
- Yeah.
- Two years ago...

772
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:39,511
...he was discharged from the military
for some assaults.

773
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:41,324
Regular dickhead shit.

774
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:44,272
But after I saw the video,
I got to thinking about that girl.

775
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,202
- Your girl.
- Yeah, and...?

776
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,461
Well, her real name isn't Walsh.

777
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:51,529
She got married at 19 in Little Rock.

778
01:05:51,616 --> 01:05:54,232
Before that, she was Anna Devost.

779
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,105
Which is why the surrogate agency
missed this.

780
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:01,846
<i>Marijuana. A DUI.</i>

781
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,936
<i>Nothing horrible, really.</i>

782
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:06,836
<i>But not exactly the picture of innocence.</i>

783
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:10,445
So I dug a little deeper.

784
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:11,673
<i>She was born in Memphis.</i>

785
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,906
<i>Her parents died when she was 3.</i>

786
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:17,682
<i>Raised by foster parents.</i>

787
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,733
<i>She lived with them for 12 years.</i>

788
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:25,654
<i>Now, this took some work to get to.</i>

789
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,102
<i>When she was 16,
she attacks her foster dad...</i>

790
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:30,264
<i>...with a pair of scissors.</i>

791
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:32,341
<i>Killed him.</i>

792
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:34,549
<i>Seems she had a reason.</i>

793
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:37,965
<i>The guy was sexually abusing her.</i>

794
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:41,890
<i>State takes over...</i>

795
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:44,457
<i>...puts her in psych.</i>

796
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:49,948
<i>She's a minor, so the records are sealed.</i>

797
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:54,169
<i>But when she turns 18,
she walks out and is gone.</i>

798
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,786
<i>She's dangerous, John.</i>

799
01:06:56,889 --> 01:06:59,598
You're right where you should be.

800
01:06:59,684 --> 01:07:03,124
And you slowly begin
to reawaken yourself...

801
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:06,102
...with small movements.

802
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,858
You appreciate your mind and your body...

803
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:12,167
...for the accomplishments of this lesson.

804
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:19,466
Thank you so much.

805
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:21,679
- Thank you.
- Okay, it's my turn.

806
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:26,243
This was John's great-grandmother's...

807
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,064
...and then my mother and then mine.

808
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:31,552
I always wanted you to have it.

809
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:34,259
John told me about this.

810
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:43,098
Isn't it lovely?

811
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,238
Oh, that's so cute.

812
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:59,143
Thank you.

813
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,672
What are you doing here in my office?

814
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,943
You picked me.

815
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:08,952
It wasn't the other way around.

816
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,261
When you're around me...

817
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,476
...my whole body reacts.

818
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:16,308
I can't think.

819
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:18,183
I can't breathe.

820
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,045
I need you.

821
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:25,366
I know.

822
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,748
You want to be a good man.

823
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:30,210
But how do you know you love your wife?

824
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,339
If you kiss me...

825
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:41,398
...what if you found out
that this was more real?

826
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:47,468
- Kiss me.
- No, I'm not gonna kiss you.

827
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:48,824
- Kiss me.
- No.

828
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:51,581
Or I'll tell her things
that will make her leave you.

829
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:56,346
Kiss me, John.

830
01:10:57,755 --> 01:10:58,909
- Please, John.
- No. No.

831
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:01,839
- Kiss me. John.
- No. No!

832
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:24,389
I can't live like this.

833
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:35,977
Look...

834
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:39,778
...nobody knows what's gonna
happen in the future.

835
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,878
What do you mean?

836
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:46,502
I mean, I know what you want.

837
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:51,674
But you're gonna have to trust me.

838
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:55,571
Okay?

839
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:01,725
I need you to go back to bed.

840
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,839
So will you do that for me?

841
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:17,067
I love you, John.

842
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:19,971
I know.

843
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:58,043
No!

844
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,189
- You asshole!
- Whoa, wait a minute. Hold up!

845
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:14,395
You lied to me! Stay away from me.

846
01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:18,261
- Come here.
- I'll kill you!

847
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,649
Anna.

848
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,810
- Stay away from me.
- Anna.

849
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:30,667
Leave me alone!

850
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:32,761
I hate you!

851
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,928
Okay. Give me the knife.
Give me the knife.

852
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:37,179
- Give me the knife.
- No! No!

853
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:40,513
- Give me the knife. Give me the knife.
- I wanna leave!

854
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:42,631
Relax. Just relax.

855
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:44,032
- Relax.
- Anna!

856
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:45,891
Stop it!

857
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,510
What the hell is going on?

858
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,729
He doesn't love you!

859
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:51,765
He told me!

860
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,678
Every time he screws me,
that's what he tells me!

861
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:56,990
- What are you talking about?
- I hate you!

862
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,887
Anna, please.

863
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,184
Stop this.

864
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:08,972
- What's going on here?
- Please don't let him hurt me.

865
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:12,212
- We got a call, a disturbance.
- No. She is having our baby.

866
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:13,703
She has to come back inside.

867
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:17,863
He's been screwing me. Every night.

868
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:22,002
Using me. Lying to me.

869
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:24,885
He told me that he loves me.

870
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:27,487
- That's not true.
- I hate him!

871
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,768
Come in the house. Let me talk to you.

872
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,811
- Don't come any further.
- Listen...

873
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,976
- Sir, you need to step back.
- Listen, she is carrying our baby.

874
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:39,000
Sir, did you hear me? Step back. Now!

875
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,105
Now.

876
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:55,870
Okay, drive careful, ma'am.

877
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:11,653
None of what she said was true, okay?
None of it. Babe, she is lying!

878
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:13,777
- I never even touched her.
- Whatever it was...

879
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:16,028
...you have been lying to me!

880
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:17,807
And now she's gone with our baby!

881
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,136
I've never lied to you.

882
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,287
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

883
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:24,227
- Did you kiss her?
- No.

884
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:26,291
Then why didn't you say anything?

885
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,818
I didn't wanna ruin
the experience for you.

886
01:15:30,903 --> 01:15:34,168
I thought that I could handle it, okay?
I knew that I was handling it.

887
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,825
And then it just... It just got worse.

888
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:38,009
And then she threatened
to take the baby and...

889
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:39,622
Because I couldn't have a baby...

890
01:15:39,745 --> 01:15:41,506
- ...that I'm not a woman...
- No, no.

891
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:43,991
- ...that I can't handle it, you...
- No, I knew you could.

892
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:46,966
- I knew, I just...
- No, you didn't.

893
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:48,507
- I didn't wanna ruin it.
- You lied.

894
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:50,864
Baby, I just didn't wanna ruin it.

895
01:15:52,216 --> 01:15:54,276
I wanted it for you.

896
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:58,261
I wish I could say that
it never happens, but it does.

897
01:15:59,348 --> 01:16:01,542
So when does it become a kidnapping?

898
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:04,808
Never. It never becomes kidnapping.

899
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:07,985
Even though it's your egg,
fertilised by your husband's sperm...

900
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:10,166
...it's your embryo...

901
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:12,552
...but it's growing inside her uterus.

902
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:15,661
The law views her as the birth mother.

903
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:18,829
And when she gives birth,
it is her child...

904
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,319
...until she relinquishes that right.

905
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:37,515
Yes, thank you,
I'd like to hold for the doctor.

906
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:40,772
I'm not gonna make partner.

907
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:42,805
Why?

908
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,418
Anna came to the office,
caused a lot of problems.

909
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,713
Think Cooper's gonna let me go.

910
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,491
Dr. Park just got a notice
from a pharmacy in Mexico...

911
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:04,936
- ...where Anna bought Cytotec.
- She's in Mexico?

912
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,747
- No, she had it shipped here.
- What is Cytotec?

913
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:09,728
Well, it's normally prescribed
for ulcers...

914
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:14,171
...but if a pregnant woman takes
enough of it, it could induce labour...

915
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,502
...or terminate.

916
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,594
Where is the medicine being shipped?

917
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,563
I got the address. Let's go.

918
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,988
Hello?

919
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:30,887
<i>- Is she there?</i>
- No.

920
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:32,825
No, she's not here. Where are you?

921
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,621
I want you to come back.

922
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:38,411
<i>Not to her. Just to you.</i>

923
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,796
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

924
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:44,780
<i>- Isn't that crazy?</i>
- I can meet you.

925
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:48,568
I can meet you today, right now.
Where are you?

926
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,086
<i>It can't be like it was.</i>

927
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:54,391
<i>Everything has to change.</i>

928
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:02,860
I swear to you, if she does anything
to hurt my child, I will kill her.

929
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:06,374
She hasn't been here today.

930
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,102
Box is empty.

931
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,385
I think if she calls again, you know,
I could...

932
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,003
...lure her to a public place,
have the police there waiting for her.

933
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,612
Except she's not guilty of anything.

934
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,836
She is guilty. Okay?

935
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:21,438
She ordered a drug to end the pregnancy.

936
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,427
You want me to explain that to a judge?

937
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:26,577
I mean, you'd win the case,
but you'd lose your child.

938
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,557
She could kill your baby today.

939
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:30,991
You don't have time
to bring this to the police.

940
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:34,523
She was part of the scam, then she fell
in love with you. That's what we have.

941
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:37,718
She could have that baby any minute
now. She could be disappearing.

942
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:40,929
Oh, that girl ain't going nowhere.
She loves you.

943
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:43,265
You gotta put her at ease.

944
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:45,313
- You need to make her happy.
- Make her happy?

945
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,964
- Yes.
- No. I know this girl.

946
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:50,077
Making her happy is not an option.

947
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,450
You're wrong. You're wrong.
You give her what she wants.

948
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:56,355
Convince her you're in love with her.
Tell her that you're leaving me.

949
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:57,862
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Yes.

950
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,477
She is in love with you.
If you make her believe...

951
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,764
...that you feel the same way,
she will stay with you.

952
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,976
She will have the baby for you.

953
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:06,579
- Laura's right.
- No, she isn't.

954
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:10,141
In her mind, I am keeping
the two of you apart.

955
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:11,966
You convince her that you love her.

956
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,350
When you meet her,
you have to make her believe you.

957
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:18,426
That you want to have the baby
with her and not with me.

958
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,068
I don't wanna know what you have to do.
I don't ever...

959
01:19:29,141 --> 01:19:30,470
...need to hear about it.

960
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:36,481
But you do whatever it takes
to bring my baby back.

961
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:54,379
You should take her to the lake house.

962
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:58,529
Tell her that you're thinking
of moving there.

963
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,607
With her.

964
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,566
Stay with me.

965
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,044
The new exhibit's right that way.

966
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,252
Wait, Anna.

967
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,324
Anna.

968
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,556
Oh, my God.

969
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,093
I love it.

970
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:56,949
It's so beautiful.

971
01:22:57,098 --> 01:23:00,106
Yeah, it was my father's. Laura hates it.

972
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,580
I guess I should've sold it...

973
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:06,625
...but part of me
always wanted to live here.

974
01:23:27,504 --> 01:23:31,119
God, I love it so much, John.

975
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,562
Can we live here?

976
01:23:34,678 --> 01:23:36,522
Just us?

977
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:38,482
Yes.

978
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,133
After I file those divorce papers.

979
01:23:41,226 --> 01:23:43,286
Just us.

980
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:54,994
<i>I'm gonna make you so happy, John.</i>

981
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:58,317
I want you to know...

982
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,683
...everything that I am...

983
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:05,891
...is yours.

984
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,866
All of me...

985
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,702
...everything...

986
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:20,207
...forever.

987
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:16,413
Laura?

988
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:23,044
Laura?

989
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:54,248
I couldn't sleep.

990
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,463
It's beautiful.

991
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:08,259
A leap of faith.

992
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,442
Yeah.

993
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:32,083
I can't stay long,
because I told her that...

994
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:33,557
Yeah.

995
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,224
I told her I had to pick up some papers.

996
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:39,805
Okay.

997
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,475
Laura, I...

998
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:47,204
- It's okay.
- No. I...

999
01:26:47,996 --> 01:26:50,746
- ...just...
- It's okay.

1000
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:53,133
Come here.

1001
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:09,042
<i>She's gonna stay
at the lake house tonight.</i>

1002
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:14,211
She agreed to go to
the doctor's with me tomorrow.

1003
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:22,967
<i>It's happening. Contractions.</i>

1004
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:26,272
<i>I'm okay. I'm going to St. Agnes Hospital.</i>

1005
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:27,941
<i>Come as soon as you can.</i>

1006
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:29,517
<i>It's our baby.</i>

1007
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,009
- I have to go there.
- No. No, no.

1008
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,778
- She cannot see you.
- John.

1009
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:35,168
I know, just trust me. Okay?

1010
01:28:35,346 --> 01:28:37,797
Please, just trust me.

1011
01:28:46,698 --> 01:28:49,273
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a patient. Anna Walsh.

1012
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:53,013
- Are you a relative? Okay.
- She's having my son, yes.

1013
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:55,222
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Thanks for coming.

1014
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:58,257
No, I'm sorry. I don't have a patient
listed under the last name Walsh.

1015
01:28:58,334 --> 01:29:00,487
Try Taylor. My last name is Taylor.

1016
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,722
- No. No Taylors.
- That's... That's impossible.

1017
01:29:04,841 --> 01:29:06,819
No, there has to be a Taylor
or a Walsh in there.

1018
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:08,636
- No, I have neither.
- She's not here, John.

1019
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,873
She never checked in.

1020
01:29:11,681 --> 01:29:13,360
Where the hell could she be?

1021
01:30:04,901 --> 01:30:07,095
Miss Havisham?

1022
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:12,031
Miss Havisham, where are you?

1023
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:19,498
Miss Havisham...

1024
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:25,143
Are you hiding in the pantry?

1025
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:36,507
What the hell is that smell?

1026
01:32:19,035 --> 01:32:22,465
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1027
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:27,017
Oh, my God.

1028
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:58,602
Oh, Jesus.

1029
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:29,649
<i>Hi, this is Laura Taylor.
Leave a message...</i>

1030
01:33:46,122 --> 01:33:47,152
Oh, God.

1031
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:56,877
Okay. Okay.

1032
01:33:59,496 --> 01:34:00,721
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1033
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,511
Please, come now. She's having the baby.

1034
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:04,627
No!

1035
01:34:05,516 --> 01:34:06,670
No, no!

1036
01:34:22,325 --> 01:34:25,158
She's dropping.
Let's get those fluids going.

1037
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:28,402
Laura. Laura, can you hear me?

1038
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:29,651
She's unresponsive.

1039
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,861
- Wide open.
- Okay.

1040
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,493
We got a female, early 40s.
Possible head trauma.

1041
01:34:33,586 --> 01:34:36,758
Pressure 85/55 and dropping.

1042
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:38,899
All right, let's cross-type and match.

1043
01:34:39,008 --> 01:34:40,512
Make sure the CAT scan...

1044
01:35:40,528 --> 01:35:43,752
Hey. Can you hear me?

1045
01:35:45,032 --> 01:35:46,835
John?

1046
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:49,970
You're gonna be fine.

1047
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:52,912
Doctor says you just have
a bad concussion, some stitches...

1048
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:55,491
...but you're gonna be okay.

1049
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:56,830
Where's my baby?

1050
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:59,897
We can't find Anna.

1051
01:36:03,926 --> 01:36:05,636
It's Roland. Yeah.

1052
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:07,996
I'm across the river
at Montgomery Hospital.

1053
01:36:08,088 --> 01:36:11,178
Anna walked into ER in labour
after she attacked Laura.

1054
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:15,088
<i>Gave birth to a healthy baby boy,
according to her records.</i>

1055
01:36:15,637 --> 01:36:18,008
She left later that evening
and took the baby with her.

1056
01:36:18,068 --> 01:36:20,277
- Where did she go?
<i>- She disappeared.</i>

1057
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:22,078
<i>I told the police to put an APB...</i>

1058
01:36:22,236 --> 01:36:24,471
...out on her in every city
she's ever lived in...

1059
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:28,229
...including that military base in
Pensacola where Mike was stationed.

1060
01:36:28,325 --> 01:36:30,807
John, she has that baby...

1061
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:32,714
...she's gonna wanna be someplace safe.

1062
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:35,148
- And close by.
- All right, thanks.

1063
01:36:37,451 --> 01:36:41,084
The lake house.
It's gotta be the lake house.

1064
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:44,712
- No, babe. What are you doing?
- John.

1065
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,054
- Please, I have to go.
- I can't let you do that.

1066
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:50,668
John, I am going to get my child back.

1067
01:36:59,273 --> 01:37:00,303
No. No, no, no.

1068
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:02,594
I let you come with me,
but this is as far as you go.

1069
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:04,712
Look, we know that she's dangerous.

1070
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:07,171
Just wait in the car.

1071
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:17,323
Hey.

1072
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:25,754
Shit.

1073
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:34,928
Oh, God! What happened?

1074
01:40:36,365 --> 01:40:38,250
I got you. Just get in the car.

1075
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:40,860
- I got it.
- Come on. We gotta move.

1076
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:52,098
We better hurry up.

1077
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:24,707
Oh, shit.

1078
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:27,570
Cover the baby!

1079
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:42,608
I am sick of you, you crazy bitch.

1080
01:43:06,557 --> 01:43:08,658
It's gonna be okay.
