- [Rustling]
- [Man On Radio] We've been receiving...

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,441
so many calls, asking
about this marvelous airship...

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,640
the Spirit of Freedom...
which, uh, may or may not
be passing over our area soon.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,600
I'll let you know as soon as we have
more information available.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,371
But, fiirst, here's the weather forecast.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,565
Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the mountains.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,961
Mild winds will be blowing in from the west...

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,441
- pushing the clouds out by this evening.
- [Bee Buzzing]

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,087
There'll be a beautiful
full moon lighting up the skies...

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,921
so, if you've been
planning something special,
tonight might be the night.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,765
Tomorrow also looks good
with clear skies and sun.

13

[Clicks Off Radio]

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,449
- Mornin'!
- Hi!

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,363
[Bird Chirps]

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,361
- Jiji, wake up.! Tonight's the night.
- Hmm?

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,330
Hey, Mom! Oh.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,484
Hi, Miss Dora. Hey, Mom, it's gonna
be clear tonight.

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,928
And, guess what.
The radio says there'll be a full moon!

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,482
Did you borrow your father's radio
again without asking?

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,324
Don't worry. He doesn't mind.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,769
Please excuse me, Miss Dora.
Mom, it's a perfect midnight
for me to leave home.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,844
You mean tonight?
Next month is what you told me.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,287
Yeah, but the next
full moon might be on a cloudy night.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,448
And, I want to leave
on the perfect midnight.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,927
Huh? But, Kiki... Wait!

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,929
Ohh...
[Gasps]

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,008
Uhh...
[Sighs]

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,289
My, oh, my. What's this all about?

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,569
It's one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13...

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,371
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,563
- Your little baby is 13?
- [Sighs]

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,331
My goodness, but time flies so quickly.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,882
I know. She seems so young
to be leaving home now.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,881
I remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,722
A little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,561
And, I was certain
she was much too young
to hold such an importantjob...

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,768
as resident witch.

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,288
- [Chuckles]
- Yes, but I could fly. Kiki
barely knows how to do that.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,331
And, I have had no time
to teach her how to mix potions like me.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,323
Hmm. Young people are all the same.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,960
They all want to do something different.

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,969
But, I hope, you at least get to teach her...

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,966
- the potion that cures my rheumatism.
- [Laughs]

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,011
Hurry up! We always said
we'd leave on the perfect night, didn't we?

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,243
Uh-uh. Our plan was that
we would stick around for
another month and play it safe.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,249
I liked that plan.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,883
And, if we put it off for a
month, and I find some wonderful
boyfriend, then what'll we do?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,889
- Uh-oh!
- Come on, Jiji.!

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,089
I'm gonna put my paws together
and pray you're not serious.

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,368
Of course, I am.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,809
You know ever since I turned 13,
I've been excited about making this trip.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,130
- [Car Approaching]
- There. Dad!

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,442
Dad! Guess what!

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,881
I've decided to leave tonight!

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,924
- You're... You're going away?
- Yeah, there's a full moon!

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,923
Well, yeah, but what happened
to the camping trip...

58
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,923
we were supposed
to take this weekend?

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,686
Sorry, Dad!

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,204
Aah, oh... Uh, Kiki, wait!
I need... Whoa! Ya... Ow!

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,966
Ahh... Ohh...

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,926
Ye... Yeah,
I'll expect you then. Thanks.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,965
Hi, Mom, it's me.
I wanted to make sure you knew
that Kiki is leaving tonight.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,963
Yes, midnight.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,169
- Very pretty.
- Lilac would look prettier on me.

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,961
- Or, white.
- Witches have worn this color
for a very long time, Kiki.

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,488
Oh, Mom, I look really dumb.

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,325
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,681
What matters is the heart inside.

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,844
Well, I'm gonna be the very
best witch that I can be, Mom.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,526
And, I know having
a good heart is important.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,322
- Just follow your heart and keep smiling.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,849
- And, be sure to write home
as soon as you're settled.
- Okay.

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,281
Dad! Oh. Can I please take the radio?

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,046
- Mom, didn't you say I could have the radio?
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,289
- Yea.!
- All right. It's yours already.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,768
- Thank you.!
- Well, now. You certainly
look very grown up.

78
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,441
- My little princess.
- [Giggles]

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,171
#Ta-da ##

80
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,648
You look just like your mother,
when she was young.

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,689
I'm glad about that.

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,411
Dad, can you lift me up high,
like when I was little?

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,091
Well...

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,689
- Uhh... Uh... I don't know.
[Grunts]
- Oh...

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,730
- Here we go!
- [Laughs]

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,730
- [Laughs]
- Oh.

87
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,090
How come you never
told me you were growin' up so fast?

88
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,441
If things don't work out, you can
always come home.

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,729
And come back a failure? Ooh-aghh!

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,729
[Laughing]

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,730
Will you write us if you have the time?

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,646
Mm-hmm. Oh, I love you, Dad.

93
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,561
[Woman] After all, she is a baby.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,121
[Man] I won't disagree with you there.
It's beautiful.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,489
But aren't you worried about
Kiki living in the big city all alone?

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,642
Of course they are, but Kiki'll be just fine.

97
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,491
- You're gonna find a city by the ocean?
- Or maybe a town?

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,921
Uh-huh. That's what I'm hoping, anyway.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,247
- Wow. You're gonna have such a good time.
- Wow, I'm so jealous.

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,563
- You'll have so much fun!
- But I'm not going just for a good time.

101
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,644
In order to be a good witch,
I have to train a year away from home.

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,531
Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys.

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,562
- [Girls Giggling]
- Kiki, it's time.

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,365
- 'Kay!
- Oh.

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,761
That's the broom you're going
to be leaving on?

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,651
Yep! I just made it
this morning all by myself.

107
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,649
Honey, it's too small to be really safe.

108
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,206
I'd rather you took my broom.
I know it better.

109
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,203
But, Mom, that one's so old!

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,283
And, that's why it's good.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,483
You can rely on it time after time
in any kind of weather.

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,921
Now, Kiki, do this for me, please.

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,283
But I put so much work into this one.
Right, Jiji?

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,923
- Your broom is nice, but
let's take your mother's.
- You're no help!

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,450
Now, Kiki, can't you make
yourself another fine broom
when you get settled down?

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,770
Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,242
- Umm-hmm.
- Be careful.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,328
- You be strong, okay?
- I will!

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,370
- Bye!
- Bye, Kiki!

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,765
- [Girl] Fly safely.!
- [Girl] Go get 'em.! Good-bye.!

121
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,962
Oh, dear!

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,563
Go, Kiki! Go, Kiki!
Go, Kiki! Go, Kiki! Go, Kiki! Go!

123
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,849
[Gasps] Uhh! Uhh!

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,843
- [Parents Gasp]
- [Jiji] Bear right!

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,128
- [Jiji] Go left! Go left! Go left!
- [Kiki] Okay!

126
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,123
- [Bells Ringing]
- [Jiji] Oww.!

127
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,123
Aim your broomstick!

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,122
[Kiki] Good-bye, everybody.!
I'll miss you.!

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,123
She's okay.

130
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,164
May our little baby be well and have
a safe trip.

131
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,971
I'm going to miss the wonderful sound
of those bells.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,848
Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,843
- [Wind Howling]
- Where are we going?

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,207
I'm headed south to see the ocean.

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,009
Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio.

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,407
I don't think I can handle it.
Can you do it?

137
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,449
Oh, great!

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,809
- Now, I'm suddenly the flight attendant.

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,687
Do you think, maybe,
you can teach me how to fly it?

302
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,243
Hey, Tombo.! Maybe you can sweep her
offher feet with that broom.

303
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,361
- [Laughing]
- Hey, shut up, all right? Who-o-a! Hey...

304
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,007
You know, miss, I love flying too.
Could I see your broom?

305
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,731
- Hey, wait!
- Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

306
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,281
But I really shouldn't
be talking to you,
and you wanna know why?

307
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,325
It's very rude to talk to a girl
before you've been introduced
and before you know her name.

308
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,286
- Hmph!
- [Stammers]

Hmm.

310
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,170
You're kind of old-fashioned,
aren't ya? You sound like my grandmother.

311
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,368
Just go away and leave me alone!

312
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,605
Hey! Don't go. Come back. Wait up, huh?

313
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,802
Ohh! Oh...

314
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,331
Hmm. What a cool witch.

315
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,689
[Clicks Tongue] Come on.

316
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,690
Stay here tonight? I'm afraid
I don't understand.

317
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,689
Your parents are here
with you, aren't they?

318
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,930
No, sir, I'm alone.
I've come to this town because
I'm a new witch in training.

319
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,242
Do you have some identification?

320
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,641
Oh, never mind.

321
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,846
- [Children Chattering]
- Hey, hey, come on over here.

322
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,561
Kiki, aren't you going to eat that?

323
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,087
No, you can have it, Jiji.

324
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,889
Where are we going to stay tonight?

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,889
- [Siren Approaching]
- Huh?

326
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,886
Let's go.

327
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,649
Why don't we go find another town?

328
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,322
I'll bet there are bigger
and better ones. Ones that
are friendlier than this.

329
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,562
Just a thought.

330
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,691
Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness.!

331
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,690
Hey there! Your pacifier!

332
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,931
Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifiier.!

333
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,004
Oh! Poor baby.

334
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,006
Without this, the baby'll wake
up and cry all the way home.

335
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,401
I better go give it to her myself.

336
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm sorry, folks. But could
you wait just a minute? I'll be right back.

337
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,209
- [Man] Uh-huh.
- [Woman] Certainly.

338
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,803
- Excuse me. But would you like
me to deliver it for you?
- What?

339
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,651
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went around the corner.

340
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,003
- I could reach her in no time.
- Really? You'd do that?

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,401
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

342
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,530

- Excuse me, young lady!

Oh...

Wow!

345
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,488
Uh, Kiki, is this really
any of our business?

346
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,041
Kiki? No, I thought not.

347
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,208
- Wow!
- [Gasps] Oh!

348
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,809
Sorry to surprise you, but
the lady in the bakery asked me
to return this pacifier.

349
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,803
Oh!

- Eh, I'd like one of those.

354
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,170
Yes, sir. Oh, hi there. Come in
and wait a minute, will you?

355
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,444
- Excuse me.
- Mmm. These are nice and fresh.
Just out of the oven.

356
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,723
- There you are.
- All right. Thank you very much.

357
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,326
- Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,281
That'll be all for you?
All right. Thank you.

359
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,200
- Now come back again!
- Thanks.

360
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,046
But of course.

361
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,602
When I saw you fly off,
I thought for a second I was dreaming!

362
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,882
The baby's mother told me
to give you this message.

363
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,681
Hmm?

364
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,210
"Thanks for returning the
pacifier. Your new delivery
girl is really quite special."

365
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,210
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- Wait!

366
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,688
Wait a minute. I really must do something
to show you my thanks.

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,289
Huh?

368

Follow me. Bakery's downstairs,
upstairs is home.

you like some hot chocolate?

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,007
And, this is for you, little guy.

373
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,003
So, tell me if I'm right.

374
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,243
- I'm guessing you're a witch in training.
- You're right.!

375
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,610
And I really love it here,
but people don't seem to like
witches in this town.

376
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,603
Depends on the people.

377

Now, take me, for instance.
I just met you and I know I like you.

are you two staying?

- Uhh...
- Oh, I see.

380
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,607
Why didn't you tell me you have
no place to stay? We have
a spare room in the attic.

381
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,291
- You can use that.
- You'd really let me stay with you?

[Laughs]

383
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,489
Why, of course! But we haven't
introduced ourselves.

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,124

here is my very best friend.

385
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,365
It's right up here, Kiki.
It may need a little dusting...

386
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,006
but I think you'll like it.

387

Oh, my. It's a little bit
dustier than I remember.

388
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,686

a baby, I'd help you clean.
- That's okay!

389
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,922
All right, then. Water
and bathroom are downstairs.

390
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,290
- Give a shout if you need anything.
- Thank you.

- This is... quaint.
- Jiji.

392

you know. It's flour.

appears in our skies.

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,888
Jiji, I've decided
not to leave this town.

409
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,288
- Maybe I can stay and find some
other nice people like Osono,
- You know, Jack, I think...

410
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,528
- who will like me and accept me for who I am.
- Our audience would agree...

How much do you think it would
cost to get a phone here?

426
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,882
- A phone?
- Yep. We're gonna need a phone.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,722
And I personally think that what
money you have should be spent
on getting us back home.

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,804
Or, at least, on buying me

Whoa!

- Well, I really only have
one skill and that's flying.

435
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,048
So I thought a delivery service
wouldn't be a bad idea.

It's a great idea...

- I have a little saved up already.

441
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,168
Don't waste your money.!
What I think you should do
is use our phone.

You know it will take some time
to get regular customers.

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,408
I'll make you a deal.
Since I'm expecting a baby,
I could use help.

You're a bit late! After
my sister telephoned, we were
wondering where you were.

598
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,926
Uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

599
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,921
Ah... Um. Could I please have
your signature, ma'am?

600
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,444
- Mom, can I put the canary in here?
- Uh-huh.

601
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,844
- But you be sure not to let it fly away, Ket.
- 'Kay. [Laughs]

602
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,651
Ahh... Um...

603
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,888
I've gotta run! Bye!

604
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,407
Oh...

605
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,086
Thank you! Enjoy your present!

606
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,766
Well! Woo...

607
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,605
Come on, you stupid bird.!

608
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,482
I got a brand-new home for you.
[Grunts]

609
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,247
[Whimpers] Please hurry, Kiki.

610
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,287
[Groans]

611
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,884
I know you fell close by, so
you've got to be here somewhere.

612
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,887
[Gasps]

613
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,764
There you are!

614
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,443
Hello! Anyone home?

615
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,331
Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello!

616
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,449
- Anybody here?
- Yes.! Stop shouting.! I'm on
the roof.! What do you want?

617
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,164
Why don't you come up?
Good, birdie. Hold it right there.

618
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,244
- [Gasps]
- [Crow Caws]

619
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,442
[Caws]

620
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,084
- What do you want?
- Oh, well, you have a black cat...

621
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,687
in your cabin window,
and, you see, it's mine and I need it back.

622
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,729
You're a good birdie, aren't you?

623
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,486
I'm sorry, but, uh, I'm kind of in a hurry.

624
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,688
So, why was it alone in the forest, huh?

625
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,049
That's where I dropped it.
Um, may I have it back, please?

626
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,209
I really need to finish this.

627
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,324
That's my girl!

628
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,006
- You're just about through, okay?
- [Crow Caws]

629
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,206
[Sighs]

630
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,931
Well, why didn't you tell me
sooner why you needed it
in such a hurry?

631
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,250
He keeps me company.
I've gotten sort of fond ofhim, you know?

632
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,368
Thank you.
[Gasps]
Oh...

633
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,602
Oh, no!

634
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,768
His head's falling off.

635
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,605
Ooh, it must have been
the crows. They were making
such a big fuss over him.

636
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,610
This is terrible. I can't deliver it like this.

637
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,604
Hm. Hey!

638
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,889
- I know. How about we work out a deal?
- Huh?

639
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,801
So, you're on your own at 13.
That's pretty exciting.

640
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,803
To be completely independent
and a witch!

641
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,088
- Impressive!
- How's it going?

642
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,083
Trust me. He'll be good as new.

643
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,687
Huh... Almost done.

644
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,722
- [Woman] Ket, dear, turn off the TV.!
- [TV Character Growls]

645
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,920
Your birthday guests are gonna be here soon.!

646
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,447
Ket, did you hear me?

647
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,531
- [Shouting] Ket, turn off the TV.!
- Okay! Okay!

648
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,964
That's right. You just keep sleeping.
[Gasps]

649
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,284
Nice doggy.

650
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,244
Good dog. Stay. Stay!

651
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,727
All right. Don't stay.

652
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,680
[Whimpering]

653
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,889
Uhh-h-h... Yuck!

654
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,606
- [Groans]
- Uhh...

655
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,250

656
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,842
- Better go getJiji before it's too late.
- But I haven't finished yet.

657
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,281
Don't worry. You've done enough.
Now, go on and get him!

658
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,323
[Panting] Thanks!

659
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,367
Hmm.

660
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,411
[Laughter]

661
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,246
- Jeff likes my present more than me!
- [Laughing]

662
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,888
Je<i>ff'</i>s such a funny dog. He
simply adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.!

663
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,929
[Man]
I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy.!

664
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,964
[Older Woman]
He'll be upset when Ket wants
to take it and play with it.

665
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,969
- Sure will.!
- He sure will.!
- That's okay. He can have it.

666
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,401
Just don't forget to send
your aunt a thank-you note.

667
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,409
- [Ket] Okay.
- Ket...

668
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,525
- Okay.!
- Well, I'm glad to seeJeff
excited about something.

669
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,603
He's getting to be such an old dog.

670
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,408
- Yeah. All he does is sleep all day.
- [Laughs] All day.!

671
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,046
Ket, dear, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

672
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,048
- Jeff, shut the door when you're done. Okay?
- [Groans]

673
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,162
- [Jeff Groans]
- Thanks!

674
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,120
- [Gasps] There you are!
- What took you so long?

675
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,165
- I'm sorry!
- My friend, Jeff, helped me escape.

676
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,566
Kiki, if we ask him,
I bet he'll take the stuffed one back inside.

677
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,247
He'll do it. He's a good dog!

678
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,964
- Could you take this in, please?
- [Murmurs]

679
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,729
See. What did I tell ya.!
Isn't he the greatest?

680
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:48,449
Thanks, Jeff, you're a real pal.!
I owe you one.!

681
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,322
- How are ya? Hungry?
- No, I'm tired!

682
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,886
Yeah, me too. I'm very tired.

683
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,048
We're both gonna sleep well tonight!

684
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,441
By the way, that painter
who found the stuffed cat...

685
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,682
told me she wants to do
a drawing with me in it.

686
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,683
- Naked?
- Jiji!

687
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,249
- [Girl] Mommy.!
- [Woman] Hurry up.! Hurry up.!

688
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,328
Over here.!

689
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,450
- Thank you. I'll be right back with your order.
- No garlic, sir.

690
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,850
[Sighs]

691
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,244
Boring.

692
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,523
Hey!

693
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,286
Message for sleepyhead!

694
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,886
Wake up! You're supposed
to be minding the store!

695
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,725
I am, but today this place is boring.

696
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,803
But it always gets busy about this time.

697
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,248
I know that. That's not what I mean.

698
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,289
I mean, my customers.

699
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,842
Jiji, if nobody comes in,
I'm gonna have to eat pancakes forever...

700
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,482
and be fat, fat, fat!

701
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,007
And what am I supposed
to do about that?

702
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,841
- Well, I like pancakes,
provided they're not burned.
- [Groans]

703
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,562
Look, fur ball, when you get
as fat and round as a pancake,
you see if I care.

704
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,609
[Gasps]

705
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,122
Hi! Oh.

706
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,921
Beautiful, isn't she?
They tell me she's a clothes designer.

707
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,402
Her designs may be fabulous,
but her cat's still a snob.

708
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,846
[Rings]

709
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,843
[Gasps]
Oh...

710
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,128
Hello! Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

711
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,282
What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma'am.

712
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,410
'Bout time we got a customer, huh?

713
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,040
Uh, yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up.

714
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,090
- If you'll just...
- Oh-h-h... Gee.

715
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,488
Uh-huh. And the address?
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

716
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,682
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it all.

717
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,646
- And thank you very much, ma'am.
- [Door Opens]

718
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,805
- Hi!
- Hmph!

719
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,646
I'll take this, please. Okay?

720
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,849
Thank you very much. Good afternoon.

721
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,042
Aw, come on.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

722
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,640
Listen. We're gonna
have a huge party at the club tonight.

723
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,327
It's called the Aviation Club.
And we'd really like for you to come.

724
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,528
Here's your invitation.

725
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,807
It's a serious club for kids who are into
flying and aircraft and stuff.

726
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,850
And you know everybody would
be really excited if you came.

727
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,483
- Yes. May I help you, sir?
- They tell me you have a delivery service.

728
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,847
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. Yes,
of course, we can handle it.

729
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,810
It's very urgent this package arrive
as soon as possible.

730
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,400
- That's no problem. Oh...
- Oh...
- Oh...

731
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,927
- Uh, are you all right?
- [Kiki Grunts]

732
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,526
- [Straining] I do this every day.
- Can I help you?

733
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,887
[Grunting]

734
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,806
[Grunting] Uh. Oh-h-h...

735
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,440
Uhh...
[Sighs]

736
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,563
Well, I hope you make up
your mind by 6:00, 'cause that's
when I'll be by to pick ya up.

737
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,007
- See ya! Uh-ah... Uh.
- How much will that be?

738
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,646
Will that be inside
or outside city limits, sir?

739
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,725
- I wrote the address on the box!
- Oh... Oh, the box! Oh, I'm sorry.

740
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,644
Osono.! Osono.!
I've got a big problem.!

741
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,128
I got an invitation to go to a party
at Tombo's flying club!

742
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,129
I'm sure it'll be a great party, Kiki.

743
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,647
No! But my problem is,
what am I going to wear?

744
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,010
Kiki, you haven't got a problem.
You look fine in that.

745
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,369
- Besides, it makes you look
beautiful and mysterious.

01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,251
[Gasps]
Oh.

1204
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,011
- Like it?
- Yes.

1205
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,084
I have to say I became inspired after
the first time we met.

1206
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,609
But... I really haven't got the face right.

1207
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,809
I've been waiting for you to come back
so I can try again.

1208
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,201
- You mean that's me?
- Sure is.

1209
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,601
You know, you'd make
my life a lot easier if you'd model for me.

1210
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,003
But I'm not very beautiful.
What do you want me to do that for?

1211
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,562
[Laughing]

1212
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,651
Come on, Kiki. You have got a great face.
You're very pretty.

1213
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,043
Now, don't you be nervous.
Sit down over here.

1214
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,930
Raise your chin up a little.
Look straight ahead. Now, don't move.

1215
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,926
Painting and magical powers
seem very much the same.

1216
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,929
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.

1217
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,811
You mean it?
Then what? What happens?

1218
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,409
Kiki, please don't move.
It's hard to draw a moving target.

1219
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,167
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

1220
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,961
Now I'm trying to look inside
myself to find out how I did it.

1221
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,325
- But I just can't fiigure it out.
- You know, could be you're
working at it too hard.

1222
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,323
Maybe you shouldjust take a break.

1223
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,051
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...

1224
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,289
Then stop trying.
Take long walks. Look at the scenery.

1225
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,330
Doze off at noon.
Don't even think about flying.

1226
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,881
And then, pretty soon,
you'll be flying again.

1227
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,641
- You think my problems will...
- Go away? That's right.

1228
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,442
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

1229
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,811
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

1230
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,807
I loved to paint so much.
I'd paint all day until
I fell asleep right at my easel.

1231
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,089
And then one day,
for some reason, I just
couldn't paint anymore.

1232
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,569
I tried and tried,
but nothing I did seemed any good.

1233
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:32,089
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before...

1234
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,971
and not very good copies either.

1235
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,560
I just felt like I'd lost my ability.

1236
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,927
That sounds like me.

1237
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:45,042
It's exactly the same,
but then I found the answer.

1238
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,090
You see, I hadn't
fiigured out what or why
I wanted to paint.

1239
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,089
- I had to discover my own style.
- Mm-hmm.

1240
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,647
When you fly, you rely on what's
inside of you, don't you?

1241
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,286
Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit.

1242
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,081
Trusting your spirit!
Yes, yes! That's exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

1243
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,922
That same spirit
is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake.

1244
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,601
But we each need to find
our own inspiration, Kiki.

1245
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,922
Sometimes it's not easy.

1246
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,483
I guess I never gave much thought to why
I wanted to do this.

1247
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,491
I got so caught up
in all the training and stuff.

1248
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,689
Maybe I have to find my own inspiration.

1249
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,289
But am I ever gonna find it?
And is it worth all the trouble?

1250
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,687
Well, for example,
there were quite a few times...

1251
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,929
when I thought of painting something
over that painting.

1252
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,971
- [Kiki] But it ended up being so great.
- So I guess it's worth it.

1253
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,970
Today when I saw you
I thought, I wanna paint!

1254
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,448
- You've got such a great face.
- That's why I came?

1255
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,003
[Laughing]
Hey, well, it's better than
you cleaning my floor again.

1256
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,011
- Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.
- Okay.

1257
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,282
Sorry about taking your bed from you.

1258
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,920
Aw, no problem.

1259
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,771
- So you really think I'll fly again?
- Sure.

1260
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,287
You'll just have to wait
for the right inspiration to come along.

1261
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,926
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

1262
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,168
Mmm!

1263
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:11,079
[Man On TV] And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom...

1264
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,447
[Man On TV] And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom...

1265
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,443
- recently downed in
a spectacular forced landing...
- [Phone Ringing]

1266
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,604
Due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits.

1267
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,286
- Well, it's been repaired.
It is now in fiinal preparation...
- [Osono] Yes?

1268
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,442
Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

1269
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,763
- Kiki! How are you?
- I'm okay. Thanks.

1270
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,322
Well, you take plenty of time coming home.
Oh, and by the way...

1271
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,522
- that older woman you made a delivery for?
- Uh-huh?

1272
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,809
She has another delivery
for you. I said I wasn't sure you could do it.

1273
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:40,522
- She was really very insistent.
What do you think, Kiki?
- Okay.

1274
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,565
Great! Stop there on your way back. Bye.

1275
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,684
Thank you so much for everything.

1276
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,683
Bye.!

1277
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,209
[Birds Chirping]

1278
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,961
[Bell Dinging]

1279
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:08,006
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well, we've been expecting you.

1280
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,049
Thanks.

1281
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,886
[Man On TV] There are less than five
minutes to takeoff now.

1282
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,561
Um, it's very nice
to see you again, ma'am.

1283
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,803
I'm glad you came.
Please excuse me for not standing.

1284
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,167
My legs are bothering me more than usual.

1285
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,169
Barsa, bring the package now.

1286
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,762
Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.

1287
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,720
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad about
lighter-than-air travel.

1288
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,326
I'm the adventuresome type. Mm-hmm.

1289
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,608
[Man On TV]
The local fiire department
and the Coast Guard stand ready.

1290
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,081
- Could you turn it down, please?
- Certainly.

1291
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,168
Would you do me a favor and open the box?

1292
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,163
Yep.

1293
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,404
[Gasps] I don't get it.

1294
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,609
Would you please bring this
to a young delivery girl?

1295
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,728
She was kind to me and a very big help.

1296
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,723
It's my way of saying thank you.

1297
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,724
Ah, yes, and can you find out
when her next birthday is?

1298
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,451
Then I can bake her another one.

1299
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,241
Will you handle this very
special delivery, Kiki?

1300
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,011
[Crying]

1301
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,367
Don't cry.

[Sniffling]

1303
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,207
Of course I will! And maybe
the young girl will want
to know the lady's birthday...

1304
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,364
because she'll be able to give
her a present to repay her!

1305
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,888
- You've got a deal.
- [Both Laughing]

1315
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,440
Midsummer is always
when these winds come.

1316
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,649
- They'll be hitting us any minute.
- Oh!

1317
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,406
Goodness.! It's a strong one.!

1318
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,642
It'll pass quickly. Don't worry.

1319
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,689
- [People Screaming On TV]
- [Barsa] Oh, goody.!

1320
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,929
- It's back on. Look!
- [Screaming]

1321
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,970
Oh, look at that.
It's completely upside down.

1322
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,691
Freak winds blowing in from the sea!

1323
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,690
- It has broken loose from its mooring ropes.
- My, my. How terrible.

1324
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,771
A desperate last-ditch
effort is being made to tie
the dirigible to the ground...

1325
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,922
and keep it from drifting into the air.

1326
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,687
But it's extremely doubtful
whether or not this can actually be done.

1327
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,047
- Oh!
- Oh, no, no.! It's useless.!

1328
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:38,125
The tremendous lifting power
of the helium balloon is lifting
the police patrol car...

1329
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,682
- That's Tombo! That's
my friend hanging on that rope.
- Huh?

1330
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,729
It's being lifted as though it were a toy!

1331
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,043
Oh, no, there's a young boy
hanging onto the cable!

1332
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,242
He's being lifted away
together with the police car!

I'm seeing. The dirigible
is being blown towards town!

has escaped injury...

Tombo! Sir, is there
any word about the boy?

1353
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,847
All I know is that the radio
said that the police car
dropped into a pool.

Please, sir, may I use

that the blimp is heading
directly for the clock tower!

And, look, the young boy
is safe, but he's clutching
that rope for dear life.!
