1
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:20,931
Dear Attilio,
we are all gathered here together...

2
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:25,269
Who's the half-wit who left his car outside?

3
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,691
- That's mine.
- Well you can't leave it there

4
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,943
- Ten Minutes!
- Too long.

5
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:35,612
- Five!
- No more than five.

6
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:41,201
In five minutes I'm going to clamp you!

7
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,204
Gang of loonies, here every bloody night...

8
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:47,457
This woman has something to say to you.

9
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:55,215
Attilio De Giovanni,

10
00:02:55,465 --> 00:03:00,053
I sing your name,
it opens the gates of Paradise.

11
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,473
You will be mine forever,
so grant me gods.

12
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,977
When you kiss me, the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse gallop forth

13
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:10,731
and when I think of your body,
so troubled and vague,

14
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,899
the ground opens beneath my feet.

15
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,319
Your divine manhood ascends to heaven,

16
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,488
you're beautiful!

17
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,491
You sunflower crazed by light,

18
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:25,245
when you raise your eyes you
set the sky ablaze.

19
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:28,665
Friends, see how the Earth,

20
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:32,586
like a mother,
gives suck to her most precious child.

21
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:37,424
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

22
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:41,761
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth burst forth this cry.

23
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,263
I love you.

24
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,769
I want to make love to you now.

25
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:54,858
That's the best line
I ever heard in my life.

26
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,308
Still not here?

27
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:29,893
No.

28
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,147
Here he is!

29
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,486
- On the dot!
- You're 20 minutes late, Daddy!

30
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:43,907
- Yes, 20 minutes on the dot.
- You couldn't find the car?

31
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:47,243
- Hi Carla, everything okay?
- Fine, thanks.

32
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,498
I have a programme and tomorrow
I'll have them at school at 9:00 sharp.

33
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:57,253
At 8:30! - I know. - I'll remind him.
- I'll remember all right!

34
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,922
Mamma doesn't trust you.

35
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:02,425
She doesn't trust me?
She doesn't trust you.

36
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:06,429
- Where are we going?
- A surprise!

37
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,647
- Sure I'm not hurting him?
- Course you are not.

38
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,690
Shall I wash his feet too?

39
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,776
I honestly couldn't care less.

40
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,528
Still the same guy, what's-his-name?

41
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:26,616
Yes, Francesco Verri,
he's not even in my class.

42
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:30,536
- The less I see him the better.
- Is he really that bad?

43
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,458
Very bad, hateful
- Hateful? - Hateful.

44
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:41,381
- In other words, you love him.
- Yes. - A lot? - Lots and lots.

45
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:46,302
- Emilia, Daddy! - Rosa!
Hang on!

46
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:50,556
- The best camel driver ever.
- What a fantastic present!

47
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:54,477
Thank the director here, thanks Camillo.

48
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,979
Now we're in Rome I hope
we'll see you more often.

49
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,402
- Want to have a go? - Me? - You're scared.
- Daddy's not scared of anything.

50
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:08,241
He's all right? - Does he spit?
- No.

51
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:14,831
This is great,
how do you get him to stand up?

52
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,588
It's twice as high as a horse!
No seat belt!

53
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:28,010
How about that then, eh?
Just when I'm on a camel!

54
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,598
Attorney!
You've got the hearing this morning.

55
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,519
For the furniture you shouldn't have sold,

56
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,688
ignoring a summons back in '98...

57
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,857
I can't right now, can we do it tomorrow?

58
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:46,445
You've got to be here within three minutes
or they'll sentence you!

59
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:50,449
Three minutes, make that two!

60
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,453
Down, boy.
Slowly.

61
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:58,124
Ubruk!

62
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,794
How about that?

63
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:05,297
Camels may be smelly, but they're smart.

64
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:25,484
- What's that?
- A bat! Get down, keep down!

65
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:30,239
It's casing the joint,
let's see what it's up to!

66
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,662
Let's get under the bed.

67
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,417
Go away, beastly bat!
Don't say that.

68
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:45,838
You'll offend it if you call it a beastly
bar, you've got to be nice.

69
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:51,427
Oh bat, sweet creature of the night,

70
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,513
you'll find the window on your right!

71
00:07:58,517 --> 00:07:59,435
"What luck!"

72
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,689
That's what poetry's all about,
you called it a beastly bat...

73
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:05,274
It always works.

74
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,027
I was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.

75
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:12,448
A spider climbed in and I said to
it, "Spider dear, get out of here".

76
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:16,118
- It went!
- And if you find a mouse?

77
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:19,538
"Mr. Mouse, leave this house"
then run for it.

78
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:22,374
Will you teach me to write nice poems?

79
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,545
How did you become a poet?
How do you start?

80
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:30,632
I was small, younger than you are now,
eight or nine.

81
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:35,053
I was with my mother,
I loved her so much...

82
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:40,559
We were at Uncle Giustino's
and there was a wood.

83
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:44,062
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

84
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:51,111
A little bird flew by,
singing, flying lower...

85
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,822
and lower.

86
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,828
He landed right here on my shoulder.

87
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:02,748
I swear!

88
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,334
He'd chosen me, of all people.

89
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,921
I was afraid he'd fly away,
so I pretended to be a tree,

90
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,756
I didn't move a muscle.

91
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:20,849
I started to feel my heart beating,
thumping actually.

92
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:26,938
- And then?
- It flew away. I wanted to tell my mother.

93
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,179
"Mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...

94
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,329
landed on my shoulder and
sat there for an hour. "

95
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:46,708
She said, "I thought something awful
happened" and carried on chatting.

96
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,711
That was mean of Granny,
didn't she like birds?

97
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:53,465
No, Granny wasn't mean,
and she did like little birds.

98
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,468
It wasn't her, it was me.

99
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,971
It was my fault for not telling
the story properly,

100
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,391
for not making her feel what I'd felt.

101
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:06,061
I was so upset I told myself,

102
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:10,398
"There must be people whose job
it is to use the right words,

103
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,818
put things in a way...

104
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:16,613
who when their hearts beats,
can get other people's hearts to beat. "

105
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,324
That day I decided to become a poet.

106
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,746
- My heart beat.
- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.

107
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:28,250
If the words aren't right, nothing's right.

108
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,754
If I say now, "go to sleep",
those are the right words.

109
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:36,549
- And if another bat comes in?
- Off to bed with you.

110
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,177
I've got to get you to school
at 9:00 tomorrow.

111
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:44,766
At 8:30!
I know.

112
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:53,024
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passions,

113
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,945
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry,

114
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:58,446
I love you!

115
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:04,452
My love, I want to stay
with you here forever,

116
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,371
for all eternity.

117
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,374
Don't you have to take
the girls to school at 8:30?

118
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,503
Give me five minutes, be right back.

119
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:24,472
You don't remember
where I left the car, do you?

120
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,643
- Same bloody car parked outside...
- It's mine, I'll move it.

121
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,812
Five minutes.

122
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:36,568
Come along, don't hang around,
take your time.

123
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:40,071
Don't start writing love poems,

124
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,408
they're the hardest,
wait till you're at least 80.

125
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:49,581
Write about something else, the sea,
the wind, a radiator,

126
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:53,835
a tram running late,
no one thing's more poetic than another.

127
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,921
Poetry isn't without, it's within.

128
00:11:57,171 --> 00:12:00,508
Don't ask what's poetic or true,
look in the mirror, poetry's you.

129
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:05,013
Dress your poems up,
choose your words carefully,

130
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:09,517
be selective, some things you need
eight months to find one word.

131
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,854
Beauty started when people began to choose,

132
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:14,188
since Adam and Eve.

133
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:19,110
You know how long Eve took
to pick the right fig leaf?

134
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:24,949
How about this one? She stripped bare
all the fig trees in Paradise.

135
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,954
Fall in love,
if you don't love it's all dead!

136
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:32,123
Fall in love and
everything will come to life.

137
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,627
Squander your joy,
dissipate your cheerfulness.

138
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:39,797
be sad and silent with enthusiasm,

139
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,301
hurl your happiness into people's faces.

140
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:47,472
And how? Let me look at my notes,
I've forgotten.

141
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:51,809
That's what you should do.
I can't read 'em.

142
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:57,732
To convey happiness you must be happy,

143
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:01,152
to convey pain you must to happy.

144
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:08,659
Be happy, you must suffer! Don't be scared
of suffering, the whole world suffers!

145
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:13,915
If you don't have the means, don't worry,

146
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:16,334
only one thing is necessary
to write poetry, everything.

147
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:20,755
Don't try to be modern,
it's the most old-fashioned thing there is.

148
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:24,675
If a line doesn't come
to you in this position,

149
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:28,262
chuck yourself on the ground like this!

150
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:32,933
It's lying down that you see the sky.

151
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:34,769
Why didn't I do that before?

152
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:39,190
What are you looking at?
Poets don't look, they see.

153
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:41,275
Make words obey you.

154
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,946
If the world "wall"
doesn't take any notice,

155
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,866
don't use it again for eight years,
that'll teach it.

156
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,951
What's that? No idea!

157
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,621
That's true beauty, like those lines there,

158
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,207
that I want left there forever.

159
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:59,376
Erase it all, we've got to start,
the lesson's over.

160
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,796
See you Wednesday... Thursday.

161
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,632
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

162
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,139
The room's all yours, Professor Browning.

163
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,892
Thank you Signor De Giovanni.

164
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,900
Please don't, I'll do it.

165
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:27,071
Still having problems with the principal?

166
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:32,409
Lots, about the course,
I'd like to discuss it with you.

167
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,748
Can we sleep together tonight?

168
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,002
Nancy!

169
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,005
Last time we slept together it snowed,

170
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:48,425
it was the coldest
most beautiful day in January.

171
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:58,018
- Lets sleep together.
- The kids'll be back.

172
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:02,523
It's laying down that you see the sky.
Don't you like me anymore?

173
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,784
I had such a wonderful time with you,

174
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:16,787
why did you want to cut it so short?

175
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:20,040
When I fell in love with you...

176
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,044
I fell in love with you
because you fell in love with me.

177
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,964
And a wonderful fall it was.

178
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,966
What are you doing this evening?

179
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:33,637
- Nothing.
- Let's sleep together tonight.

180
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:39,476
Attilio, we've gotta go.
Hi Ermanno.

181
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,062
Do you remember where I left the car?

182
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:46,400
- Near the entrance.
- Thank you, Nancy.

183
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:52,072
Knock-knock, I look through the peep-hole,
all I see is hair.

184
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:57,911
I open the door and a bear says,
"Hello Ermanno, give me a Kiss. "

185
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,163
I ask, "Who are you?"

186
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,500
and she, "Don't you recognize me, my son?"

187
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,502
No!

188
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:07,838
And she starts crying.

189
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:12,342
I say, "I'm sorry, Mamma",
and put my arms around her,

190
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:15,512
then this morning
when I woke up I felt so happy.

191
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,683
- Your mother was a bear?
- I'd just never realized it before.

192
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,437
I kept dreaming about vultures,
hyenas, crocodiles...

193
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:28,191
Good for you.
I always have the same dream.

194
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,026
The same animal?

195
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,281
No, no animal at all. I'm at a
kind of wedding with lots of people,

196
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:38,785
and then in she walks,
the woman I'm crazy about.

197
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:42,122
She ends up telling me,
"I want to make love with you, kiss me. "

198
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:46,710
So what do you do?
I pass out.

199
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,796
- It's wonderful.
- What kind of animal is she?

200
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:55,552
It's her, the love of my life.
What kind of a dream is that?

201
00:16:55,886 --> 00:17:01,308
It's like saying I like cherries
and in my dream I eat cherries.

202
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,477
It denotes a primitive subconscious.

203
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:08,064
- A Dream that won't come true?
- Come true!

204
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:12,068
If I like a woman,
I dream about her in a symbolic fashion,

205
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,989
she's a penguin bearing
the mythological baggage of penguins,

206
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,993
or she's a iguana, that's a mature dream.

207
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,912
- You think?
- What, me? Sigmund Freud thinks so.

208
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:25,999
Freud.

209
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,251
Dream about an animal?

210
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:36,009
Right on time, just starting.

211
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,227
Love thou thy dream,
all base love scorning.

212
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:50,273
Love thou the wind, and here take warning.

213
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,528
That dreams alone can truly be.
For this dream I come to thee.

214
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:01,785
He's the greatest living Arab poet.
Beautiful that poem, eh?

215
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,078
- Rips you apart.
- Sure does.

216
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:07,540
You'll hear the rest.

217
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,794
Fuad concluded with a homage to one
of his inspirational mentors.

218
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,756
Fuad, in these difficult days
for his home country,

219
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:18,301
decided to leave France
and go back to Baghdad.

220
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:23,723
Let's hope this senseless war
never breaks out.

221
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:26,643
Let's thank Fuad, goodbye to all.

222
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,648
Damn, I think it's over!

223
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:35,318
- Shall we go eat?
- I want to go and say hello to him.

224
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,986
Fuad, remember that name.

225
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:41,366
In four, five years' time,
he'll get the Nobel Prize.

226
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:45,078
It'll be a wrench to leave
Paris after 18 years...

227
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:48,998
- When will you go back to Baghdad?
- As soon as possible.

228
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,043
How much time do you need
to finish the book?

229
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:56,214
The publishers want it in September,
but I refuse to rush.

230
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,674
I'd like to spend at least
a week with you.

231
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,009
We'll find the time.

232
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:03,346
Goodbye, see you soon.

233
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:06,933
Attilio!

234
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:08,976
- Fuad!
- Where were you?

235
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:14,107
Back there, I got here a bit late
but I enjoyed the whole thing.

236
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:19,153
You've got fans here,
when I quoted you at the start

237
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:22,031
they all cheered, did you hear it?

238
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:27,870
Vittoria! Your book. Oh, thank you.

239
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,129
I'm losing my mind.

240
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:09,745
- Do you have time for dinner?
- Let's have dinner together.

241
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,956
Then I'll leave you to it.

242
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,584
Goodbye.

243
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:19,588
Dear Attilio, it's as
if no time has passed at all.

244
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,008
Attilio?

245
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,596
Fuad, thanks, I'll say goodbye then.
Goodbye, Fuad, goodbye.

246
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:31,100
- When are you leaving?
- Right after dinner.

247
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:41,152
Plenty of time! Love you. - What
about dinner? - Sure, any time.

248
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:45,197
- You coming to eat then?
- Sure, any time.

249
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:25,154
- I came here to have tea by myself.
- So did I.

250
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:30,326
We can have it together! Two teas.

251
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:35,998
Mr. Poet Attilio De Giovanni,
there's absolutely no question.

252
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,585
I don't want to disturb you, heaven forbid.

253
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:44,173
Since we don't see each other often...

254
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,683
the two of us, not immediately...

255
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,278
Why do you keep pestering me? Haven't
you got anything else to think about?

256
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:11,033
Me think about you?
Whoever thinks about you?

257
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,204
Someone said they even saw you in Verona!

258
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:21,460
No, wait!
What's that? Me, in Verona?

259
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,712
- Who told you that?
- Settembrini.

260
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,131
He saw you outside my hotel for hours.

261
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,468
Listen, I was not in Verona.

262
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:32,888
Why on Earth should
I care if you're in Verona

263
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,390
or Piazza dell'Esquilino?

264
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:38,143
I don't believe it, you were there too?

265
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,981
I never know where you are
and I don't care.

266
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:51,573
Why don't you come to my place?

267
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:55,077
To see where I live,

268
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,747
sleep, read, write, wash the dishes.

269
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:04,086
Come on, let's walk round Rome,
you can come over and...

270
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:06,505
We can be together.

271
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,508
Yes? Huh?

272
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:13,595
You tell me who's speaking, you called me.

273
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:18,683
Valeri who?
Yes, I was at Fuad's, why?

274
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:25,273
In fact, this jacket isn't mine.
This phone isn't either!

275
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:30,695
This jacket is five times too big,
yours must be too small.

276
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:32,447
Pay more attention!

277
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:36,034
He took my jacket instead of his.

278
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:41,206
I can't, I'm in a meeting.

279
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,959
Yes, okay.

280
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:50,465
I'm in the bar round the corner,
but right away, I'm busy.

281
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:23,081
Signor Valeri, over here,
how did you mistake my jacket for yours?

282
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:26,918
- It's three sizes larger!
- Yes in fact, I didn't...

283
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:31,673
Signor Valeri mistook my jacket for his.

284
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:35,760
- Didn't you realize it was tight?
- I didn't put it on.

285
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,597
Now I know why you didn't realize it.

286
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:42,851
All's well that ends well, goodbye.

287
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:49,524
Some people are so scatter-brained.
He hardly knew what to say,

288
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:53,027
at one point he said, I love you,

289
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:59,200
I dream of you every night, let's
get married. What would you have said?

290
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,036
- The check, please.
- No, let me.

291
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,038
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

292
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,541
Vittoria!

293
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,712
How much is it?

294
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,214
Keep the change.

295
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,967
The tea had absolutely no taste.

296
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,568
I want to see where you wash your dishes,

297
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:36,237
take me home.

298
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,625
"SURPRISE!"

299
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:38,025
"I've walked down millions of
stairs holding your arm,

300
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:41,445
now you're no longer here,
there's a void beneath every step. "

301
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:46,533
- Dammit, I tripped...
- Serves you right.

302
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,620
We're here, this is me.

303
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:54,792
I trip on that wretched step every day.

304
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,710
Go ahead.

305
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:08,472
Please do come in, Vittoria.

306
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:13,310
Here we are,
Vittoria and I together at home...

307
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:17,314
I always leave the candles on.

308
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:21,819
And the television.

309
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:29,326
I always like to have things ready
in case Vittoria comes...

310
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:33,664
I'll go make some coffee,

311
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:37,918
I'll make you some too,
it won't take a sec...

312
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:46,093
What's the matter?
Nothing, I just burnt myself slightly.

313
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:50,931
- The coffee is ready?
- I make it in case Vittoria comes.

314
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,432
Have a seat.

315
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:59,356
It was coming to the boil as we came in.
Here. I always like to tell the truth.

316
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,526
seeing you sitting here
at night alone with me,

317
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:06,530
drinking coffee, it makes my heart race.

318
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,284
You're so beautiful!

319
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,705
Women are so beautiful
when they're about to make love.

320
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:20,127
Why not live together
for the rest of our lives? It's easy.

321
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:23,130
As easy as seeing a tiger in the snow.

322
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:25,799
When I do, we will be together forever.

323
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,553
Off to Tibet with us then,
it always snows on tigers there.

324
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:31,304
But we live in Rome.

325
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:36,560
Snow falling on a tiger in Rome!
I get it.

326
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,148
Please stay and sleep with me.

327
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,651
You've got a man here who loves you.

328
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:49,739
A man who loves you is
a sight worth seeing, isn't it?

329
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,161
It's a cold, grey world outside, stay here.

330
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:57,914
We can have a nice hot bath together.

331
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:02,085
I'll dry you,
I'll wrap you in a blue bathrobe.

332
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:07,507
You know what you are, Blondie!
You're on big son of a bitch!

333
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:16,016
All this, every evening for me,

334
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,520
you've forgotten one thing though,
the champagne.

335
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:28,111
Explain the rest later,
but I want to know how you did that.

336
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:31,531
You know, tricks of the trade.

337
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,700
But just as I said "champagne".

338
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:37,454
A bit of luck.
Here, Vittoria.

339
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,961
I want to do with you
what the spring does with cherries.

340
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,213
Now, now, now.

341
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:49,716
You haven't said anything about the house.

342
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:54,054
I'd move this table,
I'll finish my champagne then go...

343
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:58,558
and your books, don't try and stop me,
shouldn't be on the floor,

344
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,226
it's a bit too bohemian.

345
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:04,481
There's a time for everything,
peach trees don't bloom in December.

346
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,733
This green wall's hideous.

347
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,486
I long to feel your arms around me.

348
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:13,990
This floor... but I can't...
is office-like.

349
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:17,410
I'm not sure if I should stay or go.

350
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:20,747
What'll I do? You decide.

351
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:25,084
My compliments on your apartment.

352
00:31:26,503 --> 00:31:31,591
I think I know what you're getting
at about the apartment,

353
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:34,260
I think this is the best solution.

354
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,432
As far as the floor's concerned,
let's leave it as it is.

355
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:42,852
About the table,
I agree with you, I'd move it,

356
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,773
and make more space,
I'd put two armchairs there.

357
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:52,111
For the fittings, I know
a carpenter downstairs, so that's sorted.

358
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:57,450
The floor we said leave as it,
the ceiling isn't great...

359
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:00,536
I wasn't really planning
on staying here long,

360
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:07,543
I'm only renting and
I can't remember when my lease ends.

361
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:12,632
All I know is
that tonight'll never come back.

362
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:17,470
There's just one word
on the great clock of time, now.

363
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,973
But you're right about one thing, my love.

364
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:23,476
That green wall has got to go.

365
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,572
Where are you going?

366
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:41,327
I'm going to put on the blue bathrobe.

367
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:44,831
If only you knew what I have inside of me,

368
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:51,337
fleets of minesweepers dropping
death-charges into my chest,

369
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:56,342
torpedoing my thorax,
circumnavigating my heart.

370
00:32:56,926 --> 00:33:00,012
Now I can tell you, I was Verona,

371
00:33:00,263 --> 00:33:05,017
and in Piazza dell'Esquilino.
Two and a quarter hours!

372
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:07,436
I'm ashamed to say,

373
00:33:08,104 --> 00:33:11,691
I was in Catania too, I never told you.

374
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,862
I dream of you every night,
always the same dream, always you.

375
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:21,200
I see you everywhere,
my whole life hears you.

376
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:25,621
In all creation
I feel the beating of your heart.

377
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:29,709
You these books,
the bubbles in my champagne,

378
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:33,963
you're the flame of these candles,
these trees,

379
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,465
you're down the street...

380
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:40,886
Vittoria?

381
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:43,055
Vittoria!

382
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:48,811
I'll fix her, when I catch her!

383
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,813
Vittoria, I'll sue you!

384
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,066
I'll take you to court!

385
00:33:54,817 --> 00:34:01,407
Vittoria! Vittoria!
Wait!

386
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,075
Vittoria!

387
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,584
Stop!

388
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,252
Vittoria!

389
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:20,092
Stop this tram!
Driver, stop!

390
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:23,762
Vittoria!

391
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,432
You know what you are?

392
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:31,603
You're one big daughter of a bitch!

393
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,445
It's raining!

394
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:43,615
It rains on the city,

395
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:47,369
like tears in my heart.

396
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,542
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

397
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,631
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry.

398
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:03,635
"Kiss me!"
Please my love.

399
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,972
I said kiss me.

400
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:09,475
Attilio. Attilio!

401
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:16,148
It's her, the symbolism is so obvious!
I know, I guessed it right away

402
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:18,817
but I'm not kissing a kangaroo,
it's revolting.

403
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:22,404
Revolting? Goodbye then,
you'll never see me again.

404
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,491
Vittoria!

405
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,161
I wasn't talking to you.

406
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,955
Vittoria!
Stop!

407
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,253
What a coincidence!
Vittoria!

408
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:42,591
I was walking along thinking of
everything except you...

409
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,844
Vittoria!
What are you doing, leaving?

410
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,096
Okay, I get the message.

411
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:51,099
Since I know you're leaving,
I just came to tell you this.

412
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:56,688
It's all over between us,
you'll never see me again.

413
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,566
Goodbye forever!

414
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:09,117
Sorry, I forgot to tell you something.

415
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:15,290
Oh Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

416
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,461
Peace! Peace!

417
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,465
You tell him,
I can't in half an hour, Attorney.

418
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:27,469
Go to prison? But I'm in the right!

419
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,306
- This is an act of violence.
- War's an act of violence.

420
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,018
Hanging out the peace
banner never hurt anyone.

421
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:41,816
I can't in half an hour. Professor! Yes?

422
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:52,494
Mamma Mia, what a bang!
Almost killed me!

423
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,037
What the...

424
00:36:56,608 --> 00:37:03,406
Stop hopping about like that.
Will you please stop hopping?

425
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:06,993
Vittoria, I will not get into your pouch,

426
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,663
I won't fit, be a good girl.

427
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:15,001
Don't kiss me,
I know it's you but stop it.

428
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:19,297
Behave, Vittoria.

429
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,510
Vittoria...

430
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:50,453
Yes, speaking.

431
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:52,372
Who is it?

432
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:54,123
Who?

433
00:37:54,958 --> 00:38:02,465
Fuad, what a nice surprise!
I'm glad, how are you?

434
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,302
What's wrong?

435
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,391
Vittoria? Of course.

436
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:15,478
She's there with you, right?
She talked about me, eh?

437
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:19,148
What happened?

438
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,329
Is she dead?

439
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:37,166
I don't know,
I just came back from the hospital.

440
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,753
The doctor is afraid she won't make it
through the night.

441
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:44,799
She's alive but there's nothing to be done,

442
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:47,510
We've got no medicine or supplies here.

443
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,347
We'd nearly finished out work,

444
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:56,185
we were walking in Baghdad,
there was an explosion, a building fell.

445
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:58,271
What?

446
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:03,943
I don't know, when I opened my eyes
she was lying there unconscious.

447
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:08,029
What's the hospital called?

448
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:13,159
I'll be there right away, see you soon.

449
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:14,952
See you soon in Baghdad.

450
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,539
I'll call you as soon as I arrive.

451
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,558
Carla, it's me, I know, sorry but...

452
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,393
Everything's fine, don't worry.

453
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,979
They're both fine, they're asleep.

454
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,648
I've got to go away right now.

455
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:46,484
I'm not sure when, please don't start.

456
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,070
I've got to go, I don't know when.

457
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:54,242
Come early tomorrow morning,
I'll leave the keys out,

458
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,246
you look after Rosa and Emilia.

459
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:11,350
- Good morning.
- Yes?

460
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,022
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

461
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,150
What?

462
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,322
I said I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

463
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:29,994
- Maybe I misheard.
- What's the problem? Not again.

464
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,747
- I am at the airport, aren't I?
- Of course.

465
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,082
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad please.

466
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,503
Perhaps you haven't heard,
but there's a war in Iraq.

467
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,132
There are no flights,
there's no longer an airport!

468
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,593
- I have to go to Baghdad.
- You can't!

469
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,845
There must be an airport near Baghdad!

470
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,723
Give me a ticket for
an airport near Baghdad

471
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:56,938
then I'll take a taxi, boat, or walk,
that's up to me.

472
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,940
- Give me the nearest airport
- Nearest to what?

473
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,360
"Baghdad!"
Where do you want to go?

474
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:08,282
No, just wanted to know...
no time to waste.

475
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,620
You're very kind, extremely kind, goodbye.

476
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:15,748
Everything okay?

477
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,459
A ticket for Baghdad!

478
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:21,462
Was he joking?

479
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:52,243
Hi Eleonora, what's for dinner?

480
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:55,996
They sent the certificate back,
you've got to call them.

481
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,501
- How are you? You look tired.
- The usual stuff...

482
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:05,089
Apart from this morning
some guy comes in all agitated

483
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,508
asking for a ticket to Baghdad!

484
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:10,344
Imagine, wanting to go to Baghdad
that game day!

485
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,515
A ticket for Baghdad? What was he like?
Quite ordinary looking.

486
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:18,018
Like that guy there.

487
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:22,982
That guy there unloading
the crates in Iraq.

488
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,445
It's the splitting image!

489
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:31,532
Eleonora!

490
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:33,409
That's him!

491
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,120
Will you help me drain the pasta?

492
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,543
How the hell did he manage that?

493
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:48,382
No, these stay here in Basra,
those are got Baghdad.

494
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,385
Where's Gauzzelli?

495
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:54,263
- What is it?
- We've got to leave for Baghdad.

496
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:57,891
- We haven't gotten the okay.
- Yes we have, from Mrs. Serao.

497
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,145
- Come on, let's go now.
- Start it up!

498
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:08,735
- Mrs. Serao! - Finally found you.
You're a marvelous, wonderful person.

499
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:13,657
Sorry if I pressed you,
but I'm so happy to be here!

500
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:22,666
Thank you, Doctor,
Sorry if I seemed doubtful in Rome.

501
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,254
So many people want to help
but just end up wasting our time,

502
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:30,257
but we can't get enough of
surgeons like you.

503
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:33,594
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, goodbye.

504
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:36,221
Let's go!

505
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:49,609
- Can't you go a bit faster?
- No.

506
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:53,530
- Shall I drive?
- Why don't you take a nap?

507
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,547
What's the problem?

508
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:14,801
Doctor Guazzelli, why've we stopped?

509
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:18,054
We just got the order to go back to Basra.

510
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:20,891
Back to Basra?

511
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:27,314
You crazy?
Stop, counter-orders!

512
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,566
- How far is it to Baghdad?
- About 100 kilometers.

513
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,653
Wait, stop.

514
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:37,657
I've got to get to Baghdad.

515
00:44:37,824 --> 00:44:40,160
- But it's all desert.
- I've got to get to Baghdad.

516
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:44,080
Thanks, I'll tell Guazzelli, don't worry.

517
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:46,374
Go, go!

518
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,175
Fuad, it's Attilio.

519
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,763
I'm glad you called,
I've been trying to reach you all day.

520
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,434
I've found a way to get you
to Iraq in a few days.

521
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,938
- I'm in Baghdad!
- What do you mean?

522
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:37,944
There are two huge hands
holding two scimitars.

523
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:40,613
- Where's the hospital?
- I don't believe it!

524
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:42,698
I'll take you, don't move.

525
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,299
Fuad!

526
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:03,553
You took your time!

527
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,057
- How are you?
- Fine. How'd you get to Baghdad?

528
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:12,478
By bus.
Where's the hospital? Let's go.

529
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,512
We're off.
Come along.

530
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:50,933
- Where is she?
- Over here.

531
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:57,356
- That's odd...
- What? She was here last night.

532
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,529
- I'm afraid it's a bad sign.
- You're joking!

533
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:07,199
It's a good sign, they've probably moved
her to a convalescent ward.

534
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,288
Let's ask, there must be a doctor,
a surgeon, a sister a brother...

535
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:16,876
I'll try and find someone, don't worry.
I'm quite happy.

536
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:21,297
It's a very good sign,
I'm happy she's recovered,

537
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,549
I'll go look for her...

538
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:04,089
Vittoria?

539
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:08,177
Vittoria.

540
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:10,262
See who it is?

541
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:13,265
See who it is?

542
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:21,690
What a coincidence!
You in Baghdad, too!

543
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:30,449
With that blanket on your face you seemed...
but you're breathing!

544
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:34,536
You're looking great.
Really great.

545
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,791
They told me you weren't well,
I got a bit scared.

546
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:49,718
What was that?

547
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:54,556
Thought you said something.

548
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:00,646
You know...

549
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:07,152
Fuad's gone to talk to this doctor
who is just great.

550
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:15,577
The whole of Baghdad's talking about him.
I said, "Who is he?"

551
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:21,416
The hospital's empty, he's cured everyone.

552
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:28,340
I've spoken to him, I'll have you
home in a couple of days, I promise.

553
00:50:28,674 --> 00:50:30,759
Found her.

554
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:36,431
Bed stuck away at an angle,
a blanket covering her face,

555
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,432
I thought she was dead.

556
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:40,519
The doctor doesn't speak Italian,
I've spoken to him.

557
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:46,441
- The prospects aren't good.
- Why? Great colour in her cheeks...

558
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:51,279
Look, Fuad's here, see?
She's all right.

559
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:58,370
She's better, she can leave now?
She's better?

560
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:04,376
What did he say?
There's no hope.

561
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:10,382
Are you nuts, in front of her?
She can hear every word.

562
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,884
So she's better, I knew it.

563
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:16,805
He said there's no hope,
but he didn't say she's dead.

564
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,807
- Is she dead or alive?
- She's alive but...

565
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:22,227
What does "she's alive but" mean?
She's alive!

566
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:29,067
Couldn't be better!
What needs to be done? Ask him.

567
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:36,908
- What did he say?
- Vittoria has a cerebral edema.

568
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:42,330
She's not reacting,
we've got no drugs to treat edemas,

569
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:47,168
this means
she'll die soon.

570
00:51:49,587 --> 00:51:53,675
Unless we find the right medicine,

571
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:58,346
she takes it, the edema goes
and she'll be up and about.

572
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:01,599
How long do we have to find the medicine?

573
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:07,772
- There must be a pharmacy open!
- There are no medicines in Baghdad!

574
00:52:08,022 --> 00:52:09,357
I got that, but...

575
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:13,611
Ask him how long she's got
without this medicine,

576
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:18,783
30, 34, 47 minutes,
get him to tell you something.

577
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,961
- What's he say?
- It's all written here.

578
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:33,965
He wrote the name of the medicine?
How long have we got?

579
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:36,384
No more than four hours.

580
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:42,974
Four hours!
More than enough!

581
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:45,727
Give us time to have a coffee too!

582
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:50,315
Let's go get it, four hours...

583
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:53,735
Let me say goodbye to Victoria.

584
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,322
The doctor said you could come with us,

585
00:52:57,488 --> 00:53:00,491
but I reckon more bed rest won't hurt you,

586
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:05,079
get your strength back.
Then I'll find you a better spot,

587
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,667
I saw a fancy spot under the stairs
where no one comes by.

588
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:13,671
Goodbye.
Okay, Fuad.

589
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:20,344
Here's one open.

590
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:23,681
Pharmacist! Anybody there?

591
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,935
Clients!

592
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:32,023
This one's closed too, now what?

593
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,026
Maybe there's one there.

594
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:36,777
Look!

595
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:41,365
How do you say in Arabic?
Bazaar, they've got everything.

596
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:45,786
Give me the prescription, thanks.
They'll have everything there.

597
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:52,376
Good morning, I'm Italian.
Do you have this medicine?

598
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:57,715
I need that. I look around, maybe you have
the medicine and maybe you don't remember...

599
00:53:57,965 --> 00:54:04,221
...in this confusion. I have a look.
Where is medicine?

600
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:06,557
Medicine?

601
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,226
Come along.

602
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:11,646
You don't have...

603
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:15,733
They've got Etruscan vases,
diving equipment,

604
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:20,071
motor-cycle helmets,
and they don't have any medicine!

605
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:24,408
- It's no use, this medicine...
- What does it do?

606
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:26,660
- It's an anti-edema.
- Let's get it made!

607
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:31,916
- Who by? - Don't you know a pharmacist?
- A pharmacist? - You're from Baghdad!

608
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:44,178
I know one!
Al-Giumeili, an old friend of my father's,

609
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:47,014
a formidable man.

610
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,203
- Is he home?
- Yes.

611
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:13,457
- I told you so, come on.
- She's gone to ask permission.

612
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:16,293
He's extremely old,
I wonder if he remembers me.

613
00:55:16,794 --> 00:55:18,545
My father used to hold him up
as an example

614
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:21,632
of the most noble man he ever knew.

615
00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:25,469
- Why, what did he do?
- He as a real poet.

616
00:55:25,919 --> 00:55:29,006
He was young, fell in love
with a woman and married her.

617
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,925
A few years later while he was
fighting in some war,

618
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:36,763
he heard his wife and contracted smallpox
and had been disfigured.

619
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:44,688
So Al-Giumeili said, "My eyes hurt".
And then, "I've gone blind".

620
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:49,526
When his wife died, 12 years later,
he opens his eyes again.

621
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,781
So as not to upset his wife,

622
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,367
he pretended to be blind for 12 years?

623
00:55:58,452 --> 00:56:02,456
Every person is a chasm,
it makes you dizzy to look down...

624
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:04,875
He never explained to anybody

625
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:11,882
I'll go and talk to him
first then I'll call you.

626
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:35,322
For me?

627
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,326
It's a present for me?

628
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:42,496
It's a beautiful present.

629
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:48,084
Come. -
Bye. - Bye.

630
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:02,015
Attilio.
Hello.

631
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:06,937
Thank you.

632
00:57:09,356 --> 00:57:13,360
What did he say?
Can we make it in three hours?

633
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,112
I'm sorry,

634
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:19,449
he can't make the medicine we need,

635
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:22,369
he hasn't got any of the equipment,

636
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:28,708
he needs mannitol, cortisone, and
various other things. It's not possible.

637
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:34,381
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

638
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:39,302
Mannitol, cortisone, what are they?
Can you tell him something else?

639
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:42,639
Tell him in Arabic, fifty years ago

640
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:45,558
there was no mannitol or cortisone.

641
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:49,562
When someone got a bump on the head,

642
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:52,565
people did say, "He's got an edema,
he'll be dead soon"...

643
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:03,660
So what did he,
Iraq's foremost scientist, do?

644
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,921
- We tried gastric treatment.
- What did they pump into the stomach?

645
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:18,925
Glycerine.

646
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:24,597
Glycerine.
I've heard of that, you see.

647
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:29,769
Where do we buy it?
Forget it, I know everything's closed...

648
00:58:29,936 --> 00:58:35,441
Can we make some glycerine
and feed it into her stomach?

649
00:58:45,368 --> 00:58:47,036
There's a way.

650
00:58:49,122 --> 00:58:50,289
Really!

651
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,292
He's trying to remember.

652
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:04,387
What time is it? How long do we have?

653
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:20,736
Al-Giumeili my old friend,
find me this glycerine.

654
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,492
I know you can,
otherwise she's going to die.

655
00:59:26,742 --> 00:59:27,660
If she dies,

656
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:33,082
they can close
this whole show of a world...

657
00:59:33,332 --> 00:59:38,504
They can cart if off, unscrew the stars,

658
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:43,759
roll up the sky and put it on a truck,

659
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:48,531
they can turn off this sunlight
I love so much,

660
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:50,449
you know why I love it so much?

661
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,369
Because I love her
when the sun shines on her.

662
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:59,458
They can take everything away,
these carpets, columns, houses,

663
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:04,547
sand, wind, frogs, ripe watermelons,

664
01:00:05,297 --> 01:00:09,969
hail, seven in the evening,
May, June, July,

665
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:15,224
basil, bees, the sea, courgettes...

666
01:00:16,058 --> 01:00:18,227
Courgettes, Al-Giumeili!

667
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:20,229
Get me this glycerine!

668
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,921
- What's he say?
- Butter, palm oil, olive oil.

669
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:56,432
The base is soda,
but ashes will do, fat and ashes.

670
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,435
It might work, I've got it all,

671
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,187
we can do it in a couple of hours.

672
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:09,611
A thousand thanks, Al-Giumeili.

673
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,621
Thank you.

674
01:01:26,962 --> 01:01:29,548
I reckon it's ready, come here!

675
01:01:29,798 --> 01:01:32,551
- A little more ash.
- No, we've got quite enough.

676
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:36,138
- Doesn't need any more.
- Just another spoonful.

677
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:37,723
Thank you, Fuad, for everything.

678
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,892
I'll do this, go have a rest.

679
01:01:40,058 --> 01:01:43,061
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little, in this chair.

680
01:01:43,312 --> 01:01:47,149
Al-giumeili intimidated me a bit.
Was that his daughter?

681
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:50,485
She's the last wife of his son Ali.

682
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:56,325
He was murdered six months ago,
he was a real free spirit.

683
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:02,080
Saddam Hussein didn't like free spirits.
Poor Al-Giumeili.

684
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:12,007
Time has left me nothing to
sustain my eyes and my heart.

685
01:02:13,258 --> 01:02:19,931
Come on, Fuad, if this stuff works
we'll have dinner and celebrate.

686
01:02:33,695 --> 01:02:36,031
Good, eh?

687
01:02:36,281 --> 01:02:40,702
It's home made, hand-made by me and Fuad,

688
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:43,705
no preservatives, colorings, chemicals,

689
01:02:43,955 --> 01:02:48,293
just like home-made tagliatelle,
"butter please, oil please,

690
01:02:48,543 --> 01:02:50,796
chop some onions, put in garlic",

691
01:02:51,046 --> 01:02:56,134
really delicious,
Fuad and I both had second helpings.

692
01:02:56,384 --> 01:03:01,306
Fuad wanted a third but I said,
"No, leave some for Vittoria!"

693
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:07,562
You're looking well, I tidied you up...
Really well.

694
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,150
I was forgetting, look what I've got!

695
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:15,570
Hang on, close your eyes.

696
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:18,323
Close 'em!

697
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:22,577
Open your eyes.

698
01:03:22,827 --> 01:03:25,079
Open!

699
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,751
I'll hang it here, okay?

700
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:36,091
How's that? I banged my head!

701
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:39,594
I'll be getting an edema next!
It's full of flies here!

702
01:03:39,928 --> 01:03:42,514
You like it? Look.

703
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,935
Take a quick look,
tell me whether it's okay or not.

704
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:52,107
One second...

705
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,131
Did you move?
I thought before you were like that...

706
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,136
She looks worse than ever to me.

707
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,474
That brew didn't do much good.

708
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:35,233
I'll go have a word with the doctor,
a personal matter,

709
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,485
be right back.

710
01:04:40,738 --> 01:04:42,073
Doctor?

711
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:47,078
Doctor, excuse me, doctor.
Excuse me, but ahh...

712
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,416
...she seems worse.
The glycerine didn't help.

713
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:52,667
- Didn't help at all?
- No.

714
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:56,838
Without it she'd be dead already.
It's a miracle she's still alive.

715
01:04:57,005 --> 01:05:00,925
Now we must wait and hope
that the medicines arrive soon.

716
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:07,181
Doctor, if I can lend a hand,
if you need anything I...

717
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:11,436
Thank you, I will get to her
as soon as possible. Yes...

718
01:05:19,277 --> 01:05:22,029
Hey, what are you doing?

719
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:32,874
Doctor! Who the hell is he? Where do
you think you're going? Who are you?

720
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:36,294
What have you done to her?

721
01:05:36,627 --> 01:05:41,382
Doctor, he was leaning over Vittoria
like this. What did he want?

722
01:05:42,383 --> 01:05:43,718
This, I suspect.

723
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:47,555
Vittoria's chain.

724
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:50,892
You have thieves in the hospital?

725
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:57,231
I think it's better if you keep that.
It's a nightmare...

726
01:05:57,481 --> 01:06:02,069
...looters everywhere. The Americans
promised us some security people...

727
01:06:02,403 --> 01:06:03,821
...let's hope they get here soon.

728
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:07,241
Doctor, how is she, she looks very pale.

729
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:09,243
Do you think she can breathe all right?

730
01:06:09,493 --> 01:06:13,247
She could probably do with some oxygen.
Goodbye for now.

731
01:06:15,082 --> 01:06:19,920
Thank you, excuse me Doctor.
You breathing?

732
01:06:21,255 --> 01:06:23,758
Breathe, Vittoria.

733
01:06:25,259 --> 01:06:33,434
The only ones breathing are the flies.
Damnit, where do they get so much oxygen?

734
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:38,439
It's a nightmare.
I'll go find you some oxygen right away.

735
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:46,363
Hang on.
Poor doctor, hasn't even got any band-aids.

736
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:50,367
Hi, it's Attilio.

737
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:54,789
By any chance to you
have an oxygen tank at home?

738
01:06:55,623 --> 01:06:56,957
Yes, oxygen tank.

739
01:06:57,208 --> 01:07:01,378
You might have forgotten you had one...

740
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:08,969
You don't know anyone
who might have some oxygen?

741
01:07:11,388 --> 01:07:18,062
Got it! Don't worry, don't
need it any longer. Thanks bye.

742
01:07:18,729 --> 01:07:24,735
I'll get you some oxygen, I know where.
I'll go fetch it.

743
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:32,743
Goodbye Vittoria.

744
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:48,842
Mamma Mia!

745
01:07:57,851 --> 01:08:00,437
It's total hell!

746
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:07,778
Look out!

747
01:08:10,531 --> 01:08:12,616
It was here, who pinched it?

748
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,451
Excuse me, did you see where...

749
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:24,545
Where've they put it? Have you
seen A wet-suit with a mask?

750
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:27,881
Stop!

751
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:31,802
Hey Mr. Arab, stop!

752
01:08:32,135 --> 01:08:39,142
I said stop!
Mr. Arab, whatever your names is, stop!

753
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,146
You crazy?
Stop!

754
01:08:43,397 --> 01:08:47,317
Friend. Italian. I am Italian.

755
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:56,576
I need the oxygeno.
Oxygen tank, for me. Oxygen.

756
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:59,746
I need. I pay. I pay. I pay.

757
01:08:59,997 --> 01:09:03,250
Dollar?
Like Dollar. Euro... Do you know?

758
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:06,420
Italy, France, Germany,
Luxembourg... I pay...

759
01:09:09,089 --> 01:09:13,510
More? How much does he want?

760
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:19,599
He's left me the whole cart!
The tank!

761
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:24,354
It's stuck.

762
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:32,946
I'd better go, if anyone comes
tell him I paid for all this lot!

763
01:09:34,698 --> 01:09:36,199
I paid for it!

764
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:42,622
Hang on, there's more, there's this too.

765
01:09:42,956 --> 01:09:48,962
A dog, where shall I put it?
Next to you?

766
01:09:49,796 --> 01:09:54,718
Here, that way he can keep an eye on you.
Looks good here.

767
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:59,806
I spent a fortune but it was worth it,

768
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:03,059
above all because
I found something absolutely fantastic.

769
01:10:03,393 --> 01:10:05,145
Really close your eyes.

770
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:10,233
A fly whisk! I've found the weapon
of mass destruction.

771
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,818
I found it!

772
01:10:12,736 --> 01:10:16,906
I'm going to have myself a massacre,
you're dead!

773
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:23,830
Breathing okay?

774
01:10:23,997 --> 01:10:26,750
What's the weather like up
in the mountains?

775
01:10:29,085 --> 01:10:31,087
Is it snowing?

776
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:35,925
If only you know
how pretty you are in blue.

777
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:39,179
I've put some tape here, hope it works,

778
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:45,602
Do you like music? I'll show you.

779
01:10:46,269 --> 01:10:49,022
I've found an old record player,
it's all Arab music,

780
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:50,440
but they're nice, I bet.

781
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:56,696
Can't figure out a thing here...
Look who's here in Baghdad.

782
01:10:57,864 --> 01:11:00,950
Look who I've found, close your ears,

783
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:04,412
this is incredible, just listen.

784
01:11:23,973 --> 01:11:28,353
As soon as you're better
we'll go to Granada together and dance.

785
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:32,148
how are you muchacha, breathing okay?

786
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:35,234
The light's gone again.

787
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:49,082
Fuad, yes, hello.
Fuad, is that you?

788
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:52,085
It's you Attorney, I can't hear you well.

789
01:11:52,585 --> 01:11:54,837
Be in my office at 8:00 tomorrow,

790
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:59,842
you've got to sign the charge sheet,
or off to jail with you!

791
01:12:00,218 --> 01:12:02,303
No messing around.

792
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:04,931
Attilio! Attilio!

793
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:09,268
Hello? Hello?
Thank goodness.

794
01:12:19,487 --> 01:12:22,198
Doctor, good evening. Doctor, excuse me,

795
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:24,700
I have done everything you said, but...

796
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:28,454
...she doesn't answer. She doesn't move,
she doesn't react in anyway.

797
01:12:29,872 --> 01:12:31,707
She's like ahh... dead.

798
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:33,000
I don't know what else...

799
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:37,213
But ahh, how can I tell
if she's getting better, recovering.

800
01:12:38,256 --> 01:12:42,802
If there's the slightest movement,
a finger, a hand, an eye.

801
01:12:43,052 --> 01:12:46,013
You'll know she has made it,
any movement is from the mental.

802
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:50,226
What on earth? Claudio Villa!

803
01:12:56,482 --> 01:12:57,525
What is that?

804
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:02,405
An old record I found,
the music might cheer her up.

805
01:13:02,822 --> 01:13:06,867
Is the oxygen okay? Yes,
but it's finished. Already?

806
01:13:07,076 --> 01:13:08,452
Yeah. This can be removed.

807
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:12,123
You hear that? The oxygen's done you good.

808
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,834
How is she?

809
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:21,549
She is alive.
Alive? But Doctor. Doctor...

810
01:13:21,757 --> 01:13:25,428
Without water, without food,
how can she go on.

811
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:28,097
Isn't there anything we can give her?

812
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,683
If only I had...
Had what?

813
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:33,269
Some sort of nutritional drip
I could give her...

814
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:37,731
along with the cortisone
and the antibiotics... never mind.

815
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:39,525
But what can we...

816
01:13:39,775 --> 01:13:42,862
It will help a lot.
Goodbye for now.

817
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,574
Now he tells me one thing at a time!

818
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:49,952
The nutritional drip is crucial.

819
01:13:50,286 --> 01:13:52,329
I'll find you something to eat,

820
01:13:52,538 --> 01:13:56,542
don't worry, I'll get food for you.

821
01:13:57,293 --> 01:14:02,172
Right away, if I say I will, I will.

822
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:04,133
Nunzio, how are you?

823
01:14:04,383 --> 01:14:09,555
It's De Giovanni.
Doctor Guazzelli, I've missed you!

824
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:13,809
I'm in Baghdad, I'm all right.

825
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:18,355
And you?
Where are you? When'll you get here?

826
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:23,402
Yeah right! We need things now,
there are sick people here!

827
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:29,408
They won't let the Red Cross through
the road blocks? Knock'em down!

828
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:32,578
You know what, I'll come to you.

829
01:14:32,953 --> 01:14:35,247
Goodbye, Nunzio. Goodbye.

830
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:37,916
I'll get you some food.

831
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:42,379
I'll get a couple of candles
so we can have dinner together.

832
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:47,009
I'm off, they're not far, 50 kilometers,

833
01:14:47,176 --> 01:14:49,636
I'll borrow the doctor's bike,

834
01:14:49,845 --> 01:14:52,764
if I go at 100,
I'll be there in half an hour.

835
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:54,183
Don't move,

836
01:14:54,349 --> 01:14:59,271
actually do move...
a finger, a hand, an eye, whatever.

837
01:15:40,312 --> 01:15:47,235
Might have know it, now I've hurt...
my foot.

838
01:15:55,243 --> 01:16:00,415
Out of gas in Iraq, it's too much!

839
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:04,586
On we go, then we'll see.

840
01:16:21,019 --> 01:16:25,440
Hello! Hello! I am Italian!

841
01:16:26,191 --> 01:16:29,736
Anyone there?
Hello! Please!

842
01:16:31,112 --> 01:16:36,493
I'm borrowing a camel.
I'll bring it right back.

843
01:16:39,955 --> 01:16:45,460
You're much more beautiful than him,
my favorite camel.

844
01:16:46,419 --> 01:16:47,921
Now be good, down.

845
01:16:48,129 --> 01:16:52,550
Let me get on,
how do you say "down" in Arabic?

846
01:16:57,222 --> 01:17:12,737
You've got to get down! You're more
beautiful than he is, and he's deaf too!

847
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:14,572
Now let's go.

848
01:17:14,989 --> 01:17:19,160
Hang on.

849
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,749
Slowly!

850
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:29,671
Now this is a real camel,
you're ugly and dead too!

851
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:32,799
That way!

852
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:39,514
Other way, camel!
This is the way back to Baghdad!

853
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:43,935
He's taking me back to the hospital.

854
01:17:44,269 --> 01:17:48,940
Camel, can you hear me?
Go that way!

855
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,692
Down boy!

856
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:54,153
I can't jump off, I've hurt my foot.

857
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:11,379
Look where we are,
he must be used to going to Baghdad!

858
01:18:11,629 --> 01:18:13,881
Stop!

859
01:18:22,724 --> 01:18:26,811
Just my luck, the dumbest camel
in the whole of Arabia!

860
01:18:27,395 --> 01:18:28,563
Goodbye.

861
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,318
What is it?

862
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,488
What do you want?

863
01:18:38,448 --> 01:18:39,740
Go away!

864
01:18:56,215 --> 01:18:59,760
Before you couldn't wait to get to Baghdad!

865
01:19:00,011 --> 01:19:03,181
Other way!
Go away, camel.

866
01:19:05,016 --> 01:19:07,768
What on earth are you following me for now?

867
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:12,607
Mamma Mia, you smell disgusting.

868
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,109
How come you have such bad breath?

869
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:21,032
- The Italian Red Cross?
- Doctor!

870
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,201
Is Nunzio around, Dr. Guazzelli?

871
01:19:27,455 --> 01:19:28,497
That's the lot.

872
01:19:28,706 --> 01:19:33,753
Did you remember some decent anti-edema,
syringes and cortisone?

873
01:19:33,961 --> 01:19:38,215
Everything, don't know how you'll
manage this lot on your bike.

874
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:42,803
What I can't squeeze in,
you can bring back with you.

875
01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:48,934
You put some gas for the bike?
Did you recharge my cell phone?

876
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:59,153
What do you think, Chemiotina or Talamagil?

877
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,237
Chemiotina.

878
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:05,910
I might as well take both,
except I've got no more room.

879
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:13,876
- When will you get to Baghdad?
- They won't let us in.

880
01:20:14,084 --> 01:20:18,172
It's a real nightmare in Baghdad,
they haven't even got band-aids.

881
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:20,633
- Are they in here?
- Right there.

882
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:26,472
Thanks a million.
Could you give me a push?

883
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,518
I'll tell you when.
One, two, three... push hard!

884
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:38,275
Good luck!
Thanks, same to you!

885
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:02,466
Sir!
Halt!

886
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:06,512
Halt I said! The bike, down!

887
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,641
I'm Italian.

888
01:21:10,891 --> 01:21:12,976
Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!

889
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:16,438
Hold your fire!

890
01:21:18,647 --> 01:21:21,066
Don't you move!

891
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:23,693
Put your hands on your head!

892
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:27,739
Hands on your head I said! Don't move!

893
01:21:27,906 --> 01:21:29,491
He's a fuckin' powder keg!

894
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:30,826
Don't shoot!

895
01:21:31,034 --> 01:21:33,411
Are you crazy! I'm Italian!

896
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,414
These are medical...
Stop! Don't touch those!

897
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:39,835
They're medical supplies! -
Medical what? - Medical supplies!

898
01:21:40,001 --> 01:21:43,338
Stay there or we'll shoot you!

899
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:45,840
I don't move!

900
01:21:46,174 --> 01:21:49,177
Put your hands on your head!
Okay!

901
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:53,598
Tell him to stay calm.
He is very nervous.

902
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:56,017
"He's going to shoot me!
He's shaking!"

903
01:21:56,184 --> 01:21:59,187
Stay calm! Put that gun machine down!

904
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:01,856
Stay calm! I am having heart attack!

905
01:22:02,023 --> 01:22:03,358
Shut up!

906
01:22:05,193 --> 01:22:08,989
Williams, Johnson, check him out!

907
01:22:12,283 --> 01:22:14,244
Careful, watch for the trigger, careful!

908
01:22:14,536 --> 01:22:19,541
You're... ow! You're... ow!
- Tell him... - He's clean sir.

909
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:24,671
Aspirin. Got saline. He's clean.

910
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:32,220
Okay. He's just some nut! Some
crazy Italian! Who the fuck is he!

911
01:22:32,972 --> 01:22:35,558
Now you listen to me, Sir. Who are you?

912
01:22:36,267 --> 01:22:38,811
I am Italian.
Yeah, we got that.

913
01:22:38,978 --> 01:22:40,438
What do you do?

914
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,982
- I am a teacher.
- Of what?

915
01:22:43,316 --> 01:22:48,780
Poetry. What poetry.
- Poetry. - Poetry.

916
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:50,239
Poetry.

917
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:54,327
He's a poet!
What?

918
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:56,829
What did you say?
Poet!

919
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:04,918
So you're a poet?
Yes. Like ahh...

920
01:23:05,085 --> 01:23:07,087
Dante. Walt Whitman.

921
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,464
Walt Whitman.

922
01:23:13,844 --> 01:23:15,429
Okay... get the fuck out of here!

923
01:23:17,598 --> 01:23:18,599
Pull the wire!

924
01:23:21,852 --> 01:23:23,687
Very sorry about that.

925
01:23:24,021 --> 01:23:28,859
Yes, thank you. Thank you...
... excuse me.

926
01:23:29,109 --> 01:23:32,529
Just a push. A last favor.

927
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:36,700
Thank you, a push, yeah.
One, two, three! Yes!

928
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:42,372
Bye sir! Thank you!

929
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:48,295
Bye! Bye-bye! Thank you!

930
01:23:49,046 --> 01:23:50,514
Go down!

931
01:23:50,549 --> 01:23:52,718
Damn thing's stuck,

932
01:23:53,302 --> 01:23:54,928
Just won't budge.

933
01:23:59,725 --> 01:24:01,685
Ahh Doctor this too.

934
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:06,148
Thank you for this, and for all the rest.

935
01:24:06,398 --> 01:24:09,902
Even if it's just a drop in the ocean.
She's okay now.

936
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:12,613
Thank you.
I must be going.

937
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:15,282
She's okay, Doctor,
but she still isn't moving.

938
01:24:15,574 --> 01:24:20,162
I mean, rather than do one thing at a time,
how about if you do everything at once.

939
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,496
What can we do now?

940
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:26,084
At this stage, there is nothing more
we can do. Just hope and pray to Allah.

941
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:27,753
Ah, thank you.

942
01:24:31,089 --> 01:24:32,841
You hear that?

943
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:36,428
He said we've done all we can.

944
01:24:37,012 --> 01:24:39,514
You're fine, it's all inside here.

945
01:24:39,932 --> 01:24:45,604
There's nothing more we need to do,
just relax.

946
01:24:45,937 --> 01:24:56,031
He told me to pray to Allah. It's the
only thing we can do, pray to Allah.

947
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,116
I would pray.

948
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,205
We've done everything else...

949
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:10,295
Allah, the only prayers
I know is the Lord's Prayer in Italian,

950
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:15,467
you understand Italian?
It's a beautiful prayer.

951
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,137
How about it?

952
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:27,813
Our Father, who are in heaven,

953
01:25:28,188 --> 01:25:30,315
hallowed be thy name.

954
01:25:31,149 --> 01:25:34,653
Thy kingdom come, they will be done

955
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,738
in Earth as it is in heaven.

956
01:25:36,905 --> 01:25:41,576
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

957
01:25:41,826 --> 01:25:43,495
as we forgive them
that trespass against us

958
01:25:43,745 --> 01:25:44,955
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

959
01:25:45,163 --> 01:25:46,331
Now we've really done all we can.

960
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:59,678
Rest, I'm going to have
a little rest myself.

961
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:04,599
Bye Vittoria.

962
01:26:11,106 --> 01:26:13,274
Anything you need, I'm at the barber's.

963
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:21,616
That's just what I said to Vittoria

964
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:24,786
when she asked
why I'd come back to Baghdad.

965
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:29,958
I told her about the 351st Arabian Night,
remember it?

966
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:34,129
You know all 1001? How about 406th?

967
01:26:34,379 --> 01:26:38,883
406 is about the Italian poet
with a funny sole.

968
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:42,303
"The Arabian Nights", wonderful!

969
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:44,931
"Beautiful sky!"

970
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,725
The Baghdad sky is
the pillow of the world.

971
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:52,188
Looks like they're firing angels.

972
01:26:54,274 --> 01:26:57,735
80km from here, over 3,000 years ago,

973
01:26:57,944 --> 01:27:01,823
they built the Tower of Babel
so they could climb up to this sky.

974
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:05,577
80km from here all
our languages were born.

975
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:09,831
Since they tried to touch this sky,
we no longer understand each other.

976
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:18,590
A Muslim legend says that now
and then Allah comes back to Earth

977
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:20,842
because he misses the look of
the starry sky from below.

978
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:25,013
Centuries of wisdom
and what have we learned? Nothing.

979
01:27:25,346 --> 01:27:27,265
You know why there are wars?

980
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:32,270
Because the world started without men
and without men it'll finish.

981
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:40,528
Come over and get a good night's
sleep in a proper bed.

982
01:27:40,778 --> 01:27:45,867
Thanks, but I've got
a comfortable barber's chair.

983
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,869
I'll sleep like a log near Vittoria,
you never know.

984
01:27:48,035 --> 01:27:51,122
I do know.
Goodbye.

985
01:27:51,622 --> 01:27:53,040
Goodnight, Fuad.

986
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,293
Fuad?

987
01:27:55,752 --> 01:27:59,797
Come on, if we're good and behave well,
we'll get to heaven!

988
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:04,802
There's nothing after this. Even less than
nothing, which would at least be something.

989
01:28:05,052 --> 01:28:07,555
Still, I'm glad I was born,

990
01:28:07,763 --> 01:28:12,310
I'm sure even when I'm dead
I'll remember when I was alive.

991
01:28:13,019 --> 01:28:14,395
Good night, Attilio.

992
01:28:15,897 --> 01:28:17,190
See you, Fuad.

993
01:30:53,804 --> 01:30:54,721
Fuad!

994
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:01,979
Fuad!

995
01:31:32,843 --> 01:31:34,094
Oh Vittoria!

996
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,182
Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

997
01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:56,116
No, you can't take her away yet.
She can hardly stand.

998
01:31:56,450 --> 01:32:00,454
You'll have to give her a day or two.
Look it's almost a miracle,

999
01:32:00,704 --> 01:32:02,205
but in here they do happen sometimes.

1000
01:32:02,372 --> 01:32:08,461
But, sorry... sorry to keep asking
you doctor. But she really is better?

1001
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:11,381
Yes, she's better. Come and see.

1002
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:14,134
But do you think she'll recognize me?
Of course she will.

1003
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:15,552
- Yes.
- Yes.

1004
01:32:19,055 --> 01:32:21,725
I bet she won't. Wait, Doctor...

1005
01:32:21,975 --> 01:32:25,645
Maybe first, a pair of new shoes...

1006
01:32:25,812 --> 01:32:30,483
...or some flowers, or maybe a shower,
I must stink like a camel.

1007
01:32:35,905 --> 01:32:40,243
Fine, we'll try to get her walking.
There's still so much to do.

1008
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:42,829
Thank you Doctor.
Doctor, Doctor... Excuse me.

1009
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:47,917
Forgive me but ahh...
Have you even been kissed by a camel?

1010
01:32:52,422 --> 01:32:55,342
I'll give her a surprise.

1011
01:33:04,517 --> 01:33:05,935
A dark brown.

1012
01:33:09,773 --> 01:33:12,692
They are used. But they are beautiful.

1013
01:33:13,443 --> 01:33:17,864
Thank you. Beautiful, yes, thank you.
Okay, so how much is it?

1014
01:33:18,615 --> 01:33:19,783
Only twenty dollar.

1015
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:33,963
I... I... I don't... Excuse me.

1016
01:33:34,214 --> 01:33:35,298
Yes?

1017
01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:42,555
May I try just two, three steps?

1018
01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:45,225
Just to see how they fit me?

1019
01:33:45,391 --> 01:33:49,646
Yes. - Sometimes they are large, they are
tight. Take your time. Take your time.

1020
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:55,151
To try, yeah? Two, three steps, yeah?

1021
01:33:55,401 --> 01:33:57,570
They are wonderful.
Yes.

1022
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,825
Wonderful. What a beautiful good
man. - Couple of steps more. - Please.

1023
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,078
It's not bad.

1024
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:10,416
Sir! Sir!

1025
01:34:25,681 --> 01:34:27,683
All for a pair of shoes that are too big!

1026
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,772
Leave me alone!

1027
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:37,527
Stop, that's a minefield!

1028
01:34:40,863 --> 01:34:42,698
You're scared!

1029
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:44,367
Wimps!

1030
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:57,713
Don't move!
Careful where you tread!

1031
01:35:00,466 --> 01:35:03,386
You want your wretched shoes!

1032
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:05,471
Boom! Boom!

1033
01:35:05,638 --> 01:35:07,473
I'll give them back.

1034
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:10,726
Here, have 'em!

1035
01:35:18,401 --> 01:35:24,573
The other one too? Want both?
So long as you leave me in peace.

1036
01:35:42,425 --> 01:35:45,511
There are mines!

1037
01:35:45,845 --> 01:35:48,514
Now what'll I do?

1038
01:35:49,265 --> 01:35:51,434
Mines!

1039
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,521
Allah, do a friend a favor,

1040
01:35:55,771 --> 01:35:59,692
I'll never ask for another.
Help me.

1041
01:36:00,192 --> 01:36:03,863
Maybe if I tread where I trod before...

1042
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:08,534
dead east,
Let's go.

1043
01:36:09,702 --> 01:36:14,206
There, just as I thought.
That's my footprint...

1044
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,795
Would you believe it?
Stuck in the middle of a minefield!

1045
01:36:20,379 --> 01:36:21,881
There and there.

1046
01:36:33,726 --> 01:36:35,227
Oh Mamma Mia!

1047
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:40,899
Thanks for your help,
I'll do the same for you.

1048
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:43,235
Bye, thanks.

1049
01:36:49,074 --> 01:36:51,076
Fuad, can I come in?

1050
01:36:53,495 --> 01:36:54,663
Fuad?

1051
01:36:55,164 --> 01:36:57,666
It's Attilio, can I come in?

1052
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,004
I've got some great news,
the best in the world!

1053
01:37:02,504 --> 01:37:04,173
What a wind!

1054
01:37:05,507 --> 01:37:07,426
You're losing all your papers.

1055
01:37:08,927 --> 01:37:11,430
However much poetry do you write?

1056
01:37:12,514 --> 01:37:16,101
It's all falling down,
shall I close the door?

1057
01:37:24,776 --> 01:37:26,695
Fuad...

1058
01:37:29,281 --> 01:37:31,366
Fuad...

1059
01:37:33,368 --> 01:37:35,370
What have you done?

1060
01:37:37,873 --> 01:37:39,541
Fuad...

1061
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:43,712
What have you done?

1062
01:38:44,356 --> 01:38:48,276
First squad! Flush against the houses!
Clear the rooms! Move!

1063
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:18,056
I'm Italian! I'm Italian!

1064
01:39:19,557 --> 01:39:21,226
I'm Italian!

1065
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:28,817
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1066
01:39:30,902 --> 01:39:32,153
Shut up, will you!

1067
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,990
You've been shouting for days!

1068
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:39,160
Let me sleep!

1069
01:39:40,245 --> 01:39:45,500
I am Italian. I am Italian.

1070
01:39:51,589 --> 01:39:56,594
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1071
01:39:57,512 --> 01:40:01,933
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1072
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:04,519
- You want a cigarette.
- No man.

1073
01:40:05,103 --> 01:40:07,772
Hey Pete, you want a cigarette?
No thanks.

1074
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:13,194
I'm Italian!

1075
01:40:14,195 --> 01:40:16,114
I'm Italian!

1076
01:40:17,031 --> 01:40:19,033
I am Italian!

1077
01:40:20,368 --> 01:40:22,036
The poet.

1078
01:40:23,538 --> 01:40:24,872
I am Italian!

1079
01:40:41,523 --> 01:40:43,191
Good morning, I'm Italian.

1080
01:40:43,525 --> 01:40:47,529
I've got no papers,
they gave me this at the Consulate.

1081
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,868
Attilio De Giovanni, that's me.

1082
01:40:57,205 --> 01:40:58,289
Thank you.

1083
01:41:02,627 --> 01:41:05,797
Come with me, nothing to worry about.

1084
01:41:06,214 --> 01:41:07,549
Nothing?

1085
01:41:08,049 --> 01:41:09,217
Just a check.

1086
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:24,982
Attilio!
See who's here, your attorney!

1087
01:41:25,231 --> 01:41:28,652
They actually put me in prison!

1088
01:41:32,074 --> 01:41:36,576
Glad to help,
one night and I got you out, eh?

1089
01:41:36,993 --> 01:41:41,917
See what your attorney does?
I'll drive you home.

1090
01:41:56,549 --> 01:41:59,885
This damned pollen,
it won't let me sleep at night.

1091
01:42:07,393 --> 01:42:10,896
But that's a zebra!
Beautiful!

1092
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:14,817
What's a zebra doing here?
That looks like an ostrich.

1093
01:42:15,568 --> 01:42:21,073
They've turned it into a zoo?
Could be, there's a cop, ask him.

1094
01:42:22,575 --> 01:42:24,577
Officer, what's with the zebra?

1095
01:42:24,827 --> 01:42:29,581
There's even a monkey in my garden,
what's going on?

1096
01:42:29,748 --> 01:42:33,252
There's a fire at the circus, back up!

1097
01:42:43,429 --> 01:42:46,664
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1098
01:44:06,678 --> 01:44:12,517
- Open up! - Rosa, let's go
I'm here!

1099
01:44:12,768 --> 01:44:16,521
- The door's locked.
- Why'd you always lock it?

1100
01:44:16,688 --> 01:44:18,857
I can't swim without my goggles.

1101
01:44:19,107 --> 01:44:22,194
- My red bathing cap?
- You always forget everything.

1102
01:44:27,866 --> 01:44:28,867
Papa!

1103
01:44:29,034 --> 01:44:35,207
What a coincidence! Where've you been?
Rosa too?

1104
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:39,544
How pretty we are!

1105
01:44:40,045 --> 01:44:43,048
- Where've you been?
- Me? Where have you been!

1106
01:44:43,298 --> 01:44:49,721
Mamma's round the back!
Mamma, Daddy's back!

1107
01:44:52,891 --> 01:44:56,811
- Did you know Daddy was coming?
- No.

1108
01:44:57,062 --> 01:44:58,730
Are you happy?

1109
01:45:01,566 --> 01:45:03,818
I thought I'd give you a surprise.

1110
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,738
I'm glad you did.

1111
01:45:07,238 --> 01:45:12,243
I've got a surprise for you, a great one.
We're going to be late for swimming.

1112
01:45:12,494 --> 01:45:16,414
Hang on!
Come here.

1113
01:45:16,998 --> 01:45:19,000
Mamma's looking well, isn't she?

1114
01:45:19,668 --> 01:45:22,504
Yes, but she was very sick,

1115
01:45:22,671 --> 01:45:24,339
she nearly died in Baghdad.

1116
01:45:24,923 --> 01:45:29,094
They don't know who saved her,
some unknown Italian doctor,

1117
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:30,845
a medical genius.

1118
01:45:39,104 --> 01:45:43,108
First he disappears then back
he comes when it suits him.

1119
01:45:43,274 --> 01:45:46,194
- Dreadful, isn't he?
- Yes, he is just dreadful.

1120
01:45:46,444 --> 01:45:49,614
- You can't stand it any longer.
- Quite right.

1121
01:45:49,864 --> 01:45:52,200
- Can't live with someone like that.
- No.

1122
01:45:52,367 --> 01:45:54,869
So, you're madly in love with him?

1123
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,621
Yes.

1124
01:45:57,205 --> 01:46:01,709
Open your eyes... two goldfinches.

1125
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,213
- What do they do?
- Sing and fly.

1126
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:07,298
Emilia and I got them in Perugia for you.

1127
01:46:08,466 --> 01:46:12,470
Beautiful, thanks.
I'll go and get the car.

1128
01:46:12,887 --> 01:46:14,973
- I wanted to...
- Stop it!

1129
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:21,479
Goodbye Papa!
Goodbye!

1130
01:46:21,729 --> 01:46:24,315
I'll see lots of you later.

1131
01:46:28,653 --> 01:46:30,405
Sorry, I'm a bit tired.

1132
01:46:31,072 --> 01:46:33,741
- Something to drink?
- No, thanks.

1133
01:46:44,252 --> 01:46:47,672
It's lovely here, I haven't
been here in a while.

1134
01:46:47,922 --> 01:46:49,757
How are the lectures?

1135
01:46:50,258 --> 01:46:51,259
Fine.

1136
01:46:54,846 --> 01:46:57,181
Nancy took off, you know.

1137
01:46:57,432 --> 01:47:01,936
She went back to England for good,
just quit and left.

1138
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:26,043
I'm sorry. There hadn't been
anything for a long time.

1139
01:47:27,628 --> 01:47:30,965
- I must say, you...
- I was upset.

1140
01:47:31,382 --> 01:47:33,968
- I'd rather not talk about it now.
- Nor me.

1141
01:47:36,253 --> 01:47:39,840
The girls are beauties,
Emilia's just like you,

1142
01:47:40,007 --> 01:47:46,096
tough, takes things hard.
I'd like to see more of them.

1143
01:47:46,347 --> 01:47:52,186
So you should, you just disappeared.
The girls asked about you, then I was away.

1144
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,022
I haven't been very well,
I must take it easy.

1145
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:59,777
It's a long story,
but I'll tell you some other time.

1146
01:48:00,444 --> 01:48:05,699
I have very sad news through, Fuad's dead,
he killed himself.

1147
01:48:06,533 --> 01:48:09,536
- Maybe you read it.
- Yes, I know.

1148
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:17,878
- How's the book going?
- I haven't finished it.

1149
01:48:23,634 --> 01:48:25,052
Here...

1150
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:33,977
You know,

1151
01:48:34,144 --> 01:48:39,983
I still dream about us getting
married every night.

1152
01:48:40,734 --> 01:48:43,821
Even if we don't that's fine.

1153
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:48,492
- What?
- Would you like another cushion?

1154
01:48:49,076 --> 01:48:50,494
No, thank you.

1155
01:48:57,751 --> 01:49:00,838
I'll go, get some rest.

1156
01:49:01,338 --> 01:49:08,345
I'll see you soon, tomorrow,
the day after, I'll come often.

1157
01:49:08,595 --> 01:49:13,433
- Stay if you'd like.
- No, you look tired. Goodbye, Vittoria.

1158
01:49:23,694 --> 01:49:25,696
Sorry, I took the wrong...

1159
01:49:30,367 --> 01:49:31,618
My jacket...

1160
01:50:18,665 --> 01:50:19,916
The birds!

1161
01:50:45,775 --> 01:50:47,861
They sing and fly...

1162
01:50:53,116 --> 01:50:54,284
Bye.

1163
01:51:24,064 --> 01:51:29,652
You don't by any chance know
where I left the car, do you?
