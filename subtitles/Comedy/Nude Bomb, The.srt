1
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:19,381
Forgive me.
Well.

2
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:24,463
Which of you nuns
violated my first commandment?

3
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,710
You do not steal from Chavo.
No.

4
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,576
Did you steal from Chavo?

5
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,509
You can tell me, mother.

6
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,356
I will hear you.

7
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:03,199
Yes or no?

8
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,934
No.

9
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,070
Now, you!

10
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:20,966
Did you steal from Chavo?
No? You lie to me ?

11
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,862
- You lie to Chavo?
- No.

12
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,532
Where d'you go?

13
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,585
Where are you going?
Come here.

14
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,116
Take her.

15
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,439
WHo your trouble

16
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,601
Thank you.
Let's go.

17
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,962
From Father Bernardo.

18
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,318
Nice.

19
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:43,775
Go ahead. Pick the one you want.
It's on the house.

20
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,490
You want the special?

21
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,139
Very good.

22
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,488
I go and get her ready for you.

23
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,754
Faster. Do I have to dick this bitch ?
going to pay triple for that holly piece of  ass.

24
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:38,278
- You knew nun pussy was in such demand, hey.
- I told you for the last time.

25
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,482
She cant handle anymore.

26
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:44,150
- Use another girl.
- No, no, no.

27
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:49,006
They need to know it's a real nun.
There are no dirty whore. Do not like it.

28
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,371
- I can help you.
- Damn quacks.

29
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,551
You got money to do this.
So do it.

30
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,932
I may be a lot of things
but I'm no Murderer.

31
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:04,502
Well.
I'll do it.

32
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,825
Get older.

33
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,399
Mother fucker Padre Bernardo Damn.

34
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,006
God bless him.

35
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,636
You think that's funny?
Come, laugh with me.

36
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:08,700
Damn!
Another one.

37
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,442
You dont care how much You pay for a nun.

38
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,400
There ...

39
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,477
spoil ...

40
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:35,574
merchandise.

41
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,502
Vraciu!
Get your ass here.

42
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,244
Get rid of them. Now.

43
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:48,591
I was certain God came to me.

44
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:51,620
He said: have a better purpose in life.

45
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,163
God didn't talk to you.

46
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,236
It was just a bad reaction
about that shit in your body.

47
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:03,459
- What did God tell you.
- He told me to kill.

48
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:07,827
- To kill who ?
- All  who sin against him.

49
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:11,018
God told you to start going around
killing people?

50
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,147
Shit.
You must have been tripping badly..

51
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:17,731
Because ... I gave you the good stuff.

52
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,367
He wanted me to go away.

53
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,716
To purify my mind
only with his words.

54
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:28,029
Only then could I be prepared
to do his vengeance

55
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,134
Forget it.

56
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:51,203
For you.

57
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,850
If you're going to be doing the Lord's work..

58
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,248
you'll need the god's tools.

59
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:07,664
Carefull, hey, they are loaded.

60
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:13,961
What else did God tell you ?

61
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,197
He told me He was going to test me.

62
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:23,311
To see if I was worthy
to take on his mission.

63
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,236
- What kind of test?
- I w'ld have to show no mercy.

64
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:35,409
even to someone who show mercy on me.

65
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,824
Prigo?

66
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:45,528
Take care of my drugs.

67
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,200
- Thank you, Father.
- Bon voyage, my son.

68
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:53,060
Goodbye, Carlitos.

69
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,667
Bueno Suerte.

70
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,253
Carlitos!

71
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,804
You have a customer over here.

72
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,049
Carlitos?

73
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,860
Let God, who has enlightened every heart

74
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:54,531
teach you to know your sins
and trust in his mercy.

75
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,412
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been one day since my last confession.

76
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:04,738
What sins troubles you so much
that you must return after one day?

77
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,893
Just business as usual at our monastery.

78
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,723
The nuns carried the dope.
Our cousin priests were counting the money.

79
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:38,400
I just did not know that death was about to make
an appeareance in this house of God.

80
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,420
Stranger killed the priest?

81
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,875
Patience, padre, I'm getting to the good part.

82
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,912
The stranger leaned in and whispered into his ear.

83
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:42,066
This must have put the fear of God into him,

84
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,880
because all he could say was,
Carlitos.

85
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,826
And that's all the stranger needed to hear.

86
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:53,947
The stranger pushed the priest into his chair..

87
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,746
..turned and walked away.

88
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:59,884
But the priest had one more hail near the officery

89
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,740
He reached for a gun... Bang ! Bang, Bang !

90
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:12,570
- Priest  killed the stranger?
- No.

91
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,390
Stranger killed the priest?

92
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,262
What happened to the priest?

93
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:21,686
Four shots.

94
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,129
Forehead ...

95
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,156
sternum ...

96
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,151
shoulder ...

97
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,045
shoulder.

98
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:36,104
Sign of the Cross.

99
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,435
What happened to the stranger?

100
00:17:55,935 --> 00:18:00,940
He came in as a vilain
and managed like an angel.

101
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,644
Bullshit. I've heard nothing of this.
How do I know it's even true?

102
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:16,655
Who the fuck are you?
Who sent you? Talk to me!

103
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:21,665
Who the hell ...
A fucking liar yelper.

104
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:28,211
So Natcha is running around wacking priests left in, right ?

105
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,957
Why the hell am I paying protection every month
for you people care to protect the one damned thing?

106
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:36,776
Stop your worrying.
You are still alive, aren't you?

107
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,386
Don't give me that. I fucked used my men, for Christ's sake.

108
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:44,263
- How do I know I'm not next on his list?
- I said  we take care of it.

109
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,947
Hello? Hello?

110
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:57,929
Bullshit! Ther's a goddamned vigilante
running around wacking priests...

111
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:01,117
...and all they can tell me is they'll take care of it?

112
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:04,608
Take care of it how?
like they took care of Father Bernardo?

113
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:09,588
Where is the world coming to when a man
of the clerck can't even do God's work?

114
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:14,673
It's a God dammned shame.
Bernardo was a good earner.

115
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,081
May God have mercy on his soul.

116
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:51,187
- Hello. How are you?
- There's something wrong. You can look at it, please?

117
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,937
- What a shit hole!
- Penny, watch your mouth !.

118
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:01,004
- But it is.
- Come here.

119
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:02,238
What?

120
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,164
- That's for the attitude, young missy.
- Dad!

121
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,566
I can fit my finger in your radiator.
It's rusted.

122
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,166
Hey man, let's take a little bit of this.
They won't miss it.

123
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,674
That's how people get killed.

124
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:24,216
Just kidding, anyway.
I'm going to see what guys doin.

125
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,649
You do that.

126
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:31,825
Just miss my friends, you know.
I could be on the beach, at the ocean ...

127
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,619
- Look at all you ...
- Dude!

128
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:34,708
What?

129
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,982
Come check this shit out.

130
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,828
- Do not look at them.
- Where's Dad?

131
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:57,768
- Ladies!
- Get your hands off her!

132
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,270
Stanley!

133
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:20,136
- What happened?
- I was just fucking around with my buddy.

134
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:21,981
Your buddy?

135
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,687
Why are you crying?
It's okay. Come.

136
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:32,347
Come, come.

137
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:54,969
- We do not want any trouble
- Trouble? Do we look like trouble?

138
00:21:56,424 --> 00:22:00,136
- So you are a bunch of nice guys.
- Yes, yes. We are very very nice guys.

139
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,584
But ... we do have a problem

140
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:11,412
when people come to our establishment
and they dont want to pay respect.

141
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,064
I do pay respect.

142
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:32,845
Do I look a puta?

143
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,660
- No!
- You called me puta, no?

144
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,773
Are you trying to pay me with puta money?

145
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,546
Want to see the puta?
Here she is.

146
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:55,295
Show him a puta guys.

147
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:28,486
You good, took it... with courage.

148
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,678
Be a man.
Go ahead and save her from the bankin.

149
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,553
I'll stop. I promise.
Come on, you can do it. Go!

150
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,828
Be a man.
Go! Save her!

151
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:11,963
Hello.

152
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:18,524
I'm sorry about your daddy.
I think I'll have to be play the role of Papa.

153
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,093
You're cute.

154
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,647
- Chavo on the phone.
- Who?

155
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:31,706
- It's him.
- Damn! What does he want?

156
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,465
He wants to talk to you.

157
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,452
- How does he sound?
- He sounds serious.

158
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,995
I come back for you, Momy.

159
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:03,657
Chavez's repair.
You're welcome, we don't give a shit.

160
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:09,182
Father Bernardo is dead.
And so are Lobo and Chinaco.

161
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,694
It was a godamned massacre.

162
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,733
They took nothing. No money, no drugs.
It was strictly personal.

163
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,860
Fucking.

164
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,013
Round up your men and get the word out.

165
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,902
Ole Cheffe, we have a surprise for you.

166
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:33,620
Isn't she sweet?You check.
Isn't that right Kick Stand?

167
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:34,731
Sure No.

168
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:38,904
- Do you like to pop her cherry?
- Yes.

169
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:49,107
But I can't.
We have work to do.

170
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:55,671
Muchachos ... We are in the middle of a holy war.

171
00:25:57,552 --> 00:26:01,640
In fact, my maman did say to me:

172
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,580
"If you want a sweet  nice ripe peach,

173
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:09,843
you have to wait a while, fallin under the tree. "

174
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:15,510
I like it ripe and nice and juicy this way.
Here Ramon.

175
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:24,460
My papa said:
"Acre or sweet, we need to chew."

176
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:31,317
That's what he said. Hey.
Chavo? Where are you going?

177
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:35,633
You're talking about my mamma to say
and how much about your dirty stinking fucking father?

178
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:37,035
I said nothing.

179
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:42,657
If we talk of mother
gonna fly eggs.

180
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:46,324
- Chavo!
- Let's not talk about my mother.

181
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,668
If anybody else wants to talk about my mama,

182
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:52,151
be prepared to get a few punches.

183
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:02,593
- Rigo!
- Yes.

184
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:06,552
- Do you like this one?
- Yes.

185
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,640
Do you want me to give her to you?

186
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,866
- Yes.
- Okay.

187
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:16,783
Give her to him.

188
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:22,748
Not now. Go away. Leave me alone.

189
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:26,076
Shit!

190
00:28:27,962 --> 00:28:30,465
Hello, Chavo.

191
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:33,093
You done a great job
taking care of my place.

192
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,889
I am I made you a lot of money.

193
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:41,292
Listen up.

194
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:46,550
There's a vigilante on the streets.
going around and  killing the bad guys.

195
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:51,133
In case you guys forgot, we are the bad guys.

196
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:58,187
alright.
Anybody comes through that door,I want to know about it.

197
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:00,232
Understand?

198
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,468
Go! Go!

199
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:09,035
alright alright, I'm on it !

200
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:22,837
My hat.

201
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,244
In witness pleasuring one another in God's house.

202
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:44,716
That kind of blasphemy will not be tolerated
in my church.

203
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:30,623
- Fr Carlitos there. And he is scared.
- Okay.

204
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,889
Why don't we just call the police
and let's them take care of it?

205
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,655
Jews have called for help.

206
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:51,867
When Moses came down from the mountain,
did not ask who is on their side.

207
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,253
They responded by taking arms
the name of the Lord

208
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,630
slay all who oppose the Lord.

209
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,722
Spared noone.

210
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:02,472
Are you ready for this?

211
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,742
Are you ready going with   xxx bleeding

212
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,403
and  shooting of a short and killing more priests?
I am not ready for this.

213
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,497
You know what they did to us?
you know they will continue to do to all like us.

214
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:21,535
They must be punished, Angelina.
be punished on behalf of true believers.

215
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,973
Look at me.

216
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,004
How am i supposed to be the hand of God,
If i can't even hold my own hands still?

217
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:37,648
All I can think is going back
at the monastery, in my filthy cell,

218
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:40,846
Where they can stick  needles in my arm
and I can forget.

219
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:54,272
Mother Magda told me to die.

220
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:58,723
deep die.

221
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:19,258
I was there.

222
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:24,654
When I was in his arms
Lord spoke to me.

223
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:29,332
giving me his calling.

224
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:34,628
One, I was agreeing for .

225
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,196
One I'll have to prepare for.

226
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:42,155
- What did the Lord say?
- It wasn't words.

227
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:48,649
It was intense emotion of being alive
one that spoke to me.

228
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:52,288
How did you escape them?

229
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,202
Lord sent an angel to guide me back to his kingdom
to protect me.

230
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:03,686
- like doing your protecting me now?
- Yes.

231
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:08,760
Now that we found each other,
We will  be whole again.

232
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:33,777
Ther is no easy road to become a nun.

233
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,280
It is not a life of refuge from the outside world,

234
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:45,890
It is a life of sacrifice.

235
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:52,081
When times become unbearable,
we take comfort in knowing...

236
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:57,457
...that the sacrifice that we make
is the name of our Lord

237
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,651
Jesus Christ.

238
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,873
When you pass through those doors,
you will be born into a new life.

239
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:13,641
You'll enter with nothing and you will be
absolved of sins without questions.

240
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:18,764
We do not ask nor do we speak
of our past lifes upon entry.

241
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,511
To make a closer union with the crucified Lord,

242
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,157
You will be submitted to...

243
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:32,665
...  exercises in tasks
and humility.

244
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:39,728
If you question this trial,
you do not belong with us.

245
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:51,915
To be obedient in all things until death

246
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,329
with the love of God.

247
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:57,746
Is to be perfect nun.

248
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,900
You want me to take care of it?

249
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:53,747
No.
I am in the mood for a good jerk-off story.

250
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:58,305
- I'm on it.
- It Could be the priests's killer.

251
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:03,381
The Good Book is all the protection I need.

252
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,597
May God who has enlightened every soul..

253
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:41,661
..teach you to know your sins
and trust in his mercy.

254
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,908
Forgive me, Lord,
for I'm about to sin.

255
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:48,146
I'm not the Lord, he only works through me.

256
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:50,008
Now tell me what is so heavy on your heart..

257
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,055
..you must come to confession
at this unearthy hour?

258
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:58,940
I'm not here to confess any sins.
I'm here to commit them.

259
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:03,565
You must have Balls in steel to come to my house.

260
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:09,117
Do you know who your dealing with?
How much money comes through this church?

261
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:12,501
Kiilling a couple of thugs and a priest
is not going to stop anything.

262
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,527
- You have no idea what you're out against fuck.
- Just tell me who you work for.

263
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:19,062
and you won't have to suffer the same fate as your brothers.

264
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:23,207
I work for the Lord.
He is my sheperd.

265
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,768
Make yourself comfortable.

266
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,960
Fuck.

267
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:58,015
Is always the same.

268
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:19,653
Fuck. Passing.

269
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,365
There is nothing sacred any more.

270
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:33,247
Dont coverup. It's alright.
Its a minute.

271
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:21,231
- I need a room.
- By the hour or by the  night?

272
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:30,048
- By the night.
- That will be 30 dollars, cash.

273
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:44,535
Lucky Room number seven.

274
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:11,980
Halfbreed.

275
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:16,291
These guys, they're yours.

276
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:20,377
- You good?
- Yah.

277
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:25,237
How can you get to count everybody's money,
including your own?

278
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:27,354
What's your problem?
You want to count my money?

279
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:29,121
- I'd like to see them.
- Count me.

280
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:32,713
- Count me.
- No, that's alright. It's good.

281
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:41,747
Rigo.

282
00:46:51,532 --> 00:46:54,576
Go ahead to your business, man.

283
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:07,092
- Chavo's workshop, Rigo.
- Get me Chavo on the phone. Now!

284
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:10,270
OK. Ok.

285
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:17,808
- Carlitos, who?
- The one bastards killed him in his own church.

286
00:47:19,398 --> 00:47:24,362
- He should have prayed harder.
- You need to put an end to this, right now.

287
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,555
OK.

288
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:33,460
You want us to track down this little eraser its going
to be double the regular price.

289
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:38,565
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Hey , Padre, don't fuck with me.

290
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,972
We've already lost two men
in your holy war.

291
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:45,417
In fact, I know Jesus has deep pockets
for this kind of shit.

292
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:51,085
If you won't double the pay,
Then I won't all this done in half the time.

293
00:47:51,063 --> 00:47:55,485
Meet Mother Magda at Carlitos his church.
She is expecting you.

294
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:05,943
Carlitos ...

295
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,888
It sounds good.

296
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:27,898
This way.

297
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:35,409
You guys stay here and make sure
we don't have any unwanted visitors.

298
00:48:56,873 --> 00:49:01,420
- What do you think?
- I'm dead alright.

299
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:06,005
You can stop them. Make them pay.

300
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:10,272
You know, you're not exactly the forgiving type, Magda.

301
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:15,397
You know, turn the other cheek, love thy enemy ...
..and All the bullshit you preach.

302
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:20,645
Listen, They called me up from my monastery
to fix this.

303
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:24,976
And I expect it to be resolved
as soon as possible.

304
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,529
I heard you the first time,OK ?
I know, Iknow you want it fast.

305
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:30,487
You want a miracle.

306
00:49:30,818 --> 00:49:32,236
That's your business.

307
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:37,828
But by the looks of things,
Your businesss not doing very well.

308
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,323
Now. Are here any witnesses?

309
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:49,649
Sister Mary was the first one
to alert us of the situation.

310
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,617
- Then get her ass in here.
- This won't do any good.

311
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:56,947
Sister Marytook a vow of silence 20 years ago.

312
00:49:58,005 --> 00:50:01,550
I keep her around just because she knows
how to keep a big mouth shut.

313
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:06,356
We'll see about that . Bring her.

314
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,515
Who did this?

315
00:51:04,774 --> 00:51:06,859
Who killed these men?

316
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:15,344
OK.
I am going to ask you one more time nicely.

317
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:20,969
If you do not want to talk, I'm going to let
Kick Stand take over the questioning.

318
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:26,455
Who killed these men?

319
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:32,854
OK. It's your choice.

320
00:51:36,919 --> 00:51:38,421
I'll be right back.

321
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:47,468
Mary, tell me what you saw now.

322
00:51:47,794 --> 00:51:51,589
Mary what did you see?

323
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:56,849
It's alright. You can talk.
I won't tell anyone.

324
00:51:58,389 --> 00:51:59,891
Just between us.

325
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:04,389
Mary, they are going to come back here..

326
00:52:04,306 --> 00:52:06,642
.. then I can not stop them.

327
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,477
What did you see?

328
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:17,129
Kick Stand, get your dick over here.
Now!

329
00:52:29,374 --> 00:52:31,001
Who killed them, Mary?

330
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:34,353
You know who it was, don't you?

331
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:40,640
You've seen them before,Haven't you?
What did they look like?

332
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:49,952
Kick Stand, go to work.

333
00:52:51,364 --> 00:52:54,868
I'll nail your arse as they
nailed Jesus to the cross.

334
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,179
Kick Stand, enough.

335
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,569
It was a nun.

336
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:13,422
- It was God's hands.
- A nun?

337
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:19,869
It's like one of your penguins is to recoup , Magda.

338
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:24,647
- What kind of gun did she have?
- Big guns.

339
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,152
I looked into her eyes
and saw the devil in them.

340
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:43,485
- What to do now, boss?
- First, w're going to handle the troops and then ...

341
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:48,827
we are going nun-hunting
.

342
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:55,046
Halfbreed quit fucking around, get up here.

343
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,952
We're looking for a nun.

344
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,612
A nun with big guns.

345
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:17,289
You mean, "big guns" like in "Big Tits"?

346
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:20,881
I said guns.
I'm surrounded by idiots.

347
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,280
Pull yourself together, or you'll end up here
in a pine box.

348
00:55:30,651 --> 00:55:33,487
Spread the rumor on the streets.

349
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:53,302
Fix that. Go check that out.

350
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:10,929
What about her?
She is a nun.

351
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,577
Yes she is.

352
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:28,818
Are you a killer?

353
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:34,311
No, no, no. Not this one, hey. Ouhh.

354
00:56:35,421 --> 00:56:37,923
I don't think she can even hold a gun
much less shoot one.

355
00:56:38,379 --> 00:56:39,797
Let's go.

356
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:45,716
back for you later.

357
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,880
S back errant daughter.

358
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:49,790
When they didn't find your body in Valambrosa
I thought even it was you causing all this trouble.

359
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:54,922
And now that you sit before me
I know Iknow my words are true.

360
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:57,692
The only thing worse is resting in your arms.

361
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,586
I know you would not last a week outside of here.

362
00:58:02,181 --> 00:58:06,936
Are you looking for someone?
Well, take a good look at him.

363
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,437
God punishes those
Why I serve Satan.

364
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,076
Let me go.

365
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:38,130
- A delivery from Magda.
- What should I do with her?

366
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:40,332
I thought w're done with this nun bullshit.

367
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:45,302
Magda said to give her to Chavo and when he
is finished with her just  throw out the rest of the trash.

368
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:48,160
- Put it in that booth.
- Alright.

369
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,599
Nice rack.

370
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:16,583
- Hi, Chavo.
- Hello, love.

371
00:59:16,547 --> 00:59:20,717
Go Tell  Beverly to bring me some beer, please.

372
00:59:28,141 --> 00:59:29,809
Come with me.

373
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:38,588
Just like I remember heyy.

374
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:44,240
- Dance for me, Mamasicu?
- Of course.

375
00:59:46,452 --> 00:59:49,038
Come on, come here.

376
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:03,798
Thanks, Beverly.

377
01:00:09,122 --> 01:00:12,876
Listen, if you see a crazy chick like that
youshoot first and ask questions later

378
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,177
That's Chavo's orders.

379
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:20,700
- Halfbreed, would you like a beer?
- What the fuck you think, bitch? Yeah.

380
01:00:23,435 --> 01:00:27,897
I think God is trying to tell me something.
everywhere I go, I see nuns.

381
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:30,390
What the fuck you said earlier, honey?

382
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:34,479
The girl in the picture. I saw one checking in
at the Palms Hotel, last night.

383
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,457
Really dirty looking one too.
She mihgt have, don't know,.. a drinking problem.

384
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:42,891
You saw this chick, a nun
checking in a piece-of-shit motel last night?

385
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:45,120
I was with Butch.
Ask her, sh'll tell you the same thing.

386
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:49,871
If you're wrong about this, Beverly,
God fucking help you.

387
01:01:24,606 --> 01:01:29,445
- What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
- I need you to wake the fuck up and pay attention.

388
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:33,402
Yes, now you got my undivided attention.

389
01:01:33,682 --> 01:01:36,810
What the fuck is so important you need
to wake me up in the middle of the morning?

390
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:39,385
It's four o'clock in the afternoon, you stupid bitch.

391
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,589
- Did you checked in a nun, last night?
- No.

392
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:47,079
Beverly, you fucking cunt, I'll rip your fuckin' ass
when I get off the phone.

393
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:51,171
Leave her the fuck alone, Jesus.

394
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:55,034
It didn't checked her in  last night.
I checked her in this morning at 2AM.

395
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:58,152
<i> Butch,no is not the time to fuck with me. </ i></i>

396
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,381
Room seven.
I checked her in myself.

397
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:07,200
Don't let that fuckin' bitch leave.
We are on our way.

398
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:47,132
<i>We got irresponsible heterosexuality . </ i></i>

399
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:51,845
<i>We  lesbianism, homosexuality
transsexuality </ i></i>

400
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:56,146
<i> multi sexuality. All sexuality. </ I></i>

401
01:02:56,884 --> 01:03:00,305
<i> it's just sin.
We got lesbians ...</ i></i>

402
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:29,954
Is she dead?

403
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:33,996
No, but Beverly saw a nun
checkin'in to the motel last night.

404
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:39,623
I want to see this little heroine.
Kick Stand, you get over there.

405
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:43,091
Put it on back to me, alive
Go.

406
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:58,101
Let me leave now.
I'll have to kill you.

407
01:03:58,055 --> 01:04:01,183
If you have not noticed,
I'm the one with the gun.

408
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:02,676
You do not have to go through this.

409
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:07,428
I know that God forgives sins.

410
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:12,968
- You just do ask for his forgiveness.
- What do you know about sin?

411
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:16,142
Are you even some real nun
or just some poor plain dressed-up?

412
01:04:17,806 --> 01:04:22,895
I've taken my vows
at my church, in the name of the Lord.

413
01:04:23,724 --> 01:04:28,187
You think you're so High mighty.
Who are you to preach?

414
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:31,511
What do you know about half the sins
you condemn?

415
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:37,824
- I too am a sinner.
- What are your sins, my precious sister?

416
01:04:41,316 --> 01:04:45,945
- I am a fornicator
- Big fucking deal.

417
01:04:45,873 --> 01:04:49,502
Half of you pinguins are being poached
By the preachers

418
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:52,934
That may be true.

419
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,145
My sins of the flesh.

420
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:00,751
are that of the fair sex.

421
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,115
Get back on the bed, bitch.

422
01:05:32,492 --> 01:05:33,994
We sin today.

423
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:39,851
And ask forgiveness tomorrow.

424
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:51,119
Such is the beauty of devine.

425
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:28,463
- Who the hell are you?
- You thought, you thought, you thought wrong.

426
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:33,891
- You said I can be forgiven.
- Want to be forgiven? Ask for it. Come on..

427
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:37,903
Please ... please.

428
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:44,532
Please ...

429
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:52,939
I absolve you.

430
01:07:07,048 --> 01:07:10,968
I absolve you..

431
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:15,024
of all your sins.

432
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:24,510
But there isno penance
for the hell bounds.

433
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:54,875
Where the fuck have you been all day?
At Tity Fucker?

434
01:07:55,146 --> 01:07:59,776
They got this new girl over there.
Man, I'm telling you: She-is-it!

435
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:04,083
She is dressed up in nun
put down yur pants.

436
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:08,193
You've  seen a nun
at the Tita club?

437
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:13,187
- How long has she been there, asshole?
- Papa said she just stopped there.

438
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:17,236
Get th efuck out of my face.

439
01:08:23,493 --> 01:08:26,788
- What now?
- Butch is dead.

440
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:30,275
That nun worked over real good.

441
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,661
<i> Chavo i sgoing to be pissed. </ i></i>

442
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:40,115
Sorry, boss. But I have bad news.
Butch is dead.

443
01:08:40,045 --> 01:08:45,384
- Bloody messover there, man.
- Mutt, this is crazy.

444
01:08:45,282 --> 01:08:48,953
Prospect said there's a nun
over the Tity Fucker right now.

445
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:51,436
Come on.

446
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:05,592
- Tity Fucker's.
- Hey, man, it's Halfbreed.

447
01:09:05,593 --> 01:09:10,890
- I bet that you're looking for that nun.
- Tell  Pope that Chavo is on his way.

448
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:13,752
<i> Yes, I get that bitch cleaned up. </ i></i>

449
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,627
- Now what?
- Chavo is on his way.

450
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:20,716
Ann, Get that bitch out of the boot
and clean her up before he gets here.

451
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:27,533
What happens Halfbreed?

452
01:09:30,941 --> 01:09:33,777
Not now, bitch.

453
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:43,330
Wake up!
And put your clothes back on.

454
01:10:14,602 --> 01:10:18,439
<i> my heart will not allow me to wait any longer. </ i></i>

455
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,819
<i> I pray to the Lord. he will save me
and reunite us. </ i></i>

456
01:10:21,798 --> 01:10:25,385
<i> If not in this world
then in heaven above. </ i></i>

457
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:51,576
Take your stuffy hands off me.

458
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,813
Where's Angelina?

459
01:13:54,819 --> 01:13:59,324
She is just playing at the Tity Fucker theater
with some old friends of yours.

460
01:14:01,216 --> 01:14:05,095
Going mean is not going to make things right.

461
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:19,879
Kick Stand, tell Pope
to bring in a nun.

462
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:43,010
Hi again, killer.

463
01:15:43,009 --> 01:15:46,513
I know you are not the man I'm looking for.

464
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:50,158
I do believe you have something to do.

465
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:55,589
- Pope, leave us alone for a while.
- to get dumped anyway.

466
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:34,290
I'll also give.

467
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:46,510
Nun.

468
01:18:04,943 --> 01:18:09,448
Put the gun down, nuts and small.

469
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:33,900
Who the hell are you?

470
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:44,096
Fucking bitch!

471
01:20:06,607 --> 01:20:09,359
Who the hell are you?

472
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:36,420
No, no, no, calm down.

473
01:20:36,673 --> 01:20:40,177
Yes, yes.

474
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:43,921
Do not touch anything. It's okay.

475
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:48,118
Come, go.

476
01:20:55,344 --> 01:20:57,388
Are you okay?

477
01:20:57,903 --> 01:21:01,824
- I will.
- No, no, no ...

478
01:21:03,621 --> 01:21:05,456
No, no.

479
01:21:08,938 --> 01:21:10,606
No! No, no, no.

480
01:22:06,432 --> 01:22:09,351
Everyone?

481
01:22:10,909 --> 01:22:14,788
No. I'll take care of it myself.

482
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:21,365
Father ...

483
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:27,000
are you ready to take on this new mission
in the name of our Lord?
