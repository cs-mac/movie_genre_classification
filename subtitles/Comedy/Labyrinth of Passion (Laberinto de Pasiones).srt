LABYRINTH OF PASSION

2
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,669
"A Spanish biogynaecologist, Dr De la Pena,

3
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:18,459
"achieved the non-sexual reproduction
of six identical parakeets for the first time.

4
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,064
"We are one step away
from the mass production of mammals. "

5
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,025
"The Emperor of Tiran leaves USA
and seeks refuge on Contadora Island. "

6
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:35,703
No money, babe, no car, no girl,
no hash, no vice, no mascara.

7
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,342
I'm hysterical.

8
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:42,387
"International porn star
Patti Diphusa talks about men. "

9
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:47,018
I'm going to snort a bit of nail polish.

10
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,501
Take some, love.

11
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,507
What an overdose!

12
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,820
I love it. Here.

13
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,224
- What a syndrome.
- What a syndrome. Loads of alcohol.

14
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,301
What an overdose!

15
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,584
Pass me the lipstick, darling.

16
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:50,982
Waiter!

17
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,263
- How may I help you?
- Could you give this note

18
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,983
- to that man over there?
- And who will pay for it?

19
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,980
He will, of course.

20
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,939
You have a note from that table.

21
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,747
- Which one?
- That, the one on the back.

22
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,781
It's 200 pesetas.

23
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:22,461
"Yes, I'd like to Cher something
with you this evening. "

24
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:28,941
Hi, everyone. I'm back, but I'm not here for you.

25
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,263
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,978
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on the pull, as you can see.

27
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,499
What a coincidence. Me too.

28
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,141
- Do you have a place?
- I have a 200-square-foot flat.

29
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:49,307
- Do you think it'll be enough?
- More than enough.

30
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,857
There's never enough.

31
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,499
Size does matter.

32
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,022
- Let's go home.
- Are you feeling lonely?

33
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,058
No, but I want to throw a party.
There'll be music, alcohol, porn, drugs...

34
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,743
- Hard ones, right?
- Only stimulants.

35
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,218
- And what other girls will be there?
- It's just me.

36
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,459
- Will it be enough?
- What do you think?

37
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,144
And don't go away, there are
12 guys I like in there. Don't go away.

38
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,708
Fast, we have an itch to scratch.

39
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,986
What do you want to bet
I can catch it with my mouth?

40
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,104
I don't know.

41
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,862
- Don't you like betting?
- I can take it or leave it.

42
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,228
I lost!

43
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,586
See if I'm lucky with this one.

44
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:45,700
Apart from men,
gambling is what excites me the most.

45
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,899
I love betting on anything.

46
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,268
- And eating as well, right?
- Yes, but it doesn't excite me so much.

47
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,067
At least not sexually.

48
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,508
By the way, did you go out as we agreed?

49
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,183
- Yes, I went to the flea market yesterday.
- And how was it?

50
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,858
- Not bad at all.
- Did you buy anything?

51
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,066
No. I found a few guys,
but I took them home for free.

52
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,265
I don't need to pay for that yet.

53
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,262
Are you implying that you had sex with them?

54
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,627
- Of course.
- And how many of them were there?

55
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,543
Eight or 10. I didn't count them.

56
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,665
- And how many girls?
- Just me.

57
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,582
I never take girls to my parties.
I can manage myself.

58
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,782
- But, Sexi, that means you're a...
- Nymphomaniac?

59
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:31,825
- Since I was a child.
- But you should control yourself.

60
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,103
Why?

61
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,141
Because you won't always be young.
I'm talking from experience. And it's not fair.

62
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,743
Even if it sounds like a cliche,
it's your father's fault.

63
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:43,582
- My father's?
- Let me explain.

64
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,141
You hate the sun
because it represents him to you.

65
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,301
Because you're very much in love with him.

66
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,860
And you shag anything that moves
just to see if he reacts and pays attention to you.

67
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,782
But your father is completely blind.

68
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,787
He doesn't realise
that your happiness depends on him.

69
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,019
Your happiness and mine.

70
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,501
Not my happiness, I can tellyou that.
But why does yours depend on him?

71
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:11,707
Why hide it from you? I want to shag your dad.

72
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:15,827
- My dad?
- Professional success isn't everything.

73
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,787
I'm going to call him.

74
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,262
I'm sorry, Princess.

75
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,658
Yes? Yes, put me through.

76
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,985
Hello? It's Susana.

77
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,425
- Hello, Susana. Did Sexilia pass by?
- Yes, I'm here with her.

78
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,741
But you never told me she's been
a nymphomaniac since she was a child.

79
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:41,104
I don't know, I must have forgotten.

80
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:47,182
You really are a case.
Why don't you and I have dinner tonight?

81
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,624
- I can't. Not tonight.
- All right, tomorrow.

82
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,303
- Tomorrow I can't, either.
- The day after?

83
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,784
- No, I can't this week.
- Well, next week.

84
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,379
I'll call you and we'll talk, all right?
Goodbye, Susana.

85
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,301
I'm sorry, Princess.

86
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:03,103
Is something wrong?

87
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,623
It was Sexilia's psychologist.
She's a bit of a pain.

88
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,462
I didn't know she was under treatment.
Is it serious?

89
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,621
It's nothing. But the other day at a party...

90
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,264
Who's this man?

91
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,464
Don't you know him?
He's Dr De la Pena, the biogynaecologist.

92
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:21,109
- The father of artificial insemination?
- Yes.

93
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,098
I didn't think he was that young.

94
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:27,864
- Ana, I think I like him.
- Well, forget it.

95
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,543
He's the kind of man who's married to his job.

96
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,180
In his case, that means being sexually obsessed.
I'm going to get off with him.

97
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,346
You won't succeed.

98
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:42,024
- Do you want to bet?
- Your fur coat.

99
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:44,669
- Against your Sevres porcelain.
- Deal.

100
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,305
- And how is Sexilia?
- I don't know. I barely see her.

101
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,860
- Why? Does she go out a lot at night?
- No, but she leaves her room at 5:00,

102
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,658
and I start working at that time,
so we don't see each other.

103
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:01,186
Sexi has an aversion to daylight.

104
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,418
How come?

105
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,458
She just hates it. She had to take
night lessons at secondary school...

106
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:11,144
There is a name for that in psychopathology.
My name is Susana Diaz.

107
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,868
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm a Lacanian psychoanalyst.

108
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,099
- I see.
- Why don't you bring her to my office?

109
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,258
- My name is Ana.
- Pleased to meet you.

110
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,377
I could make her overcome
her little phobia of daylight.

111
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:27,948
I told Sexilia and she found it amusing.
Going to therapy is trendy among the youth.

112
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,982
She's been going there for a week,

113
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,982
and it would be great if she could
overcome her phobia for daylight.

114
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,788
- It must be very uncomfortable.
- Yes.

115
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,184
- Here is what you asked for.
- Thanks.

116
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,305
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

117
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:52,139
And, back to our business, are you happy?

118
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,458
- Well, imagine. It seems incredible.
- But it's true.

119
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:01,337
You're more fertile now than a 15-year-old girl.

120
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,258
We've done a great job, Princess.

121
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,025
Will you tell the Emperor?

122
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,982
I don't know.

123
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:14,422
Between exile, his cancer...

124
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:19,665
- It must be hard for him.
- Yes, it must be very hard for him.

125
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,462
- Have I told you that I met him?
- No.

126
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:27,139
It was one summer 15 years ago
on the Costa del Sol.

127
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,789
He was with Sarah and the children.

128
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,305
You know he was very interested in gynaecology.

129
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:34,948
You're telling me.

130
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:39,024
Well, I had published an article
on artificial insemination

131
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:43,944
that caused a huge stir,
and he happened to read it.

132
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:49,866
He learnt that I spent my summers there,
called me, and we had a very nice chat.

133
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:55,781
He told me to call him if I continued
with my research. He had an idea.

134
00:09:56,109 --> 00:10:02,059
- What idea?
- He wanted to have many children.

135
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,943
He wanted half his country to carry his blood,

136
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:09,347
and he thought that
my theories would make it possible.

137
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:17,584
Yes, he's a bit crazy.
And when he left me, he went even crazier.

138
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,547
Yes, I suppose.

139
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:23,304
The doctor will help you have your own child.
I'm talking from experience.

140
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,382
- I was hopeless, too.
- But you're a bit younger than me.

141
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:32,259
Never mind. I was totally sterile,
and I have the womb of a six-year-old girl.

142
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,748
It's incredible.

143
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,538
So this must all seem
like a miracle to you, doesn't it?

144
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,623
Well, you can see.
But you should think it over before doing it.

145
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,384
Children don't bring happiness.

146
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,502
And we shouldn't fight against nature.
She knows much more than we do.

147
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:54,785
- Now I regret taking this step.
- How can you say so, with such a beautiful child?

148
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,345
- She's going to kill me.
- Don't say that in front of her.

149
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,707
- She doesn't mind. She's used to it.
- Mum exaggerates a lot, doesn't she?

150
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,702
- She has bad nerves.
- She's so impudent!

151
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,578
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Doctor.

152
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,220
- Hello, Carmen. What are you reading?
- Come on, don't be rude.

153
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,618
- Answer the doctor.
- I don't want to.

154
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:22,904
- Is this the test-tube child? Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry, I'm used to it by now.

155
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,177
Forgive me for asking,
but I'm thinking of doing it, too.

156
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,818
- Me, too.
- It's wonderful, isn't it?

157
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,901
You don't know what you're getting into.

158
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,823
- Is she completely normal?
- Yes, I guess so.

159
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,901
- But she's a monster.
- My God, don't say that.

160
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,227
- She's so smart.
- No, she's not an idiot,

161
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,824
- but I'm fed up with her.
- Don't exaggerate.

162
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,828
It sometimes happens to children.
You know, they're just children.

163
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,469
And a mother must be patient.

164
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,701
- Of course. We'd be very patient.
- I see.

165
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,465
- That's what we're here for.
- Goodbye.

166
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,221
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

167
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,501
- If I only told you...
- Get it off your chest. You can tell me.

168
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:10,663
I used to live with a man
who wanted to have a child, but I was sterile.

169
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,785
Then we found this solution.

170
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,981
Do you know what he did
when I came home with the child? He left.

171
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,982
- What a rotten swine.
- And now I'm alone with her.

172
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,425
You just need to find another man.

173
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,818
But when?
I spend my days working at the airport.

174
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,778
There are opportunities there, people coming
and going. And there are loads of men

175
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,507
who like test-tube children.

176
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:39,619
- Hi, Sexilia, how are you?
- Great.

177
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,782
- Do you know I'm fertile thanks to your dad?
- Fertile? What for?

178
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,461
I'm sorry, Princess.

179
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,505
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry.

180
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,867
- I understand. She's not very well, the poor child.
- I have a problem with her.

181
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:57,628
Call me if there is any news.
Have a good trip, Princess.

182
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:03,588
Come in.

183
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:12,539
- Sexi, why did you talk like that to the empress?
- Former empress, you mean.

184
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,383
She's always kind to you.

185
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:20,224
- I don't like her. I never have, and I can't hide it.
- I see.

186
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,900
- How did it go with your psychologist?
- Very well. She's funny, she's very crazy.

187
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,628
- She's said to be very good.
- I don't know.

188
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,665
- At least she's original.
- I see.

189
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,980
- I have to leave you, I must go back to work.
- Bye.

190
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:01,258
"Vitopens. Gives your penis
long-lasting strength and hardness.

"Especially indicated for mature,
impotent men and those lacking libido. "

192
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,027
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

193
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,667
It's all this.

194
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:26,988
A coat,

195
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,665
a pair of blue trousers,

196
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:36,621
a leather jacket

197
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,145
and a short dress.

198
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,706
- Is it urgent?
- A bit.

199
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:55,618
Well, it's impossible

200
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,701
- in less than five days.
- All right. Goodbye.

201
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,745
Goodbye. Thanks.

202
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:19,866
You are divine.

203
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,587
Queti, go buy my tea.

204
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:31,306
- Bladderwrack tea. Don't forget.
- I'll go right now.

205
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,621
- Queti?
- Yes?

206
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,507
Bring me my tea.

207
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,943
"Benzamuro. Calms sexual desire.

209
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,225
Dad, here's your tea.

210
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,499
- Darling?
- Yes?

211
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:41,983
- Can you put some cream on my back?
- Yes, I'll do it right now.

212
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,297
Turn around a little, please.

213
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:55,342
That's it. Slowly. Softly.

214
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:59,381
- Here.
- Here?

215
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,144
Look.

216
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:10,347
It's a pity these wrinkles aren't
like the ones on trousers.

217
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,024
I wish I could iron them out.

218
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:20,061
- What do you do to look so young?
- Nothing.

219
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,863
- Nothing? You always say that.
- You always ask that.

220
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,268
And you're only two years younger than me.

221
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,262
- Don't start again, Dad, please.
- Don't call me Dad.

222
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:39,945
- I've told you not to call me Dad.
- What's up? Same story all over again?

223
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,029
This is not right. It's not right, Dad.

224
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,862
- This is not right.
- Either you're schizophrenic

225
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:52,386
or you do it to turn me on. Come here.

226
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,021
- Let's go to bed.
- No, I have a lot to do. I have to do laundry.

227
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,418
I have to do the ironing, and there's lots of it.

228
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:04,946
- I'll help you out later...
- This is very wrong, Dad.

229
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,064
You like it this way, don't you? You're debauched.

230
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:18,861
I married a woman who, on top of having
a dual personality, is a bit debauched.

231
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:25,903
But I love you the same
when you say you're my daughter

232
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,105
and when you say you're my wife.

233
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:34,746
If instead of two personalities you had four,
I'd love each and every one of them.

234
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,266
"The son of the Emperor of Tiran
exiled in Madrid. "

235
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:02,908
- Hello.
- Hello.

236
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:06,186
Could I speak to Mohamed? This is his aunt.

237
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,102
- What are you doing? Are you alone?
- Not anymore.

238
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:14,822
- Do you have a place?
- No. I live in a hotel, but I don't want to go there.

239
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:20,108
- Mohamed, I'm fertile.
- At last! I knewyou'd succeed.

240
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:25,703
- Well, I live with a few friends and...
- We'll do a group session.

241
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,344
- No, no, no.
- They're not gay?

242
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:34,059
- No, we're medical students.
- Okay, I'll just go with you, then.

243
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:39,423
By the way, I need you to do me
a very special favour.

244
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:45,664
I need a bit of the Emperor's semen.
I'll tell you how to send it to me.

245
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,662
Come with me.

246
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,623
Is it true Riza is in Madrid?

247
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:55,578
Yes, I want to meet him. This is the coolest city
in the world, and he's so modern...

248
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:58,660
- Do you have his address?
- No.

249
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:06,221
I'd really like to see him. You have to
find out where he is, how I can find him.

250
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:10,667
Look in the bathhouses,
in gay bars. Well, you know.

251
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:15,902
I can't talk, somebody's coming.
This place is full of spies.

252
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,458
Go on.

253
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,786
It's a bit messy here. We'd better go to my room.

254
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,867
I really like you. It's been a long time
since I liked somebody so much.

255
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,347
You smell so good.

256
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,427
And that picture?

257
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:35,945
That's me. It was at a party.
I dressed up like the women of my country.

258
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,978
- Are you from Tiran?
- Yes.

259
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:46,109
- And you? You look Arab, too.
- I'm English, but my mum is from Morocco.

260
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:54,018
- Are you leaving already?
- I forgot I had things to do.

261
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:59,981
- Wouldn't you like a repeat?
- I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

262
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,065
Well, give me a telephone number,
some way to contact you.

263
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,345
I can't remember right now.

264
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,024
- Besides, your friends are here.
- Well...

265
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:15,461
Can you imagine
if what the magazines say were true?

266
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:19,304
If that's the case, we'll have to plan it carefully.

267
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:28,339
- Sadec.
- Wow.

268
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,187
- Sadec.
- What's going on?

269
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:40,102
Sadec, how dare you bring someone here?
He could have seen the guns.

270
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:43,101
- I'm sorry.
- Riza Niro is in Madrid.

271
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,823
- Really?
- We thought we could kidnap him.

272
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,027
Of course. Then his father will have to
give us back what he stole from us.

273
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,225
- But do you have his address?
- No.

274
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:57,746
- You'll have to use your sense of smell.
- But I'd need to smell his clothes first.

275
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:01,265
That's fine. We'll ask our spy
in Contadora to send us something.

276
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,146
- Let him send us his address. It'll be easier.
- I don't think he can. They're watching him.

277
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,300
They might send us a piece of clothing.

278
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,948
Enjoy, enjoy. Enjoy it more. Look at me.
Look at me with lewd eyes.

279
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,463
Look at me. Get closer. Get closer to the drill.

280
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:23,022
You want that drill. Yes, try to lick it.

281
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:26,740
Try. Yes, yes. You like it. You like the taste of it.

282
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,060
- Fine. You're getting the drill, right, Pablo?
- Perfect.

283
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,301
- Yes? Very good. Now, come a little.
- No! No!

284
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:36,904
- Yes, yes, yes. Very good.
- Yes, yes! Yes!

285
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:38,900
- I want more. I deserve it. Say "I deserve it".
- I deserve it.

286
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:40,900
- I deserve it.
- More.

287
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:43,184
- Shout, "I'm terrible".
- I'm terrible!

288
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,146
- Terrible.
- I'm terrible, perverted!

289
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:48,187
- Very good.
- Destroy me!

290
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:52,581
Fabio, now phone and ask permission.
Phone a friend.

291
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:55,263
- All right.
- But make it short.

292
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,544
- Make it short, and watch what you say.
- Hi, So-and-so.

293
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:00,939
So-and-so calls you.
She wants to talk and take you

294
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,466
to some tacky bar to have salad for lunch.

295
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,461
Or better yet, a tuna empanada.
And then you say,

296
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,145
"Darling, I have to hang up.
A sadistic killer is literally tearing me apart.

297
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:16,904
"If I survive,
I'll call you back and give you the details. "

298
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,900
Something like that,
but always posing for the camera.

299
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:22,948
Darling, I have to hang up.
A sadistic killer is literally tearing me apart,

300
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:28,422
- and I have to wait for him to finish.
- "Well, if I survive... "

301
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,342
- If I survive...
- Open, open there.

302
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:35,820
...I'll go out later and we can go to a tacky place
to eat something greasy. Beans with sausage.

303
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,901
- All right, darling.
- Goodbye.

304
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:42,061
- That's it.
- Now, Fabio, here.

305
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,662
No, but keep smoking and enjoying.

306
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:50,662
It itches, of course. You have a sexual itch.

307
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,501
- Fabio, up here.
- Yes, that's it.

308
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:57,299
Now drill him. Put the drill next to his neck

309
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:00,825
and drill his neck. That's the final moment.

310
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:03,981
Fabio, no. Take another one.
It's the last picture of the photonovel.

311
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:08,620
Use your acting talent.
That's it. That's enough, isn't it?

312
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,582
Isn't it? Very good.

313
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:14,508
- Pedro, can I borrow him one second?
- Hello, Johnny.

314
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:18,903
- Fabio, you have a visitor.
- How are you doing, Johnny?

315
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,460
It's my new look for Photo Porno Sexy Fever.

316
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:29,227
- They've destroyed you.
- I'm Soft Queen Killer Bang.

317
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,057
- Have you got a minute? I'd like to talk.
- I have all the time in the world...

318
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,583
- And can we talk here?
- ... to love you

319
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:40,221
and destroy you with a kiss of death.

320
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,863
- I want to change my look.
- I see.

321
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,101
- I want you to completely transform me.
- No problem.

322
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,468
I'm the most sought-after beautician

323
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:56,784
in the gutters of New York, LA and Berlin.

324
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:01,347
Here I have The Golden Book of a Coiffeur.

325
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:04,268
- Coiffeurs of Paris. Very big and loose.
- No, no.

326
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,620
- Styles for day and night.
- No.

327
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:10,418
- For the woman...
- No, no. This won't do. No.

328
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,785
For the woman who is
very sporty and very mischievous.

329
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:20,138
This isn't bad, but it'd be too much.
I want something simpler, more...

330
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:23,699
More trendy, more... More confusing.

331
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,706
Simple was never trendy.

332
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,019
- Besides, I think...
- Trendy is always futuristic.

333
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:31,818
- Futurism is glitter.
- I don't have so much to do it with.

334
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:37,062
I don't have enough hair.
It must be simple, but very colourful.

335
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:41,665
- There are some gorgeous wigs. Raffia, nylon...
- But look at what I have.

336
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,260
With this, I don't know.

337
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:50,981
Some crazy colour from London
could shock the eyes.

338
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:54,347
Take my disguise.
Do what you want with me, I don't care.

339
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,104
I'll turn you into the queen of Halloween.

340
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,418
They're the best. They're great. There they are.

341
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:17,145
- There aren't many people in the audience.
- No, but they are enthusiastic. Ask them.

342
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:21,463
- Do you like them?
- They're the best!

343
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:25,902
Wait, let's ask some people. What do you think?

344
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,268
- They're crap.
- She's just envious.

345
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:32,547
A thousand for a bit of hash.

346
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:36,185
Hey, where's the toilet?

347
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:39,705
- Over there.
- I can't hear anything. Where?

348
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,142
Wait here, Fabio.

349
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:43,538
Los Melancolicos can't perform.

350
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,347
- You know why, of course.
- I know.

351
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,068
- So Ellos will perform instead.
- Ellos.

352
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,504
Ellos will perform. Ellos.

353
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,659
- Do the introductions, come on.
- Let's go.

354
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,787
Los Melancolicos can't be with you tonight

355
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:10,820
due to problems with drugs, child trafficking,
white slavery and a few other things.

356
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:17,787
But instead, we'll have a group
you all know and hate.

357
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:24,581
Their name is Ellos. But until they arrive,
my friend and I will improvise a song

358
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:30,187
if the deejay doesn't mind playing
a random funky backing track.

359
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,023
We're going to sing it right now. Okay, let's go.

360
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:08,980
How could you change the programme?
We don't want to work with Ellos.

361
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:11,424
- If you forget, I don't.
- Nor do we.

362
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,818
I've talked with Sonobox
and they want to record your album.

363
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,501
Our album?

364
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:21,579
- This is great.
- My God.

365
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,945
Stay away from my boyfriend, you slapper.

366
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:32,901
Eusebio!

367
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:39,740
Eusebio, my darling!
We have to go to the hospital!

368
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,702
To the hospital, sweetie.

369
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,349
- We have to perform.
- Perform? Look at us!

370
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:46,939
- Bastard.
- What do we do now?

371
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,589
I don't know what he tripped over.

372
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:52,581
- Where's the toilet?
- The toilet? Come with me.

373
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:54,068
Let's go to the VIP area.

374
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,628
What, don't you sing?

375
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,700
- I have a sore throat.
- And you?

376
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,583
I'm shy.

377
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:27,981
- Why don't you sing?
- Yeah, right, I'm past it.

378
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,060
Don't be stupid, but...

379
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:34,259
- Let's think of something.
- We'll have to think of something.

380
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:37,147
- How's it going?
- We can play instrumental songs.

381
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,944
- What a great jacket.
- Do you like it?

382
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:43,586
- I love it.
- Want to try it on?

383
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:46,700
- Yes.
- Don't be shy.

384
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:49,701
- I love your make-up.
- Do you like cosmetics?

385
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,667
- I love this.
- It's mine.

386
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,946
- Do you play with it?
- No, we use it to put on make-up.

387
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:58,702
- Is this for the cheeks?
- Yes. You look good.

388
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:05,347
- Do you know a song called Big Bargain?
- Big Bargain, yes, I heard it at Fabio's place.

389
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:09,707
Great, you've given me a wonderful idea.

390
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,824
- This is great.
- Awesome.

391
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:03,743
- I'm on fire.
- What do you think?

392
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,023
- Who, me?
- Yes.

393
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:08,818
- I always wanted to be a rock star.
- Great, congratulations. What's your name?

394
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,422
- Johnny.
- You did great.

395
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,261
The audience is mad for it.

396
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,820
Even Sonobox liked it.
They're going to sign a contract with us.

397
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,627
Really? They liked it?

398
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:21,143
- Not only you, but the girls, too.
- Am I singing?

399
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,379
- You have to.
- Those bitches?

400
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:26,666
Bitches and whatever you want,
but they're really hot.

401
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,741
Yes, yes.

402
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,059
The important thing is that you're happy.

403
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,385
- You, new guy, pick a number.
- Seven.

404
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:37,506
- My favourite number.
- Take a line.

405
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,978
What a great success. We have to celebrate.

406
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:44,948
- Why don't you come home and have a drink?
- To your place?

407
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,866
Well, yes.

408
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,743
- Do you want to come to a party?
- At Garces' place.

409
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,298
Let's go.

410
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,223
What's up with you?

411
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,502
Bloody hell.

412
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:30,544
- Stop, guys.
- What's up?

413
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,825
I don't feel like it today.

414
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:35,264
- You can't leave now.
- Haven't you had enough?

415
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:37,817
Come on, stay.

416
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,068
What's up? Is something wrong?

417
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:56,340
No, nothing.
It must be today's emotions, I don't know.

418
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:59,338
- Let's leave it for some other time.
- You don't mind?

419
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:12,460
- Hi.
- Hi.

420
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:16,027
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.

421
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,345
- You must be wondering why I'm here.
- I'm glad you came.

422
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:29,105
I went to an orgy after the concert,
but I could only think of you.

423
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:32,026
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

424
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:34,424
Same thing happened to me.
I couldn't sleep all night.

425
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,148
- Really?
- I couldn't get you out of my head.

426
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,138
Get into bed, you'll get cold.

427
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,865
- Do you want to lie down, too?
- I'll lie down for a while.

428
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm really glad you came.

429
00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:59,698
- I'm dead tired.
- Do you want to sleep?

430
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:17,224
- Sexi, I want to see you again.
- Me, too.

431
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:22,185
But if you live here, it'll be trouble with Santi.
As you can see, we can't stand each other.

432
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:26,467
- I don't live here. My things are in a hotel.
- That's better.

433
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:28,858
But don't tell them a word about this.

434
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,339
It'd be a lot of trouble,
and I don't want to let you go.

435
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,341
That'll be difficult.

436
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:40,259
I have to leave in a month's time.
I don't live in Madrid.

437
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,625
Really? Where do you live?
I'll go with you, no matter where.

438
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:46,265
In Panama. On the island of Contadora.

439
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,945
On an island? I hate the sea
and the beach. It drives me mad.

440
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:52,781
Why don't we move somewhere else?

441
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:58,342
- My family lives there.
- I don't understand.

442
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,904
I'm the son of the Emperor of Tiran.
I'm incognito in Madrid.

443
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,388
You're Riza Niro?

444
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,588
That's why your face looked familiar to me.

445
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,024
I didn't want to tell anybody,
but I can't lie to you.

446
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,104
I'll go with you, no matter where.

447
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:22,141
- And your family? And the group?
- My dad doesn't care what I do.

448
00:40:22,229 --> 00:40:25,266
And the girls... I'll think of something.

449
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:29,018
But you can't breathe a word to them,
especially with all this going on.

450
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:33,182
- I'll lie to them.
- Don't ever lie to me. I hate it.

451
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:36,261
- To you? I couldn't.
- Very well.

452
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:50,420
Wait here a moment, please.

453
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:58,418
- Those clothes are mine.
- I'm sorry. I didn't notice.

454
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:01,785
- What cheek!
- I swear this is the first time I wore them.

455
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:04,429
If you had asked for them,
you could have borrowed them.

456
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,501
Well, there's a taxi waiting for me.
I'll give you a lift.

457
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,219
- Come on.
- But I'm embarrassed.

458
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:11,901
Don't be shy.

459
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:15,104
Come in.

460
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,342
You're so nice.

461
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,304
I'm a fan of yours, you know?

462
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:26,982
- I've been to all of your concerts.
- Really?

463
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,904
I know all your songs by heart.

464
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,303
I love imitating you.
That's why I'm wearing your clothes.

465
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:37,938
- Don't worry. Do you like music?
- Yes.

466
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:42,387
- It's the only thing that makes me forget.
- Why, aren't you happy with your life?

467
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,063
No. I'd trade it for anybody else's.

468
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:48,380
- How come?
- I have a lot of problems.

469
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:52,144
- Everybody has problems.
- But I'm traumatised.

470
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:54,982
Come on. Tell me, I'm sure it's not that bad.

471
00:41:55,509 --> 00:42:01,345
My mother left us a few months ago.
Now I live with my father, but he's crazy.

472
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:07,026
He mistakes me for my mother
from time to time. And then he forces me.

473
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:08,940
- Do you mean he rapes you?
- Yes.

474
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,344
- And do you let him?
- You don't know how he gets.

475
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:15,308
He goes out of his mind. I don't know what to do.

476
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:18,262
- Perhaps you like it.
- No, of course I don't like it.

477
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:21,421
The thing is, you get used to everything.

478
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,423
Does he do it very often?

479
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,546
- Every second day.
- Incredible. And doesn't he ever skip one?

480
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:33,579
Never. He takes an aphrodisiac every second day,
you know? And that's when he rapes me.

481
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:37,628
- You have to give him an antidote.
- That's what I do. What did you think?

482
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:40,223
But it has no effect.

483
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:45,942
I have a friend called Paco. He's a chemist.
He might tell us what to do.

484
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:48,818
- I ironed your shirt.
- Very well.

485
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:53,744
And don't forget to wear a cotton T-shirt.
It's very cold in Oslo.

486
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:56,389
- All right. Take care of my parakeets.
- Don't worry, I will.

487
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:58,585
- See if they sing, it's important...
- I know. Don't worry.

488
00:42:58,669 --> 00:43:00,625
I'll take care of the birds.

489
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:02,301
- Hello.
- Hello, Sexi.

490
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:06,024
I'm going to Oslo for a couple of days.
Do you want something from there?

491
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:08,577
>From Oslo? I can't think of anything.
Do you want anything from Oslo?

492
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,058
- Me? No, thanks. You're very kind.
- Don't bring her anything.

493
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:13,902
I'm going to pack my luggage. See you later.

494
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:17,106
Shall we make some coffee?
The girls are coming for a rehearsal.

495
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:20,386
- I'll make coffee and some juice.
- Would you like to stay?

496
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:23,108
- Yes, but not for long. I have to leave early.
- Okay.

497
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:25,657
What a pity. Nobody called you this morning.

498
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:29,185
- The telephone didn't ring once.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

499
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:31,147
I'll make the juice.

500
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,660
Cherries, raspberries... I'll make a cocktail.
And I'll also put some papaya in it.

501
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:39,742
But there's no papaya in Spain.
Never mind, I'll use some bananas.

502
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:44,181
At last, I'm shattered.

503
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:48,148
I love your walls.

504
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:50,345
- The colours are great.
- Aren't they?

505
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:55,139
I just love them.
The combination is awesome. Look at it. Pink...

506
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:59,100
I love it. And your father...

507
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:03,179
- He's very good-looking. I like him a lot.
- He's very successful.

508
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:06,820
That's great. Doesn't your mother mind
his being so successful?

509
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:10,788
- My mother died a while ago.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:15,978
- This is too much. Is that your robe?
- Yes.

511
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:22,178
- Hi, Paco, it's Sexi.
- Hi, Sexi, how are you?

512
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:24,140
I'm sitting here with a friend.

513
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:30,099
She has some problems because her father takes
an aphrodisiac every second day and rapes her.

514
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:33,261
Do you know any antidote?

515
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:36,541
- What does her father take?
- Wait a second.

516
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:39,348
- Hey, what does your father take?
- Vitopens.

517
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,547
- Vitopens.
- But that's pure dynamite. There's no antidote.

518
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:48,140
- She's giving him something against it.
- Ask her what it's called.

519
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:52,859
- Wait. What do you give him against Vitopens?
- Benzamuro.

520
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:55,304
- Benzamuro.
- Benzamuro?

521
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:01,302
That's an awful mix. It causes paranoia.
She must stop giving him that.

522
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:04,222
I'll tell her right now.
I'll call you one of these days.

523
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,345
- I hope you will.
- Goodbye.

524
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:10,941
Listen, you can't give him Benzamuro.
The mix is what makes him paranoid.

525
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:15,864
- Really?
- Yes. Unless you want him to shag you every day.

526
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,667
- No.
- Then there's nothing we can do.

527
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:21,219
- That's not the point.
- I'm going to take this off, I can't stand it.

528
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:26,501
- Hello.
- Hello.

529
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:31,026
- What's up?
- Queti, Angustias and Nana.

530
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:33,065
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

531
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:36,585
- I'm tired but delighted, darling.
- That's good.

532
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:42,781
- Do you work in the music industry?
- No, I'm just a fan of Sexi's.

533
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,063
- I see.
- One of my fans.

534
00:45:44,149 --> 00:45:48,222
Leave that thing alone, it makes me nervous.

535
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:53,058
The thing is, I'd like to be a singer like her.

536
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:54,980
- Well, go ahead. It's the best life.
- Really?

537
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:59,824
I had a huge complex, but I started
to play the drums and now I'm cured.

538
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:01,501
- Why did you have a complex?
- Let me explain.

539
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:03,819
She had very fat thighs.

540
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:06,702
- Weak nails.
- And dry lips.

541
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:10,027
And I swallow air when I eat, so I fart.

542
00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:12,705
- That's all easy to solve.
- I don't think so.

543
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:15,542
- You'll see. I'll give you something for your lips.
- Really?

544
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:18,587
I'll love it. Look.

545
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:21,578
- Shut up.
- She says I scratch.

546
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,307
- Try this.
- Are you sure?

547
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:29,783
- Ten grams of cocoa butter, three of castor oil...
- Let's see.

548
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:35,102
...one gram of KTQ extract, two drops of birch oil

549
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:42,061
and five grams of vadiana oil.
Use it and you'll be a new woman.

550
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,344
Where did you learn all that?

551
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:48,661
Nowhere. I learnt this at home.
My father has a lot of problems...

552
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:52,901
He buys every single beauty magazine,
and I read them, too.

553
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:55,628
So if you want anything, just let me know.

554
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:59,941
- Give me something to be ugly.
- She needs something to be more intelligent.

555
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:01,428
Yes, my God. Look.

556
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:05,058
- I can give you some gum if you want.
- Do you have mint?

557
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:09,665
Mint flavour?
I have electric and rubber. It's up to you.

558
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,983
Come on! No way!

559
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:15,378
- No. No!
- Come on.

560
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:18,541
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, girl!

561
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:23,541
- Come on, I'll give you something for your thighs.
- For my thighs? Yes.

562
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:26,701
- And for your flatulence.
- Don't say a word, but that's my biggest complex.

563
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:28,780
I'm not surprised. I'll give you something.

564
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:34,660
You have to do five push-ups every morning
in front of the window, naked if possible.

565
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:37,104
- Five?
- Cold, freezing.

566
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,259
- How are you doing?
- Very well.

567
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:40,941
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

568
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,781
- I have great news.
- Do you?

569
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:44,905
Yes. The guys are recording with Sonobox.

570
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:46,866
- Wow.
- That's great.

571
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:50,908
But it's good news. It's a record company
like all the others. A bunch of bastards,

572
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:52,866
- but it's a record company.
- I didn't know about it.

573
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,780
You look relaxed. So I give you the news

574
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:57,337
- and you just...
- But what do you want?

575
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:01,263
- Didn't you know?
- No.

576
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:05,865
- Sexi, I have to leave.
- Okay. I'll ring you at the dry cleaner's.

577
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,021
- Great, and I'll give this back. I promise.
- Don't worry about it.

578
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:10,861
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

579
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:13,463
If this works, I'll owe you one.

580
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,020
Be very careful with her.
She's a nasty nymphomaniac.

581
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:21,461
At first we were a duo.
Then she was in the group for a while,

582
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:24,666
but we had to kick her out.
All she thought about was sex.

583
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:27,821
Now she's formed a group
with these two guys' ex-girlfriends

584
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:33,029
and they only want to give us a hard time.
The less you talk to them the better.

585
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:45,297
- Hello.
- Hello. What's up?

586
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:51,498
- Hey, how are you? How's your leg?
- Fine. I heard you're recording an album.

587
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:56,386
- So I'm out now that I'm injured?
- Look...

588
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:59,541
I sing with my mouth, not with my leg.

589
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:04,828
Yes, but the company wants Johnny to sing.
They saw him and they liked him better.

590
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,900
- We're sorry.
- I see. You're a bunch of bastards.

591
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,184
- I'd thrash you if I weren't injured.
- Eusebio!

592
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:11,021
- Eusebio, you're going to fall down.
- Relax.

593
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:13,828
I told you they'd kick you out
before you even knew. My God.

594
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,183
Eusebio!

595
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:18,261
- Relax.
- And what's with you, poof?

596
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:22,467
- Watch out.
- What are you doing?

597
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:34,141
- Relax. Don't touch me.
- Eusebio, come on, let's go.

598
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:42,425
- You'll hear from me.
- And you from us, about the papers.

599
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:43,783
Leave it, guys.

600
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:49,860
You know what? I'm glad. Anyway, you've been...

601
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:54,188
How long have you been with them?
Two, three years? And you've made no money.

602
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:59,468
As if I would sing in a girl band.
We won't get anywhere like this, Eusebio.

603
00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:02,382
We're not two kids anymore,
and I just want to get married.

604
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:08,066
You should study computer science.
I've heard there's a great future there.

605
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:11,981
What's up?

606
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:19,458
- You won't believe it if I explain.
- Try, see what happens.

607
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:24,624
I have a very good sense of smell.
Better than normal.

608
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:29,701
I've been looking for a friend
for a few days and one of you smells of him.

609
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:33,982
- Are you kidding or what?
- Eusebio, leave him. He's obviously high.

610
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:38,665
- What are you doing?
- Your hand smells of him. Just tell me one thing.

611
00:50:40,189 --> 00:50:44,660
- Who have you touched this evening?
- Come on. What's your friend's name?

612
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:50,577
- I don't know.
- Come on, pal, that's enough.

613
00:50:50,669 --> 00:50:55,220
I tolerate junkies, but enough is enough.
Don't be stupid. Go on, sod off.

614
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:05,658
Sadec, we've received the parcel
from our spy in Contadora.

615
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:08,627
- They're sending a shirt of Riza Niro's.
- Really?

616
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,379
They couldn't get his address.
We'll have to look for him.

617
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,381
- You'll have to give us a hand.
- Don't count on my nose.

618
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:18,541
- It's seized up.
- What's wrong? Have you got a cold?

619
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:21,621
- No, I'm in love.
- What?

620
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:25,065
- In love?
- Yes. I hadn't told you this,

621
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:31,220
but when I'm in love I can only smell that person.

622
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:35,941
- I can only smell the guy I met the other day.
- This is too much.

623
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:39,385
Sadec, you realise
what this kidnapping means for Tiranian people.

624
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,505
I understand, but I have my own problems.

625
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:45,582
Do you think your love life is
more important than the fate of your people?

626
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,058
- It is to me.
- You're perverse.

627
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:53,826
Thanks to that and his nose,
he can find Riza easier than us.

628
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,501
- Look.
- He's also a homosexual.

629
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:59,025
The places they go to are dumps.

630
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:02,706
We'll plan everything tomorrow.
I'm very tired now.

631
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:41,868
It's him!

632
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:45,388
It's him!

633
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:49,018
It's him!

634
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:12,146
- Dad, I'm going to do the shopping.
- All right.

635
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,667
- Don't take too long. There's a lot to do.
- I won't, Dad.

636
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,986
Come on, before he reads the letter
and comes out running.

637
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,866
The taxi is waiting for us there.

638
00:53:29,149 --> 00:53:32,027
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Of course.

639
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:39,784
I've brought a suitcase with my clothes.
I'll go visit you as soon as I can.

640
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:42,303
- Great.
- But you can call me whenever you want.

641
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,302
- Everything is paid for, so that's not a problem.
- Fantastic.

642
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,857
- Are you nervous?
- I'm delighted.

643
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:50,866
And how're things with you?

644
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:55,301
It's wonderful. I feel like crazy. The thing is,

645
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:58,825
- it's so beautiful it scares me sometimes.
- Why?

646
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:02,026
- You have a lot of experience with men, Sexi.
- I know.

647
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:06,580
But my experience won't help me here.
With him I want to be different.

648
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,297
- And what's he like in bed?
- I don't know.

649
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:15,422
- What? You haven't shagged him?
- No. I don't know.

650
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:19,627
I don't want it to be the same
with him as with the others.

651
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:26,102
But I'm sure he's longing for it.
Hasn't he laid a hand on you?

652
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:30,383
Now that I think of it, he hasn't.
Do you think he doesn't find me attractive?

653
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,460
Come on, don't be stupid.

654
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:37,862
I'm sure he's horny all the time.
But you've become so discreet...

655
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:43,103
Sure. I told him since the beginning
that we should respect each other.

656
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:47,023
You told him that? That's so old-fashioned.
You don't look the same anymore.

657
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,667
Neither do you.

658
00:55:08,669 --> 00:55:13,106
CLINIC - OUR LADY OF BEAUTY
COSMETIC SURGERY

659
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:15,467
This is wonderful.

660
00:55:17,229 --> 00:55:20,699
Gorgeous. It's the best.

661
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:25,577
- Good morning.
- Hi. We lack everything but want nothing.

662
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:27,546
At least let me show you what I have.

663
00:55:27,629 --> 00:55:29,506
- How long do you need?
- Just one minute.

664
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:32,422
- One minute? All right. Go ahead.
- Yes.

665
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:37,947
These are made of a cosmic metal,
mined from the Earth's core.

666
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:43,543
- I don't understand. I'm uneducated.
- I thought so, but it's not your fault.

667
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:44,903
Thanks.

668
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:48,819
Due to its proximity to the centre of the Earth,

669
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:52,663
it channels the positive vibrations of the stars.

670
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,580
That sounds good.

671
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:59,382
Since you were a child, you've always had
a clear influence from the stars.

672
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:04,907
- I didn't know that.
- You've probably only received bad vibrations.

673
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:07,822
- I've received all of those.
- Of course, so...

674
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:11,458
- You should try to change your situation.
- Should I buy a medal from you?

675
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:14,382
Yes, one or two. This will change your luck.

676
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:17,063
- My love life?
- It will be completely satisfactory.

677
00:56:17,149 --> 00:56:21,700
- And work-wise?
- Work-wise? Do you have a job? No, you don't.

678
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:26,946
If you did, you wouldn't need to do much
and you'd have loads of money.

679
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:29,702
- All right, your minute is over.
- Aren't you going to buy a medal?

680
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:31,507
- I'm not interested.
- For a poor relative?

681
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,706
- I have no relatives, rich or poor.
- All right.

682
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,337
Angel.

683
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:47,428
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. I've been talking to my mother.

684
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:51,939
You look very good. You've changed a lot.

685
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:57,103
I was a child when you met me,
and now I'm a woman.

686
00:56:57,669 --> 00:57:00,581
- And what a woman!
- Thanks.

687
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:04,738
- Are you going anywhere?
- To Pontejos, to buy tape for my hats.

688
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:08,344
- And what are you doing here?
- Nothing much, just selling some medals.

689
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:10,340
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes, sure.

690
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:11,908
- Shall we take the lift?
- Yes, it's here.

691
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,822
- Very well.
- Come in.

692
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:17,025
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

693
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:20,067
- Thanks.
- Hi.

694
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:25,979
- You don't have dry lips anymore.
- No weak nails, either.

695
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:31,901
- And your thighs are thinner.
- By the way, in case you want to know,

696
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:37,220
I don't swallow air anymore.
I don't get bloated and I don't fart.

697
00:57:39,029 --> 00:57:43,739
- Will you forgive me someday?
- It depends. We'll see.

698
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:47,906
- We should date again.
- And the group?

699
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:49,906
- They don't need to know.
- Don't they?

700
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:53,061
- And Sexilia?
- I won't say anything.

701
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:58,059
Take them, take them.

702
00:57:58,429 --> 00:58:02,741
Soft as silk. They're yours, not mine.

703
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:08,018
We talk much about love,
but we haven't discussed sex yet.

704
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:13,866
- Please, can't you go a few days without sex?
- Of course. But it's not about that.

705
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:18,188
Please, understand this. It's the first time
I've been with a guy without shagging him

706
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,624
and without taking drugs, and I feel very good.

707
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:25,778
I want you to know my past. I've had affairs

708
00:58:26,029 --> 00:58:29,817
- and I'd like...
- I'd rather not know. I'd get very jealous.

709
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:32,509
Leave the past behind. Yours and mine.

710
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,825
I've had affairs as well.
More than you, that's for sure.

711
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:43,187
- You know what? Let's think about the future.
- The future. That's the problem.

712
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:47,220
I can only offer you a future
full of luxury and uncertainty.

713
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,345
But don't think about that now.

714
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:53,462
Enjoy making your album
and then we'll go to Contadora, and we'll see.

715
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:55,545
Would you like to be an empress?

716
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:59,943
- It would be an experience.
- My mother wants us to go back to Tiran.

717
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:05,149
I'm sure it's not more difficult
than managing bitches like Angustias and Nana.

718
00:59:19,709 --> 00:59:22,098
- Shall I make your bed?
- No, thanks.

719
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:31,505
Come in.

720
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:46,022
- Can I make your bed, madam?
- Yes.

721
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:54,860
- Do you think I look good?
- Yes. You look as good as in the magazines.

722
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:12,379
Don't you even dare ring me.
I don't want to know anything about you.

723
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:18,305
- But you can ring me whenever you want.
- Keep your generosity for your husband.

724
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:22,184
- I've given you the best I had.
- And the worst, too.

725
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:26,018
When a woman like me gives herself,
she gives it all.

726
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:29,818
We've arrived.
Please, stop here a moment. I'll go on.

727
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:32,981
Darling, think of it. We're still in time to go back.

728
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:34,787
I want to erase you from my life.

729
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:39,989
I found you here and I'll leave you here, too.
This time I won't come in. I'll just go by.

730
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:44,187
- As if I hadn't met you.
- All right. Too bad for you.

731
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:52,659
You're a swine. And don't you ever ring me!

732
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:55,821
You, either. Come on.

733
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:12,500
Darling, I'm back.

734
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:15,262
Remedios, is that you?

735
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:20,305
- At last!
- I couldn't live without you.

736
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:23,859
- And our child? Queti?
- She's gone.

737
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:30,298
That's normal. If I had left at her age,
I wouldn't have done it now.

738
01:02:30,389 --> 01:02:32,664
But the important thing is that you're back.

739
01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:37,301
You don't know how sad it is to be abandoned
by your wife and your daughter.

740
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:41,143
- Especially once you're old.
- Don't say that.

741
01:02:41,229 --> 01:02:44,027
- You look better every day.
- But look,

742
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:50,219
- I took care of myself, in case you came back.
- You're so good to me.

743
01:02:50,589 --> 01:02:54,343
I won't leave ever again. I promise.

744
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:57,501
Besides, our girl will come
to visit us one of these days.

745
01:02:57,589 --> 01:03:01,548
She'll tell us she's happy
and she'll be more experienced. You'll see.

746
01:03:01,629 --> 01:03:04,507
You know much about life, so if you say so...

747
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,502
Handsome.

748
01:03:08,229 --> 01:03:12,745
Good morning. What have you brought?

749
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:17,857
You look amazing.
How did you lose so much weight?

750
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:20,459
Doctor! How are you?

751
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:25,020
- Hello, Susana. What a coincidence.
- It's no coincidence. I came to see you.

752
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:29,102
- I can't. I have to leave now.
- Please, let's have a coffee.

753
01:03:29,189 --> 01:03:31,464
- All right, a coffee.
- Sure.

754
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:36,301
I wanted to talk to you about Sexilia.
She's not coming to my office, and I'm worried.

755
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:40,667
I guess that means she doesn't need you.
She looks much better lately.

756
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:45,425
But what would you know? You don't know her,
and you haven't taken care of her.

757
01:03:45,509 --> 01:03:48,626
- Did you come to tell me off?
- No. Not at all.

758
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:54,147
I came to talk about sex.
I want to have sex with you.

759
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:02,784
I'll be honest. I've never been
interested in sex, not even when I was young.

760
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:06,908
There's something dirty and disgusting
about the union of two bodies.

761
01:04:07,749 --> 01:04:12,948
That's why I've devoted my work
to artificial insemination.

762
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:18,178
But how can someone so elegant and handsome,

763
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:24,698
with that voice and those suggestive eyes,
say something so stupid?

764
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:28,345
- It's because you haven't had proper sex.
- Please.

765
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:32,217
I can prove you wrong. Tell me.

766
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:36,461
- Please, Susana.
- Tell me one thing. Is there something you like?

767
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:38,779
Do you do anything special in bed? Tell me.

768
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:43,897
Tell me. You can trust me, I'm a psychologist.
Tell me. I'm not fastidious.

769
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,945
- Waiter, the bill, please.
- I like everything.

770
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:48,907
- You can trust me...
- Keep the change.

771
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:51,298
- Can't you?
- I think we've talked enough.

772
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:57,305
No, no. Don't worry,
it was a scientific joke. Wait, please.

773
01:04:57,389 --> 01:05:00,347
I'm a devoted researcher.

774
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:04,258
If you don't like experiments,
we can stick to theory. We can work together.

775
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,260
Please, let go of me. People are looking at us.

776
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:10,422
- Don't worry about me.
- The girl... Thanks.

777
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:13,785
She still has some problems.
You and I can help her...

778
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:17,987
- Leave us both alone.
- But I finally...

779
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:29,819
- Good morning, Princess.
- Good morning.

780
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,540
There's a telegram for you.

781
01:05:51,389 --> 01:05:54,620
"Riza is staying in the same hotel as you.
Room number three.

782
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:59,385
"Couldn't get Emperor's semen.
Sarah furious to know you are fertile. "

783
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:06,063
- Hello.
- Hello.

784
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:09,666
- Don't you recognise me?
- No, I don't think so.

785
01:06:12,029 --> 01:06:14,589
I think we'll get to know each other soon.

786
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:55,578
- What are you doing here?
- And you?

787
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:57,580
I asked first.

788
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,345
- You wouldn't imagine.
- No.

789
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:03,258
- Can't you tell?
- You're a bitch.

790
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:04,907
How dare you?

791
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:09,864
- You are the biggest man-eater in the country.
- That was before. Riza's love has changed me.

792
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:13,100
- Riza's love?
- Yes, we're together.

793
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,699
That's terrible. I can't even imagine it.

794
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:20,543
Why have you done it? You've had
everything a woman wants. Money, beauty, fame.

795
01:07:20,629 --> 01:07:23,462
You've been an empress.
You've done movies. What else do you want?

796
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:27,947
I have a long-standing debt
with his father and the people of Tiran.

797
01:07:28,229 --> 01:07:30,345
And Toraya always pays.

798
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:35,979
- You haven't given up.
- History has been unfair to me.

799
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:41,223
- I had to prove they were wrong.
- And did you have to shag my boyfriend?

800
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,659
- He's a Salebi. That's enough.
- You're crazy.

801
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:49,025
- Riza could have had better taste.
- Really?

802
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:53,702
- I was the first woman in his life.
- You're nuts!

803
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:56,667
- Ask him.
- Sexi, I didn't think you'd come so early.

804
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:58,467
- Yes, I see.
- Well...

805
01:07:59,549 --> 01:08:02,825
- Let me explain. Probably...
- Have you told her she was your first woman?

806
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:04,820
- Yes, but let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain!

807
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,865
It's not what you are thinking.

808
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,588
When I said there shouldn't be lies
I meant with other people, not each other.

809
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:13,899
Sexi, I love you.

810
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:17,228
- Stop lying.
- You're the most important thing in my life.

811
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:18,662
- If you wanted to shag...
- No, no.

812
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:23,027
...you only had to say so. This is ridiculous.
We spoke so much about love.

813
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:25,388
Is this love?

814
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:30,942
- Don't worry. I'll never fall in love again.
- Sexi!

815
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,746
Who's calling like that? Oh, it's you.

816
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:13,663
- I knew you'd come back.
- The sun.

817
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:17,464
The sun in Spain.

818
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:21,266
Wait for me here. I'll be with you right now.

819
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:29,977
Alicia, I'm sorry. We can't continue.
Someone has worse problems than you.

820
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:33,618
- Worse than me? I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid. Sit down, come on.

821
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:37,497
I don't want to. I should throw myself
out of the window and cut the psychology thing.

822
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:40,661
- I'd be better off.
- Take this pill.

823
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:44,299
Relax, now. Sleep. Be good.

824
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:54,985
Sleep, sleep. And who's going to the airport
this afternoon? Crappy psychologists!

825
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:59,305
The sun is very hot.

826
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:03,226
The sun is burning me.

827
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:07,701
- Where are you?
- On the beach,

828
01:10:08,869 --> 01:10:10,587
and he's by my side.

829
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:13,183
We're playing.

830
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:16,980
Drill me a little hole. A hole.

831
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:18,458
To breathe.

832
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:22,777
What's up?

833
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:32,184
Riza, let's play hide-and-seek.

834
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:35,186
Can you fetch us?

835
01:10:53,949 --> 01:11:00,138
Why are you so cruel? Just like your father.
Don't reject me, too. Don't you like me?

836
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:04,905
Riza, you could make me pregnant.
Please, don't leave.

837
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:10,905
- Come with me. Come on. Leave her. Let's play.
- I like you so much. Please, don't leave.

838
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,901
He prefers her.

839
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,623
- Dad, Dad, come here.
- I can't right now.

840
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,428
- There's a lady here. Come.
- I can't right now.

841
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:25,508
- Come!
- I can't. I have to talk to that man. Let go.

842
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:44,466
Hey, do you want to play
husband and wife with us?

843
01:11:44,549 --> 01:11:46,619
- I want to, too.
- Me, too.

844
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,064
Yes, I'll be the wife of you all.

845
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,704
Life is so unfair to me!

846
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:24,540
- Madam!
- Hello, Melinda.

847
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:27,427
The telephone didn't stop ringing today.

848
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,979
A friend called to say she's waiting
for you in the bar around the corner.

849
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:35,904
- And when did she call?
- Just now. About 10 minutes ago.

850
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:39,265
- A boy called, too, Manuel Angel.
- Yes.

851
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:42,142
He'll be waiting for you
this afternoon on Orellana Street

852
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:44,504
- to take some pictures.
- All right.

853
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:48,658
But look at you, you look ragged! Turn around.

854
01:12:48,749 --> 01:12:51,217
- A foreigner called, too.
- And what did he say?

855
01:12:51,309 --> 01:12:54,779
- He said... He phoned several times.
- Tell me what he said.

856
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:59,021
- He said he was rehearsing, and it was urgent.
- Okay.

857
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,619
And Angel phoned, too.

858
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:06,745
He wanted to have dinner with her tonight.
And little Carolina,

859
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:10,026
a friend from her childhood.
They went to school together.

860
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:21,106
This is crazy.

861
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:24,578
- Hi. Have you finished yet?
- What do you think?

862
01:13:24,669 --> 01:13:28,662
I thought you weren't coming.
What's up? Are you tired?

863
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:32,298
- Order something simple. I'm knackered.
- Thanks, I don't want anything.

864
01:13:32,389 --> 01:13:35,984
- What's up?
- I went to see Johnny in the morning.

865
01:13:36,589 --> 01:13:40,707
I haven't told you yet,
but he's the son of the Emperor of Tiran.

866
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:42,388
You're kidding!

867
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:46,902
Let's go to the toilet,
you have to change your clothes.

868
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:51,585
- And we're very obvious here. I'll tell you later.
- Let's go.

869
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:57,066
When I left the hotel,
I decided not to see him ever again.

870
01:13:58,549 --> 01:14:02,508
But after knowing
about Toraya and the beach... I don't know.

871
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:07,062
You have to tell him everything. What happened
on the beach happened again in the hotel,

872
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:11,939
but you're not 10 anymore.
Don't let Toraya win again.

873
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:15,466
You're right.
But why did he have to sleep with her?

874
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:18,822
Is it so hard to live without sex for a few days?

875
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:21,383
Don't be silly.
Who cares about one fuck more or less?

876
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:25,747
It's all clear now and you love him.
Find him and explain that to him.

877
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:31,461
Or do you prefer Toraya to go with him to Tiran,
overthrow the regime and become empress?

878
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:34,825
- You're right.
- You can't make it easy for her.

879
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:37,821
Besides, if you don't go with Riza,
what would we do, now we're identical?

880
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:41,060
You're right. There's no turning back.

881
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:47,140
I'll go to his rehearsal.
The keys to my house are in your jacket.

882
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:54,140
Take the suitcase. And you have
an appointment at 5:00 to take some pictures.

883
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,108
Hurry up.

884
01:14:57,669 --> 01:15:01,867
- Melinda, how do I look?
- You look very beautiful, madam.

885
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:04,782
- Don't I look a bit weird?
- No more than usual.

886
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:08,623
I have to take some pictures for the album.

887
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:12,258
Go see your father
and be nice to him. He looks very sad.

888
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:15,307
My father? But I'm in a hurry,
I haven't got time. I have to do...

889
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:18,859
- Take him this tea and talk to him.
- Where is he?

890
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:25,099
- In his office. Third door on the right.
- Of course, the office. Where's my mind?

891
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:31,378
This girl is incredible! She has no memory! She's
lived here for 20 years and can't find her way!

892
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:42,780
Dad, you've been here for hours.
Have some tea, it will do you good.

893
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:45,182
What's wrong?

894
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:50,102
I've never told anybody,
but I feel frustrated with my job.

895
01:15:50,189 --> 01:15:51,463
Why?

896
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:55,142
There's no happiness in anything I do.

897
01:15:56,069 --> 01:16:00,665
Mari Carmen, the test-tube girl,
is not normal. She's a monster.

898
01:16:01,589 --> 01:16:03,466
And the parakeets don't sing.

899
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:08,427
If they don't sing, they aren't perfect.
So I've done an imperfect job.

900
01:16:08,749 --> 01:16:13,539
Let me think. If the birds don't sing,
there are only two possible reasons.

901
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:19,977
They're either old or sad.
And you just made them, so they can't be old.

902
01:16:20,069 --> 01:16:22,060
In that case, they must be sad.

903
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:26,745
- And what can I do?
- Give them vitamins and antibiotics.

904
01:16:27,069 --> 01:16:30,505
I happen to have some here. I'll give it to them.

905
01:16:31,469 --> 01:16:34,427
You might be right. I hadn't thought of that.

906
01:16:34,509 --> 01:16:38,548
You should take some, too, Dad.
You work too much.

907
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:43,944
Your psychologist is right when she says
I should get to know you better.

908
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:48,500
It can't be today.
I have to take some pictures, but if you want,

909
01:16:48,589 --> 01:16:51,308
- tonight we can have dinner together.
- All right. Where shall we go?

910
01:16:51,389 --> 01:16:54,665
- Right here. I'll cook.
- But can you cook?

911
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:56,228
Very well.

912
01:16:57,469 --> 01:17:00,347
And I don't want to
see you like this when I come back.

913
01:17:05,549 --> 01:17:09,428
It's been a wonderful experience,
but I have to leave you.

914
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:14,183
What are you saying?
You just recorded the album. How dare you?

915
01:17:14,269 --> 01:17:17,864
It's dangerous for me to stay here,
and it could affect you, too.

916
01:17:18,309 --> 01:17:21,745
- What's he talking about?
- He's always kept things from us.

917
01:17:21,829 --> 01:17:24,343
Yes, I have.

918
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:29,986
But I want to give you a present before I leave,
so you can buy clothes and records.

919
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:32,788
- Wicked.
- Wait a moment.

920
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:34,945
This is not necessary.

921
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:39,666
- What's this for?
- This?

922
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:43,025
- For the cover of our album.
- Are you recording an album?

923
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:44,383
Of course.

924
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:48,339
- And why did you come here?
- We want to shine like lamps.

925
01:17:48,829 --> 01:17:52,708
You were playing
at Carolina the other day, weren't you?

926
01:17:53,109 --> 01:17:55,828
- Yes, did you see it? How did you like it?
- You were crap.

927
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,979
You're just so rude, darling.

928
01:17:58,469 --> 01:18:02,018
And cheeky as a bitch. I'm going to break
your lamps if you don't shut up.

929
01:18:02,109 --> 01:18:04,498
And I'll make your face look like a spotlight.

930
01:18:04,789 --> 01:18:07,747
You're just naff.

931
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:11,981
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's wrong with your voice?

932
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:14,259
- How do I look?
- I have a bit of a cold.

933
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:18,425
Kiss her and infect her. She's a bitch.

934
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:27,028
- Eusebio, look who's here.
- Forget them.

935
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:32,742
This is great for our living room.

936
01:18:33,829 --> 01:18:37,902
Babe, look at this. It's just too cute!

937
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:40,708
Pick the one you like.

938
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:42,905
- Really?
- Really.

939
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:48,779
I'd like the glass to stand out.

940
01:18:48,869 --> 01:18:50,621
- This...
- It's a bit naff, isn't it?

941
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:55,544
Maybe a little,
but it doesn't matter. Let it be naff.

942
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:58,462
As long as it's shiny.

943
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:06,145
"Riza Niro disappeared from Panama
to live a happy exile in Madrid.

944
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:12,020
"We will reward the person
who takes us to him. Call 2618430 any time. "

945
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:16,902
Eusebio, they're all so pretty.
I can't make up my mind.

946
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:19,708
Darling, isn't he that queer, Johnny?

947
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:23,628
- He looks a bit like him.
- Doesn't he?

948
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:24,858
Yes.

949
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:30,702
Isn't this the guy who replaced me?

950
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,819
- Yes, he looks a bit like him.
- Definitely. Why?

951
01:19:34,909 --> 01:19:37,662
- Can you see this? Riza Niro.
- The son of the Emperor of Tiran?

952
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:40,661
Listen, this says he's the son
of the Emperor of Tiran. The singer from Ellos.

953
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:43,058
Awesome. This will be great for promotion.

954
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:45,709
- That's bullshit. It has nothing to do with Riza.
- Look at him.

955
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:47,268
- Where are they now?
- Rehearsing.

956
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,180
- Look at him.
- Excuse me, is there a telephone here?

957
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:51,066
- Downstairs.
- My God...

958
01:19:51,149 --> 01:19:53,617
- I have to make a phone call...
- My boyfriend goes first.

959
01:19:53,709 --> 01:19:55,540
- But...
- Let go!

960
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:59,178
- Come here, bitch. If I catch you... Come here!
- Leave me alone!

961
01:20:00,989 --> 01:20:03,867
You old cow! You're naff!

962
01:20:03,949 --> 01:20:05,780
Your father's naff!

963
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:17,742
Hello? I'm calling about the advert.
Yes, the Emperor's son sings with a band.

964
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:20,544
- Who are you?
- The money.

965
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:24,463
Muslim students. Their name is "Ellos".

966
01:20:25,069 --> 01:20:28,379
They're rehearsing. How much is the reward?

967
01:20:29,509 --> 01:20:33,627
- All right. The address is 220 Warble Street.
- Don't give them the address.

968
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,945
- I'll see you there.
- Eusebio, for God's sake,

969
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:37,826
how do you intend to collect the reward?

970
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:40,742
- You're stupid, my love, you're thick. Walk.
- Come on, let's go.

971
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:42,501
It'll take us forever with your leg.

972
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:47,017
Hello?

973
01:20:48,269 --> 01:20:51,306
- One second, I'll let them know.
- Do you know if they're rehearsing?

974
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:55,587
- Yes. Can you tell them they have a call?
- Who is it?

975
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:57,660
- Hello?
- Is Sexilia around?

976
01:20:57,789 --> 01:21:02,260
- Queti, it's Sexi. What's up?
- Eusebio has called the Muslims about Riza.

977
01:21:02,349 --> 01:21:04,783
- They're on their way. Get out, fast!
- No.

978
01:21:04,869 --> 01:21:07,542
Thanks, I'll tell him right now. Goodbye.

979
01:21:08,309 --> 01:21:12,188
- We have to go to the studio right away.
- But I'm having dinner with my dad.

980
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:16,057
- With your dad? What's up with him now?
- I had a sudden rush of filial love.

981
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:19,380
Let's go. Let's go.

982
01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:24,341
You've been discovered!
The Muslims are on their way.

983
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:27,060
It had to happen sooner or later.

984
01:21:27,149 --> 01:21:28,662
- What are you talking about?
- What's up?

985
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:31,980
Nothing. I'm the son of the Emperor of Tiran.
And I'm being chased right now.

986
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:33,422
- Riza Niro?
- Riza Niro?

987
01:21:33,509 --> 01:21:37,343
- Come on, we have no time to spare.
- Why don't we all go to Contadora?

988
01:21:37,429 --> 01:21:40,182
That's it! This money will be enough.
Give me that.

989
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:42,463
Do you have your passports?

990
01:21:42,549 --> 01:21:43,823
- Yes.
- What a coincidence.

991
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:45,820
Okay, then, let's go.

992
01:21:46,549 --> 01:21:48,301
And our record? And promotion?

993
01:21:48,389 --> 01:21:53,702
- And our work?
- I've enough money for us all. To the Caribbean!

994
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:03,178
- Can I come to the airport, if you don't mind?
- To the airport?

995
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:06,981
You're coming to Contadora
with me, like we had planned.

996
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:11,506
- Otherwise, I'll stay here and let them catch me.
- No!

997
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,139
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the airport.

998
01:22:16,229 --> 01:22:17,457
But please, don't tell anybody.

999
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:39,898
I have to hang up. My laxative is taking effect.
I'll call you later, okay? Bye.

1000
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:48,225
- Where are they?
- They're not here. Let go, I'm crapping myself.

1001
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:49,662
- Where are they?
- They left.

1002
01:22:49,749 --> 01:22:50,943
- Where?
- To the airport.

1003
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:52,303
- All of them?
- Yes, all of them.

1004
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:54,107
- Long ago?
- Yes, yes.

1005
01:22:54,189 --> 01:22:57,545
- Let go!
- I like you. I have no time now, but I'll be back.

1006
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:17,428
- Paca, are they in there? What's up?
- They left.

1007
01:23:17,509 --> 01:23:19,739
- Where?
- I'll crap myself right here.

1008
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,060
- To the airport. I can't hold it anymore!
- Have you seen some Muslim guys, madam?

1009
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:26,937
- I don't understand.
- Muslim is like Arab. Dark skin and hair.

1010
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:29,589
There are very dark and weird people
around here. I can't hold it anymore.

1011
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:31,387
- Madam, please.
- I can't anymore.

1012
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:33,664
I can't hold it anymore, let me go in!

1013
01:23:33,749 --> 01:23:38,220
I'm Jaime Roca, from Howmagazine.
I wanted to interview Ellos.

1014
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:41,701
- Where did they go?
- To the airport.

1015
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:43,939
- You can go in now.
- To the airport, come on!

1016
01:23:44,029 --> 01:23:45,621
Hurry!

1017
01:23:47,549 --> 01:23:51,986
I wanted to explain everything and apologise.
I used to like boys until I met you.

1018
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:55,459
You made me forget them,
but my past was torturing me.

1019
01:23:55,549 --> 01:24:00,020
I didn't know if it would work with you.
I tried to explain, but you never let me.

1020
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:02,782
That doesn't explain the thing with Toraya.
She's not a boy, that I know.

1021
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:07,067
She came into my room. When she asked me
to have sex with her, I didn't hesitate.

1022
01:24:07,149 --> 01:24:12,018
She was the first woman I had sex with,
but not the love of my life as she said.

1023
01:24:12,109 --> 01:24:14,748
Do you understand it? It was just training.

1024
01:24:16,589 --> 01:24:20,423
I knew you were very experienced,
and I was scared of disappointing you.

1025
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:24,543
You didn't trust me very much, did you?
I've also been a bit silly.

1026
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:28,938
- I was a nymphomaniac until I met you.
- I know, I'd heard.

1027
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:32,419
But that was long ago. Now I only like you.

1028
01:24:33,149 --> 01:24:36,983
But I have to tell you something
very important. It's all Toraya's fault.

1029
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:38,661
Why? I told you she has nothing to do with it.

1030
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:41,900
Your nymphomania and mine.
My phobia for sun and all that.

1031
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:44,867
- No, I told you I used her.
- Not at all.

1032
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:47,907
Do you remember 15 years ago,
when you spent the summer on the Costa del Sol?

1033
01:24:49,509 --> 01:24:55,744
Passengers flying to Contadora,
please board through gate number four.

1034
01:24:58,109 --> 01:24:59,542
- To Contadora.
- To Contadora.

1035
01:24:59,789 --> 01:25:02,747
Can't you hear that?
The flight will depart in five minutes.

1036
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:04,706
- Can we buy tickets here?
- Over there, I don't know.

1037
01:25:04,789 --> 01:25:06,302
Come on.

1038
01:25:07,509 --> 01:25:09,420
Christ! Poofs!

1039
01:25:13,749 --> 01:25:16,980
I can smell him. Over here. Now!

1040
01:25:23,629 --> 01:25:25,142
To the Caribbean!

1041
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:28,861
- If they took a plane, where would they go?
- To Contadora, of course.

1042
01:25:28,949 --> 01:25:30,098
Of course.

1043
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:33,740
- Are there any flights to Panama?
- Yes, it's taking off right now.

1044
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:36,627
- Call the pilot. They can't take off.
- Why?

1045
01:25:37,469 --> 01:25:40,108
- There's a bomb.
- Well, I'm afraid you're late.

1046
01:25:40,189 --> 01:25:43,226
- And some passengers have infectious diseases.
- Yes.

1047
01:25:43,309 --> 01:25:46,346
Leave me alone. People know what they're
exposed to when they board on a plane.

1048
01:25:46,429 --> 01:25:49,466
- We have to get into that plane.
- You should have come earlier.

1049
01:25:53,469 --> 01:25:55,824
Have you seen four trendy girls?

1050
01:25:55,909 --> 01:25:57,820
- Very beautiful girls.
- One was wearing glasses.

1051
01:25:57,909 --> 01:25:59,661
- They went to Panama. What's up?
- Panama?

1052
01:25:59,749 --> 01:26:03,219
- One of them is the son of the Emperor of Tiran.
- Sure, and I'm Genoveffa di Brabante.

1053
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:05,743
Go pull your mother's leg, bastard!

1054
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:08,582
- Wanker!
- Did the four of them leave, or only one?

1055
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:10,978
They're all on the plane!

1056
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:14,539
And there's a bomb, and some passengers
with infectious diseases, too.

1057
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:16,665
- Anything else?
- I won't forgive Angel for this.

1058
01:26:16,749 --> 01:26:18,148
- He stood me up again.
- I won't forgive Gonzalo.

1059
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:20,299
Where are those Muslims? Have they come?

1060
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:24,382
Look where they are. To my left.
Come on, say something to them.

1061
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:26,744
It can't be them. They're from Madrid.

1062
01:26:26,829 --> 01:26:30,424
- Did you get back together with Gonzalo?
- Yes, months ago, but...

1063
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:33,626
Sexi and you were in such a mood,
and I was afraid you'd kick me out of the band.

1064
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:38,100
The truth is that I'm back with Angel, too.
But do you know what I'm going to do?

1065
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:42,348
Eusebio, don't you see
they're very dark, almost Arab-like?

1066
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:44,738
- It's them.
- It can't be them.

1067
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:48,105
- If you don't talk to them, I will.
- Shut up.

1068
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,068
- Shut up at once.
- And if I don't go, what are we doing?

1069
01:26:52,389 --> 01:26:56,223
- Madam, madam.
- Mute!

1070
01:26:56,309 --> 01:27:01,383
Did you get any questions
from a tall, dark boy, with an Arab look?

1071
01:27:01,469 --> 01:27:04,188
- Do you want to know why they left?
- Yes, hello.

1072
01:27:04,309 --> 01:27:06,618
I'm Jaime Roca
and I was supposed to interview him.

1073
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:07,983
I'm his manager.

1074
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:10,105
- Where is he?
- They went to Panama.

1075
01:27:10,429 --> 01:27:13,739
- Damn! This is bad luck.
- We're always late for everything.

1076
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:18,505
- Oh my, she's Toraya. Are you Toraya?
- I'm Princess Toraya.

1077
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:20,904
She's Empress Toraya.

1078
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:25,058
Perfect, that's exactly what we need.
Go out and park the car.

1079
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:28,698
Would you mind taking some photos
with my beautiful girls?

1080
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:31,747
- Please.
- I don't want to.

1081
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:35,139
They sing and they'll be very famous.
Just a few photos.

1082
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:39,149
Are you the Muslims?

1083
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:41,948
- And you're the one we talked to on the phone.
- Yes.

1084
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:44,259
- What's up with the money?
- Nothing.

1085
01:27:45,069 --> 01:27:48,778
How do you mean?
It's not my fault that Niro has left.

1086
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:50,985
So give me the money, come on.

1087
01:27:52,949 --> 01:27:56,419
Shut up and watch out. We'll be around.

1088
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:02,942
- Eusebio, did you get angry?
- No.

1089
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:07,423
- Those guys have...
- What are you talking about?

1090
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:11,947
- Those Muslim guys who were here.
- Muslims? The ones I told you?

1091
01:28:12,389 --> 01:28:15,984
Eusebio, you're so good
that sometimes you're stupid.

1092
01:28:16,109 --> 01:28:17,337
Everybody fools you.

1093
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:22,423
This is a huge mess. You know nothing about it,
so we can talk outside if you want.

1094
01:28:22,509 --> 01:28:25,023
- Goodbye, girls.
- Goodbye, Princess.

1095
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:27,465
- What's up?
- So you were hanging out with them?

1096
01:28:27,549 --> 01:28:30,302
- And you notice now? You're a little slow.
- With my ideas

1097
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,620
and this story, you'll get huge promotion.

1098
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:36,621
Look, I'm fed up with you playing
with our feelings, you know?

1099
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:41,180
Stars have no feelings, darling.
Remember that, because you can't afford them.

1100
01:28:41,269 --> 01:28:44,784
First I'm a woman, and then I'm a star.
And so are you, right? Tell him.

1101
01:28:44,869 --> 01:28:50,068
Come on, sometimes I really like being a star.

1102
01:28:50,509 --> 01:28:57,142
- It's a pity we were so late for the interview.
- Don't worry. You'll soon have huge news.

1103
01:28:57,229 --> 01:29:00,301
- What's it about?
- You'll know soon.

1104
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:02,057
My wallet!

1105
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:04,745
I think my wallet has been stolen!

1106
01:29:04,829 --> 01:29:08,185
- One second, Princess. I'll be right back.
- I have everything, thanks.

1107
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:11,420
Excuse me, madam.
I have a present for you from Riza Niro.

1108
01:29:11,509 --> 01:29:13,022
- From Riza Niro?
- Yes.

1109
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:16,101
- You weren't alone before, so I didn't tell you.
- Thanks. Where is it?

1110
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:18,145
- Come with me.
- Of course.

1111
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:19,787
- Come on, fast.
- Yes, it's just here.

1112
01:29:19,869 --> 01:29:21,666
- Is it? Thanks.
- Yes.

1113
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:28,982
I knew he couldn't leave just like that.

1114
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:34,147
Help! Help!

1115
01:29:41,189 --> 01:29:42,588
Susana was right.

1116
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:47,337
How could I dare talk about sex
if I didn't know what it was?

1117
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:50,382
You won't believe this, but I feel the same.

1118
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:56,340
- Hello?
- Hello, Sexilia. How are you?

1119
01:29:56,829 --> 01:30:00,265
Hello, Susana. I'm sorry to cut you off,
but I'm in bed with my father.

1120
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:01,941
In bed? Are you kidding me?

1121
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:06,227
Not at all. You were right
when you said I'm in love with him.

1122
01:30:06,309 --> 01:30:08,948
Your father hates sex, I know that. He told me.

1123
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:12,658
You're wrong.
Sex problems in this family are over.

1124
01:30:12,749 --> 01:30:15,388
Put me through to him, please.
I want to apologise.

1125
01:30:15,469 --> 01:30:18,461
- You went too far at the cafe.
- Pass him the phone, please.

1126
01:30:19,389 --> 01:30:22,028
Susana, leave us alone, and stop being a pain.

1127
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:26,546
I am a great friend,
but I can be even better an enemy.

1128
01:30:58,549 --> 01:31:02,861
- The passengers will hear us.
- Don't worry, they're all sleeping.

1129
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:06,458
- Isn't it better if we do it in the toilet?
- No!

1130
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:09,109
We'll do it here, like in Emmanuelle I.

1131
01:31:09,389 --> 01:31:13,860
Darling! You're the first man
I've shagged in-flight!
