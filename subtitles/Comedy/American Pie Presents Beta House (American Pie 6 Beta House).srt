1
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,300
- Sure you don't wanna go to my room?
- No. Why?

2
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,940
My roommate's already moved out.
We'll be all alone.

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,540
- all right.
- The door is locked.

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,420
- Okay, Jim, relax. Relax.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
No strings attached, okay?
lt's just friendly goodbye sex.

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,980
Yeah, right.
Right, right, right, right.

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,460
But you see,
it's just that...

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,340
we've never even had
friendly hello sex.

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,900
- So do you not wanna do this?
- Oh, no, no, no.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,420
Oh, I do. Yeah.
No, I definitely do.

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,980
It's just that...

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,300
you see, this is actually
my first time.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,340
Well, not my first.
It's my first time...

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,860
since my first time.

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,980
So, technically,
that's my second time.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,100
And I don't...
I don't wanna suck at it.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,500
So if I'm not up to par,
performance-wise...

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Jim, this isn't exactly a turn-on.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,780
I mean, girls like a guy
with confidence.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,380
Hey, I'm confident.

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,460
Oh, I am... I'm absolutely,
totally confident.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,580
- Let's get naked.
- Okay.

23
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,940
Seems like just yesterday my dad picked
me up after my first year at college.

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,020
We popped a couple of beers...

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,340
and he said,
''Now, you're a man.''

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,660
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Honey, your speeches
embarrass him.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,860
So, try and do what the kids say,
and just be cool.

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,420
I think I bring new meaning
to the word ''cool,'' honey.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
That's his dormitory up ahead.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,820
Turn over.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,340
- Can't bring alcohol in the dorms.
- Good.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,380
Thank you, Matt. I'm just here
to surprise my son Jim.

34
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,500
- Now pin my leg up.
- What?

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,980
Pin my leg up, like this.

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,580
Maybe you can help
me out, you know.

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,900
Is that the one? No.

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,860
There!

39
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,100
Now I remember.

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,460
I didn't do this for you.

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,060
Thanks, dude.

42
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,060
- Where's my big guy?
- Oh, my God!

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,140
- Jesus!
- Jim, we got here a little early.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,300
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.

45
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,820
Go, Dad!
Oh, my...

46
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,820
- Jeez!
- Was that your dad?

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,220
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification...

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,620
son, I'm not embarrassed.

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
I am!

50
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,660
It's a perfectly normal thing
for two human beings to do.

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
This is human nature...
human nature at its best.

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,860
Son, everybody does it. Your mother
and I... Well, not so much any more.

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,220
Got your favourite.
Oh, my God! They're fucking!

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,380
Honey, honey, listen.
I'm gonna take her...

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,060
- Please just go!
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind.

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,460
Honey...
I'll take her to the car.

57
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,100
- Hi, Mama.
- What?

58
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,380
Natalie!

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm Jim's dad.

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,420
You must be the parents
of this young lady.

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,620
I'm sorry I didn't get her name,
but hopefully my son did...

62
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,540
because I have not been
here the whole time.

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,740
Natalie, get dressed!

64
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,380
- Beer?
- Avert your eyes! Turn around!

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
- Thanks, Jim. Don't believe in locks?
- Oh, my God!

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,300
Hey, fuckface.

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,100
- Mornin', dude.
- Come on, Ozzy. It's show time.

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,260
Before you go to Ann Arbor
to pick up Heather...

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,220
I wanna show you
what you're missing.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
See what they are today, dude.
See what they are today.

71
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,740
Okay, here we go.
Moment of truth.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,260
- There's little hearts on her panties!
- Super.

73
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,060
There's little hearts on her panties!
Come on, look, you pussy. Look.

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,460
What the fuck, man?
Come on!

75
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm disappointed in you.

76
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,860
Here it is, the end of our freshman year
and you screwed one girl.

77
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
One.

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,860
You're a disgrace
to men everywhere.

79
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,820
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times this year...

80
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,140
and I'm not counting the hummer
I got in the library stacks, baby.

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,820
All right, here's a new idea
for you, Stifler, okay?

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,980
You find a girl.
You two become best friends.

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,820
You don't bother counting how many
times you have sex with each other.

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,380
- You laugh at the people who do count.
- Here's a new idea for you.

85
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,780
I'll get you a spoon
so you can eat my ass.

86
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm never even gonna think
about political science again.

87
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,660
Hey. How'd you do?

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,780
- Fine.
- Yeah?

89
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,420
Can't believe I'm going abroad for summer.
Last thing I need is more classes.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,300
- You're gonna have a great time.
- Hello, summer!

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,140
- Did that exam blow or what?
- Yeah, it sucked.

92
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,980
- Kev, what's up, man? How are you?
- Good.

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,140
Put your party hat on.

94
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,580
- We got 12 weeks of immortality ahead.
- Yes, sir!

95
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,580
Weird.

96
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,140
The one that got away, huh, son?

97
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940
Well, evidently you two...

98
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,500
made quite the handsome couple
on the Internet.

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,820
I didn't see it.

100
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,260
It was brought up
at a PTA meeting.

101
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,100
Anyway, my point is...

102
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,900
these little sexual debacles
should not get you down...

103
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,580
because you know what?

104
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,340
It happens to the best of us.

105
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,580
In fact...

106
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,500
the first time
your mother and I...

107
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,180
got together...

108
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,460
I used a condom.

109
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,300
Well, she referred to it
as ''shrink wrapping.''

110
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,420
But I got over it.

111
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,620
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging...

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,140
and good things will happen.

113
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,660
Good to have you home, son.

114
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,860
It's good to be home, Dad.

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
It's gonna be nice to hit Stifler's
tonight after exams.

116
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,860
- Did you get through 'em?
- There's the mystery man!

117
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,540
Finch, how are you?

118
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,420
It's Japanese.

119
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,620
It means ''hello.''
Hello.

120
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,060
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- Met a Japanese girl at the art museum.

121
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,100
Changed majors.

122
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,260
Wanted to understand
the things she was moaning.

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,060
- You got laid in an art museum?
- The Met.

124
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,460
- And the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?

125
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,460
And then my social-psych professor
in Baskin-Robbins.

126
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,980
All right, enough.

127
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,820
But I'll tell you,
none of these women even compare to...

128
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,340
Stifler's mom.

129
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,780
Stifler's mom is a goddess.

130
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,340
How about some more of Stifmeister's
collegiate concoction?

131
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,020
This thing is like half alcohol.
You're just trying to get me drunk.

132
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,380
Mary, would I do that?

133
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,820
- My name's Christy.
- Christy, right. Beautiful name.

134
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
Like it matters.

135
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,260
Hey, how you doing?

136
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,420
Howdy-howdy, fuckin' partners!

137
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,860
Johnny C., how's it going?
Good to see you.

138
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,940
Looks like someone
gained the freshman 15.

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,940
- This'll help.
- You're an asshole.

140
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,220
Missed you too.

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,020
All right, everybody
having a good time? Ladies?

142
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,340
Fellas! How's it going?

143
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,860
The keg's back there
as always. Enjoy.

144
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,980
Ladies, I'm Steve Stifler
and I have an 11 -inch penis...

145
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,100
around!

146
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,300
Think about it.
Sherman!

147
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,340
Okay, Stifler, take your shot.
Ha, ha.

148
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,300
Come on, man.
I'm really happy to see you.

149
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,780
All right.

150
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,620
You stupid fuck!

151
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,040
Back at Stifler's.
It's just like old times.

152
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,000
One difference.
We're college men now.

153
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,400
Some of these girls
are from the grade below us.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,560
I might actually have a chance.

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,400
Hey, I remember you.

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
Do you now?

157
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,680
You're that guy who blew
his load on the Internet.

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,240
Splat. ''Oh, wait, Nadia,
don't go.'' Splat.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,640
- Pathetic.
- Loser.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,200
It's exactly like old times.

161
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,440
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you.

162
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll call you
when I get in, okay?

163
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
Go have fun.

164
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,120
Bye.

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
I can't believe
those two girls, Kevin.

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,120
Jim, it's not a big deal.

167
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,520
They toyed with my emotions.

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
- Hello. Hello.
- See? There's other girls.

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
- How are you?
- You got nothing to worry about, man.

170
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,440
Jessica's here.

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,920
With Vicky.

172
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,680
And Vicky got hot!

173
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,240
What's that supposed to mean?

174
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,520
Look at her.

175
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,040
- Yeah, Jim, I see her.
- Hey, Kevin.

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
I'll be right back.

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,960
- Hey, Vic, how are you?
- What's up?

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's good.

180
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
- It's good to hear.
- Yeah, you too.

181
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
Wow.

182
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Well, this is about as comfortable
as a high colonic in Tijuana.

183
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,720
And I would know.
Okay.

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,600
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- She's right.

185
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,960
- Why is this so weird?
- Actually, I have no idea.

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,320
See, I knew it.
I knew you'd be mature about this.

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,480
You know, and we could
still be friends, right?

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,360
I miss you, Kev.

189
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,760
Whoa.

190
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,760
Friends, right?

191
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,200
Yeah, right. I mean, I know you said
friends and I... I just...

192
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,520
I'm sorry.
I was... It was just...

193
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,320
an old habit...
a friend kiss.

194
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,800
Are you sure?

195
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Vic, why wouldn't I wanna
be friends with you?

196
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,840
Look, we'll...
we'll just do this, okay?

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,680
- Friends.
- Friends.

198
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,620
Stifler's mom's room.

199
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,700
How did you do
that magic you did?

200
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,980
Tantra.

201
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,780
What the fuck
are you doin' in here?

202
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,500
- Just relax.
- You get out of my house!

203
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,980
- Jesus Christ!
- Come back here, you little fucker!

204
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,140
Come back here,
you son of a bitch!

205
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,420
Easy! That's enough.

206
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Okay, guys, we went through this
last summer, all right?

207
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,380
Finch got a black eye
and Stifler got six stitches.

208
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,780
'Cause he fuckin' bit me!

209
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
You touch me, I bite.

210
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,500
- You two relax and shake hands.
- Shake this.

211
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,700
I need a drink.

212
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,620
Why is everybody
taking a piss right now?

213
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,180
- Line's too long. I ain't gonna make it.
- You'll be okay. Relax.

214
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,660
Hey, bro. Hey, man, you're
the guy who boned Stifler's mom.

215
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,580
- Hey, you are a god.
- Holy shit, dude.

216
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,340
If I didn't have to hold my dick 'cause
I gotta piss, I would shake your hand.

217
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,780
- I'm honoured, guys.
- Don't leave.

218
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,500
You must teach me.
How?

219
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,420
How?

220
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
Look what I found, Christy.

221
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,820
What a coincidence.

222
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,620
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

223
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,860
for a special girl,
just like you.

224
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,220
- You're so sweet.
- That's what they say.

225
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,660
Weird.

226
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,900
- Oh, my God.
- I spilled some on you.

227
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,140
- Maybe I should mop that up.
- Thanks.

228
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,460
No problem.

229
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,140
Whoa! Whoa, hey.

230
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,260
- Take it slow. Come on.
- Right.

231
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,540
You know, they warn us
about these situations in college.

232
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,420
Now, you may be intoxicated.

233
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,380
Oh, yeah.

234
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,100
Are you certain that you wish
to engage in consenting...

235
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,620
Hey, don't count
your chickens, buster.

236
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,740
- I'm just playing by the rules, baby.
- I make the rules.

237
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,980
That's a pretty good fucking rule.

238
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,220
Dude, the line's too long.
I'll never make it.

239
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,140
It's gotta happen now.
Get my back.

240
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,180
- Clamp it off.
- Hello.

241
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,780
- How are you?
- Awesome.

242
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,780
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

243
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,180
How 'bout I give you
a little champagne?

244
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,060
Go downstairs and get us some beers?

245
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,340
I've got a surprise for you.
Close your eyes and get ready.

246
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,980
I'm ready.

247
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,460
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, all right.

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,060
Okay, go.

249
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,660
This is kind of kinky,
and I like that.

250
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,700
That's it.
Bathe the Stifmeister.

251
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,860
Oh, that's great!

252
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,020
That's great.

253
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,060
How did you get it
so nice and warm?

254
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
I can taste the bubbles.

255
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,180
Actually, I can't.

256
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,060
Much better.

257
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,140
Wait a second.

258
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,900
- Let's go.
- Thanks, man.

259
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,620
Christy?

260
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh, fuck!

261
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,240
Okay, now...

262
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,680
do these high school kids
think we're cool...

263
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
because they're at
a college party...

264
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,840
or are we those weird older guys...

265
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,360
that try to hang out with
high school kids when we come home?

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,480
No way. We're definitely
not those guys.

267
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,880
Cops! Cops!

268
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,920
Break it up.
Party's over.

269
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,960
Let's go.

270
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,160
Ostreicher, Myers.

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,840
Welcome back.

272
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,040
Where's Steve Stifler?

273
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
I got peed on.

274
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,960
No, man,
Stifler's got shut down.

275
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,760
We can't party anywhere any more.

276
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,200
And things are...

277
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,440
- Getting weird?
- Yeah, a little bit.

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,840
First summer back from college.

279
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,600
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.

280
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,920
- What are you talkin' about?
- Well, times change, people change.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,840
lt's just what happens,
you now.

282
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,360
Kev, listen.
Go into my old room.

283
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,880
My friends and I knew that
it was up to us to stick together.

284
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,560
You remember my first college summer?
We rented the lake house in Grand Harbour.

285
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,640
We treated every day out there
lie it was a post-prom party.

286
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Hell of a time. We capped it
all off with a massive blow-out.

287
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Best ever.
it was legendary.

288
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,880
My advice is do that.
By the end of the summer...

289
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,720
you're gonna see the big picture.

290
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,400
- She's on the phone. It's long-distance.
- Who?

291
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
- Nadia! Nadia!
- What?

292
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,680
New York. Hello.
Yes, dear, he's right here.

293
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
- Here. Wait.
- Now remember...

294
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,840
Yes, I am sure to go see
the Lion King.

295
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,880
Right. and don't ride
the subway after midnight.

296
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,560
I know they've done wonderful things
with that city, but, you know, for me...

297
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,640
- Dad!
- He's right... Hang on.

298
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,560
- How was college?
- College was excellent.

299
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,480
Yeah. Yeah, it was...
it was really excellent.

300
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,080
You have not forgotten
about me, have you?

301
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
No. I...
Absolutely not.

302
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,600
- l definitely didn't.
- Good, because guess what.

303
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm coming to see you
at the end of summer.

304
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,320
l hope you're ready for me...

305
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,840
because l have not forgotten
about you either, you sexy boy.

306
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,440
- Shit.
- Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.

307
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,760
No, Finch,
it's not the hot dogs.

308
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,680
Nadia called me this morning.

309
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,800
She's coming here at the end of
the summer and she wants to see me.

310
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,920
- That's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,760
No, not ''good thing.''
Not ''killer.''

312
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
I'll never be able to do it.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,680
Nadia is gonna be expecting
filet mignon.

314
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,080
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...

315
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,680
is rump roast.

316
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,120
Come on.

317
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,560
Jim, you've had experience
since Nadia.

318
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
Ah, yes, you would be
referring to...

319
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,800
the flute-fetish band geek that made me
her bitch, then ditched me after prom.

320
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes, that's great experience.

321
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,320
You just gotta
find the right girl, Jimbo.

322
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,320
- Brings it all together.
- I had the right woman.

323
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,320
She just sells her cottage
and takes off to parts unknown.

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,840
My romantic life
has passed its peak.

325
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,000
Take me out to the pasture
and shoot me.

326
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,600
Super start to a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.

327
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,840
Guys, I got it.
Pack your bags.

328
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
For what?

329
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
We're moving to the lake.

330
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
We're gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach is gonna know us.

331
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Plenty of opportunities
to practise for Nadia.

332
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,280
Throw a huge party at the end
of the summer to cap it all off.

333
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,840
Dude, that's a great idea. That way
we'll be able to welcome Heather back...

334
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,840
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.

335
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,400
This is it.
This is my summer of love.

336
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,600
Just thought I'd say
goodbye to you animals.

337
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,840
Hey, Mr Levenstein.
How are you, sir?

338
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,000
- All packed up, I see.
- We're all set, Dad.

339
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,480
Don't worry, okay?
I'll be fine.

340
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,440
Come on and give
your old man a hug.

341
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,200
Keep it real, homies.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,400
You too, sir.
Have a good summer.

343
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,560
All right, let's go.

344
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,400
I've been running
these numbers here...

345
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,920
and I don't think the four of us
can afford this place.

346
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
- Not on summer jobs.
- Well, I kinda thought of that.

347
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,640
So, I invited someone else.

348
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,600
Oh, yeah! The Stifmeister's
coming back to Grand Harbour!

349
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,080
Deck the halls!
Bye-bye, Great Falls!

350
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,320
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!

351
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
It's Stifler time, baby!

352
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,480
Stifler, if you're gonna be living
with us, you gotta behave yourself.

353
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,280
All right, you and Finch
just stay out of each other's way.

354
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,000
Kevin, Stifler's stench
is unavoidable.

355
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Finch, fist yourself.

356
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
That's right, baby.
We're here.

357
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,840
Yeah, baby, we're here!

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,760
- It's a palace.
- It's a temple.

359
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Isn't this great?

360
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,120
Are you kidding me?

361
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,320
This just won't do.

362
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,080
Guys.

363
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
Check this out.
This is it.

364
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Will you idiots tell me
what this fucker's doin'?

365
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,560
Don't touch me
while I'm tantric.

366
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,000
''Tantric?''
What the fuck is tantric?

367
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,680
It's a Buddhist discipline.

368
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,240
You learn to channel
your body's energies... your chakras.

369
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,040
When you can do that, you can have sex
for hours, even days.

370
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
And this stuff's for real?

371
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,000
It's been around for centuries.

372
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,360
With tantra you can make
an entire session of sex...

373
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,240
feel like one giant orgasm.

374
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,000
Eventually, you can sustain
that feeling by meditating.

375
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,200
- Maybe you can teach me sometime?
- Very doubtful.

376
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,400
- True.
- Come on, Jim.

377
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,600
- You can't possibly be that bad.
- Oh, no?

378
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,800
No way.

379
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,520
I guess there's only one person
that really knows for sure, huh?

380
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,080
Oh, yeah?
Where is she this summer?

381
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,560
Hey, are you here for
the mid-session performance?

382
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,680
Guests go in the amphitheatre.
You can't be here.

383
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,640
Do you know where I could find
Michele Flaherty?

384
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,600
Guests bring food.
Food attracts animals. This one time...

385
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,960
a bear came, and then the bear
had to be destroyed...

386
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,840
which means they shot it in the head
with a rifle and killed it and it died.

387
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,400
You must know Michele.

388
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,560
One, two, three, four.

389
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,880
That's a lot of flutes.

390
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Good luck. Thanks.

391
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,040
Good job.
Have fun at your next class.

392
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,800
Jim. Holy potatoes!

393
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,960
You're really here?

394
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,120
Oh, shoot!

395
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
We're not supposed to
have visitors...

396
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,400
'cause this one time, here...

397
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
this kid had these cookies...

398
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,360
Let me guess. A bear came.

399
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,480
Cool.

400
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,720
It's like you know
all our stories.

401
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Was that a question?

402
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
I don't know. Maybe.

403
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,720
Do you wanna answer it anyway?

404
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,320
I left you like...
like three messages after prom.

405
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,640
Really?

406
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,360
You didn't think I was weird...

407
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,840
because of the way
I acted that night?

408
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,480
Weird, no.

409
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Surprising, yes.

410
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,920
I get nasty when I'm horny.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
That's kind of why I'm here.

412
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,160
You remember,
was I any good that night?

413
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,160
Wow.Jeez.

414
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
How could I forget?

415
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,720
You sucked. You didn't know
what the hell you were doing.

416
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,240
But wasn't it fun even though
you were so terrible?

417
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,120
- I'm sorry. ''Terrible?''
- I've had worse.

418
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,760
Sorry.

419
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,920
I could give you
some pointers if you want.

420
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,280
Really?

421
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,560
Shoot. Okay, wait here.
I'll meet you in an hour, okay?

422
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,440
- Yeah.
- Wait.

423
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
Cool idea.

424
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,560
What are you doing?

425
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
You're all right. Here we go. You know
you're not supposed to be here now.

426
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,800
Everyone's supposed to be in
the amphitheatre. All right, come on.

427
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,200
It's piss-poor to be this late.
I'm very angry right now.

428
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,080
You can tell by the tone of my voice
I'm angry. I'm pissed off.

429
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,320
Here they are. Got him home.

430
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,320
Wait a minute.
Are you Petey?

431
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,360
Yeah, sure.

432
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,800
Petey!
Well, that explains everything.

433
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,400
All right. Well, always something
with these kids. Go!

434
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,520
We are just so thrilled to have you.
None of my kids are at your calibre.

435
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,560
But we are just so overjoyed...

436
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,880
to have someone
with your kind of talent here.

437
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Here you go.

438
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,720
Look at this.
Your old best friend.

439
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
I know it's not yours...

440
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
but you are going to make
beautiful music.

441
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
This is fantastic.
I'm very excited.

442
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,080
You just own this
and break a leg.

443
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,040
What was he doing
wandering unsupervised?

444
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,800
Who knows?

445
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,280
I'll tell you something. I'm about
fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.

446
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,440
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.

447
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,240
No, no, no, Petey.
Here we go.

448
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,680
All right, all right.
Come on, now. A little encouragement.

449
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,040
Folks, he's just a little nervous.

450
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,800
This isn't right.

451
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,720
Just blow on it, kid.
All right.

452
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,320
Here we go.

453
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,800
Play! Do something.

454
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,400
Special, my ass.

455
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,680
Come on. Give the little guy
some support.

456
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,840
Come on, Petey.
You're doing great, partner.

457
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,240
Come on, honey.
You can do it.

458
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,880
Come on, Petey.

459
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,400
What the hell.

460
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,760
All right!

461
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,640
All right, Petey!
Come on, now! Come on!

462
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,400
Rock and roll!

463
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,640
Thank you!

464
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,360
Thank you, Tall Oaks.
You're beautiful.

465
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,320
My name is Petey!

466
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,720
Thank you!

467
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,600
And I have gigantic balls!

468
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,040
Not now!
Come back later. Go!

469
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,080
Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here!

470
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,280
- I wanna talk to you!
- You are so sweet.

471
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,160
He is special.

472
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,600
He's my bitch.

473
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,600
Well, Michele has confirmed it.

474
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,960
- I suck.
- What?

475
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,720
I gotta get some practice.

476
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't worry about it. I mean,
that's why we got the house, Jimbo.

477
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,200
We plop a keg on the deck
and the girls come in off the beach.

478
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,240
It's like a hummingbird feeder.

479
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,120
- You think so?
- I know so.

480
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,040
Guaranteed hotties.

481
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,640
Fellas, nice pad.

482
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,560
Good view, but...

483
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,920
the Sherminator sensors detect
no female life forms in the vicinity.

484
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,160
High likelihood of
a sausage fest in progress.

485
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,520
The girls are coming.
I made some calls.

486
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,880
The Sherminator's got a point, Kev.

487
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Since when do you start listening
to the Sherminator?

488
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Since he made me realize
there's an abundance of wiener here.

489
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,120
I mean, look around, dude.

490
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,320
All right,
now it's your turn.

491
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,280
Come on.
There's nothing to tell.

492
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,720
Hey, what's up?
What are you guys talking about?

493
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,920
You know, we're just trading
war stories about college...

494
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,320
who hooked up with who,
who slept with who...

495
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,520
So, Vicky?

496
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,440
Well, there was this one guy.
How 'bout you?

497
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,040
You know, there was
a few girls...

498
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,080
three.

499
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,920
Look at you.
You stud.

500
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,400
All right, Oz. Now that Kevin
told us, what about you?

501
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,800
You haven't had the slightest bit
of attraction to any girl at school?

502
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,640
Don't you fuckin' say no.
I know you did.

503
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Even if I did...

504
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
it wouldn't be anything more
than just a momentary thing.

505
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,560
Very uninteresting.

506
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,480
How about you, Jessica? How many chicks
did you sleep with this year?

507
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,320
Gee, wouldn't you like to know.

508
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
Fuck yeah, I would.

509
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,320
Come on, Ozzy.

510
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,720
Yeah, man. Ball.
Pool's yours.

511
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure. You wanna break?

512
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,280
Where are the fuckin' females?

513
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,880
Jim, can't you leave your shirt on?
You're scaring the chicks away.

514
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,080
Dude, give him a break.

515
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,200
Ozzy, go deep.

516
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,760
- Yeah, bro. You playing?
- No.

517
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
No, keep going.
Flank pattern.

518
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,880
- What are you doin'?
- Fishin'.

519
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,560
Are you okay?

520
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,800
- You okay?
- I'm so sorry. Is everybody okay?

521
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,920
Amazing.

522
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,840
The Force is strong
in that one.

523
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
Whoa.

524
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,640
The Sherminator detects serious heat
at a distance of two metres.

525
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,600
Preparing to deploy beer.

526
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,000
Dude, let me give you a valuable
piece of advice, okay?

527
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,640
Drop the whole
''Sherminator'' thing.

528
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,760
Please repeat previous statement.

529
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
Look, I know your last name
is Sherman, right?

530
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,160
And that rhymes
with The Terminator...

531
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,560
which was a big hit movie
ten years ago.

532
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,360
But you can't tell me
a girl's ever really gone for it.

533
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,280
System overload.
Hasta la vista, Jessica.

534
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Freak.

535
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,560
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?

536
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,240
You know, we barely had a chance
to hang out, you know, catch up.

537
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
- What are you doing this weekend?
- I can get together.

538
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,760
- Cool. Let's hang out.
- All right.

539
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,320
- Bye, Kev.
- See ya, Jess.

540
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,080
No, no, that's all wrong.

541
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,200
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

542
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,080
- So what does he mean, ''meet up''?
- You know, like hang out...

543
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,640
grab lunch, whatever.

544
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,200
I told you, we're just friends now.
And he totally understands.

545
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,760
- I'm sure he understands quite well.
- He does.

546
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,960
Oh, no, sir. These are all
wrong for you. I mean, seriously.

547
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
Sure. Well, we're friends.

548
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,360
But it's not like I see her
making plans with anyone else.

549
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,920
I don't see her with a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.

550
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,520
Hey, Vicky only slept with
one guy since we went out.

551
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,840
I mean, that like makes me 50%
of her entire guy-related life.

552
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,800
You dipshit.

553
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,920
She didn't sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.

554
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,560
What?

555
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
When a girl tells you
how many guys she slept with...

556
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
multiply it by three
and that's the real number.

557
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,600
Didn't you fuckers
learn anything at college?

558
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,199
- Kevin did not sleep with three girls.
- Why would he lie to me?

559
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,239
It's not a lie. It's an adjustment.
The rule of three.

560
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,499
- The rule of what?
- Three.

561
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,759
If a guy tells you how many girls he's
been with, it's not even close to that.

562
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,159
Take that number and divide it by three.
Then you get the real total.

563
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,139
So, if Kevin's saying it's been three
girls, it's more like one, or none.

564
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,359
- None?
- Rule of three.

565
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,140
It's an exact science,
consistent as gravity.

566
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,880
Oh, my God!

567
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,480
Guys, check it out.

568
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,400
Lesbians.

569
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,219
Lesbians live here.

570
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,720
You know,
Mr Homophobic Wizard...

571
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,800
that it is possible for women
to hold hands and not be gay.

572
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,400
Friends can hold hands.

573
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Hey, Finch, I don't wanna hear
about you and your boyfriends.

574
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,640
- Go jerk off.
- Unnecessary.

575
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,080
Tantra teaches you to hold
an orgasm over time...

576
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,520
in anticipation
of an ultimate moment...

577
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,920
to release it upon the world.

578
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,160
I'm filling up to the brim.

579
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,480
That's fucking disgusting!
I'm gonna throw up.

580
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
Hey, Heather. You're in!

581
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,240
How's the studying going?

582
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,200
I'd hardly call it studying.

583
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,120
I've been going
to the Picasso museum...

584
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,480
hanging out
at Sagrada Familia...

585
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,880
going with Pierre
to the Parc Guell.

586
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,360
- Who's Pierre?
- One of the guys in the programme.

587
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,160
He's got a girlfriend back in France, so
we've kind of got something in common.

588
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,840
That sounds cool.

589
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, I've overheard them
on the phone at night.

590
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,680
And, well, it made me think.

591
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,480
Hey, Oz, l'm reaching under my shirt
and l'm rubbing myself.

592
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,320
Oz, come on. It's phone sex.
Help me out here.

593
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,800
Okay.

594
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm going over to my bed.

595
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,720
and l'm lying down.

596
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,160
And I'm slowly...

597
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,480
reaching downstairs.

598
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,240
Grab it.
Tell me how big it is.

599
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,640
Listen, Heather,
I'm feeling kind of awkward.

600
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,320
If we can't be with each other,
then we have to learn to be more vocal.

601
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,720
- Right?
- Right. Okay.

602
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,280
Okay, here we go.
I'm reaching in my pants now.

603
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,000
And I'm rubbing it
for you, Heather.

604
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,760
And it feels so good.

605
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,040
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.

606
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,880
I got...

607
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,120
Call waiting.

608
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,800
Shit. Hello?

609
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
Wrong number.

610
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,320
Hey. Hello. Wrong number.

611
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,680
All right, look, man. I got
my hand on my dick right now, okay...

612
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,160
and I'm trying to have sex
with my girlfriend over the phone.

613
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,040
Good for you, man.

614
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,800
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

615
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,120
I think you were
reaching for something.

616
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Oh, yeah.

617
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,040
Oh, yeah, Heather. I'm rubbing it
and it feels so good.

618
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,600
Hey, Oz, I'm touching myself.
What else do you want me to do?

619
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,000
Heather, baby.

620
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,760
Why don't you tell me my dick
is as big as Stifler's.

621
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,880
Stifler, get off!

622
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,000
I am getting off just listening
to the two of you guys.

623
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,760
- Keep going.
- We should try this another time.

624
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,640
Yeah, all right.
Bye. I love you.

625
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,840
- I love you.
- Come on you, guys. I was almost there!

626
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,800
- Nice talking with you, Steven.
- Stifler, man!

627
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,680
Repressed.

628
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,520
Check it out.

629
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,840
Potential lesbians
leaving the building.

630
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,720
All right.
Now is my chance.

631
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,320
I need confirmation.

632
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Stifler. Hey, man,
what are you doing?

633
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,120
Go get him.

634
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
You ass.
Stifler, get out.

635
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,400
Shit, dude!
I found a dildo!

636
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,480
Big blue rubber dicks
for everyone!

637
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,840
- The people demand rubber dicks!
- Finch, help.

638
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,280
Dildo, dildo, dildo!

639
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,080
- What are you doing?
- Looking for more lesbian artefacts.

640
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,320
- Where'd you get this?
- Finch's ass.

641
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,400
Shit! Guys, they're back.

642
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
Stall 'em!

643
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Come on. Come on!

644
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,680
- Come on. Come on.
- This is awesome!

645
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,920
Danielle, Amber, hi.

646
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,880
Just needed the paper, huh?

647
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,720
- Which room?
- I can't remember. I was too excited.

648
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,240
- I'm in a lesbian stronghold.
- Was it in here?

649
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,520
- Why you asking me so many questions?
- Was it in here?

650
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,200
- Maybe.
- Was it or was it not here?

651
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,000
Happy painting, boys.

652
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
You gotta get out of there.
They're inside.

653
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,640
Oh, shit, balls!

654
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,040
- Very original, Steven.
- Don't call me Steven.

655
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,240
I can wear that
little leopard bikini of mine.

656
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,880
I love that one.
It's so cute on you.

657
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,440
Help me zip, please.

658
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,000
- Did I show you my cute pink shoes?
- Does it match your pink bikini?

659
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,960
They're getting naked.

660
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,160
- Cute.
- Thank you.

661
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,440
Shit. She's de-pantsing.

662
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,240
Oh, man.

663
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Wait. They can't hear us inside?
We won't cross over their radio?

664
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,400
No, man.
These work on a CB frequency.

665
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,240
This girl is so hot.

666
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,880
Two possible lesbians
in their bras and panties.

667
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,040
Lesbians?

668
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Did you say lesbians?

669
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,920
Hot lesbians!

670
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,980
This is not gonna fit.
Look at you and look at me.

671
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,180
- Too big.
- I'll get you the blue stringy number.

672
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,660
Johnny West is missing.

673
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,220
Maybe you kicked it
under the bed.

674
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,500
Okay, let me look.

675
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,300
Wait. Didn't you have it
when we were downstairs?

676
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,740
Maybe.

677
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,380
Guys, get the hell
out of there right now.

678
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,260
Come on!

679
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,660
- It's clear!
- Go, go, go!

680
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,340
They're coming back.

681
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,980
I'm just so glad I found him.
He's my favourite collectible.

682
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,460
I know.

683
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,260
Holy shit!
There's a dildo in my drawer.

684
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,740
Oh, my God!

685
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,860
You could have asked me
if you wanted to borrow it.

686
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,500
Stop it.

687
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,820
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Call 9 11 .

688
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,860
- No 9 11 .
- Don't call the police.

689
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,660
- My God, it's the painting kids.
- I'm still calling the cops.

690
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,620
Okay, no, no, no.
This isn't right.

691
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,820
- Look. Stifler did break in here.
- You dick!

692
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,380
But we just followed him in
to get him out.

693
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,500
I just wanted proof that you chicks
are really lesbians.

694
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,860
You wanna mess with 'em?

695
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,780
Yeah, it'll be fun.

696
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,900
Let's do it.

697
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,220
You guys like that?

698
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,460
Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.

699
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,540
That's a big 10-4
on the confirmation.

700
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,500
Sounds like your little friends
outside wanna play too.

701
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,560
You won't be needing this.

702
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,600
Who wants me to touch Amber?

703
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,060
l do, l do.

704
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,540
- Who the hell is that?
- Who's this?

705
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,980
This is John... Smith.

706
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,020
I'm turning off my radio now.

707
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,180
Okay.
Where should I touch Amber?

708
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,540
Ass, baby.
Feel that ass!

709
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,220
That's nice.

710
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,980
I know.
You feel his ass first.

711
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,180
Excuse me?

712
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,980
Yeah, I like that.
That's good.

713
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,180
I got some painting
I should...

714
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,020
Jim, hold on.
I can handle it.

715
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,300
- What?
- I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

716
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,740
And I would love
to see that show.

717
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,900
Bravo!

718
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,900
One finger on the cheek.

719
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,980
We want...

720
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,660
palm grasping.

721
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,620
That's too much.
No, no, no.

722
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,660
You don't touch,
we don't touch.

723
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,060
- Squeeze his ass, son. You'll like it.
- Come on, boys.

724
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,620
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

725
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,860
I'm touching his ass.
I'm touching his ass.

726
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,340
Red Leader,
what's your position?

727
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,220
l'm touching his ass.
l'm touching his ass.

728
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,180
Mommy!

729
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,460
You can go.

730
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,380
That really wasn't bad.

731
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,860
- I wanna go home.
- That's too bad.

732
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,380
Never mind.
I'm staying.

733
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,820
Danielle is feeling my breasts.

734
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,180
No way, dude!

735
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,900
Her breasts are so luscious.

736
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,380
What a wonderful Christmas gift
you bought the boys.

737
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,820
My nipples are so hard.

738
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,540
I think I can fix these.

739
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,340
Sweet Jesus.

740
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,420
Your turn.

741
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,980
Oh, yeah!

742
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,540
No, no, no.

743
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
Him.

744
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,940
Kiss.

745
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,340
Dude, no.

746
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,700
- Wait. What?
- You want more?

747
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,180
We want more.
Go get him, tiger.

748
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,940
- You're gonna love it.
- Do it for us.

749
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,900
Okay, dude.

750
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,820
One, two...

751
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,980
three.

752
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,020
- That doesn't even count.
- That totally counted.

753
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,500
- That's how you kiss your mother.
- Don't you say anything!

754
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,620
Make it real.
You do that...

755
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,860
we'll do anything you want.

756
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,260
Anything?

757
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,700
Anything.

758
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,420
- You better like it.
- Promise.

759
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,340
I wouldn't lie.

760
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,420
That is what I'm talking about.

761
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,260
Kev, you can look.

762
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,900
That's it.

763
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,700
Where's your tongue?

764
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,540
Good boys.

765
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,300
- Very good.
- Dude, you're a fucking lousy kisser.

766
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,260
What? I wasn't trying!

767
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,140
That's not fair!

768
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,140
I wasn't trying there!

769
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,860
No judgment.

770
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,620
Wait a second.
You were trying?

771
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,060
- Fuck no!
- You were trying!

772
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,780
- I kissed Jim!
- Silence!

773
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,900
- Ladies.
- Yes?

774
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,980
As you were.

775
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,580
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

776
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,280
- Honey, come on. Food's ready.
- I'm not hungry!

777
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,640
- Oh, God.
- It was worth it.

778
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,760
- I want more.
- Hell, yeah. I want more too, baby.

779
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,560
We're gonna get more physical
as soon as we get some...

780
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,240
- Hand jobs.
- Okay!

781
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,320
Hand jobs.

782
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,320
You do him.
We love to watch.

783
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,560
I'm sorry?

784
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,720
- You go.
- We go.

785
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,160
Don't be a wimp.

786
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,680
Okay. It's okay.

787
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,560
I know what I have to do.

788
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,520
I need to keep this party goin'.

789
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,720
I'm takin' one for the team.

790
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,120
Mother of God!

791
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,720
Come on, you pussies!
We had 'em!

792
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,360
- I am not touching that.
- Put that thing away, Stifler.

793
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,560
Why can't you guys
be team players, huh?

794
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,480
I was the one doin'
all the sacrificing'.

795
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,020
Now, wait just a minute.

796
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,900
Stifler wanted to give
you two hand jobs?

797
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,660
No. Stifler wanted one from us.

798
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,580
What? Bullshit.

799
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,380
He did.
And it was horrible.

800
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,100
Very horrible.

801
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,540
You guys, you wanna
play some ''asshole''?

802
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,180
Just watching the game, Kev.

803
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,260
I just wanna
do something together.

804
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,460
We just did something together.
Very together.

805
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,380
Ho, ho, ho.
Stifler Claus is here.

806
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,220
Now, just so there's no confusion...

807
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,580
Santa Porn has just brought us
some heterosexual entertainment.

808
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,100
Here you go.

809
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,980
All right. Here.

810
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,700
And the Stifmeister's provided us
some complimentary lubricant.

811
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,660
Whack away, Jim.

812
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,460
Does this stuff really
make a difference?

813
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,220
- Oh, yeah!
- Really?

814
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,020
Stifmeister's palace of love...

815
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,620
straight love.

816
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,500
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I'm fine.

817
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,220
- How about you?
- That's Stifler's mom.

818
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,660
Silence.

819
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,660
I didn't really think you were gonna be
in Michigan this summer.

820
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,660
Yeah, you're more than welcome
to be here.

821
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,020
Okay, stop by in a couple of weeks.
We're having a big party.

822
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,660
Okay, bye.

823
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,060
Stifler, was that...

824
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,980
She's coming.

825
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Stifler's mom is coming here.

826
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,420
Efforts must be doubled.

827
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,660
''Efforts must be doubled.''

828
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,220
Absolutely.

829
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,220
Jenny, where'd you put
my clarinet?

830
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,700
- I think I shoved it in your box.
- Thanks.

831
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,660
Bad man.
I'm a bad, bad man.

832
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,260
Jim, what are you
doing here?

833
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,700
Well, I thought
you had said...

834
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,580
You can't just
stand out here.

835
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,380
Loo, l need your help.

836
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,420
Nadia's coming back
and I don't...

837
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,500
I don't wanna be this awkward...

838
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,540
bumbling, nervous guy with her.

839
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,140
I don't wanna seem
like a dork.

840
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,340
Well, I know that feeling.

841
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,460
Spend your life playing
in the band...

842
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,420
it doesn't exactly give you
the ultra-cool hipster image.

843
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,020
- I think you're pretty cool.
- Seriously?

844
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,460
Michele, why did you
ditch me after prom?

845
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,380
I didn't ditch you.
I just...

846
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,860
Our date was over.

847
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,860
I mean, did you want some...

848
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,420
funky, weird,
next-morning goodbye?

849
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,620
It's not like I wanted you to pretend
you were in love with me or something.

850
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,500
Why would I pretend that?

851
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,220
Guys do that.

852
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,980
Yeah, well,
I'm not like other guys.

853
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,620
I know.

854
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

855
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,620
Really?

856
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,300
Yeah, I feel bad
for saying that you sucked...

857
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,300
even though you kind of did.

858
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,700
Let's just get started.

859
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,140
- Now, I'm a hot girl.
- Right.

860
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,020
- Okay, what do you wanna do?
- I wanna feel your boobs.

861
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,060
No, you dingbat.

862
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,420
You don't just go
groping away.

863
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,020
You gotta preheat the oven
before you stick in the turkey.

864
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,900
Kiss me, here.

865
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,820
Good. Okay, now...

866
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,380
the collarbone... kiss.

867
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,420
Good, Jim.

868
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,940
You're making me wet.

869
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,340
Holy shit. Really?

870
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,500
No, I was just saying that
so you could practise.

871
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,700
Of course.

872
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,820
Does direction matter,
like clockwise, counter clockwise?

873
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,260
Okay, Jim,
this is what I'm talking about.

874
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,460
Your main problem is
you're so uptight.

875
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,940
Do I seem uptight
about my sexual stuff? No.

876
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,100
The biggest pointer
I could give you is...

877
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,540
you have to feel comfortable
in any situation.

878
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,940
Stand up.

879
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,700
Stand up.

880
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,580
- Now, this is a fucked-up situation.
- What happened to preheating?

881
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,180
- We're skipping a few chapters.
- Oh, okay.

882
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,860
This is good. This is good.
Obviously.

883
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,540
- Gilligan's island, Mr Howell.
- What?

884
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,340
You've got to control yourself
and think of something nonsexual.

885
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,820
I haven't even touched you yet,
and you're turning into the Sears Tower.

886
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,660
I'm sorry.
Yeah, nonsexual.

887
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,260
Right, right.
Okay.

888
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,060
- Chairs.
- Good.

889
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,900
Mastodons.

890
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,620
Cleaning my bathroom.

891
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,700
Dung beetles.

892
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,180
Okay. Now, don't freak out.

893
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,180
I'm gonna do something
to push your threshold.

894
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,020
Oh, that's cold!
What are you doing?

895
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,660
I just shoved a trumpet in your ass.
Aren't instruments fun?

896
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,060
Okay, I think you've just
crossed my threshold.

897
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,940
Call me in two weeks. I'll be home then.
We can finish lessons.

898
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,180
Pointer... less tongue.

899
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,400
- What is it? A guest book?
- Yeah, and look at this entry.

900
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,080
''Best thing was the blow-out
at Tom Myers' place.

901
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,480
- There he is.
- A night not soon to be forgotten.

902
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,080
August '93.''
It's your brother, man. Look.

903
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, his cottage was
right down on the beach.

904
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,480
Guys, this is what
our party's gotta be.

905
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,200
- Something we'll always remember.
- Yes, definitely.

906
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,800
Absolutely.

907
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,880
- You go fish.
- Finch, we're playing gin.

908
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,680
Gin.

909
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,440
What the fuck?

910
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,440
''Dear Jim.

911
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,040
Chicago is beautiful,
but it would be better if you were here.

912
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,880
I'm counting the days.
Love, Nadia.''

913
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,080
Well, I wish
you were here, Nadia.

914
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,440
- Have you been dirty?
- Oh, yes, baby. I?ve been dirty.

915
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,280
Do you want me to clean you?

916
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,920
''Apply a few drops
to achieve desired lubrication.''

917
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,640
All right.

918
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,000
I that a loofah,
or are you just glad to see me?

919
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,920
What the hell.

920
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,680
Shit.

921
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,920
God!

922
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I been missin' out.

923
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,360
Oh, shit!

924
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,360
Shit!

925
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,960
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

926
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,680
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

927
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,440
Shut the fuck up or I'll break down
this door and pummel your ass!

928
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,200
No, don't come in here. I'm fine.
I just fell out of the bed.

929
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,120
- You sure?
- Okay, good night, then.

930
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,080
- 'Night.
- We'll see you in the morning.

931
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,800
Oh, shit!

932
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,040
- Poison control.
- Hello?

933
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,600
Yeah, I kind of...

934
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,440
Super Glued myself...

935
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,200
to myself.

936
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,360
No, no!

937
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,000
Don't send an ambulance.

938
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,000
Look, is there anything, you know,
around the house?

939
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,360
Paint thinner.

940
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,440
Shit.

941
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,400
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

942
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,840
Hands where we can see 'em!

943
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,400
Both hands!
Get the other hand up, God damn it!

944
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,200
I can't! I can't!
I'm glued!

945
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,160
I'm glued!

946
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,160
Sorry.

947
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,040
Relax your hands.

948
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,920
I'll take it from here, okay?

949
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,880
Don't worry, Jimbo.
You're gonna be fine, buddy.

950
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,480
Jim, this happens
to the best of us.

951
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,080
Left foot first.
Easy does it. Good.

952
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,680
- Watch your head.
- All right. Take a seat.

953
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,840
Excuse me, sir.
Are you a family member?

954
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,360
Fuck, no!
This is just too good to miss!

955
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,200
Okay, sir, you're just gonna have
to wait here. All right?

956
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,280
This summer's
turned out to be great.

957
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:41,459
- How you doin', son?
- I've been better.

958
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,080
Boy, that doesn't look
too bad, Jim.

959
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,200
Good job, Doctor.

960
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,360
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.

961
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,000
Eight or nine...

962
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,160
Beach party's in a week.
Nadia's coming.

963
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,520
Doctor, my son has
a party in seven days...

964
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,560
and there's a young lady coming...

965
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,720
that he's been waiting to...

966
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,680
he's been waiting to get with.

967
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,080
I'd tell your son to keep
his pants on during that party.

968
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,880
Oh, yes. Believe me, I will be
doing that. It goes without saying.

969
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,440
But if his pants...

970
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,600
decide to come off
during the party...

971
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,640
could he have
full use of his...

972
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,240
penis?

973
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,840
Okay.

974
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,560
This should shave
a couple of days off.

975
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,160
Oh, good.

976
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,200
Thank you, Doctor.

977
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,560
Jim...

978
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,320
that's good news.

979
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,840
This has been a good-news day, son.
Here. Put this on.

980
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,400
Little chilly out there.

981
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,720
Well, here we are.

982
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,400
You know, Jim...

983
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,040
I think we should keep your mother
in the dark about the incident tonight.

984
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,360
I think the whole glue thing
might get her a little queasy.

985
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,840
I don't know how I get myself
into these things.

986
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,400
But thanks for understanding.

987
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,000
You've been really cool.

988
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,040
I mean, between this and...

989
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,800
you know...

990
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,680
You know, you may be
Jimbo or Jumbo...

991
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,760
or Jimbodinny to these guys
in here, but...

992
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,400
I want you to know
there are two people...

993
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,800
who still remember where
James Emanuel Levenstein came from.

994
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,640
We're awful proud of you, son.

995
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,480
Thanks, Dad.

996
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,000
Don't forget your penis cream.

997
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,680
That was it.

998
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,520
Right there.
That was a pure tantric moment.

999
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,320
The fiicus, the water...
it was all erotic.

1000
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,000
One more stimulant,
I would have had full release.

1001
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Finch, stay the fuck
away from that fiicus.

1002
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,760
That's a jizz-free fiicus.

1003
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
There he is. Morning, Jimbo.
How's the twig and giggleberries, man?

1004
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,320
Oh, very colourful.
My dick looks like a paint-by-numbers.

1005
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,120
You're the only guy I know
whose dick needs an instruction manual.

1006
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,920
Casa de Stifler.

1007
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,840
You're here now?
No, that's cool.

1008
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,440
You know, if you want to
hang out with these guys.

1009
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,680
Okay, then.
I'll meet you out front.

1010
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,440
- Hey, Stifler, was that...
- Eat shit, Shitbreak.

1011
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,760
She's here.

1012
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,600
My lady has arrived.

1013
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,480
- I gotta prepare.
- Here we go.

1014
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,600
- Great. Stifler's mom is here?
- This could be a disaster.

1015
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,240
Not unless Stifler's mom
drives a moped.

1016
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Moped?

1017
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,080
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
How you doin', boys?

1018
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,400
- That's Stifler's little brother.
- What are you doing here?

1019
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,880
Pussy, man.
I'm here for the pussy.

1020
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,680
Take a number.

1021
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,160
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows this is my special day.

1022
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,800
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin' dress?

1023
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,320
- Are you wearing a dress?
- Shitbreak, meet my little brother.

1024
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,080
Little brother, meet Shitbreak.

1025
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,360
- That's your brother?
- Yes.

1026
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,680
My lady's not coming.

1027
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,320
So my entire stockpile
is wasted...

1028
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,640
and I look ridiculous!

1029
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,600
Excuse me.

1030
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,080
- That didn't look too good.
- No.

1031
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:27,960
- Let's go find your room.
- So, where are the fuckin' females?

1032
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,120
I can't believe
I finally got you alone.

1033
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
That only took, what, six weeks?

1034
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,880
So, are you alone too?

1035
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,360
- Yep.
- Good.

1036
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,960
I'm all alone.

1037
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,720
Guess what I had in mind?

1038
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,200
Hey, Marco,
can you get your balls off me?

1039
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,920
- What the hell's going on over there?
- Nothing.

1040
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,160
It's just my flatmates.

1041
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,000
I guess this is kind of
a lost cause, huh?

1042
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
- Yeah, I guess so.
- See ya this weekend?

1043
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,160
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait either.

1044
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,360
Bye-bye.

1045
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,720
- Surprise!
- Holy... Nadia!

1046
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,080
You're here? You're here.
What are you doing here?

1047
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,040
Jim, I got so tired
of sightseeing.

1048
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,360
But you're... you're early.

1049
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,040
Okay.
Nice to know you.

1050
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,640
- I will leave.
- No!

1051
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,040
No.
Don't... Don't leave.

1052
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,080
Don't leave.
No leaving.

1053
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:41,160
It's just,
I'm not gonna be ready...

1054
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,160
I mean, the party won't be
ready until Saturday.

1055
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,040
I can stay here until then?

1056
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,640
Yeah.

1057
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,840
I'm gonna be right back.
Is that okay?

1058
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,400
- Okay.
- Nadia...

1059
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,840
who's in my room.
Now. Holy shit.

1060
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,080
all right, I?ve got a plan.

1061
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,640
Okay.
How about I come back with you...

1062
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,280
and you say...

1063
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,520
''Hello, this is Michele,
my girlfriend.''

1064
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,000
And obviously, Nadia won't
expect you to hop in the sack.

1065
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,520
And then we break up
the day of the party.

1066
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,560
And you're all healed
and back on the market.

1067
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,360
- You're evil.
- No way!

1068
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,480
I'm like Cupid.

1069
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,960
And I know how
to make a girl jealous.

1070
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,760
This is gonna be fun.

1071
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,760
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner...

1072
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,160
but we just started seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

1073
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,120
But I'd really love it
if you stayed here.

1074
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,920
I think you should stay
and have fun at the party.

1075
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,440
Good for you, Jim.
Of course I will stay.

1076
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,360
That's great...
That's my nipples!

1077
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,120
She just loves my nipples.

1078
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,640
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1079
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,600
No.

1080
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,640
I'm fine.

1081
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,840
I might have to
actually go through with this.

1082
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,440
What's the big deal
with Nadia, anyway?

1083
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,280
I mean, okay...

1084
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,920
so she's 50,000 times hotter
than most girls...

1085
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,320
but come on, it's just sex.

1086
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh, no.

1087
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,480
You saw the thing on the Internet.

1088
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,720
Did it look like I might have had...

1089
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,360
a slight interest in Nadia then?

1090
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,880
Add another year to that.

1091
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,040
Okay.

1092
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,520
Hey, why don't you bring Nadia
to the concert first?

1093
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,360
It'll be a cool date.

1094
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,160
We'll see how things go.

1095
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,680
Michele, you have been great.

1096
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,400
Thank you.

1097
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,040
Anytime.

1098
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,560
Come on.

1099
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,600
You ready to break up?

1100
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,920
You big, stupid dummy!

1101
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,200
Theatre is so cool!

1102
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,520
I don't care if you are the best lay
I've ever had in my life.

1103
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,600
- I hate your guts anyway.
- Don't say that.

1104
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:47,560
And I don't care if you did give me
ten orgasms in a row...

1105
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,520
because you smell really bad.

1106
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,720
I smell really bad!

1107
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,200
Because we've been having
so much sex, and...

1108
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,640
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!

1109
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,920
So, don't you go being all
super sexy guy any more...

1110
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,320
because I am now impervious...

1111
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,000
to your unrelenting machismo
and sexual ardour.

1112
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,000
And that includes fucking me
in the ass! So there!

1113
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
We had something special.

1114
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,360
Vicki. Hey.

1115
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,680
I'm so glad you came.
You want something to drink or...

1116
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,520
Can I help you?

1117
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,080
- Kevin.
- What?

1118
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,480
That's my date.

1119
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,600
You saved them all.

1120
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,280
How sweet.

1121
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,160
You don't think I'm a dork?

1122
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,120
Whatever you are, Jim,
it is what I like.

1123
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
Kevin left.
Didn't look good.

1124
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
Kevin left?

1125
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,280
Just wandered down the beach.

1126
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,160
You okay, Kev?

1127
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,080
Wanna tell us what's up?

1128
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,840
Wanna feel Finch's ass?

1129
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,520
No, I went to say hi to Vicky...

1130
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,280
and she was there with a date.

1131
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,800
You hooked up with three girls
this year. You're doing fine.

1132
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,760
Rule of three, Oz.

1133
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,320
I guess I was living in the past...
wanting to party with you guys...

1134
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,840
and be with Vicky,
just like high school.

1135
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,320
You remember
that day after prom?

1136
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,080
You know, we made
a toast to the next step.

1137
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,840
I guess I never took it.

1138
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,200
My brother said that by the end
of the summer I'd see the big picture.

1139
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,200
And I see it.

1140
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,760
No matter what, times change
and things are different.

1141
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,160
The problem is,
I don't want them to be.

1142
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,240
You know, Kevin,
I haven't moved on either.

1143
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
I've been obsessed
with the one woman...

1144
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,520
I can't have a real future with...

1145
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,480
other than a very kinky,
extremely warped one.

1146
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,080
I got to find a new goddess.

1147
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,760
It's gonna take patience,
but I've been celibate all summer.

1148
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,760
- You kinda get used to it, though, huh?
- Are you insane?

1149
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,440
Look, Kev, different does not
necessarily mean worse.

1150
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,280
As a matter of fact,
I think things are just getting better.

1151
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,440
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass
back to that party and prove it to you?

1152
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,800
I'll walk.

1153
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,360
You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1154
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,360
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.

1155
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,720
- Oh. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1156
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,920
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?

1157
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Come on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.

1158
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,840
- I think you better...
- Your loss.

1159
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,880
Wow. You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1160
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,400
Come here, dude.
You're making an ass out of yourself.

1161
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,760
You're ruining my mojo.
And you're not the Stifmeister, okay?

1162
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,120
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.

1163
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,360
Come on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.

1164
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,160
- Hey, Pop Tart.
- Dream on, midget.

1165
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,560
Excuse him. Come here.
Take this. You're on cop watch.

1166
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,400
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?

1167
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,200
All right.

1168
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,680
Gentlemen,
this appears to be a party.

1169
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,800
Guys, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.

1170
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,640
Good luck.

1171
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,000
So what was this year like for you?

1172
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,240
Did you miss high school?

1173
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,240
Well, no.

1174
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,840
When you travel as much as I do,
you get used to moving on.

1175
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,440
But I have great memories.

1176
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,800
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?

1177
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,640
Yes.

1178
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,400
Yes, we can.

1179
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,320
How romantic.

1180
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,080
Jim, come on.

1181
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,440
It's beautiful!

1182
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,120
Cool!

1183
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,840
Jim, I have told you
my memories from high school.

1184
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,600
What are yours?

1185
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,120
You.

1186
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,400
You have not changed.

1187
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,800
Jim, relax.

1188
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,080
We are just, how do you say,
tooting our horns.

1189
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,040
Actually,
that is quite difficult.

1190
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,280
What do you mean?

1191
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,240
Well, this one time
at band camp...

1192
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,480
Holy shit!

1193
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,800
What? Tell me.

1194
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,440
Well, this one time at band camp...

1195
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,560
I got stuck playing this trombone.

1196
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,680
And I can't play anything at all.
So I totally sucked.

1197
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,640
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy...

1198
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,280
but I didn't know what to think,
so I just kept playing and playing...

1199
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,360
and I didn't know
what I was doing.

1200
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,160
It was so funny!

1201
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,560
- I gotta go.
- What? Why?

1202
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,160
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

1203
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,600
but you're...

1204
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,640
you're everything
that I used to want.

1205
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,680
And as much as I may really...

1206
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,320
really regret
what I'm about to do...

1207
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,560
there's somebody else
I want to be with.

1208
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,560
You want the band geek?

1209
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,800
Nadia...

1210
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,680
I am a band geek.

1211
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,680
I just never joined the band.

1212
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,080
You go get your geek.

1213
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,440
Someday I will find mine.

1214
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,680
Hey. Kevin Myers.

1215
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,880
Hi.
Sorry I was a dick before.

1216
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,680
It's okay, man.
My name's Brett.

1217
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,480
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

1218
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,920
Look, you don't have to do this.

1219
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,400
Maybe I was being selfish...

1220
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,760
in wanting to be your friend.

1221
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,400
Maybe it's just not gonna work.

1222
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,920
I would much rather have you as a friend
than not have you in my life at all.

1223
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,600
Party on!

1224
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,360
- From the lighthouse all the way...
- Hey, handsome.

1225
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,640
What are you doing here?

1226
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,000
I was gonna pick you up
at the airport in two hours.

1227
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,280
I took an earlier flight,
and I thought I'd surprise you.

1228
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:10,080
- Yeah, you did.
- Kinda weird without the phone, huh?

1229
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,320
We'll get used to it.

1230
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,600
Come on. I wanna hear all about it.
We'll grab you a drink.

1231
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,080
Steve, this cop-watch
thing is horseshit.

1232
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,560
Hello?

1233
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,720
Man, this sucks.

1234
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,560
Who is it out there?

1235
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,160
It's the Stifmeister, baby.

1236
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,800
I that so?

1237
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,520
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

1238
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,840
It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

1239
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,240
I'm used to girls ignoring me.

1240
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,160
Or making fun of me.

1241
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,240
''Come on, Sherman.
Be the Sherminator.''

1242
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,760
Like the movie.
How clever.

1243
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,720
I get it, okay?

1244
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,800
Maybe I am a geek.

1245
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,320
Whatever.

1246
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,280
Yes! Yes, you are!

1247
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,200
All right.

1248
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,840
I am the Sherminator.

1249
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,280
A sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

1250
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,800
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

1251
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,640
I am lucky lady?

1252
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,640
That's right, Nadia.

1253
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,280
You've been targeted
for Shermination.

1254
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,920
Come with me
if you want to live.

1255
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,080
Help!

1256
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,600
- Fuck me, geek!
- Affirmative!

1257
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,040
No fuckin' way!

1258
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,080
- Forget it.
- Like you have a chance.

1259
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,440
Cheers, bud.

1260
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,760
Hey, Steve, look what I found.

1261
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,240
- Dude, don't touch the shirt.
- Just look.

1262
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,040
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1263
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,200
Brilliant.
You found lesbians.

1264
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,040
Good luck trying to break
through that force field.

1265
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,320
- Lesbians?
- We never said that.

1266
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,600
- What?
- We never said that.

1267
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,720
Oh, man.

1268
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,480
I will do anything... anything...
to sleep with you chicks.

1269
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,840
Okay? I'll grab
every guy's ass in this room.

1270
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,960
I'll caress it, even.
I'll shave some ass if they need it.

1271
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,200
Oh, yeah.
You heard me.

1272
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:11,120
It's true. I'll kiss everybody here.
Dudes, chicks, everybody.

1273
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,800
Because I am comfortable
with my sexuality.

1274
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,160
Oh, yeah.

1275
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,520
At least have a drink
with the Stifmeister.

1276
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,760
- All right.
- That's fair.

1277
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,040
All right.

1278
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,720
You truly are a Stifmeister.

1279
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,760
- Welcome back to the party.
- Steve, those are my lesbians.

1280
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,560
- Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.
- Like what?

1281
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,880
One time at this party,
I was drinking champagne...

1282
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,480
Thank you. Thank you.

1283
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,800
Our next soloist
will be Michele Flaherty.

1284
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,240
Petey?

1285
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,640
This kid is killing me.

1286
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,060
- You suck, retard.
- I'm not retarded.

1287
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,200
I'm a very special boy.

1288
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,000
How's this
for a band camp story?

1289
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,320
Come on, guys.
Let's hear it for Petey!

1290
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,060
- Good for them.
- It's awesome.

1291
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,540
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1292
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,380
We'll be back.
Come on now, baby.

1293
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,760
You know, there's only one word
for that party.

1294
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,200
- Bitchin'.
- Out of control.

1295
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,920
Am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.

1296
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,320
Later.

1297
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,920
- Good-bye.
- See ya.

1298
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,920
- Let's go to our page.
- We have to write about this party.

1299
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,760
This party was crazy!
Look at my date! He's passed out!

1300
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,200
- You drank him under the table.
- He couldn't hack it.

1301
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,800
- Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
- Absolutely.

1302
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,840
- Sorry things didn't work out for you.
- You kiddin'? Things are great.

1303
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,360
I have all the time in the world.

1304
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,440
So, are we gonna
do this every summer?

1305
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,760
- Hell, yeah, we are.
- Of course we are, gentlemen.

1306
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,360
Well, we're gonna try.

1307
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,040
- That's a sweet car.
- It is sweet.

1308
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,000
- Stifler's mom.
- Hey, Finchy.

1309
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,960
How did you know I was here?

1310
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,160
I called a couple of weeks ago.

1311
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,600
Didn't Steven tell you that
I was gonna drop by sometime?

1312
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,360
I guess it slipped his mind.

1313
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,680
What's your name?

1314
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,920
Jeanine.

1315
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,960
Okay, well...

1316
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,160
I've been thinking, and,
you know, I'm 19 years old.

1317
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,200
There's a whole world out there.
I can't be obsessed with one woman.

1318
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,920
- Just can't be.
- I'm glad you're learning, Finchy.

1319
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,080
Good.

1320
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,840
- You want to get it on?
- You better clear your schedule.

1321
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,120
See you guys later.

1322
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,160
Where are you goin', man?
What about Dog Years?

1323
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,880
Give me, like, three days.

1324
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,880
Wait, was that who I think...

1325
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,240
- No.
- Yeah!

1326
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,800
- I think it was.
- I think so too.

1327
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,560
Who the hell was that?

1328
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,080
That was...

1329
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,760
That was... Someone was lost.

1330
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,800
- Lookin' for the lake.
- Yeah, all turned around.

1331
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,960
What a dumb ass.
The lake's right there.

1332
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,920
Incredible.
How does Finch get so lucky?

1333
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,920
What are you worried about?
You got a girlfriend now.

1334
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:17,040
Everything in. Let's go.
Pony up. Dog Years awaits.

1335
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,080
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do.

1336
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,160
- I have a girlfriend now.
- Yeah, you do.

1337
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,600
- She's my girlfriend.
- All right, Jimbo.

1338
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,480
Let's go! Let's go!

1339
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,880
- Where's Shitbreak?
- The movies.

1340
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,640
- Took the bus.
- Coffee.

1341
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,760
Wait a second.

1342
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,080
Who the fuck was in that car?

1343
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,720
Oh, Finchy, I missed you.

1344
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,280
Oh, Jeanine. Jeanine.

1345
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,120
Call me Stifler's mom.

1346
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,080
Oh, Stifler's mom!
