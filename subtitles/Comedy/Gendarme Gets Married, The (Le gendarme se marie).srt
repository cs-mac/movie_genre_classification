1
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

2
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,199
It's tulip season today
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,279
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,199
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,879
Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:59,678
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:03,758
Come on, go for a ride.

8
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:05,878
No! Freeze!

9
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,518
Leg down! Leg down!

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,238
That's it. Come on.

11
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:19,317
No! You monkey-eared son of a ...

12
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:24,037
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:28,677
I'll bet you wish
you were a real ...

14
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,957
You dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:38,236
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

16
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,276
Verdell?

17
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:52,275
Verdell?

18
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:56,955
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

19
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:00,595
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,435
Mr. Udall?

21
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:10,035
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

22
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:18,954
My dog. You know ...
My dog with the adorable face.

23
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:25,074
- Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

24
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:29,634
I thought it was that coloured man.

25
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:33,033
Which colour was that?

26
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:38,233
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

27
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:41,473
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

28
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:46,153
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

29
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:50,992
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

30
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:55,312
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -

31
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,232
- I don't care
where you shove your show.

32
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:03,032
Are we done being neighbours?

33
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:10,671
- Let me ...
- No! Not worth it.

34
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:22,671
- Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

35
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,589
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:52,309
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:15,308
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

38
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:38,187
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

39
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:41,267
- Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

40
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,466
My honey. Where have you been?

41
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,866
Look at my boy.

42
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:01,506
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

43
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,025
Where was my baby?

44
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:11,305
ln the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

45
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:17,105
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

46
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:23,984
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator ...

47
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:29,224
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

48
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:37,184
''ln the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven.''

49
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,184
''This is what you live for,
he said.''

50
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:43,943
''Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval.''

51
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:48,663
''There is only the safety
of being with each other.''

52
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:54,343
''How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?''

53
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:59,863
- Mr. Udall!
- ''She was able to define love.''

54
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:02,342
''Love was ...''

55
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:07,862
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

56
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:12,302
- ''Love was ...''
- Are you in there?

57
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,462
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

58
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,422
Yes?

59
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:21,061
This can wait.

60
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:25,021
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

61
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:33,341
Well ... That's a load off.

62
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,381
Did you ... do something to him?

63
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:43,140
Do you realize
that I work at home?

64
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,180
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

65
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,820
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

66
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,779
- And put a piece of cardboard ...
- I work all the time.

67
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,899
So never interrupt me!

68
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:07,619
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -

69
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,419
- and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -

70
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:17,738
- and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

71
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:21,298
Even then, don't come knocking.

72
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:27,098
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -

73
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:32,578
- because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

74
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:37,417
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -

75
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:41,497
- and you want someone
to share the moment with.

76
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:46,977
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

77
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:50,417
Not for any reason.

78
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:54,177
Do you get me, sweetheart?

79
00:07:55,256 --> 00:08:01,296
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

80
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,336
Okay, then.

81
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:21,735
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

82
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:33,454
''Love was ...''

83
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,014
What was love?

84
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:42,054
''Love was ...''

85
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:48,574
Now I'm really pissed!

86
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:53,013
Don't touch!

87
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:57,773
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

88
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:01,653
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

89
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:08,493
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

90
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:12,492
Assault! And you're black!

91
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,892
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -

92
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:21,612
- if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

93
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:29,972
Meantime ... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

94
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:35,131
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

95
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,331
Have a nice day.

96
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,611
Party!

97
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,450
- Don't touch.
- Get a life.

98
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,490
Watch it.

99
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,049
- Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

100
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:20,449
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

101
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:25,089
I'm walking out the door, he says,
''I promise not to get a cough.''

102
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,048
- lsn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

103
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,968
I said, ''You love me the way
you love your remote control.''

104
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,208
That's great.

105
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:42,208
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

106
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:45,528
- Eat up!
- I've got your money.

107
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,567
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

108
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,607
Excuse me, Melvin.

109
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,207
There you go.

110
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:04,967
Pardon me.
Take the money.

111
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:10,966
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

112
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:16,086
- I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

113
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:21,566
Spence is more excited about it
than I am.

114
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,326
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to ...

115
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,365
- I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

116
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,445
You can sit
at someone else's station.

117
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:37,005
Or you can wait your turn.

118
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,964
How much more have you got to eat?

119
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:55,084
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

120
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:57,924
That's it!

121
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,284
Let's go.

122
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:05,043
He's barred for life.

123
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:18,043
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

124
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:25,242
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

125
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:28,282
I'm going to miss the excitement.

126
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,922
Three eggs, over easy.

127
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:36,122
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

128
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:40,282
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

129
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:43,361
You'll die soon, with that diet.

130
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:49,001
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

131
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,600
If you ever mention my son again ...

132
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,640
... you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

133
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,599
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

134
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,479
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

135
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,719
Do you?

136
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
Yes ...

137
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,598
I'll get your order.

138
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,757
Wear my earrings tonight.

139
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:06,957
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

140
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:17,037
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it ...

141
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:20,556
I sort of sleep in here.

142
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,596
Don't worry about it.

143
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,754
What?

144
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,474
I don't know.

145
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,754
Grandma ...

146
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:15,353
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

147
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:22,713
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything ...

148
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:26,713
I put these on to give you privacy.

149
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:29,393
How was dinner?

150
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:35,872
- How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

151
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:40,992
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

152
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:44,872
I have him ...

153
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:48,672
- One more spit?
- He's waiting.

154
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:51,312
Go.

155
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:55,111
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.

156
00:15:55,311 --> 00:16:00,151
- Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

157
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,671
Close the curtains.

158
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:14,550
No! He can't take smoke.

159
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,110
Magic.

160
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,069
God! That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

161
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,069
Come here.

162
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,709
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- ''Little bit of throw-up''?

163
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,988
What shall we do?

164
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,708
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay ...

165
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:01,748
No. I'll take a cab.

166
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:12,427
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

167
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,187
I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

168
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:23,347
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.

169
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:30,226
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

170
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:33,666
Okay. I just found a model.

171
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:39,186
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.

172
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:45,386
What's going on?

173
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:50,305
- Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

174
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:53,585
You picked me up some time ago.

175
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:57,585
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

176
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:02,185
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

177
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:06,505
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

178
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,064
Who is it, baby?

179
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,784
Who is it, Verdell?

180
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:25,024
I'm sorry. I told you today.

181
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,023
I was out in the studio and I ...

182
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,023
It's out here.

183
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:34,463
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

184
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:38,943
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

185
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:42,423
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

186
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:48,702
This is not a nude.

187
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,022
Just kidding around.

188
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,942
So much for love.

189
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,622
And yet another pose.

190
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:04,981
- What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

191
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:11,941
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

192
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:17,061
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

193
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:22,541
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

194
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,180
No direction.

195
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,260
What I do is, I watch.

196
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,180
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

197
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,820
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

198
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,179
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

199
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,619
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

200
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,459
They're just sort of realer
and more alive.

201
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:02,938
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

202
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:09,578
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:18,978
Oh, my God ... Hold it.

204
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:23,177
Look out.

205
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:25,217
Excuse me.

206
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,257
I got on the third line of dialogue.

207
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:33,257
And all of a sudden I blanked.

208
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,417
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

209
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:39,777
- So he said to me, ''Last chance.''
- Last chance.

210
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,016
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

211
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:47,336
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

212
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,176
He cast me!

213
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:55,096
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

214
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:04,175
Can't live without me?

215
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:11,175
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

216
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:15,135
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

217
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:20,494
- It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

218
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:25,654
''Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out.''

219
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:32,454
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

220
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:44,493
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

221
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:50,453
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection ...

222
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,653
- ls this bothering you?
- No.

223
00:21:57,372 --> 00:22:01,172
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -

224
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:05,132
- where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

225
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,572
Nice chatting.

226
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:12,252
- His name?
- Spencer.

227
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,331
Spence.

228
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,171
It's okay. Go on.

229
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,770
Put on anything you want.

230
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,290
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play!

231
00:22:57,689 --> 00:23:04,129
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

232
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,248
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

233
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:29,768
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

234
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:34,447
Wait! I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

235
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:38,127
- Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

236
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:40,607
I'm going to look at the painting.

237
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,647
Where are you going?

238
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:52,686
Want some water?
What's the matter?

239
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:54,886
You want some water?

240
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,686
Simon, wait!

241
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:15,885
Why are you doing this?

242
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:19,885
No, wait ...

243
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:23,365
- That painting in there ...
- Are you cruising him?

244
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:33,724
Excuse me ...

245
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:37,484
- Help me!
- Come on!

246
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:41,044
Come on.

247
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:56,363
You call 91 1
and don't leave your name?

248
00:24:56,523 --> 00:25:01,083
- Even a dumb geezer knows ...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

249
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,283
Ask him.

250
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:07,643
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

251
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:11,642
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

252
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:18,482
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

253
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,122
Go shake down a 7-1 1
for a day-old wiener.

254
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:26,602
There's a painting
of one of the guys.

255
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:34,601
- I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

256
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:38,801
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

257
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:41,721
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

258
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,360
Old bitch. Damn dog.

259
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
You're taking him!

260
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,360
Get out of the way!

261
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,480
Even the books.

262
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,160
Wait!

263
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,280
Do you want to say no to me?

264
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,759
I don't want to say nothing to you.

265
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,439
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

266
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,638
Thanks for looking after him.

267
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:32,518
- Hey! Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

268
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:37,478
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

269
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,438
Hey, Frank.

270
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:09,156
One, two, three, four ...

271
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,675
You're dead.

272
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:34,515
We don't have no dog food here.

273
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:39,075
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

274
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:50,154
Don't you do anything!

275
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,753
Where's the trust?

276
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:19,073
Never a break.

277
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,431
God!

278
00:28:51,591 --> 00:28:56,191
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

279
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:59,550
No, we can't reduce the price.

280
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,630
- I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

281
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,990
I'll meet you in there, okay?

282
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,950
Thank you.

283
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,869
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

284
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:24,429
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

285
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:29,029
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and ...

286
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:38,548
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

287
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:43,068
The scars might ... Oh, shit!

288
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:50,508
Jackie ...

289
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:53,668
Hand me a mirror, please.

290
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:04,707
Wait. I have a smaller one.

291
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:17,506
So how are things, anyway?

292
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:23,066
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall ... taking care of him.

293
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:28,666
- How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

294
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:33,465
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

295
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,465
I'm always on the move and ...

296
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,345
Trust me.

297
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:44,065
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

298
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:53,944
Waiting gives the devil time.

299
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,503
Oh, my!

300
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:24,703
Where did I go?

301
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,823
- That's your dog?
- No.

302
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,782
What are you doing with a dog?

303
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:37,702
- Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

304
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:43,582
No, not until now.

305
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:47,502
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

306
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,021
Hey, puppy.

307
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:54,101
It's so cute.

308
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:57,141
I wonder what breed he is.

309
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:05,141
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

310
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:10,300
How old are you?

311
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,780
To guess by your eyes ... 50.

312
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,380
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

313
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,740
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

314
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,660
- Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

315
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,179
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

316
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:35,859
What's with the dark?

317
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,299
Dawn patrol.

318
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,099
My son had
a full-blown attack.

319
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:49,378
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

320
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:52,258
No!

321
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:56,378
It's bacon for the dog.

322
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:02,218
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

323
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:08,577
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

324
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:21,217
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

325
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:36,176
Look at that dog.

326
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:41,176
I've got to give you
something real good.

327
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:45,255
I'm going to show it to you.

328
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:49,295
Don't be like me.

329
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:54,975
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

330
00:33:56,975 --> 00:34:00,015
I'd like to be treated like that.

331
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:05,454
Let's go home and do some writing.

332
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:11,174
''He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.''

333
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:14,894
''You've saved my life, she said.''

334
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:19,694
''You'd better make it up to me.''

335
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:28,173
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

336
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:32,453
62 books. Done.

337
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:38,453
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

338
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:43,452
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

339
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:47,212
- Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

340
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:50,332
And all the laundry.

341
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:58,972
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

342
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:04,611
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

343
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:10,931
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

344
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:27,690
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

345
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:37,730
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

346
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,329
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

347
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:47,729
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

348
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:53,089
Okay.

349
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,568
Hungry? Be right with you.

350
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,325
Mr. Udall.

351
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:13,805
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like ...

352
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,604
Could you take it ...

353
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:21,604
... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

354
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,604
Thank you.

355
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,524
Verdell.

356
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:36,883
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

357
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:40,323
Let's go home and get well.

358
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:46,203
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

359
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,643
Thank you.

360
00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:58,562
Come on, sweetheart.

361
00:37:58,722 --> 00:38:01,962
Verdell, come here.

362
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:06,882
I know what you want.

363
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:12,841
Where's my boy?

364
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:21,681
No, don't force him.

365
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,359
Over a dog!

366
00:38:56,999 --> 00:39:00,439
Over an ugly dog.

367
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:11,838
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

368
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:22,838
- Help!
- You'll make an appointment.

369
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,838
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -

370
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,877
- and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

371
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,357
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

372
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:38,717
- What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility ...

373
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:42,757
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

374
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,717
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

375
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,716
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

376
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:55,036
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

377
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:58,636
No, we're not doing this now.

378
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:03,676
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

379
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:06,196
No. Nope.

380
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:19,675
What if this is
as good as it gets?

381
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:34,034
What the heck are those for?

382
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:38,874
No, no, no. Get Carol.

383
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:44,634
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

384
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:51,033
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

385
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:55,113
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

386
00:40:55,273 --> 00:41:00,673
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

387
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,793
I'll pay whatever you want.

388
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:08,272
Do it!

389
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:14,072
Bryan. Code blue.

390
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:23,392
Out! Just shut up and get out.

391
00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:30,031
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

392
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:34,311
Go get Carol.

393
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:39,831
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

394
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:44,910
This day has been a disaster.

395
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,270
- I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!

396
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:56,470
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

397
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:13,069
See you.

398
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,389
It's about time.

399
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:23,428
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

400
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:34,468
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

401
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:25,625
I'm hungry.

402
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:28,905
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

403
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:33,025
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing ...

404
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:36,465
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

405
00:43:38,504 --> 00:43:43,944
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

406
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:48,864
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

407
00:43:49,024 --> 00:43:54,744
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

408
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:03,903
Yes, I do.

409
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:10,263
And to prove it ... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

410
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:15,183
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

411
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:20,462
You don't look sick.

412
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:24,582
Just tired and bitter.

413
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:29,582
My son is sick.

414
00:44:31,982 --> 00:44:34,702
What about your mother?

415
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:40,541
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

416
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:44,621
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

417
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:55,500
How are you doing?

418
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,220
You should answer me.

419
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,980
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

420
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,179
Back to life.

421
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,019
What's wrong?

422
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:29,219
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand ...

423
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:35,738
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

424
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:40,898
Look out, you guys!

425
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:46,138
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

426
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:50,258
Melvin! Wait!

427
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:54,097
Melvin! Wait!

428
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:02,657
Shut up, kids!

429
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:06,217
Give us a lift, would you?

430
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:13,376
Cover your mouth when you cough.

431
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:20,376
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

432
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:25,936
- Any chance you'll be back today?
- No! Stay away from me.

433
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:35,855
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to ...

434
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:40,455
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

435
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,895
Sorry.

436
00:46:47,535 --> 00:46:52,454
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

437
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:58,214
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

438
00:46:58,374 --> 00:47:03,494
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

439
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,254
SlMON, YOU'RE BROKE

440
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:16,493
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

441
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:21,413
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

442
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:25,333
But they'd feel strange calling you.

443
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:29,932
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

444
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:33,012
Come here.

445
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:36,932
Verdell? What's wrong?

446
00:47:37,092 --> 00:47:41,412
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

447
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:46,411
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

448
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:49,171
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,971
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

450
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:53,731
Sorry ...

451
00:47:55,171 --> 00:48:00,291
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

452
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:06,690
Oh, my God!

453
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,529
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate ...

454
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:46,288
I need this.
Just say, ''Melvin, I'll try.''

455
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,728
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

456
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:59,008
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

457
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:04,807
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

458
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:19,487
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

459
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:23,686
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

460
00:49:23,846 --> 00:49:26,366
What does it mean to you?

461
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:31,046
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

462
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:34,606
God, this is like a nightmare.

463
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:39,166
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

464
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:46,525
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

465
00:49:46,725 --> 00:49:51,085
And I take away reason
and accountability.

466
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:23,523
- Mom!
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.

467
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:26,763
- Please, what?
- I'm ...

468
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,483
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.

469
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:34,363
- Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

470
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:39,202
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

471
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:42,042
I'm home.

472
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:46,362
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

473
00:50:47,442 --> 00:50:50,602
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

474
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:53,642
Okay, doctor?

475
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:57,361
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

476
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:02,681
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

477
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:07,001
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

478
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:11,001
- ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

479
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,561
Excuse me.

480
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:19,120
- I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

481
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,480
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

482
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,600
- Did you say ''today''?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

483
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,759
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

484
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:43,359
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

485
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,519
- And how he felt.
- Good.

486
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,159
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

487
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,959
Have they done blood tests?

488
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,758
- When he was well?
- No.

489
00:51:57,918 --> 00:52:01,078
- And how about skin testing?
- No.

490
00:52:01,238 --> 00:52:04,118
- No standard scratch test?
- No.

491
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,638
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

492
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:14,037
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

493
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:19,477
- I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

494
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:27,597
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

495
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:31,357
Me.
My home number is on the card.

496
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:35,316
His home number.

497
00:52:40,196 --> 00:52:43,316
- What?
- Your home ...

498
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:52,275
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

499
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:56,155
Couple of female slaves?

500
00:52:56,315 --> 00:53:00,875
There's still a lot of tests
I need to do.

501
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:04,675
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -

502
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:09,595
- from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

503
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:19,834
Doc!

504
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,114
That's good.

505
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:37,073
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll ...

506
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:41,153
The costs
are going to be considerable.

507
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:46,033
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

508
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,392
That's wonderful.

509
00:53:54,592 --> 00:53:57,992
Thank you for everything, Nora.

510
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:03,312
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

511
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:15,751
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

512
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,631
No!

513
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,710
- ls he dead yet?
- No.

514
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:44,430
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

515
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:50,749
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

516
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:57,909
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

517
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:04,189
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

518
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:09,068
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

519
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:13,708
Did you learn to talk like this in
a ''Sailor, wanna hump-hump''-bar?

520
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:16,988
Or is this your last shot
at his whisky?

521
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,348
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

522
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:34,827
No! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

523
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:40,107
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

524
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:45,226
This lets a crazy man
into our lives.

525
00:55:47,826 --> 00:55:50,986
You know how this will turn out.

526
00:55:51,186 --> 00:55:56,106
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

527
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:02,826
Right?

528
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:12,465
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

529
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:17,105
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

530
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,785
Bye.

531
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:22,265
Bye-bye.

532
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:28,184
What a day ...

533
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:31,504
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

534
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:34,304
Thank you for walking him.

535
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:41,384
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

536
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:43,623
Go away.

537
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:49,023
- This cleaning lady doesn't ..?
- Please, just leave.

538
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:55,303
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!

539
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:03,662
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

540
00:57:05,142 --> 00:57:09,702
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

541
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:16,422
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

542
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:19,662
You'll be back on your knees
in no time.

543
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:31,141
ls this fun for you?

544
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:37,421
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

545
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:42,340
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

546
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,940
And I won't.

547
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,260
I don't want to paint any more.

548
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,780
The life I was trying for, is over.

549
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:57,540
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

550
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,299
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

551
00:58:03,899 --> 00:58:06,219
Terrified!

552
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:21,258
I was trying to give you a boost.

553
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:25,978
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

554
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:30,338
You absolute horror
of a human being.

555
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:47,297
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

556
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:49,857
Get out.

557
00:58:50,177 --> 00:58:53,977
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

558
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:56,696
It's a trick.

559
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:01,776
I keep bacon in my pocket.

560
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:04,416
See?

561
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:15,575
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

562
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:26,815
Come here, Verdell.

563
00:59:31,415 --> 00:59:33,854
Come on.

564
00:59:34,214 --> 00:59:36,134
Come here.

565
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:44,934
Just a stupid dog.

566
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:51,934
Could you leave now? Please?

567
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:57,333
I don't get it.

568
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:31,648
Mr. Udall!

569
01:01:33,408 --> 01:01:36,728
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

570
01:01:46,128 --> 01:01:50,567
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

571
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:58,847
If you ...

572
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:08,086
- If it's about thanking me ...
- That's not why I'm here.

573
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:13,286
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

574
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:19,766
Note. Put it in a note.

575
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:33,205
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

576
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:42,245
- So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

577
01:02:45,404 --> 01:02:48,844
I'm worried you did this ...

578
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:08,083
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

579
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:12,843
Look ...

580
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:19,763
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

581
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:23,802
Clear what up?

582
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:30,162
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

583
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,562
Not ever!

584
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:42,042
I'm sorry, but ...

585
01:03:43,841 --> 01:03:49,121
... we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

586
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:55,841
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

587
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:02,120
Just ... thank you.

588
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,320
So you will be at work tomorrow?

589
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,120
Yes.

590
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:32,559
''Never'', she said.

591
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:53,838
I took a chance you were up.

592
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:57,358
I brought you some Chinese soup.

593
01:04:59,477 --> 01:05:01,557
Thanks.

594
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:20,916
I've never been this tired
in my life.

595
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:30,796
I haven't been sleeping.

596
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:37,156
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

597
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,395
I'm in trouble.

598
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:45,515
It's not just the tiredness.

599
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:51,035
- Sick. Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

600
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:57,194
Everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

601
01:05:57,394 --> 01:06:01,034
You can barely find the will
to complain.

602
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:08,354
I'm glad we did this.

603
01:06:09,074 --> 01:06:12,114
Good talking to you.

604
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:25,593
- Still writing that thank-you note?
- How do you spell ''conscience''?

605
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:28,953
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

606
01:06:29,113 --> 01:06:34,153
Look, I got Sean to babysit
so we could go out.

607
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:37,992
I don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

608
01:06:38,152 --> 01:06:43,112
Spencer's okay. Start finding
something to do with your free time.

609
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:47,552
Sean, are you hungry?

610
01:06:48,432 --> 01:06:54,471
We got pizza. Sausage, pepperoni.
You want to make this later?

611
01:06:56,151 --> 01:06:59,591
We are going out, like people do.

612
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:07,591
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little, -

613
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:12,631
- then you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

614
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,950
I don't need one.
I know what's going on here.

615
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:24,470
I must finish this letter first.
This can't be right? Con-science?

616
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,270
Carol!

617
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,229
What?

618
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:51,588
It's very weird not feeling that ...

619
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:56,388
... stupid panic thing inside me.

620
01:07:57,068 --> 01:08:00,708
Without that,
I start thinking about myself.

621
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:04,188
And what good
does that ever get anybody?

622
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:10,188
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

623
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:13,027
And I felt myself ...

624
01:08:14,307 --> 01:08:17,787
... giving them a dirty look.

625
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:24,067
I just had no idea.
Everything was ...

626
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,266
Go ahead.

627
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:37,666
Moving in the wrong direction.

628
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:44,506
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man ...

629
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,946
... to hold fucking ...

630
01:08:50,985 --> 01:08:54,665
... hands with.

631
01:08:56,345 --> 01:09:02,305
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

632
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:10,624
Which is probably why I make Spence
hug me more than he wants to.

633
01:09:12,384 --> 01:09:17,184
He has to make up for
his Mom not getting any.

634
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:26,863
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?

635
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:31,903
Leave me be.
What is it you want?

636
01:09:32,063 --> 01:09:38,143
Does getting me thinking about all
that's wrong have some purpose?

637
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:43,063
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

638
01:09:43,423 --> 01:09:47,742
- What?
- I want us to go out.

639
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:20,581
- Thank you.
- I'll send you a thank-you note.

640
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,580
That's why you brought me here?

641
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:35,140
Well, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

642
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:39,140
But the dog did throw up
twice last night.

643
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:44,459
- Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

644
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:47,779
- They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it ...

645
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:50,859
Sorry.

646
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:55,819
- This is for later.
- What's this?

647
01:10:56,859 --> 01:11:00,539
- It's a note.
- A note?

648
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:04,098
- A thank-you note.
- No thank you.

649
01:11:04,258 --> 01:11:08,818
- You can read it later.
- No thank-you note. No, no.

650
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:14,618
Thank you.

651
01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:26,377
- She's nice.
- Yeah, really nice.

652
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:33,337
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, ''No thanks required''?

653
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:38,777
Sure looks like it went over, too.

654
01:11:39,857 --> 01:11:43,256
Look at you.

655
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:48,536
You're making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

656
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:56,056
- What?
- You think I'm a mark ...

657
01:11:56,256 --> 01:12:01,015
You helped with the dog. I'm as
concerned about Simon as you are.

658
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:04,055
- Concerned?
- He needs more than money.

659
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:08,855
He must go to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

660
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:12,695
They have to help. It's the rules.

661
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:16,415
That's great. Let them help him.

662
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:20,134
Only ...

663
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:25,454
... I got a painter coming through,
so I'm out.

664
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:30,934
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!

665
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:35,854
Take my car? A convertible.

666
01:12:37,214 --> 01:12:41,013
- Do you drive?
- Yes. But I'm not doing it.

667
01:12:41,173 --> 01:12:43,893
Getting loud.

668
01:12:45,373 --> 01:12:50,413
- He wants me to take his car ...
- I want your problems.

669
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:54,973
Somebody offers me a convertible
so I can get out of this city ...

670
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:05,172
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

671
01:13:05,332 --> 01:13:10,652
I'll take him. Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

672
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:20,491
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

673
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:30,331
If there's some health foundation
for people like you, let me know.

674
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:35,570
- Last-word freak.
- Good luck, lady.

675
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:39,930
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

676
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:46,290
I'm going to give my queer neighbour
a lift to Baltimore.

677
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:54,969
What I did for you ...
It's working out?

678
01:13:57,289 --> 01:14:00,849
What you did changed my life.

679
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:03,809
No!

680
01:14:04,249 --> 01:14:06,769
No thank-you note.

681
01:14:06,969 --> 01:14:12,089
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life -

682
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:17,488
- is that you have done more
for my mother, my son ...

683
01:14:17,688 --> 01:14:21,168
... and me
than anybody else ever has.

684
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:24,728
I'm just going to read you
this part of it

685
01:14:25,648 --> 01:14:31,288
''That makes you the most generous
person I ever met in my life.''

686
01:14:31,448 --> 01:14:35,887
''And you're going to be
in our daily prayers, forever.''

687
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:39,247
Lovely.

688
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:44,567
I also wrote one part ...
I wrote that I was sorry.

689
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:50,767
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you -

690
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:54,966
- when you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

691
01:14:55,126 --> 01:15:01,406
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I'm sorry for that night ...

692
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:05,886
... when I said that I was never ...

693
01:15:06,046 --> 01:15:11,405
I'm sorry for every time your food
was cold and you had to wait.

694
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:18,245
And I'm sorry for never spotting the
human being that did this for us.

695
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:23,405
I'll just start from the beginning.

696
01:15:23,605 --> 01:15:27,005
''I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you.''

697
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:32,524
''The word grateful doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel.''

698
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:39,924
That's nice of you. Thank you.

699
01:15:42,724 --> 01:15:45,484
Thank you.

700
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:57,243
Now I want you
to do something for me.

701
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:08,682
I'm sorry. Didn't I say ''what''?
I thought I did.

702
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:16,282
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

703
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:19,882
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

704
01:16:20,082 --> 01:16:27,082
He might pull the stiff one-eye
on me. I need you to chaperone.

705
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:33,481
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook. Two days.

706
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:39,161
- I can't. My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

707
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:47,000
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

708
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:53,000
- I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?

709
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,720
ls there any other way to see it?

710
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,480
No.

711
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:11,239
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

712
01:17:19,799 --> 01:17:22,479
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

713
01:17:45,357 --> 01:17:48,757
- You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

714
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:53,957
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

715
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:58,357
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you're going to say.

716
01:17:58,517 --> 01:18:01,637
I mean ... I think I know.

717
01:18:02,437 --> 01:18:08,676
- I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

718
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:14,556
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

719
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:21,516
Maybe ...

720
01:18:21,836 --> 01:18:26,595
- Yes. Let's ... Let's.
- Okay.

721
01:18:29,555 --> 01:18:33,355
- What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

722
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:37,635
Okay, then. Goodnight.

723
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:46,754
- Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.

724
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:52,994
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.

725
01:18:54,514 --> 01:18:56,274
Lip kiss.

726
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:04,393
I love you. I'll miss you ...
Real sensitive.

727
01:19:05,313 --> 01:19:09,393
- Bye.
- Call when you're settled.

728
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:20,912
- Have a good time.
- Don't run!

729
01:19:21,352 --> 01:19:25,912
Have fun, but don't run.

730
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:33,192
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you.
- So am I, Frank.

731
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:36,032
Give me a hug.

732
01:19:37,032 --> 01:19:39,551
Everything's going to be okay.

733
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:45,191
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

734
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:53,071
Hello.

735
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,270
Thank you for being on time.

736
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:10,270
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

737
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:17,349
Holy God. Who did that to you?

738
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:22,789
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

739
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:26,549
And I was hospitalized.

740
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:32,389
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk later.

741
01:20:36,109 --> 01:20:38,988
- I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?

742
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:43,868
- There's no place cards.
- You need room.

743
01:20:45,268 --> 01:20:47,868
So I'll sit in the back.

744
01:21:01,187 --> 01:21:04,027
Never a break. Never.

745
01:21:04,787 --> 01:21:07,587
Thank you. It was very thoughtful.

746
01:21:08,387 --> 01:21:12,267
- You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

747
01:21:14,906 --> 01:21:16,026
Thanks.

748
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,626
Thank you.

749
01:21:27,746 --> 01:21:29,666
You're welcome.

750
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:36,745
I've got the whole trip programmed.

751
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:44,505
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

752
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:48,505
TO USE AS lCEBREAKER

753
01:21:48,705 --> 01:21:51,545
We've got good stuff here.

754
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:08,664
I like this music.

755
01:22:10,544 --> 01:22:13,463
I like this music.

756
01:22:26,623 --> 01:22:30,303
I'm sure
they did something really off.

757
01:22:30,463 --> 01:22:37,302
But something will always be off
for you, unless you set it straight.

758
01:22:38,142 --> 01:22:42,662
And maybe this thing happened to you
to give you a chance to do that.

759
01:22:42,822 --> 01:22:45,542
Nonsense. You want to know why?

760
01:22:45,702 --> 01:22:49,622
Anyone interested in what Melvin
has to say, raise their hand.

761
01:22:57,821 --> 01:23:01,981
Want to know
what happened with my parents?

762
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:07,741
- When I was ...
- Wait. I'm going to pull over.

763
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:16,180
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.

764
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,180
She was sort of fabulous about it.

765
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:26,260
She ... I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it.

766
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,619
And she was very natural.

767
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:33,179
So she used to pose nude for me.

768
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:37,939
I always thought
that my father knew about it.

769
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:41,699
- This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.

770
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:45,699
- Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop!

771
01:23:47,538 --> 01:23:52,018
Go ahead. Don't let him stop you.

772
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:57,898
One day he walked in and found us.
And he started screaming.

773
01:23:58,058 --> 01:24:01,138
My father didn't come out
for 1 1 years.

774
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:05,898
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

775
01:24:10,457 --> 01:24:15,617
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

776
01:24:15,777 --> 01:24:17,937
Please, come on.

777
01:24:19,217 --> 01:24:21,937
He was ...

778
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:26,816
I was defending my mother.

779
01:24:27,176 --> 01:24:33,256
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

780
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:38,136
I said,
''She's not naked. It's art.''

781
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:44,296
And he started hitting me.

782
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:47,815
He beat me unconscious.

783
01:24:48,335 --> 01:24:54,255
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.

784
01:24:55,015 --> 01:24:59,535
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

785
01:24:59,735 --> 01:25:05,534
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

786
01:25:06,294 --> 01:25:11,894
A big sweaty wad of money.

787
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:17,774
And he said, ''I don't want you
to ever come back.''

788
01:25:17,934 --> 01:25:21,774
I just grabbed him
and I hugged him.

789
01:25:21,974 --> 01:25:25,573
And he turned and walked out.

790
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:40,573
- We all have these stories.
- It's not true.

791
01:25:40,853 --> 01:25:43,532
Some of us have great stories.

792
01:25:43,732 --> 01:25:49,412
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

793
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:54,372
No one here. But a lot of people.
That's their story ...

794
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:59,932
Good times, noodle salad.
It's not that you had it bad, -

795
01:26:00,092 --> 01:26:04,531
- but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

796
01:26:04,691 --> 01:26:09,331
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

797
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,291
Not it at all?

798
01:26:12,851 --> 01:26:17,891
Let's go to the hotel.

799
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:23,530
You'll see if you can get another
wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

800
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:35,410
Can I ask you a personal question?

801
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:40,729
Sure.

802
01:26:40,889 --> 01:26:44,889
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

803
01:26:46,249 --> 01:26:52,209
- Wouldn't your life be easier ..?
- You consider your life easy?

804
01:26:53,529 --> 01:26:57,809
I give you that one.

805
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:02,888
Nice packing.

806
01:27:10,608 --> 01:27:14,888
- Hey, Spence.
- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

807
01:27:15,088 --> 01:27:19,207
- Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, lscored a goal.

808
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:23,207
- You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie.

809
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:27,687
That's great.
Oh my God!

810
01:27:28,447 --> 01:27:32,087
- We're playing again. Got to go.
- Wait ...

811
01:27:34,607 --> 01:27:38,766
- He scored a goal.
- I don't believe it.

812
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:40,966
You would have died.

813
01:27:42,646 --> 01:27:46,606
My son was outside playing soccer.

814
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:51,646
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

815
01:27:53,326 --> 01:27:58,085
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

816
01:27:58,285 --> 01:28:00,405
No.

817
01:28:00,565 --> 01:28:03,965
All right.

818
01:28:04,405 --> 01:28:08,965
- Are you sad or something?
- No. I'm nervous.

819
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:15,085
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

820
01:28:27,204 --> 01:28:31,804
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

821
01:28:33,884 --> 01:28:36,963
Let's get dressed.

822
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:49,283
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

823
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:27,521
All set?

824
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,200
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

825
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,320
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

826
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,640
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

827
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,119
Good evening.

828
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:57,119
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking.

829
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,919
- You can answer.
- Yes, we do.

830
01:30:01,799 --> 01:30:04,879
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

831
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,199
They require a tie and jacket.

832
01:30:21,558 --> 01:30:28,158
No. I'm not putting that on. And I
won't let you inject me with plague.

833
01:30:28,318 --> 01:30:33,197
It's a nice place. You dry-clean
these all the time, don't you?

834
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:36,397
I don't think so.

835
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:49,116
You just wait here.

836
01:31:00,556 --> 01:31:02,116
Good evening.

837
01:31:04,036 --> 01:31:07,995
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

838
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:14,155
- No?
- That one.

839
01:31:14,315 --> 01:31:16,835
And this tie.

840
01:31:25,755 --> 01:31:27,354
Excuse me.

841
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:35,674
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

842
01:31:36,394 --> 01:31:41,914
- Should I get her for you?
- No. I'll just watch.

843
01:32:24,351 --> 01:32:26,471
Ma'am ...

844
01:33:04,189 --> 01:33:06,509
You look so se ...

845
01:33:08,909 --> 01:33:11,949
You look great.

846
01:33:13,149 --> 01:33:15,189
You look great.

847
01:33:25,108 --> 01:33:27,668
You want to dance?

848
01:33:27,828 --> 01:33:31,548
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

849
01:33:31,948 --> 01:33:33,908
No.

850
01:33:36,348 --> 01:33:38,628
I don't get this place.

851
01:33:38,788 --> 01:33:44,987
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

852
01:33:46,107 --> 01:33:51,227
What? Wait.
Where are you going? Why?

853
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:57,867
I didn't mean it that way. Sit down.

854
01:33:58,027 --> 01:34:03,026
- Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

855
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:06,066
I need one. Quick.

856
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:10,066
What you just said hurt my feelings.

857
01:34:10,266 --> 01:34:14,866
The minute someone gets that they
need you they threaten to walk out.

858
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:19,425
A compliment is
something nice about somebody else.

859
01:34:19,705 --> 01:34:22,105
Now or never.

860
01:34:32,065 --> 01:34:35,065
And mean it.

861
01:34:44,984 --> 01:34:47,904
Can we order first?

862
01:34:53,584 --> 01:34:57,743
Two hard-shell crab dinners ...
Pitcher of cold beer.

863
01:34:57,903 --> 01:35:02,063
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

864
01:35:03,463 --> 01:35:06,863
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

865
01:35:07,023 --> 01:35:11,143
I'll tell your waiter.

866
01:35:12,063 --> 01:35:18,622
I've got a great compliment for you.
And it's true.

867
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:25,822
- I'm afraid it's something awful.
- Don't be pessimistic.

868
01:35:25,982 --> 01:35:32,182
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

869
01:35:33,662 --> 01:35:37,861
I've got this ... ailment.

870
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:45,421
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to, -

871
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:51,181
- says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases a pill really helps.

872
01:35:51,821 --> 01:35:54,940
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing.

873
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:59,740
I'm using the word ''hate'' here
about pills.

874
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:05,260
My compliment is, the night you came
over and told me you would never ...

875
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:11,380
All right, you know what you said.

876
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,739
My compliment to you is, -

877
01:36:15,219 --> 01:36:19,859
- the next morning
I started taking the pills.

878
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:26,659
How is that a compliment for me?

879
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:36,138
You make me
want to be a better man.

880
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:50,018
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

881
01:36:54,137 --> 01:36:59,817
Maybe I overshot a bit
to keep you from walking out.

882
01:37:11,016 --> 01:37:16,456
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

883
01:37:22,056 --> 01:37:25,256
It's little by little.

884
01:37:25,896 --> 01:37:30,855
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

885
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:53,934
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

886
01:37:54,094 --> 01:37:56,094
Never.

887
01:37:56,534 --> 01:37:59,654
Here's the trouble with never.

888
01:38:20,213 --> 01:38:25,253
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

889
01:38:25,653 --> 01:38:30,972
When I first saw you
I thought you were handsome.

890
01:38:32,132 --> 01:38:35,212
Then, of course, you spoke.

891
01:38:36,892 --> 01:38:42,892
So now that your ...
soft underbelly is all exposed ...

892
01:38:43,772 --> 01:38:47,971
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

893
01:38:50,251 --> 01:38:51,851
Well, I ...

894
01:38:56,811 --> 01:39:01,931
- That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

895
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:05,850
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

896
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:10,690
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

897
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:14,090
I ...

898
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:20,050
There's a lot of reasons.

899
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:26,609
- If you had sex with Simon ...
- What?

900
01:39:27,489 --> 01:39:32,929
- That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

901
01:39:33,089 --> 01:39:37,329
Like I'm a what ..?
And I owe you what?

902
01:39:37,489 --> 01:39:42,049
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought.

903
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:45,608
It came out first.

904
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:49,768
You kiss him ... me ...
You two seemed to hit it off.

905
01:39:49,928 --> 01:39:54,448
Wait. I didn't mean ...
Forget what I said about Simon.

906
01:39:54,608 --> 01:39:58,208
- I'll never forget it.
- A mistake.

907
01:39:58,408 --> 01:40:00,688
It was a mistake.

908
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:10,447
Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
We're unable to take yourcall.

909
01:40:10,607 --> 01:40:15,967
- Leave a message.
- Say goodbye ... and thank you.

910
01:40:16,327 --> 01:40:19,167
It's Simon.

911
01:40:19,727 --> 01:40:22,566
I'm in town.

912
01:40:26,606 --> 01:40:32,286
You've never been out later than
ten o'clock. Pick up the phone.

913
01:40:34,366 --> 01:40:37,166
Really.

914
01:40:40,406 --> 01:40:44,765
I'm going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

915
01:40:44,925 --> 01:40:47,805
Or at least
get you to answer the phone.

916
01:40:56,525 --> 01:40:58,125
How are you?

917
01:40:59,005 --> 01:41:03,604
- ls this going to be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

918
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:08,324
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

919
01:41:10,804 --> 01:41:14,924
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

920
01:41:18,044 --> 01:41:21,043
I'm taking a big bath.

921
01:41:21,203 --> 01:41:24,123
Are you okay?

922
01:41:24,483 --> 01:41:28,123
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my complaints.

923
01:41:28,323 --> 01:41:32,963
- What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

924
01:41:34,363 --> 01:41:39,122
Can you believe, in our little mix
you're the good roommate?

925
01:41:50,562 --> 01:41:52,802
Goodnight.

926
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,079
Hold it.

927
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:58,238
I have to draw you.

928
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:03,318
- I have to draw you.
- No.

929
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:07,878
- I'm more shy than people think.
- I have to.

930
01:43:08,038 --> 01:43:12,318
- I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

931
01:43:13,718 --> 01:43:18,317
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

932
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:22,117
The back. The line of you.

933
01:43:23,637 --> 01:43:27,917
You're why cavemen
chiselled on walls.

934
01:43:29,957 --> 01:43:32,917
Cut me a break.

935
01:43:54,115 --> 01:43:57,755
The next thing I know
she's sitting next to me.

936
01:43:58,955 --> 01:44:04,115
It's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

937
01:44:04,275 --> 01:44:07,555
I said the wrong thing.

938
01:44:10,395 --> 01:44:13,314
Where, if I hadn't, -

939
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:17,234
- I could be in bed now
with a woman who ...

940
01:44:17,394 --> 01:44:21,394
If you make her laugh,
you got a life.

941
01:44:22,474 --> 01:44:25,274
lnstead, I'm here with you.

942
01:44:25,434 --> 01:44:30,354
No offence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

943
01:44:33,593 --> 01:44:36,593
Jameson, soda back.

944
01:44:38,113 --> 01:44:42,193
I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

945
01:44:42,353 --> 01:44:47,113
No, this is ...
This is great. This is so great.

946
01:44:47,273 --> 01:44:51,872
My hand won't even keep up.
Hold it.

947
01:44:52,032 --> 01:44:55,672
- I'm just turning.
- But hold that.

948
01:44:56,472 --> 01:44:59,952
My hand's not even bothering me.

949
01:45:02,032 --> 01:45:05,752
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

950
01:45:08,992 --> 01:45:11,151
Careful.

951
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:18,951
PRlVACY

952
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:25,391
I'm coming in. It's late.

953
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:36,150
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

954
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:41,750
Sorry.

955
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:47,110
I didn't know she was still here ...
Did you have sex with her?

956
01:45:47,269 --> 01:45:51,829
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

957
01:45:52,749 --> 01:45:58,429
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

958
01:46:03,309 --> 01:46:06,189
I just love her.

959
01:46:11,068 --> 01:46:14,068
How are you doing?

960
01:46:28,067 --> 01:46:31,867
- Mom, hi.
- Hello, Simon.

961
01:46:32,027 --> 01:46:35,467
- You were right We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?

962
01:46:35,627 --> 01:46:40,827
- I'm nota screamer.
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

963
01:46:40,987 --> 01:46:44,706
- Yourfatheris not feeling well.
- I can't hear you.

964
01:46:44,866 --> 01:46:47,946
- Hold on.
- What are you going to do?

965
01:46:48,546 --> 01:46:52,626
- I get why you're angry with me ...
- He's talking to his parents.

966
01:46:52,786 --> 01:46:57,226
Listen to me. Truly no grudges.

967
01:46:57,426 --> 01:47:01,906
It was odd that you didn't come and
see me when you heard I was hurt.

968
01:47:02,066 --> 01:47:04,785
- We almost did.
- I don't want to talk about it.

969
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:09,265
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

970
01:47:09,425 --> 01:47:12,505
- I'm working again.
- Good. Aboutmoney ...

971
01:47:12,665 --> 01:47:19,545
No. I'll drop you a line. It's up
to you to make the next move.

972
01:47:19,705 --> 01:47:24,744
He's going to want to stay.
And they'll take a ride to the lake.

973
01:47:25,584 --> 01:47:30,144
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

974
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:36,024
We'll probably have a five-hour
drive. It'll give us a chance to ...

975
01:47:37,584 --> 01:47:40,904
- I'm coming.
- What about your parents?

976
01:47:41,064 --> 01:47:44,703
- No. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

977
01:47:44,863 --> 01:47:49,863
- You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

978
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:53,543
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

979
01:47:53,903 --> 01:47:57,343
Carol, a load has been lifted.

980
01:47:59,663 --> 01:48:02,862
- One night wih me.
- You think you're kidding.

981
01:48:06,782 --> 01:48:11,862
- No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

982
01:48:12,022 --> 01:48:15,662
Let me see ... Gorgeous.

983
01:48:16,542 --> 01:48:21,101
Do it. And get the dog picked up. I
can't believe he let it stay there.

984
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,941
Goodbye.

985
01:48:24,141 --> 01:48:26,221
Your luck's running.

986
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:31,301
They sub-let your place.
You're homeless.

987
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:36,901
- Frank's got a line on a new place.
- Where?

988
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:40,940
Does it matter?

989
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:44,860
No, it doesn't.

990
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:48,700
I'm fine. Like the hat?

991
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,500
I'm sorry.

992
01:49:05,979 --> 01:49:08,299
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY

993
01:49:22,858 --> 01:49:27,898
- I don't want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.

994
01:49:30,258 --> 01:49:36,338
- This one has a meaning.
- I don't want to hear it.

995
01:49:57,696 --> 01:50:01,736
Here's the keys to my apartment.

996
01:50:01,896 --> 01:50:05,976
Go up there and wait
and I'll take Carol home.

997
01:50:06,136 --> 01:50:10,496
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

998
01:50:15,695 --> 01:50:18,495
Can you come here?

999
01:50:18,655 --> 01:50:22,295
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1000
01:50:22,455 --> 01:50:27,615
I don't want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.

1001
01:50:30,855 --> 01:50:33,695
You have my number.

1002
01:50:35,014 --> 01:50:39,014
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1003
01:50:40,054 --> 01:50:43,054
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1004
01:50:51,214 --> 01:50:53,853
Don't say anything.

1005
01:50:57,293 --> 01:51:02,493
I've got to get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

1006
01:51:03,453 --> 01:51:07,013
I think you're going to
have to camp it here.

1007
01:51:07,173 --> 01:51:10,333
There's Verdell!

1008
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:21,652
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1009
01:51:23,092 --> 01:51:27,172
Sorry. You're fun to mess with.

1010
01:51:28,292 --> 01:51:33,411
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

1011
01:51:33,571 --> 01:51:38,251
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

1012
01:51:38,411 --> 01:51:43,211
- It's got good light.
- I'm coming.

1013
01:51:47,971 --> 01:51:51,770
It's nice. Looks good.

1014
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:59,250
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

1015
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:01,770
I have to say they did a good job.

1016
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:10,329
It's going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?

1017
01:52:14,929 --> 01:52:19,329
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

1018
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:29,968
I love you.

1019
01:52:33,888 --> 01:52:40,288
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1020
01:52:51,927 --> 01:52:55,407
Make yourself at home.

1021
01:52:56,687 --> 01:52:59,207
Anything else in the bag?

1022
01:52:59,367 --> 01:53:02,967
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1023
01:53:03,127 --> 01:53:06,487
I love my cookbook.

1024
01:53:06,647 --> 01:53:11,446
It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

1025
01:53:11,606 --> 01:53:16,646
Shark with a bite.
Would you like that, Spencer?

1026
01:53:16,806 --> 01:53:19,406
And some cookies here
called Wasps' Nests.

1027
01:53:22,686 --> 01:53:26,006
Where is my big hairy boy?

1028
01:53:26,206 --> 01:53:30,805
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

1029
01:53:30,965 --> 01:53:33,045
Sweetheart!

1030
01:53:33,205 --> 01:53:36,525
- Oh, you're in bed.
- No, no.

1031
01:53:39,765 --> 01:53:46,684
I just didn't think Verdell should
get too comfortable sleeping here.

1032
01:53:46,844 --> 01:53:50,364
The dog's already comfortable.

1033
01:53:54,204 --> 01:53:56,084
ls this okay?

1034
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:01,364
Hello ... Hi, it's me.

1035
01:54:01,804 --> 01:54:06,843
He took me in.
It's Carol for you.

1036
01:54:07,003 --> 01:54:11,643
- Jackie brought it all over ...
- Just take the dog.

1037
01:54:12,603 --> 01:54:14,483
Take the dog.

1038
01:54:17,723 --> 01:54:23,003
- Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

1039
01:54:38,682 --> 01:54:41,682
- Howare you doing?
- Not so hot.

1040
01:54:41,842 --> 01:54:47,361
- Why? What's wrong?
- Was I sensible or hard on you?

1041
01:54:47,641 --> 01:54:53,681
- Maybe both.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

1042
01:54:53,841 --> 01:54:58,321
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer.

1043
01:54:58,521 --> 01:55:00,841
Just listen to me.

1044
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:05,680
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1045
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:11,280
And what I said on the street ...
That was a bad thing to say.

1046
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:17,360
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1047
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:22,239
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1048
01:55:23,799 --> 01:55:29,679
But you do bother me.
And I know it's better for me ...

1049
01:55:29,879 --> 01:55:34,279
... to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1050
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:38,799
You're an old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

1051
01:55:38,959 --> 01:55:44,398
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1052
01:55:50,798 --> 01:55:53,638
Anyway. Thanks for the trip.

1053
01:55:55,358 --> 01:55:57,598
Goodnight.

1054
01:55:57,758 --> 01:56:00,717
Okay if I say something now?

1055
01:56:04,597 --> 01:56:07,077
Go ahead.

1056
01:56:08,037 --> 01:56:12,037
I should have danced with you.

1057
01:56:14,997 --> 01:56:18,317
Goodnight.

1058
01:56:37,076 --> 01:56:41,475
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm coming.

1059
01:56:51,475 --> 01:56:56,315
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1060
01:56:56,475 --> 01:57:00,554
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1061
01:57:01,634 --> 01:57:04,394
I'm dying here.

1062
01:57:05,634 --> 01:57:11,314
- Because ... you love her.
- No.

1063
01:57:11,474 --> 01:57:14,594
And you people
are supposed to be sensitive?

1064
01:57:14,754 --> 01:57:18,993
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's ''dying here''.

1065
01:57:19,153 --> 01:57:22,673
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1066
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:26,473
- I'll figure it out.
- Please ...

1067
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:33,953
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1068
01:57:35,992 --> 01:57:40,712
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1069
01:57:40,872 --> 01:57:43,952
It's better than this.

1070
01:57:44,112 --> 01:57:48,392
If you're going to give me hope,
you've got to do better.

1071
01:57:48,552 --> 01:57:52,272
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut up.

1072
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:56,271
I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

1073
01:57:56,431 --> 01:57:59,391
Picking on me won't help.

1074
01:58:00,471 --> 01:58:04,191
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1075
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:08,231
Do you know where you're lucky?

1076
01:58:12,791 --> 01:58:16,310
You know who you want.

1077
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:22,310
I would take your seat any day.
Do something. Go over there.

1078
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:27,550
Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1079
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:31,550
You can do this, Melvin.

1080
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:34,789
Tell her how you feel.

1081
01:58:34,989 --> 01:58:39,029
- I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1082
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:43,629
- She might kill me if I go there.
- Then stay. I'll read you a story.

1083
01:58:43,789 --> 01:58:49,349
The best thing going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself.

1084
01:58:49,509 --> 01:58:53,108
Go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1085
01:59:02,508 --> 01:59:05,068
Thanks a lot.

1086
01:59:06,668 --> 01:59:09,348
Here I go.

1087
01:59:18,027 --> 01:59:20,707
What's wrong?

1088
01:59:22,227 --> 01:59:25,227
I forgot to lock the door.

1089
02:00:40,303 --> 02:00:43,783
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1090
02:00:43,943 --> 02:00:47,102
I wasn't asleep.

1091
02:00:50,302 --> 02:00:53,182
What a break.

1092
02:00:54,102 --> 02:00:57,622
ls it a secret
what you're doing here?

1093
02:00:59,782 --> 02:01:02,622
I had to see you.

1094
02:01:05,661 --> 02:01:07,861
Because?

1095
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:14,061
It relaxes me.

1096
02:01:14,501 --> 02:01:18,461
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb -

1097
02:01:18,661 --> 02:01:22,861
- than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1098
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:25,540
That's overstating.

1099
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:31,340
I'd rather be sitting inside so I
don't get my feet in the gutter.

1100
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:36,820
Stop. Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1101
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:40,580
A regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1102
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:43,979
Everybody wants that.
It doesn't exist.

1103
02:01:47,459 --> 02:01:52,379
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1104
02:01:58,259 --> 02:02:01,339
Boyfriend ...

1105
02:02:04,098 --> 02:02:09,178
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

1106
02:02:09,378 --> 02:02:13,338
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1107
02:02:16,578 --> 02:02:20,178
Maybe we could.

1108
02:02:44,056 --> 02:02:48,856
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

1109
02:02:51,656 --> 02:02:56,976
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1110
02:02:57,816 --> 02:03:02,775
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse ...

1111
02:03:03,575 --> 02:03:07,575
There's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

1112
02:03:07,775 --> 02:03:13,295
That way we're not screwy,
but two people that like warm rolls.

1113
02:03:36,614 --> 02:03:42,773
- What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.

1114
02:03:49,853 --> 02:03:54,493
And darling
I'm neverlonely

1115
02:03:54,653 --> 02:03:58,012
wheneveryou're in sight...

1116
02:03:58,812 --> 02:04:00,692
Thank you.

1117
02:04:02,172 --> 02:04:05,332
I was ...

1118
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:23,691
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is won't work.

1119
02:04:31,771 --> 02:04:34,091
- I'm ...
- What?

1120
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,850
I'm feeling better.

1121
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:45,610
It may seem that way now,
but you don't know me all that well.

1122
02:04:46,450 --> 02:04:49,370
I'm not the answer for you.

1123
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:53,450
- I've got a compliment for you.
- You know what?

1124
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:57,329
Let me talk.

1125
02:05:03,649 --> 02:05:07,249
I might be the only person
on the earth -

1126
02:05:07,449 --> 02:05:10,329
- that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

1127
02:05:10,489 --> 02:05:17,768
I might be the only one who knows
how amazing you are.

1128
02:05:18,128 --> 02:05:22,128
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

1129
02:05:23,288 --> 02:05:27,328
And in every single thought
you have.

1130
02:05:27,488 --> 02:05:33,927
How you almost always mean something
that's about being straight or good.

1131
02:05:35,127 --> 02:05:38,807
Most people miss that about you.

1132
02:05:39,127 --> 02:05:44,087
I wonder how they can watch you
bring their food and clear tables -

1133
02:05:44,247 --> 02:05:48,367
- and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1134
02:05:48,567 --> 02:05:53,486
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good ...

1135
02:05:54,366 --> 02:05:58,406
... about me.

1136
02:06:04,566 --> 02:06:10,766
ls that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

1137
02:06:19,565 --> 02:06:21,885
No.

1138
02:06:24,525 --> 02:06:27,645
I'm going to grab you?

1139
02:06:27,805 --> 02:06:32,284
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

1140
02:06:54,803 --> 02:06:57,563
I know I can do better than that.

1141
02:07:20,042 --> 02:07:23,762
Better. Definitely better.

1142
02:07:27,602 --> 02:07:30,481
See?

1143
02:07:43,921 --> 02:07:48,440
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1144
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:58,760
Excuse us.
