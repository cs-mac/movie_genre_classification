1
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,150
"And the Raven, never flitting,"

2
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,725
"still is sitting, still is sitting."

3
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,353
"On the pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door."

4
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,555
"And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming."

5
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,196
"And the lamp-light o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor.."

6
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:29,469
"And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor."

7
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,135
"Shall be lifted.. nevermore!"

8
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,540
Pretty good, huh? Okay.

9
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:41,085
I want you to read
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

10
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,210
You're gonna like it.

11
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:45,813
It's about a schoolteacher
who gets chased by a headless demon.

12
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

13
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:01,070
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing in the hallway?

14
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:04,232
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday.

15
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:08,210
You sound like one of my students.
Why don't you carry my books?

16
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:11,777
I hope you haven't made any plans
for this afternoon.

17
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:14,476
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

18
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:51,947
You okay?

19
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,016
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

20
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,118
- It didn't used to bother me.
- Enjoy the ride, folks?

21
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:16,834
That's it. Take it away.

22
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:55,102
- Do you want to come in?
- I'd better not.

23
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,172
Are you all right?

24
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,579
I'm okay.

25
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,423
I had a wonderful time.

26
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,295
Are you sure you don't want to come in?

27
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,600
You could spend the night here.

28
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,842
Better not.

29
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,777
Some things are worth waiting for.

30
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,513
My books.

31
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:45,760
Johnny, wait!

32
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:56,267
I'm so crazy about you.

33
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm going to marry you, you know?

34
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,340
You'd better.

35
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:15,246
- Drive carefully.
- I will.

36
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,796
Where's Intensive Care?

37
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,449
Johnny.

38
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,758
Johnny, don't leave me, please.

39
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:49,529
Johnny, you're going to get better.
I know you are.

40
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,330
Can you hear me?

41
00:09:57,543 --> 00:10:00,740
We're going to get married, Johnny.
Don't leave me.

42
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,528
Hello, John.

43
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,626
My name's Weizak.

44
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,303
I'm Dr. Sam Weizak.

45
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,896
I'm the director of this clinic.

46
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,443
You've been our guest here for a while.

47
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:09,842
You've been our guest here for a while.

48
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,072
Guest?

49
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,376
It's a funny way of putting it.

50
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,187
How do you feel?

51
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:25,183
My throat hurts.

52
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,658
Try a bit of water.

53
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,857
Come.

54
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:40,903
Hey, slow down.
Not so fast. Slow down.

55
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:53,782
You've been involved
in a terrible traffic accident.

56
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,245
Do you remember?

57
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,517
Am I okay?

58
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,086
Well,

59
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,087
you've been smashed up pretty badly.

60
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:13,368
What is it?

61
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,577
No bandages.

62
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:33,684
How come?

63
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:39,487
Your parents are here.
They're right next door.

64
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:43,625
I'm going to bring them in now.
Is that okay?

65
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,093
Sure.

66
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,706
Do come in.

67
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:01,383
- Hi, Mom, Dad.
- John.

68
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:05,684
Johnny.

69
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,223
Johnny, Johnny.

70
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,558
It's a miracle, John.

71
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,797
I know. I was lucky.

72
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:23,102
Look here, not a scratch.

73
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,274
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.

74
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:33,347
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs. Smith, please.

75
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,712
What's she talking about?

76
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,448
You've been in a coma, Johnny.
Not a trance.

77
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,217
Coma?

78
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,860
For how long?

79
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,693
We're just glad to have you back, son.
That's all that matters.

80
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,993
How long?

81
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,397
Dad, how long?

82
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,774
Five years.

83
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,270
Five long years, John.

84
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,512
Lost for five years.

85
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,442
And now reborn unto me.

86
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,448
Five..

87
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,183
years?

88
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,785
What about Sarah?

89
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,999
Cast her from your thoughts, John.

90
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,330
She's turned her back on you.

91
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,798
She cleaves now unto another man,
a husband.

92
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,276
Husband?

93
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:01,344
Amy.

94
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:09,887
Amy.

95
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,364
- Amy.
- Amy is my daughter's name.

96
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,458
Your daughter's screaming.

97
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,666
The house is burning. Your daughter's
in the house. It's not too late.

98
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:25,367
Amy.

99
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,171
Amy!

100
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:43,289
Your daughter's screaming.

101
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:48,961
Amy's screaming. It's not too late.
Your daughter's screaming. Hurry up!

102
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,455
The first order of business
is getting your body back into shape.

103
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,988
Although you've been
exercised regularly,

104
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:21,052
the ligaments have shortened a little
during the coma.

105
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:23,393
Am I gonna have to live in a wheelchair?

106
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,057
Not permanently.

107
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,302
And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.

108
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:33,070
I won't deceive you, John.

109
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:37,407
Your therapy will be long and painful.

110
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,240
But you will walk.

111
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,315
Thank you.

112
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:06,833
The wolf is loose.

113
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:09,908
John. John, are you all right?

114
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,440
No match for them.

115
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,592
Horses, fire.

116
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:07,520
The boy is safe.

117
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,373
The boy is safe.

118
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,172
John! John!

119
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:26,781
John, are you all right?

120
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:32,352
Tell me. What about the boy?

121
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:36,015
You keep saying,
"The boy is safe, the boy is safe."

122
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:39,457
- What boy?
- You. You're the boy.

123
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,729
I am the boy?

124
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,695
She saved you. She's alive, Sam.

125
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,027
- Who?
- Your mother.

126
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:54,204
- No, that is not possible, John.
- She survived.

127
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,269
John, my mother is dead.

128
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:01,446
She's alive. I know her name,
I know where she lives.

129
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,248
But that is not possible, John.

130
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:08,719
How could you know that? How..

131
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:11,781
I'm scared, Sam.

132
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,193
What's happening to me?

133
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,012
- Hello?
- Hello.

134
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,348
- May I speak to..
- Yes?

135
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:43,450
- Is Johanna there, please?
- One moment.

136
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:53,361
Hello? Hello, who is this, please?

137
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:55,523
Hello?

138
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:07,537
Well, you are either in possession of

139
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:10,773
a very new human ability,

140
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,176
or a very old one.

141
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,111
Yes?

142
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:21,155
Over here will be fine. Thank you.

143
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,653
I'm trying to get you back on your feet
in a day or two.

144
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:29,753
Thanks.

145
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:33,130
This should help you get
some of your strength back.

146
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,374
What's on your mind, Sam?

147
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:48,513
You were right, John, about my mother.

148
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,685
I got the number from Information.

149
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:57,254
There it was, right in the phone book.

150
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,384
Did you talk to her?

151
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:04,764
No, I didn't. I..

152
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:10,632
She came to the phone,
but I just couldn't talk to her. I..

153
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,269
I hung up.

154
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:17,039
- Why?
- Why?

155
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,309
Because it wasn't meant to be.

156
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,344
It wasn't meant to be.

157
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,614
Chug, chug, chug. Come on, easy now.

158
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,915
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Come on.

159
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,819
Weight down, knees up.

160
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,823
Keep it moving, keep it moving.
Chug, chug.

161
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:38,294
- That's it.
- That's it?

162
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:44,094
After all I've done, that's what I get?
Eight lousy steps?

163
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,635
I counted 10.

164
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:49,941
I'd really like to see you do
some serious chugging.

165
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,373
I'm gonna take a run
around the building.

166
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,808
- You'll stay out here?
- Okay.

167
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,436
- Keep chugging?
- Okay.

168
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,708
I'll see you when I get back.

169
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,279
Johnny.

170
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:09,419
They told me you were outside.

171
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:11,386
I am.

172
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:14,731
I didn't know if I should come or not.

173
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,990
It's all right.

174
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:28,435
You got your hair cut.

175
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:31,947
Yeah, a long time ago.

176
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:34,744
You lost weight.

177
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:39,451
They call it coma diet,
"Lose weight while you sleep."

178
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,356
I guess you know I got married.

179
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,361
I heard that.

180
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,431
I think you'd like him.

181
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:54,425
You still teach?

182
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,163
Mothering's a full time job.

183
00:23:57,806 --> 00:24:00,035
Kids, too? I didn't know that.

184
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,677
I'm sorry. I thought your father
would have told you.

185
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,175
He's a wonderful little boy.

186
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:12,544
His name is Denny.

187
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,318
- How old is he?
- Ten months.

188
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:26,189
Glad for you, I am.

189
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,241
Please don't look at me like that.

190
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,107
What am I gonna do?

191
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,877
For you,
five years have come and gone.

192
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,453
For me, it's just about the next day.

193
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,886
My feelings haven't changed yet.

194
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,323
Oh, Johnny.

195
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,030
Why did it have to happen like this?

196
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,325
Bad luck.

197
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,869
I never should have let you go that night.

198
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,099
It was my idea, remember?

199
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,409
What a jerk.

200
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,646
Everybody's talking about you.
You're the talk of the town.

201
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:31,451
"Cause I got my head bashed in
and I'm still here to talk about it?"

202
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:35,197
Because you have the power
of second sight.

203
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,593
Is it true, Johnny?

204
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:41,033
The papers won't let up about it.

205
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:45,267
I keep thinking about a line from a book.
It's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,

206
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:49,470
the last thing I gave my class to read
before the accident.

207
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:53,782
Ichabod Crane disappears.

208
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,011
The line goes,

209
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:59,348
"As he was a bachelor
and in nobody's debt,"

210
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:02,220
"nobody troubled their head
about him anymore."

211
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:06,627
- Is that what you're afraid of?
- That's what I want.

212
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,357
That's what I want.

213
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,787
I don't approve.

214
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:49,535
The press has been hounding me
since I woke up.

215
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:51,827
I want to get it over with.

216
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:55,239
Once you've set something like this
in motion,

217
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,434
it seems to me you'll never know
where it'll lead.

218
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,506
It's already in motion.
I just wanna stop it.

219
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:08,680
They went over there and put it out
and that's all there is.

220
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,549
Clement Dardis, WJGE-TV.

221
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:15,057
What happened to the little girl?

222
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,059
I understand she's fine.

223
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:20,720
Well, would you call this

224
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:22,929
a psychic experience?

225
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,929
No, I would not.

226
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:27,129
Ever had one of these
experiences before?

227
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:28,996
No.

228
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,706
How about a demonstration, John?

229
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:35,443
- A what?
- You know, a demonstration.

230
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,744
You got any predictions?

231
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:42,306
You think Greg Stillson
is gonna unseat Senator Proctor?

232
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,784
- Who?
- Greg Stillson.

233
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,356
Thank you, sir. No more.

234
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,429
- Mr. Smith..
- Hey, wait a minute, please.

235
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,430
How about it, John?
How about the election?

236
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,226
I don't even know
who you're talking about.

237
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,868
Well, you didn't know
anything about this nurse.

238
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,167
That was different.

239
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,410
Well, I..

240
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,741
I touched her hand.

241
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:18,044
All right. All right.

242
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:23,852
Now, touch my hand.
Okay, John, touch my hand.

243
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,893
Tell me, is my house on fire, John?

244
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:30,593
- Do you want me to stop this?
- No, it's okay.

245
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,833
Tell you about your house?
What do you want to know?

246
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:37,927
You want to know the future? You want to
know if you're going to die? Is that it?

247
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,505
You're gonna die. I'm gonna die.

248
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:43,269
You wanna know if you're gonna
die tomorrow. Is that right?

249
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:48,043
You want to know
why your sister killed herself.

250
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:51,048
All right. Well, go on. Go on.

251
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,981
- It's not all right.
- It's okay.

252
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,575
It's not okay.

253
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,550
- Okay.
- I could tell you now.

254
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:00,887
I'm not gonna talk about that.
Let go of me, you fucking freak!

255
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:02,460
Stop it! Please stop it.

256
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,085
Just leave him, the poor boy.

257
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,460
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

258
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,065
You're hurting him!

259
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,077
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.

260
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,808
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.

261
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,349
Yes, nurse.

262
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,654
She knows you're coming.

263
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:37,419
- Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy.
- That's all right.

264
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,769
Herb?

265
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:56,770
It's Johnny, Mom.

266
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,112
Johnny.

267
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:08,222
Leave your boots outside the door, dear.

268
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,952
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.

269
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,422
I won't.

270
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,959
You're a good boy.

271
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:08,779
You're wasting your time here, Sheriff.
You know that, don't you?

272
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,542
Well, you never know, Frank.

273
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,278
Worth a try.

274
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:28,063
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm Herb Smith.

275
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:31,032
George Bannerman, how do you do?
Castle Rock.

276
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:34,263
- May I come in?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Come in.

277
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,038
Starting to get a little nippy out there.

278
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,547
- That's a nice tree you got there.
- Thanks.

279
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:47,208
May I do something for you, Sheriff?

280
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:52,649
Well, actually, if this is your son,
I came to see him. You're John?

281
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,117
Sheriff Bannerman.

282
00:31:58,395 --> 00:31:59,760
Castle Rock.

283
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,126
Well, I guess I've come to you with
what you could call a proposal, John.

284
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,134
It has to do with these murders
we've been having,

285
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:10,535
the Castle Rock killer,
I'm sure you've heard of him.

286
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,064
Sure.

287
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:18,912
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John,

288
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:23,276
about these psychic powers of yours.

289
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,594
But if it is true, John,
I could use your help.

290
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:38,832
John, maybe you should give him a..

291
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,098
Take a minute to think about it.

292
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,399
But bear in mind, some decent
young women from homes just like this,

293
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,569
have met with terrible, terrible deaths.

294
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:54,673
"Now, I'm at my wits" end.

295
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:59,377
I've exhausted about every conventional
method of approach to this situation.

296
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:00,979
I've come up with nothing.

297
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:05,148
I feel you can help me, John.

298
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,357
You made a mistake.

299
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,133
I was sorry to hear about
your mother's death, John. Mr. Smith.

300
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,971
I understand she was a good woman,
a Christian woman.

301
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:30,909
I'm not a religious man myself,
I'm sorry to say.

302
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,879
But I will say this,

303
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:39,523
if God has seen fit to bless you
with this gift, you should use it.

304
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:43,887
Bless me?

305
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,130
You know what God did for me?

306
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:51,098
He threw an 18-wheel truck at me!

307
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:54,193
Bounced me into nowhere for five years!

308
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:58,735
When I woke up, my girl was gone,
my job was gone,

309
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,742
my legs are just about useless.
Bless me?

310
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:05,207
God's been a real sport to me.

311
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,349
All right, John.

312
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:22,962
If you change your mind,
you know where I am.

313
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,434
Merry Christmas to you.

314
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,010
Well?

315
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,048
Well, what?

316
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,392
See? What did I tell you?

317
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:11,941
Them murders he was talking about,
God-awful things.

318
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:15,173
Went on all during the time
you were in that coma.

319
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,345
I just don't have the knack for tinsel.

320
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,778
It was your mother who always kept
the tree looking good.

321
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:33,288
I wish to God she were here now
so she could talk to you about this thing.

322
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,397
I'm not much help to you, am I?

323
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,800
Sure you are.

324
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,069
You are.

325
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,900
You..

326
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,873
- You want to talk about it?
- Not that much to say.

327
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,811
It don't bring you much happiness,
does it, Son?

328
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,281
When it happens,

329
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:02,313
when the spells come, it feels like..

330
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:04,951
I don't know.

331
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:09,191
It feels like I'm dying inside.

332
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:23,645
No snow. It should snow for Christmas.

333
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:12,113
Hi.

334
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:16,921
- I brought you a visitor.
- I didn't know you were coming.

335
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,695
I wasn't sure myself.

336
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:26,867
I'm glad. If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have cleaned up.

337
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,202
You look wonderful.

338
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,571
You lost the crutches, I see.

339
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,238
Yeah. I still got the limp.

340
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:43,717
- Is your father home?
- No, he won't be back till later.

341
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:49,387
- Is that who I think it is?
- His Majesty.

342
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:52,387
- Danny?
- Denny.

343
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:56,130
- Say hi.
- Denny.

344
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,534
It's cold. Come on in.

345
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:27,256
He's asleep.

346
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:38,202
Last time we were alone together,

347
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:42,241
you said some things
were worth waiting for.

348
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:48,310
Well, haven't we waited long enough?

349
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,973
Dad's been carrying on
with Charlene Mackenzie.

350
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:27,076
Ever since her husband died,
she's got him over there

351
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:28,620
building one thing or another.

352
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:31,554
But if you ask me, it's the company
she wants, more than the bookcases.

353
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:33,090
I heard that.

354
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,732
That's a boy.

355
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:47,797
There you are, young fella.

356
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:51,070
I made that for John
the night he was born.

357
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:52,938
Well, it's an excellent chair.

358
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:55,706
So, what have you two
been up to all day?

359
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,441
Making bookcases.

360
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:05,254
Sit down. Dinner's ready.

361
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:21,437
- Boy, that smells good. I'm starved.
- I hope you'll like it.

362
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:24,469
I'll bet he will.
He's fed up with my cuisine.

363
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:29,541
For what we are about to receive,

364
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:32,443
may the Lord make us truly grateful.
Amen.

365
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:47,162
You know, it feels good to have a family
eating around this table again.

366
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,803
Am I gonna see you again?

367
00:41:07,282 --> 00:41:08,748
Not like today.

368
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:13,382
Go inside, you're freezing.

369
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,848
- It doesn't have to..
- Don't say it. Don't say it, Johnny.

370
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,732
I'll just say good night.

371
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,533
Well, guess I'll hit the hay.

372
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,406
I'm gonna watch some TV.

373
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,105
Good night, Son.

374
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:18,204
Despite renewed efforts on the part
of the police forces in three counties,

375
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:22,376
the killer is at large, and is likely
to remain so for some time.

376
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,784
We spoke to Sheriff George Bannerman
outside the Castle County Courthouse,

377
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:27,254
earlier today.

378
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:30,924
Well, we have no new leads
at this time.

379
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:34,690
However, there's always the hope
that some citizen,

380
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:38,130
perhaps in the audience right now,
might have some information

381
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:40,259
that would be very helpful.

382
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:45,071
My line is always open and I would
welcome any help we can possibly get.

383
00:42:45,807 --> 00:42:48,537
And that's really all I have to say
at this time. Thank you.

384
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:51,272
Thus far, nine separate murders
have been attributed

385
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,339
to the Castle Rock killer, dating back
almost three and a half years.

386
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,113
The most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape-murders

387
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:01,314
was 15-year-old Debbie Linderman,

388
00:43:01,423 --> 00:43:03,914
a sophomore
at Castle Rock High School.

389
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:07,426
Her partially clad body
was found just one month ago today,

390
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:09,291
in the Rock Lane boatyard.

391
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:11,729
As in the other Castle Rock killings,
cause of death

392
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:15,893
was determined by the coroner's office
to be multiple stab wounds.

393
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,430
Next on News Eight,
sports and weather with Ron,

394
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,736
after this important message.

395
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:27,974
I'm gonna help him.

396
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,014
What did you say, Son?

397
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:34,143
The sheriff that came here,

398
00:43:35,288 --> 00:43:36,585
Bannerman.

399
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:42,588
I'm gonna help him.

400
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,459
We think the killer

401
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:50,629
hid around the corner
just out the end of the tunnel there.

402
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,996
When that poor girl came through,
the bastard was waiting for her.

403
00:43:55,107 --> 00:43:58,338
We tell the kids not to
come through here, but damn it,

404
00:43:58,444 --> 00:44:01,902
you know, they like to use this
as a shortcut to school.

405
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,946
He stood right here.

406
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:12,887
Found a lot of cigarette butts,
same brand.

407
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:17,250
Eight or nine butts here.
This help you any?

408
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:18,693
I don't know.

409
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:23,494
Have you got something
he might have touched or worn?

410
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:26,593
Frank, give me that package.

411
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:33,775
It's the only real evidence we have.

412
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:36,345
Found it in one of the bushes
back there.

413
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:37,244
Found it in one of the bushes
back there.

414
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:40,316
Same brand as the butts
we found on the ground.

415
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:44,010
Here.

416
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:35,761
Nothing.

417
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,571
I thought I might have felt something,
but I..

418
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:45,337
That's okay, that's okay.
Can't say we didn't try, huh?

419
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,572
Dispatch to Sheriff Bannerman.

420
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,750
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

421
00:45:52,985 --> 00:45:55,180
We got another body here, Sheriff.

422
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,050
Damn it.

423
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,078
What's the word, George?

424
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,921
Is it the work of the
Castle Rock killer?

425
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,691
- Sheriff, Sheriff.
- Hey, isn't that John Smith?

426
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,225
- What?
- The psychic. That's Smith, isn't it?

427
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:13,532
Can you stand back, please?
Just give us a chance. Give us a break.

428
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:16,971
- Stay away, stand back.
- We're trying to do a story here.

429
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:20,475
I know you're anxious,
you're just gonna have to wait.

430
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:21,772
Looks pretty grim to me.

431
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,076
- It looks like one more job for the..
- Dave, get that shot over there, okay?

432
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,581
- Is it a woman?
- Yeah.

433
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:27,742
Back up.

434
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,216
Anyone know who she is? Dodd?

435
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:51,039
Yeah, I know this girl.
Her name's Alma Frechette.

436
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,542
She works at the Coffee Pot cafe
across the way there.

437
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,506
Your idea, George, to have a psychic
to help solve the case?

438
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,343
Dodd, get these people out of here.

439
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:04,044
Move them back!
Come on now, move the people back

440
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:07,418
and knock it off with those
cameras now. No more cameras.

441
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:08,615
No more.

442
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,316
- Dodd?
- Yeah?

443
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:15,060
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, Sheriff.

444
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:26,630
You want to try?

445
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:11,850
Hey, Alma! Hi.

446
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:14,382
Hi. What are you doing up there?

447
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:16,918
Well, I'm waiting for you.
How about a little smile?

448
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,554
She knows him.

449
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:21,850
What?

450
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,432
She knows him.

451
00:48:40,577 --> 00:48:42,909
Why should I waste a smile on you?

452
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,971
You wanna see something?
It's the goddamnedest thing.

453
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:48,517
- What?
- Come up here to the gazebo.

454
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:57,991
She knows him.

455
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:04,595
Not scared. She knows him.

456
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,033
All right.

457
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:23,582
Well, what did you want to show me?

458
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,219
"Gazebo." You like that word, Alma?
Come here.

459
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,854
Look at this.

460
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:38,365
Jesus. You.. Let go of me.

461
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:41,127
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No joke.

462
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,145
No. Wait!

463
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:02,845
Are you all right?

464
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:04,714
Dodd, give me a hand.

465
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:07,418
I saw him. I was there. I saw him.

466
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:11,155
- I stood there. I saw his face.
- Who?

467
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:15,427
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl. Dodd.

468
00:50:15,534 --> 00:50:18,264
- Wait a minute, what're you saying?
- I did nothing.

469
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,237
I stood there
and watched him kill that girl.

470
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,741
- Who're you talking about?
- Dodd!

471
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:29,572
I stood there. I did nothing.

472
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:33,242
Dodd.

473
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:37,280
Dodd, get up here.

474
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:41,047
He just took off in your car, Sheriff.

475
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:48,356
I saw his face. I saw his face.

476
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,083
I want you to stay there.

477
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:34,902
Sheriff. Sheriff.

478
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:38,238
I thought I told you to stay by the car.

479
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,378
Who's there?

480
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:44,278
It's Sheriff Bannerman,
I wanted to talk to your son, Mrs. Dodd.

481
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:46,785
He ain't here.

482
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:49,148
Well, his patrol car is out here.

483
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,824
Well, his car's here, but he ain't.

484
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:54,725
He's here. I saw him in the window.

485
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:05,402
- I'm telling you, he ain't home!
- I'm coming in, Mrs. Dodd.

486
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:06,494
No!

487
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,715
You leave my boy alone!

488
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:27,619
You knew.

489
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:30,224
Didn't you?

490
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:32,824
You knew.

491
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:34,890
You..

492
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:37,364
You're a..

493
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:40,336
You're a devil

494
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:43,197
sent from hell.

495
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:46,100
Yes.

496
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,104
Yes.

497
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:35,405
Frank?

498
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:31,966
No! No!

499
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,632
Hello, John.

500
00:56:49,641 --> 00:56:51,040
May I come in?

501
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,956
How did you find me? My father?

502
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:17,198
Stopped off to see him, and he told me
you moved to a new town.

503
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,670
He's worried about you. And so am I.

504
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,805
There's nothing to worry about.
I'm taking care of myself.

505
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,466
It's about time.

506
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,606
I'm still your doctor, John.
You're still under my care.

507
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:35,414
We have to..
Well, we have to stay in touch.

508
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,145
Well.

509
00:57:38,253 --> 00:57:41,780
How's the.. All healed up now?

510
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:47,625
Bullet went right through me.

511
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:50,664
- It's nothing.
- Good.

512
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,003
Nice place you have here.

513
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:01,971
It's home.

514
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,313
Those headaches are getting worse,
aren't they?

515
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:14,352
Three, four times a day sometimes.

516
00:58:16,956 --> 00:58:21,450
- I brought you some new medication.
- No! No more pills.

517
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:24,428
It takes time to recover.
The healing process is slow,

518
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:25,896
I've told you many times.

519
00:58:26,866 --> 00:58:29,664
I'm not getting better. I'm getting worse.

520
00:58:32,071 --> 00:58:33,663
Isn't that right?

521
00:58:41,413 --> 00:58:42,641
All right.

522
00:58:46,518 --> 00:58:47,815
Now listen.

523
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:50,585
In the last few months,
I've done some research

524
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:53,157
into the area of psychic phenomena.

525
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:57,818
Several cases such as yours,
have been documented.

526
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:02,866
I was surprised to discover.
And the pattern is always the same.

527
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:08,731
As the spells, the visions
grow stronger and more powerful,

528
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:11,303
so the body weakens.

529
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:16,577
But I don't really need any research
or documentation

530
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,480
to see that this thing
is sucking the life right out of you.

531
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:23,516
One look at you can tell me that.

532
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,187
You mean I'm gonna die?

533
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:29,552
How long?

534
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:33,689
I think we can arrest the process,

535
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:35,388
reverse it even.

536
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:37,693
- How do you do that?
- Come back with me.

537
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,200
- Where?
- To the clinic, of course.

538
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,061
No. Absolutely no.

539
00:59:43,172 --> 00:59:47,108
- John, please. You must!
- Why? So you can study me?

540
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:50,004
No. So I can protect you.

541
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,174
You need to be
in a controlled environment, John.

542
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:58,919
I wanna show you something.

543
01:00:00,355 --> 01:00:01,754
Come with me.

544
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:07,021
The cards and letters
just keep pouring in.

545
01:00:09,264 --> 01:00:10,561
What is all this?

546
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:14,725
It's people with lost dogs, lost children,
lost lives.

547
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:18,962
- You haven't even opened them.
- I don't have to.

548
01:00:19,306 --> 01:00:23,037
They all want the same thing.
Reassurance, help, love.

549
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,444
Things I can't give them.

550
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:28,811
My father sends this stuff on to me.
I let it pile up.

551
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:31,944
Why? Why do you keep it?

552
01:00:32,051 --> 01:00:35,714
This is why I can't go out, live my life.

553
01:00:36,923 --> 01:00:40,017
Why I have to stay locked up
here in the house.

554
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:43,391
I'm already living
in a controlled environment, Sam.

555
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:47,656
Nothing can touch me here.

556
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:51,999
I'm alone.

557
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:54,633
I'm safe.

558
01:00:57,309 --> 01:01:00,574
"But instead of dying,"

559
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:05,116
"she shall only fall into"

560
01:01:05,684 --> 01:01:07,777
"a profound sleep"

561
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,979
"which shall last 100 years."

562
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,292
That's my mom.

563
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:20,755
Okay.

564
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:24,957
- Bye.
- Bye.

565
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:26,400
John Smith?

566
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:33,371
Hi. Hi, I'm Roger Stuart.

567
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:36,434
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

568
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:46,449
Sit down.

569
01:01:53,629 --> 01:01:54,891
What can I do for you?

570
01:01:55,697 --> 01:01:56,857
It's..

571
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:03,602
It's my boy, my son, Chris.
He needs help.

572
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:09,003
I've inquired around.
You come highly recommended.

573
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:13,003
What's the matter with him?

574
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,547
I wish I knew.

575
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:20,315
He's bright, I know he is,
but he won't take part in school.

576
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:23,150
He won't join in. He won't learn and..

577
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:26,222
God! He's so shy.

578
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,790
You think you could help him?

579
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,593
I wouldn't know that unless I met him.

580
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:39,396
Well, he's not in the car.
He wouldn't come with me today.

581
01:02:40,073 --> 01:02:42,598
You'd have to come out to the house.

582
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:45,040
No. That's out of the question.

583
01:02:45,278 --> 01:02:48,405
That's just not the way I do it.

584
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,815
It won't work otherwise.

585
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:53,344
Please.

586
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:57,115
If you come out to the house,
he'll get to know you,

587
01:02:57,222 --> 01:03:00,248
then you can bring him back here
for the lessons.

588
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:02,019
Please.

589
01:03:04,129 --> 01:03:05,118
Okay.

590
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:10,526
Great. Tomorrow morning, Saturday.
I'll send a car over to pick you up, huh?

591
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:14,735
Thank you.

592
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,624
That reminds me of my first campaign

593
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,888
when I ran for a seat
in the state Senate.

594
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:17,760
Upstate for my hometown,
my opponent went down to the ghetto.

595
01:04:17,866 --> 01:04:20,061
Roger, believe it or not, he was
actually handing out dollar bills

596
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:22,728
to them black people down there,
trying to buy votes, I heard about it.

597
01:04:22,837 --> 01:04:25,361
I went down and I said, "All right,
you folks take that money",

598
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:27,599
"put in your pocket, keep it,
then go back, get some more if you can,"

599
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:28,766
"because times is rough."

600
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:30,639
"But when you get into
that voting booth."

601
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:33,042
"I want you to vote for whomever
well you damn well please."

602
01:04:33,147 --> 01:04:35,342
Well sir, we won that election
by damn near what, Sonny?

603
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:36,473
Twenty-nine.

604
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,676
Twenty-nine percentage points,
we've been winning ever since.

605
01:04:38,786 --> 01:04:41,914
And those people spent that money
with a clear conscience.

606
01:04:44,657 --> 01:04:47,524
Hi, John, good morning.
Nice to see you.

607
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:50,357
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
my son's tutor, John Smith.

608
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:52,363
- John, this is Greg Stillson.
- How are you, John?

609
01:04:52,465 --> 01:04:56,663
- Gentleman, this is..
- Sonny Elliman.

610
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:57,963
Sonny Elliman, right here.

611
01:04:58,137 --> 01:05:02,540
Well, Greg, you got some good ideas.
You got to let me think about them.

612
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:06,637
Now, listen. Roger, we got
a good thing going and it's going strong

613
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:07,905
and I want you to be a part of it.

614
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:10,140
I need your support,
I need your expertise,

615
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:11,840
I need your input.

616
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,011
And most importantly,
I need your money.

617
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:19,184
- God bless, Roger. I'll be seeing.
- Thanks for dropping by, Greg.

618
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,521
- I'll see you. Bye-bye.
- Good to see you, Sonny.

619
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,786
My God! What a glorious day!

620
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:26,687
Amen.

621
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:33,861
Sorry about that.

622
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,399
- Well, let's go see Chris, huh, John?
- Sure.

623
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:43,244
Chris? This is Johnny.

624
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:46,673
Remember, I told you
he was coming this morning?

625
01:05:48,885 --> 01:05:51,683
I'll leave you two alone
to get acquainted.

626
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:21,873
Your father says
there's something wrong with you.

627
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:24,747
He wants me to bring you
out of your shell.

628
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:27,486
I don't know what to do.

629
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:31,218
You don't have to do anything.

630
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:34,951
It's my dad that lives in a shell, not me.

631
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,338
Chris has really taken to you, John.
I'm impressed.

632
01:07:21,439 --> 01:07:24,875
- Made lot of progress for one day.
- We just had a talk.

633
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:27,803
Well, with Chris
that's a real achievement.

634
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:29,771
You want a drink?

635
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:32,081
- No.
- Don't want a beer?

636
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,180
- Okay.
- Brian, get him a beer.

637
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,254
Here. Just listen to this.

638
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:49,797
Ninety-nine.

639
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,591
One hundred!

640
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,900
How you doing?

641
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:58,470
I'm Greg Stillson.
Just thought I'd stop by here

642
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,201
on my way to the U.S. Senate.

643
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,971
Greg Stillson. Remember,
you met him in the hall this morning?

644
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,546
- Yeah.
- ..coming out all of you.

645
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,581
Boy, you gotta be in good shape

646
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,310
to go the full distance with
those big boys down in Washington.

647
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,386
- Right.
- You got to stay in shape all the time

648
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,978
with those boys,
can't turn you back on them.

649
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,853
You got to stay in better shape
in this country.

650
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,618
What the hell is happening
to this country?

651
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,354
Can anybody tell me
what the hell is going on?

652
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,486
Look here.

653
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:23,894
I'm reading one of your local papers,
right here on the front page..

654
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,864
Do you believe this guy?

655
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,058
He's just getting warmed up.

656
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:30,594
Will you vote for him, John?

657
01:08:30,705 --> 01:08:32,468
Shame on America!

658
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:35,306
I'm not even registered.

659
01:08:35,643 --> 01:08:37,439
- Not registered?
- No.

660
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:40,941
Well, get registered, pal,
and vote against this turkey.

661
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:42,671
He's dangerous.

662
01:08:43,384 --> 01:08:45,648
And I see all around me,
so many unemployed.

663
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:47,618
What are you people here
in the middle of the day?

664
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,485
Middle of a work day!
You're standing out in the cold.

665
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:52,824
Look around. Look at each other!

666
01:08:52,926 --> 01:08:55,759
How do you feel about each other?
Are you proud of your communities?

667
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:58,797
Would you send the guy next to you
to the U.S. Senate?

668
01:08:58,898 --> 01:09:00,889
A real man of the people.

669
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:02,927
You don't feel good about yourselves.

670
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:04,731
Jesus, what an act.

671
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:07,298
Can't they see through this guy?

672
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:10,638
I'm mixed up. You both acted like
you were friends this morning.

673
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:14,941
Well, guys like Stillson,
you got to walk a thin line.

674
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:18,779
You can't get too close 'cause if they
lose, they'll drag you down with them.

675
01:09:18,884 --> 01:09:23,617
On the other hand, if he wins,
and this turkey just might,

676
01:09:24,556 --> 01:09:26,649
you got to make sure you're thought of
as a good friend.

677
01:09:26,758 --> 01:09:28,316
Know what I mean, John?

678
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:30,861
They're not working.
There's unemployment everywhere.

679
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:34,090
Well, I've come down here today
with a job for every one of you.

680
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:37,133
I've come here today with a challenge
for all of you!

681
01:09:37,234 --> 01:09:40,499
I'm challenging you right here now
to join me,

682
01:09:40,604 --> 01:09:42,435
to join a growing army

683
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:45,398
of volunteer workers on my campaign.

684
01:09:45,676 --> 01:09:49,407
Let's send Greg Stillson
to the United States Senate

685
01:09:49,547 --> 01:09:51,412
and mediocrity to hell!

686
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:20,632
What can I do for you boys?

687
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:25,207
You work late, Mr. Brenner.
That's very admirable.

688
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,842
I'm Greg Stillson.

689
01:10:29,084 --> 01:10:31,484
I know who you are, Mr. Stillson.

690
01:10:32,821 --> 01:10:36,153
Now, take your paid gorilla
and get out of my office.

691
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:40,154
My friend, Sonny, doesn't want to see
anybody get hurt,

692
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:42,491
but we got a little problem here.

693
01:10:42,597 --> 01:10:44,588
Get to the point, Mr. Stillson.

694
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,031
Well, as you know,
I'm damned near even in the polls.

695
01:10:47,135 --> 01:10:49,035
See, I'm catching on.
The people got a need for me.

696
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:52,698
I'm gonna win, and I'm gonna win big.
And I'll tell you something else.

697
01:10:52,806 --> 01:10:54,535
I've had a vision

698
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:57,974
that I am going to be President
of the United States someday

699
01:10:58,078 --> 01:11:02,640
and I have accepted that responsibility,
and nobody, I mean nobody

700
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:06,211
is gonna stop me.

701
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:11,622
Now, you can just imagine how I felt

702
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,783
when one of my loyal staff people

703
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:17,727
brought me your editorial
which is gonna hit the streets tomorrow.

704
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:21,094
You don't seem to like me, Brenner.
But that's okay.

705
01:11:21,534 --> 01:11:23,832
Because I don't like you, either.

706
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:26,631
How did you get that?

707
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:30,835
Well, like you, Brenner,
I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources.

708
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:35,776
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
Because you're right.

709
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,008
That editorial is gonna hit the streets
tomorrow morning.

710
01:11:39,117 --> 01:11:40,641
Not if we can make a deal.

711
01:11:41,519 --> 01:11:43,817
What the hell are you talking about?

712
01:11:43,922 --> 01:11:47,517
I'm talking about you staying
out of the campaign business,

713
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,025
and me staying out
of the publishing business.

714
01:11:51,128 --> 01:11:53,926
Show him what we've got to publish,
Sonny.

715
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:02,101
That's your best shot.

716
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,675
I got lots of loyal people on my side,
Brenner.

717
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:10,376
That young lady in the photographs
with you is one of them.

718
01:12:10,913 --> 01:12:13,507
Now, I've never met Mrs. Brenner,

719
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:17,313
but I'm damn near sure that ain't her.
What do you think, Sonny?

720
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:27,626
Is this Mrs. Brenner?

721
01:12:34,936 --> 01:12:38,372
- Doesn't look like her.
- You son of a bitch! You set me up.

722
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:41,909
- Who you calling a son of a bitch?
- No, it's all right, Sonny.

723
01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:44,843
Let's give Mr. Brenner a chance

724
01:12:44,946 --> 01:12:49,042
to think about his wife and kids
and his position in the community.

725
01:13:00,261 --> 01:13:02,786
What if I don't make a deal, Stillson?

726
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,761
Oh, you'll make a deal.

727
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:08,593
Otherwise I'll have my friend, Sonny,
take your goddamn head off.

728
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,268
Good idea.

729
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,877
You see, Sonny,
I told you he is a reasonable man.

730
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:22,209
He's a nice man. I like him.
I like your wife, too.

731
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:34,550
"Prophet!" said I, thing of evil..
prophet still, if bird or devil!

732
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:39,056
"By that Heaven that bends above us,
by that God we both adore."

733
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:44,294
"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if,
within the distant Aidenn."

734
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:48,599
"It shall clasp a sainted maiden
whom the angels name Lenore;"

735
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:51,194
Chris, skip to the part
where he talks about,

736
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,165
"Will I ever see her again?"

737
01:13:56,678 --> 01:14:00,444
"Eagerly I wished the morrow..
vainly I had sought to borrow."

738
01:14:00,782 --> 01:14:04,878
"From my books surcease of sorrow..
sorrow for the lost Lenore."

739
01:14:05,086 --> 01:14:08,851
"For the rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels name Lenore;."

740
01:14:09,623 --> 01:14:11,818
"Nameless here for evermore."

741
01:14:14,494 --> 01:14:16,462
Stop. I'll be right back.

742
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:27,661
Good afternoon, sir.

743
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:30,833
We're out in your neighborhood today
talking to people about Greg Stillson.

744
01:14:30,943 --> 01:14:32,672
You're familiar with our candidate,
aren't you?

745
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:33,870
What do you think?

746
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:38,911
Yeah, right.

747
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:42,215
But are you aware
of what Greg Stillson stands for?

748
01:14:44,257 --> 01:14:46,986
Greg Stillson is mounting the
most successful third party movement

749
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:48,684
this state has ever seen.

750
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,353
Stillson represents
both the poor and the well-off,

751
01:14:51,463 --> 01:14:52,555
the young and the old..

752
01:14:52,664 --> 01:14:55,155
Could you come back? I have a student.

753
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:58,099
Sure. I know you're busy. Can I
leave you some literature, though?

754
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,170
Sure.

755
01:14:59,271 --> 01:15:02,104
Honey, could you bring
some of those brochures?

756
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,690
Hello, Johnny.

757
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:26,651
Hi.

758
01:15:29,098 --> 01:15:31,157
Is this where you're living now?

759
01:15:31,267 --> 01:15:34,168
Yeah. I'm back to teaching.

760
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:36,871
This is my husband, Walt.

761
01:15:37,907 --> 01:15:39,306
Nice to meet you finally, John.

762
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:42,845
I've heard Sarah talk about you so often.

763
01:15:46,615 --> 01:15:50,381
Hey. Come on back, Johnny.
It's no fun reading by yourself.

764
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:53,444
Chris, this is Walt and Sarah.

765
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,814
Hi.

766
01:15:57,192 --> 01:15:58,523
We'll let you get back to work.

767
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:02,154
We've got a lot of ground to cover
ourselves. Don't we, honey?

768
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:05,724
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

769
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:08,768
Don't forget who to vote for
on election day.

770
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:16,633
Bye.

771
01:16:25,385 --> 01:16:26,784
Who was that?

772
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,820
You okay?

773
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,224
Why are you crying, Johnny?

774
01:16:46,005 --> 01:16:47,165
Johnny?

775
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,302
What's the matter?

776
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:29,338
Nothing.

777
01:17:30,514 --> 01:17:33,415
- My ride's here.
- I'm going with you.

778
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:45,925
- I gotta talk to you.
- Hi, Johnny.

779
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,098
- What is this? What are you doing?
- Pretty good stuff, huh?

780
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:53,691
I organized a hockey team for Chris
and some of his friends. Huh, Chris?

781
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:55,771
We have our first practice
this afternoon.

782
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,270
You are looking at the coach.

783
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,738
- Call it off.
- Take that stuff in the garage, okay?

784
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,468
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

785
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:02,736
Call it off?

786
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:06,746
What for? Chris has been
looking forward to this all week, huh?

787
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,307
- He's really coming out his shell, John.
- Wait.

788
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,281
I gotta talk to you.

789
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,490
We'll have a little nourishment
and then we'll hit the ice.

790
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,058
No, no. Listen to me. Call it off.

791
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:21,150
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

792
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:22,228
Don't be ridiculous.

793
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:23,956
We always skate on that pond
until March.

794
01:18:24,064 --> 01:18:25,793
What the hell is the matter with you?

795
01:18:25,899 --> 01:18:27,799
You want to kill your own son?

796
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:29,528
I'm scared, Dad.

797
01:18:29,736 --> 01:18:31,533
For Christ's sake, John.

798
01:18:31,638 --> 01:18:34,129
Don't be scared.
Just go eat your cookies.

799
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:36,209
Don't you know who I am?

800
01:18:37,744 --> 01:18:38,767
Of course I know who you are.

801
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:41,779
You think I'd have you come into
my son's life without checking you out?

802
01:18:41,881 --> 01:18:45,408
But I hired you for your abilities
as a teacher, not as a fortuneteller.

803
01:18:45,518 --> 01:18:47,952
Now, don't give me any argument..

804
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:52,917
The ice is gonna break!

805
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:56,291
I want you out of here.

806
01:18:56,395 --> 01:18:58,954
I don't want you
in my boy's life anymore.

807
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:00,725
And I don't want any argument from you.

808
01:19:00,832 --> 01:19:03,630
I want you do exactly
what I'm telling you now!

809
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:06,226
No, Dad. You don't know.

810
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:08,706
It's not safe.

811
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,843
All right. To hell with it!
To hell with the whole thing.

812
01:19:12,944 --> 01:19:15,606
Forget it all, forget the hockey team,
forget the practice,

813
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:17,704
but I want you out of here.

814
01:19:17,815 --> 01:19:20,477
Whatever you say. I'm sorry about that.

815
01:19:20,885 --> 01:19:23,547
I'll see that you get your final check.

816
01:19:24,155 --> 01:19:26,089
I'm not crazy, you know.

817
01:19:27,424 --> 01:19:30,655
Don't let the boy think I am.
I'm right about this.

818
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:34,758
But we'll never know, will we?

819
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:39,662
Give me your hand.

820
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:51,970
Nothing to worry about now.

821
01:19:52,081 --> 01:19:54,276
My driver will take you home.

822
01:19:56,952 --> 01:19:58,442
You were right.

823
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,891
I'll see you.

824
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:17,096
Chris?

825
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:21,470
Hey. What's going on?

826
01:20:22,043 --> 01:20:24,011
You're not even dressed.

827
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:29,409
You called it off.

828
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:31,676
I thought you called it off.

829
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,845
That was just to get rid of him.

830
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:36,422
So, we going or not?

831
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:41,557
Are you going to sit here
and pout like a baby in your room

832
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:45,131
or you coming outside
to play hockey with your friends?

833
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:51,730
Right.

834
01:22:00,336 --> 01:22:01,394
Hello.

835
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:03,535
Who is it?

836
01:22:05,508 --> 01:22:06,668
Johnny.

837
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:21,844
- Sarah, see you down there, honey.
- Okay.

838
01:24:42,723 --> 01:24:46,921
Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson!

839
01:25:21,293 --> 01:25:23,921
Good to see you. Thanks for everything.

840
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,661
Hi. How are you? Thanks for coming.
Good to see you.

841
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:30,893
Hi.

842
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,862
How you doing? Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.

843
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:37,373
Thanks very much for coming. Good.

844
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,610
- Do it, General.
- You're insane. I won't.

845
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,621
Do it!
Put your hand on the scanning screen

846
01:25:52,723 --> 01:25:54,816
and you'll go down in history with me.

847
01:25:54,925 --> 01:25:58,383
As what?
The world's greatest mass murderers?

848
01:25:58,495 --> 01:26:00,292
You cowardly bastard!

849
01:26:00,497 --> 01:26:02,931
You're not the voice of the people!
I am the voice of the people!

850
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,592
The people speak through me, not you!

851
01:26:05,735 --> 01:26:08,329
It came to me while I slept, Sonny.
My destiny.

852
01:26:08,437 --> 01:26:09,870
In the middle of the night,
it came to me.

853
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:13,738
I must get up now, right now,
and fulfill my destiny!

854
01:26:13,843 --> 01:26:16,573
Now you put your goddamn hand
on that scanning screen

855
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:19,944
or I'll hack it off and put it on for you!
Do it!

856
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:34,756
May God forgive me.

857
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:47,374
Congratulations, General.

858
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:52,137
Complete the sequence, Mr. President.

859
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:13,296
My destiny.

860
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,167
Thank you, Sonny.

861
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:33,441
Let them come up.

862
01:27:35,988 --> 01:27:38,957
This is not necessary, Mr. President.
We have a diplomatic solution.

863
01:27:39,057 --> 01:27:43,425
Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary,
the missiles are flying.

864
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:47,126
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

865
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:55,729
You okay, Greg?

866
01:27:56,907 --> 01:27:59,034
Greg! Get out!

867
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:02,508
Stillson! Stillson!

868
01:28:18,261 --> 01:28:22,321
If you could go back in time
to Germany, say,

869
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:26,328
before Hitler came to power,
knowing what you know now,

870
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:29,402
what'd you do? Would you kill him?

871
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,441
Is that why you sent for me, John?
To ask me this question?

872
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,750
I have to talk to you, Sam, because.

873
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,280
I've had another episode.

874
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,583
Yes?

875
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:51,884
Go on.

876
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:55,863
I've been tutoring this boy,
name of Stuart, and

877
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,292
in the vision, I saw him drown.
I saw him die, Sam.

878
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:01,367
But that's not the point.

879
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:04,203
In the vision,
there was something missing,

880
01:29:04,304 --> 01:29:06,568
there was something I couldn't see.

881
01:29:06,673 --> 01:29:08,197
How do you mean?

882
01:29:08,308 --> 01:29:10,276
I don't know. It was like

883
01:29:11,078 --> 01:29:13,774
a blank spot, a dead zone.

884
01:29:20,052 --> 01:29:21,883
First of all, tell me,

885
01:29:22,121 --> 01:29:25,454
did the boy, in fact, drown?
You say you saw him drown.

886
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:28,220
No, no. His father wanted to take him
to play hockey.

887
01:29:28,327 --> 01:29:30,591
I talked him out of it. The boy's alive.

888
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:35,190
Yes.

889
01:29:35,968 --> 01:29:39,562
Don't you see,
don't you see how clear it all is?

890
01:29:40,271 --> 01:29:42,569
Not only can you see the future,

891
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:45,434
- you can..
- I can change it.

892
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:47,568
You can change it. Exactly.

893
01:29:50,014 --> 01:29:51,072
Here.

894
01:29:53,651 --> 01:29:57,143
Yes, John. That is your dead zone.

895
01:29:57,955 --> 01:30:01,391
The possibility of altering the outcome

896
01:30:01,992 --> 01:30:04,688
of your premonitions.

897
01:30:05,395 --> 01:30:07,886
It's fascinating. Let me make a note.

898
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,068
What about my question, Sam?

899
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:17,468
You mean the one about Hitler?

900
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,365
What would you do?

901
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:24,444
I don't like the sound of this, John.
What are you getting at?

902
01:30:25,014 --> 01:30:28,006
What would you do?
Would you kill him?

903
01:30:31,554 --> 01:30:35,684
All right. All right,
I'll give you an answer.

904
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:40,124
I'm a man of medicine.

905
01:30:40,262 --> 01:30:43,459
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.

906
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:45,362
And I love people.

907
01:30:46,601 --> 01:30:51,300
Therefore, I would have no choice
but to kill the son of a bitch.

908
01:30:59,013 --> 01:31:01,072
You'd never get away alive.

909
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:03,839
It doesn't matter. I would kill him.

910
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:32,999
Dear Sarah,

911
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:38,563
this is a hard letter to write,
so I'll try to make it short.

912
01:32:40,142 --> 01:32:42,372
I can't go on hiding anymore.

913
01:32:43,212 --> 01:32:46,272
That's what I've been doing.
Running and hiding.

914
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,381
You know,
I had this figured out all wrong.

915
01:32:50,486 --> 01:32:53,511
I always thought this power of mine
was a curse,

916
01:32:54,155 --> 01:32:56,350
but now I can see it's a gift.

917
01:32:57,492 --> 01:33:00,188
Anyway, by the time you get this letter,

918
01:33:01,496 --> 01:33:03,123
it'll be all over.

919
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:05,496
You never will understand why, Sarah.

920
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,058
Guess nobody ever will,
but I know what I'm doing.

921
01:33:10,071 --> 01:33:11,833
And I know I'm right.

922
01:33:12,572 --> 01:33:14,039
Just remember.

923
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:18,510
There's never been anyone for me
except you.

924
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:23,144
Just wasn't in the cards for us, I guess.

925
01:33:24,785 --> 01:33:26,878
I'll always love you, Sarah.

926
01:33:27,788 --> 01:33:28,982
Johnny.

927
01:34:46,429 --> 01:34:48,294
It's a historic moment.

928
01:35:06,615 --> 01:35:08,172
We're over here.

929
01:35:31,404 --> 01:35:34,396
Thanks for your support.
Thank you for coming.

930
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,647
Hi, how you doing?

931
01:35:52,191 --> 01:35:55,718
Really appreciate it.
Thanks very much. What's your name?

932
01:35:56,328 --> 01:35:58,387
Greg, you remember
my husband, Walt?

933
01:35:58,497 --> 01:36:00,761
- Hi, Walt. This your baby?
- Yeah.

934
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:04,434
I'm supposed to do that.
Come on, bring him up on stage.

935
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:11,033
Stillson! Stillson!

936
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:17,602
I want to thank all of you
from the bottom of my heart

937
01:37:17,705 --> 01:37:20,503
for the tremendous support
you've given this campaign.

938
01:37:20,608 --> 01:37:22,269
You made this campaign

939
01:37:22,377 --> 01:37:24,708
the most talked about,
the most exciting,

940
01:37:24,811 --> 01:37:28,645
the most important campaign
in the history of this great state.

941
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:32,080
And I've come here personally
to thank you for that.

942
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:43,555
Johnny!

943
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:51,193
- Give me him!
- Don't!

944
01:37:52,438 --> 01:37:53,427
No!

945
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:56,167
Sonny! They're trying to kill me!

946
01:37:57,677 --> 01:37:59,804
Let go! Let go!

947
01:38:37,982 --> 01:38:40,951
Who are you, you son of a bitch?
Who sent you?

948
01:39:07,909 --> 01:39:09,206
It's over.

949
01:39:13,715 --> 01:39:15,273
You're finished.

950
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:21,387
Where's that kid with the camera?
He was taking pictures!

951
01:39:22,223 --> 01:39:24,521
