No, it's a letter...

the house from, the Musselmans.

Well, then I'd swing around and go back
the way you came.

But this time, turn right
where the old Hollenshed barn used to be.

183
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:52,162
Then about five miles
before the road dead-ends, veer left...

...and follow the railroad tracks
straight into a town called Beaver Mills.

the road and save yourself a heap of time.

Claude used to alley-cat around town
with a widow named Dorita Freeburger.

When he died, he left the house to Eula...

00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:19,458
...and $10,000 to Dorita.

to stuff Claude in this...

This is so romantic.

634
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,037
Why don't you make a fire?

635
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:23,164
First...

636
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,753
...open this.

637
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,133
Go ahead, open it.

638
00:53:56,449 --> 00:54:00,202
<i>It's my novel, Elizabeth. The Big Heist.</i>

639
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,373
The first few chapters, anyway.

640
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,042
Oh, Andy.

641
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:09,546
That manuscript is the whole reason
we moved to the country.

642
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,882
It's good? You really think it's good?

643
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:15,010
Well, read it and tell me.

Now? Tonight?

Yes, of course.

What, with you watching me'?

Well, I'll make a fire and you read.

You didn't find that funny?

00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:26,793
- What, you mean the first page?
-Yeah.

653
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,921
There are at least three big laughs
on that page alone.

Read the next page. It gets funnier.

658
00:55:41,015 --> 00:55:42,850
Is this a comedy?

659
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,896
I thought it was, you know,
action-adventure.

It is. It's all three.

<i>- I'll tell you what.
- Where are you going?</i>

666
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:21,850
Well, I saw a liquor store on the corner.
I'll buy some champagne, we can celebrate.

You think it's lousy?

00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:29,816
The whole thing?

675
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:34,487
It's all those flashbacks. You never know
when anything is taking place.

676
00:58:34,654 --> 00:58:38,700
In the first 20 pages alone, I counted
three flashbacks, one flash-forward...

677
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:41,995
...and I think on Page 8
you have a flash-sideways.

678
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,416
Well, what about the story?

679
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:48,627
The story?

680
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:52,506
Yeah. Four poker buddies
knocking over a casino.

681
00:58:52,673 --> 00:58:54,967
The perfect crime.

682
00:58:57,178 --> 00:59:00,765
What are you saying I should do? Take out
the flashbacks? Rewrite the opening?

683
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:02,683
I could do that.

684
00:59:04,268 --> 00:59:05,811

Thanks.

688

You don't know a damn thing about writing.
You're a schoolteacher, not an editor.

689
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:20,035
That's obvious. I read the whole thing.

690
00:59:20,202 --> 00:59:23,371
An editor would have stopped reading
after the first paragraph.

what you want? You want me to burn it?

Well, at odd times. You know,

He has some funny misadventures
and he makes all kinds of mistakes...

...and now he's completely
out of his element.

was use the entire town.

-I will, I will.

what's in store for Andy next.
