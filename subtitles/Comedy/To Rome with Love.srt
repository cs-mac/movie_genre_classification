1
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:27,821
I had a dream to never return.
("FLY" by Domenico Modugno)

2
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:33,864
I painted my hands and face blue.

3
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:41,023
Then suddenly I was abducted by the wind,

4
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:50,892
and I started to fly in the infinite sky.

5
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:59,470
Flying, oh, oh

6
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:06,678
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh

7
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,019
Into the blue painted blue

8
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:15,401
I was happy to be there.

9
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:23,026
And I flew flew happily,
higher than the sun, and still higher.

10
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:28,481
As the world slowly disappeared far away,

11
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:35,846
soft music played only for me.

12
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:42,657
Flying, oh, oh

13
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:49,614
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh

14
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,513
Come, come, come.

15
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,110
Oh-oh, a damned barrier. Bang!

16
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,849
Sorry. I don't speak English very well.

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm from Roma. My job, as you can see,
is to see that the traffic move.

18
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:19,444
I stand up here, and I see everything.
All people. I see life.

19
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,562
In this city, all is a story.

20
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:29,369
See that young man over there?
He's a Roman, Michelangelo.

21
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:33,354
Oh, uh... Excuse me.
Um... Trevi Fountain?

22
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:36,844
- Uh... so it's two blocks...
- Uh-huh, two blocks...

23
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:42,646
- and then across the piazza.
- OK, and that's Piazza Mignanelli?

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,121
- No.
- OK, no. Piazza di Spagna is this... No?

25
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:47,312
- No. This is Piazza Venezia, right?
- OK.

26
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,512
Look, I'll show you.
Um... this is Piazza...

27
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,278
I don't... I don't know.

28
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:55,131
Uh, look, you know what?
I'm going that way, I can show you.

29
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:59,458
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You speak very good English.

30
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,809
That's because of my work.
I visit New York often.

31
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,233
Oh, that's where I'm from.

32
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,172
- What do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

33
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:08,824
- And you're, let me guess, a tourist.
- For the summer.

34
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:11,374
- I'm Hayley. Hi.
- Hi. Michelangelo.

35
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:34,294
It's been an unbelievable summer.

36
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:39,197
We read about in all those romantic
novels, American goes to Rome,

37
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,390
meets handsome Roman at Trevi Fountain.

38
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:46,357
No, he's utterly adorable.

39
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:52,348
Now, Antonio and Milly
were also a young couple in Rome.

40
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:55,301
They married in the little town of Pordenone,

41
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:59,681
and came to Rome for their honeymoon
with plans to settle there.

42
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:14,432
And then there was that well-known
American architect,

43
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:19,020
concluding his vacation
with a few days in Rome.

44
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,540
And finally, we meet Leopoldo Pisanello,
an average Roman citizen of the middle class,

45
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:33,276
dependable, agreeable, predictable.

46
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:37,367
I think it happened so fast.

47
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,984
I can't wait to bring you home
and introduce you to my parents.

48
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,804
I can't wait to meet them.

49
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,695
- It is delicious.
- Buono, mama.

50
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,885
And what do you do, Hayley?

51
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:53,342
Uh... I'm self-employed.
I help clients find art.

52
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:55,156
My background is in fine art.

53
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,828
He's lawyer. I'm very proud.

54
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:02,086
All my children, I work night and day
so they get to education.

55
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,429
We want to meet your parents.
They come to Rome?

56
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:09,167
Oh... well, yes, as a matter of fact,
they're on their way.

57
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:14,592
Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our
descent into Fiumicino airport in Rome.

58
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:19,097
We may experience some turbulence.
Please keep your seat belts fastened,

59
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,341
and make sure all trays
are in appropriate position.

60
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:24,391
Great, turbulence!
My favorite!

61
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,808
No. You just relax and
stop clenching your fists.

62
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:31,132
I can't unclench when this turbulence...
You know I'm an atheist.

63
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:33,771
I don't like this. It's bumping.
The plane is bumping.

64
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,914
- I don't like it moves like that.
- I can't wait to meet her fiance.

65
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,574
You know he's a communist.

66
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,686
There's not even a communist party here anymore.
No, he's just very very left.

67
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,479
Hey, listen, I was very left
when I was his age too.

68
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,565
But... but I was never a communist.

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,090
I couldn't share a bathroom.

70
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,617
Ok... He's not a communist,
he's just a do-gooder.

71
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,023
What... what does it mean, "a do-gooder"?

72
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,492
Who believes not into
material possessions, you know.

73
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,774
What? Well, look,
if she's gonna marry an Italian,

74
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,278
I want her to marry somebody with,
you know, with material possessions,

75
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,990
with a yacht, with a couple of Ferraris,
with... with a villa in Sardinia, you know.

76
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,067
Don't you want our little Hayley
to marry into a "Eurotrash"?

77
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,366
Wow, I don't like it.

78
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,660
- I don't the plane does that!
- Just stop it!

79
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:16,431
- It's not...
- Stop it! Just relax.

80
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:20,083
- I don't like it. I get a bad feeling.
- OK? Breathe.

81
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,636
Please.
Thank you.

82
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:40,064
- You like this? - A lot.
- It's beautiful. - Yes, Yes.

83
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:44,693
Look, love, it's late.
My uncles are coming. Come on.

84
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:47,279
Yes, but what if they don't like me,
what will we do?

85
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:50,408
- Love, but what do you care?
- Be... - You are so beautiful!

86
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,327
You just have to be yourself.
Don't worry.

87
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:58,541
They are important people. Maybe a little
harsh, but not put off.

88
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,085
They are nice.

89
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,296
Next week I will be working in their company.

90
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:07,174
I do not want to say or do things that could compromise...

91
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,301
.. this wonderful opportunity that they offer.

92
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:13,973
- You will do nicely. Trust me.
Will I? - Of course.

93
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:17,226
Listen, what I was saying
on the train...

94
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,478
Yes, I will probably miss
Pordenone,...

95
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,231
.. But it is a job that I cannot refuse.

96
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:25,234
Do you realize!
If all goes well, we will live in Rome.

97
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:28,612
We will meet wonderful people.
We will have children.

98
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:33,492
And maybe one day we will have a
villa with servants, like my uncles.

99
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,494
Yes, but I have to go to the hairdresser.

100
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,123
I look like a schoolhouse teacher
with this hair.

101
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,585
- I should be a little 'more chic.
- It 's late. You have to go now?

102
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:46,005
- It'll only take a moment. I'll be quick.
- I would not make them wait...

103
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,092
- Okay. Hurry though, eh?
- Okay.

104
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,020
- Goodbye.
- Hurry up, eh.

105
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,515
I'm sorry,
the hairdresser is full.

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,143
- There is no one else around here?
- Sure.

107
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:03,022
You leave the building, go right,
second left,...

108
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:06,775
.. Pass under an arch,
immediately to the right, there is a bridge.

109
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,987
After the bridge, the first
left, straight ahead.

110
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,032
- It is on the right.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:16,322
The food is better than Malibu,
I would say that.

112
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:18,841
I can't wait to do some sight seeing.

113
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:21,128
Oh, John can show us around.
He used to live here.

114
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:23,643
Oh, God, Carol.
It was thirty years ago.

115
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:24,263
So?

116
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:27,348
- It must've been great then.
- That was fabulous.

117
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,981
I was young and in love,
and a complete fool.

118
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,333
But it's the eternal city,
it never changes.

119
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,870
And I too want to go to see the ruins.
It is Rome after all.

120
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,918
All those old ruins just depress me.

121
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,502
I'll get Ozymandias melancholia.

122
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,459
Besides, I saw it all when I lived here.

123
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:46,289
So we'll leave you and then
we'll hook up later. OK?

124
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:49,915
I'm just not a good sightseer.
I prefer just to walk through the streets.

125
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:54,032
"Ozymandias melancholia",
where did you get that phrase?

126
00:08:54,115 --> 00:09:07,559
"ARRIVEDERCI ROMA" by Renato Rascel
(Instrumental Version)

127
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:21,585
Excuse me, are you...
are you John Foye?

128
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,708
Yes. How do you know that?

129
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,857
Right. I recognized your picture
from the Herald Tribune.

130
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,120
You designed all those shopping malls.

131
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,125
- That's how you're picking me?
- No, I'm an architect.

132
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,455
- Well, studying to be, anyhow.
- Really?

133
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,741
Yeah. You... you working
on a project in Rome?

134
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,977
Uh... no, on vacation. I lived in Rome
for a year when I was your age.

135
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:44,208
- Really? Whe... Where?
- Here, Trastevere.

136
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:47,759
Yeah? I... I live here,
I'm on Via dei Uffiti.

137
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,589
That's my old stomping ground.

138
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,812
I've been wandering around all day,
I can't seem to find it.

139
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,924
Really? No, it's literally
two blocks up to the left.

140
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,516
- Well, I...
- What?

141
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,952
- Do you... do you want me to show you?
- I don't know if I should revisit it.

142
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:09,459
But... OK, why not?

143
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,781
This honey is from the square in Rome,
right in the middle.

144
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:23,287
Two euros! But it is good! Oh!
Come on, finish your breakfast. Thank you.

145
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,873
You have to eat. Camilla where is it?

146
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:29,543
Did you see?
Do you know why there's all this unemployment?

147
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:34,048
Because people are spoiled
by the latest technologies.

148
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:38,927
- What movie? - It is too late!
- Mangia! Always late!

149
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:02,284
I think the world will end now that all
the planet speaks Chinese.

150
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,953
- Who wants your opinion!
- I'm telling you.

151
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,915
They don't give a damn about anyone
or what we think.

152
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,835
- We just have to pay taxes.
- We pay taxes, right.

153
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,213
Look who it is.

154
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:18,967
Where were you when I was in the elevator
stuck for two hours?

155
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:22,096
Being young and unmarried...
Or, at least, one of the two.

156
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,098
- Did you see when she did that?
- Beautiful!

157
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:28,727
- Don't believe it. - Why?
- The weekend is on his mind.

158
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:32,064
But when?
Always.

159
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:35,317
- If you want my opinion...
- Again?! - Can I say something?!

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,486
I think...

161
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,365
- It was a romantic movie, very interesting.
- I did not understand anything.

162
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,951
It's a most beautiful story of "The King's Speech."

163
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,829
- It was most beautiful.
- What do you mean? - I do not understand.

164
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,748
- What was intended by the author.
- Why?! - Not at all wanted!

165
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,210
- The incomprehensibility of life...
- Let's eat?

166
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,379
- Do you see that...
- Yes.

167
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,465
- If I had to vote for an Oscar,
I'd have doubts. - But you do not vote...

168
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:01,260
- Who is it? Maria! - I want to see.
- If I had to vote...

169
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,641
I can't see who it is,
but I think it's Brad Pitt.

170
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,854
"This week we are
interviewing Tony Blair,...

171
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:16,275
... the winner of Miss Universe,
and Johnny Depp."

172
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,428
Oh, my God, look at this city!

173
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,841
You're tipping him in euros.

174
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,633
When you realize what you just gave him,
you're gonna have a heart attack.

175
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,510
Well, you know, they gave us
such a great room, Phyllis.

176
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,399
- Yeah.
- And I'm delighted to be here.

177
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,960
- This is great.
- See, you always used to travel for work.

178
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:37,318
Isn't it nice to be some place for pleasure?

179
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:41,865
No. I... I miss work.
I don't like being retired.

180
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:48,008
You know, I... I keep having fantasies that
I'm gonna... gonna wind up an old person...

181
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:52,170
in a... in a hotel lobby
watching a communal television set,

182
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,839
drooling with a colostomy bag or something.

183
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:59,041
- You equate retirement with death.
- Yes, exactly. Exactly.

184
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,901
Yeah, but it's a fantasy,
because you're not dying.

185
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,652
No, I'm not dying now!

186
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,660
But, you know, it's conceivable
I might one day.

187
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:10,141
You know, I'm... I'm talking
fifty, sixty years from now.

188
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:13,787
- Can I get a little water, or...?
- Sure.

189
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:17,626
You know, I haven't made my mark, I haven't
really achieved what I wanted to do.

190
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:22,136
Oh, you did just fine. Your problem was
you just a little ahead of your time.

191
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,798
Hey, I'm way ahead of my time.

192
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:28,844
You know, you married a very bright guy.
I got... I got a 150, 160 IQ.

193
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:32,947
You're figuring it in euros,
in dollars it's much less.

194
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,116
Hello!

195
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,102
- Oh, darling!
- Hi, Mom!

196
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:45,855
- Hi, Dad! How are you?
- Good, good.

197
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,324
- This Michelangelo.
- Hi.

198
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:51,225
- This is my father, my mother.
- Nice to meet you.

199
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,644
- Did you have a good trip?
- Good trip? Yeah, we have a good trip.

200
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:57,839
I thought it was all bumpy
when we're landed, but... you know...

201
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:02,163
Probably you'll read about it on the paper,
if the airline ever recovers the black box.

202
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:05,851
So our plan is to get married
around Christmas.

203
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,324
Oh, really? Uh... you...
you're a lawyer, Michaelangelo?

204
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,300
"Michel".

205
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,214
- Michel... Michel? They call you Michel?
- Yes.

206
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:16,586
Yes, for the oppressed,
those who cannot pay.

207
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:21,311
Ah, pro bono.
So... should be taking in washing soon.

208
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,993
- Um... would you like to drink or something?
- Sure.

209
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,620
- Yeah. Water?
- Um... I'm...

210
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:29,119
- Would you like water or...?
- Yeah, water. - Water is fine.

211
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,640
Hayley told me that you're working
in the music business?

212
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:37,835
I did. I'm retired. I... I used to work for a
classical music division of a record company.

213
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,216
I was an opera director for many years.

214
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:46,237
You know, Michelangelo's
great grandfather knew Verdi.

215
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:50,496
Really? Well, I... I staged
some Verdi, I did.

216
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:53,390
Basically, I did avant-garde staff,
atonal things.

217
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,730
But I... I jazzed up a couple of classics.

218
00:14:55,745 --> 00:15:01,708
You know, I did... I did a production of Rigoletto,
where all the characters were dressed as white mice.

219
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:06,709
I did... I did Tosca once,
and all in a phone booth.

220
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,479
Jerry was ahead of his time.

221
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,964
Yeah, I was... I was a little, you know,
a little fast for mass appeal, but, uh...

222
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:18,671
you know, then... then the productions
got between the critics, and cost the unions...

223
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:21,002
I'm sorry. You don't like the unions?

224
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,736
Well... you know, the unions...

225
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,978
You know, without the unions,
the worker would be ground into dust.

226
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:31,867
Yes, I understand where...
what you're saying, Michaelangelo, but I...

227
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,993
"Michel", Michelangelo.

228
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,365
- What?
- "Michel"!

229
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,954
"Michel"? Yeah.
That Michaelangelo, the painter!

230
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:41,738
Only with... with him, for some reason,
he's "Michel". Um...

231
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:46,251
Michelangelo feels very deeply
about the workers.

232
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:56,745
Excuse me... Excuse me, can you tell me where
this address is?

233
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,874
Er... Er... Ah, yes... ah, yes...

234
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,710
Take the first right.

235
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:08,131
Go a hundred meters.
You will find an ice cream parlor.

236
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:16,098
Then go straight for 50 meters
when there go left.

237
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,141
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

238
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:33,281
At the next traffic light crossing...

239
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:36,410
There is a seafood restaurant,
you cannot go wrong.

240
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:42,416
It is straight on, turn right, then again
100 meters and turn right again.

241
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:47,421
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you. - Your welcome.

242
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,861
Here, this is where I live.

243
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:47,192
Christ, this might have been my exact street!

244
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,159
- Can I ask you in for a coffee?
- Coffee?

245
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,598
Yeah. Yeah, come on in.
Sally makes great espresso.

246
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,803
- Sally?
- Yeah, my girlfriend.

247
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,933
She's a... she's studying here.

248
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:00,196
- Hey, Sally!
- Hi!

249
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,525
Hey, I brought someone home
who used to live here.

250
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:04,315
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah. This is John Foye.

251
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:05,602
- This is Sally.
- Wow, hey.

252
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,310
- Hello. - I know.
- Sally. That's so... Wow!

253
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:10,088
- You're right. She's lovely.
- She's the best.

254
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:13,224
Oh, can I give you something to drink?
I can make some coffee.

255
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,357
That'll be great, honey, yeah.
Thank you very much.

256
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:19,977
Oh, my gosh! Uh... my friend, Monica,
she called, she's going to be in Rome,

257
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,824
and I told her she could stay with us.

258
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,122
Ah, well, so I'll finally get to meet her.

259
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:28,354
She just broke up with her boyfriend,
so she's a bit at loose ends.

260
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,519
Trouble . . "Trouble in River City".

261
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:31,638
What trouble? Why... why trouble?

262
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,043
You just gonna love her.

263
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:40,706
She's smart and funny, and interesting.
Men just adore her.

264
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,753
I think it's because of the sexual vibe
that she gives off.

265
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:47,144
- Um-hm, and how long is she coming for?
- Oh, I don't know.

266
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:51,169
Between the breakup and...then
her acting career isn't going that well.

267
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:54,466
Jesus Christ, can't you see
the situation is fraught with peril?

268
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,173
Come on, give me a break.

269
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,050
Her friend is coming. Why do I care?
I'm not looking for anything?

270
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:59,066
I'm perfectly happy with Sally, and uh...

271
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:04,240
Actually judging from Sally's description of Monica
as kind of like a neurotic unpredictable type.

272
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,652
Beautiful, funny, smart, sexual, and also
neurotic. It's like filling an inside straight.

273
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:15,432
"Monica"... even her name is hot.

274
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:50,103
- Congratulations. - Yes?
- I have a super gift for you.

275
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,607
- What gift?
-A special gift for a special man.

276
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:56,818
- What is this special gift?
- It's Me!

277
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,613
I'm already all paid for.
I'm all yours, all yours.

278
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:03,491
- Look, there must be a mistake.
- You can do whatever you like.

279
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,495
- Ah, yes? Please, go away.
- I cannot. You're upset.

280
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,084
- Who...?!
- They told me that you're stressed and
you'd be surprised.

281
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:16,630
- But you are the lucky winner.
- Winner of what?!

282
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,382
- The winner of the contest.
- But what contest?

283
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:24,137
Domi and Fabio have paid me and told me
to congratulate you.

284
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:26,640
That they were wrong and that you need
to accept their apologies.

285
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:32,354
- These two gentlemen I do not know them.
Will you leave?
- I will not tell.

286
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:35,649
I am here to fulfill your dreams.

287
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,652
Please, Miss. Leave!

288
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,905
But you're Mr. Debroca,
room 504.

289
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,783
I'm not Mr. Debroca
but the room is right.

290
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:48,787
- Please, leave now...
- Is anyone there?

291
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:55,001
- Sorry, sorry.
- I told you to wait.

292
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:58,880
No, it's not like you think.
Have a seat, please.

293
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:02,133
We were to meet at noon, the door was open...

294
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:07,639
- So you do not enter without knocking!
- Nice way to meet your wife!

295
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,684
- This is not my wife.
- No!

296
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,812
I hope you're joking.

297
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,525
Of course I'm kidding.
She's my wife.

298
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,903
I am Uncle Paul.

299
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,156
Giovanna.

300
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,450
Uncle Sal.

301
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,911
Aunt Rita.

302
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,663
Anna.

303
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:36,918
- Anna! But isn't your name Milly?
- Milly?...

304
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:40,964
Milly, of course, Milly.
Anna is the second name.

305
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,216
- Milly!
- Milly.

306
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:47,304
We will be waiting downstairs,
don't worry. Come on.

307
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:50,932
- Paul... - Yes
- Yes, yes. - See you later.

308
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,983
I want to die! My life is over!
I am ruined!

309
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,986
Tell them the truth,
that there was a mistake.

310
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:07,490
But how?! They've seen us
on the bed! I am in my underwear...

311
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:13,246
They won't understand... What they'll think...
I'll never convince them, it's useless.

312
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:18,585
They will think I called an escort.
Why did you jump on me?

313
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,629
I was paid to make love with Mr.
Debroca.

314
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:25,717
- And leave the door open! - Yes
- Are you an idiot? - I thought it was closed.

315
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,513
They're the kind of people who think
they are in charge of everything.

316
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:34,017
Milly's coming.
We have to get out of here.

317
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,644
You have to pretend to be my wife.

318
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:40,774
I pretend to be your wife?
I'm no actress. Plus...

319
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,527
-You just called me an "idiot".
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

320
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:50,033
I need your help because if
Milly comes, I'll jump out the window.

321
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:53,912
- Do you not understand that sooner or later
they'll discover everything?

322
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,748
I need time,
then I'll think of something.

323
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,793
It is important that we leave immediately
and get away.

324
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:03,747
- Can you walk faster?
- I'm walking fine. Relax.

325
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,641
Her flight should've landed.

326
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:07,622
Right, by the time she goes through customs
and luggage it'll be about an hour.

327
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:09,911
I hope you don't fall in love with her.

328
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,997
In love with her? What...
what the hell does that mean?

329
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:17,306
- Well, men always just go crazy for her.
- Well, I'm... I'm crazy for you.

330
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,244
OK, That... that's her.
Monica!

331
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:27,241
- Hi!
- Hi! It's so good to see you!

332
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:31,755
- You look so great!
- Stop it!

333
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,758
Nothing special, right?

334
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,080
No, nothing special at all.
Like... I got no buzz.

335
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:39,330
I mean, look at her,
this... this is the hot "femme fatale"?

336
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:41,513
Of course, she has been flying for 14 hours.

337
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:45,185
But you would admit
there is something about her.

338
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,373
All I can say is that if something
is clicking, it's so subconscious,

339
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:49,473
I'm... I'm totally unaware.

340
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:52,339
She's no big deal, certainly not
some formidable heartbreaker.

341
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:54,862
She's...
she's a disheveled, out of work actress.

342
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,656
...for so long, now you're here. I just...

343
00:23:57,673 --> 00:24:00,011
- Hi! Hi, I'm Jack.
- This is Monica.

344
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:01,176
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

345
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,488
I'm sorry. I mean, I must look awful.

346
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,745
- Please don't make any snap judgments.
- No, you look fine.

347
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,126
I just... I can never sleep on the plane.

348
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,638
I had a Scotch and three Ambien,
but still...

349
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,985
Pretty cozy this ride into town.

350
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,392
I keep telling you
I have no interest in Monica.

351
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:20,440
I just hope having her around is
not gonna interfere with my work.

352
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,880
But there is an element of excitement,
a germ, a spark, one molecule...

353
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:27,180
God...

354
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:30,961
I see it so clearly now.
But I'm older.

355
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:33,336
- Thank you, the dinner was great.
- Thanks.

356
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:35,942
Ah, yeah, you're becoming
a really great Italian chef.

357
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:40,738
Well, I figured it was just her first
night here, so...uh, why not stay in?

358
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:42,950
Yeah, it's perfect,
just the three of us.

359
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:45,990
- Wha... what are you reading?
- Oh, the poetry of Yeats.

360
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,723
"The gong-tormented sea."

361
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:49,838
Yeah... yeah, you know it?

362
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:52,921
Do you wanna talk about
the breakup with Donald?

363
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:57,924
Well, Donald was gay. Um, it was my ego
that thought I could change him,

364
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,815
and I couldn't. Believe me, I tried.

365
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:02,632
Yeah? How does one try?

366
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:07,302
Well, I mean... I don't wanna
get graphic, but...

367
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:10,710
I mean, let's just say that
I gave it my all.

368
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,317
And it's such a shame,
because he's so brilliant,

369
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,912
and he's so wonderful out of that.

370
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,633
I mean, so much fun to be with.

371
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,746
I... I tried to show him
how sex with a woman...

372
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:25,605
...could be as exciting or even more so
than with someone from his own sex.

373
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:29,277
Then he tried, he... he did try.

374
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:32,287
But in the end, I... uh,
I struck out. So...

375
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,834
I remember you saying how much fun
you have when he took you to Paris.

376
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:37,537
Have you ever had sex with a man?

377
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:40,290
Me? Se... sex with a man?
God! No...no, no!

378
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:43,722
I mean, no. It's not something
I'm interested in ever doing...

379
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:48,769
Why are you blushing?
Probably because you wanna try it.

380
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,265
Look, I always had a little yen
for sleeping with a woman,

381
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:57,641
and when I finally did,
and it was... was very intense,

382
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:01,252
it was very exciting but unnerving.

383
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,007
I really have no repressed...

384
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,762
I... I shot this TV movie once, and...

385
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,967
one of the scenes it was with this
incredible lingerie model.

386
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,526
I mean, she was to die.

387
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,929
And... and for whatever reason,
I... I get this message one day...

388
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:20,541
...from the assistant director that Miss Lee
would like me to go to her dressing room.

389
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:25,959
And why she was so suddenly
obsessed with me, I don't know.

390
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:31,078
And... and I go.
And she's in her robe.

391
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:38,422
And she takes it off,
and gives me a big hug and kiss.

392
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:48,116
And I just become crazed.
I mean, I become so excited.

393
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:52,280
I mean, she was just
too beautiful to turn down.

394
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:55,936
We had the thing for like. .

395
00:26:56,025 --> 00:27:02,503
three months. Yeah, it was like
being in an erotic dream.

396
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:06,584
And... and on the one hand,
yes, it was very exciting,

397
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,353
but on the other hand,
just very confusing.

398
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,084
And... and that's when I started seeing
the shrink five days a week.

399
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,312
Well, fortunately, Jamal came along,
and we had a great relationship.

400
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:26,298
And as great as the orgasms were
with Victoria.

401
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:32,114
They were stronger with Jamal,
and just a lot less bewildering.

402
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:35,008
Excuse me.

403
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,995
She is something, isn't she?

404
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:42,410
Yeah, give me... I need a few minutes to
recover from her story, it's still vibrating.

405
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:43,830
I think she's so fun.

406
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,658
Yeah, but look, finally what she got,

407
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:49,412
I mean, no... no real acting career,
no relationship that's remotely stable,

408
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:50,798
sleeping pills, shrinks...

409
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:53,520
You sound like you try to convince yourself.

410
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:58,189
Hey, I've got a great idea.
Let's go for a little walk tonight.

411
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:02,452
Oh, no, I'm exhausted.
But, um... why don't you take her, Jack?

412
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:05,076
Oh, no... no... no!
God, no! That will be a catastrophe!

413
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,430
Why are you so worried?

414
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:09,080
You think of me as the seductress,
this is your problem.

415
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:13,484
Bullshit! You deliberately made up this
provocative story with some lingerie model.

416
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:15,326
It was true, most of it. OK?

417
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,207
I... I exaggerated a little.
I like to embellish.

418
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:19,899
It's part of my creative charm.

419
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:21,743
Come on! Come on,
why don't you come?

420
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,348
Sally, you've go to go along with them.

421
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:22,049
What's the matter?! Are you crazy!
Go! You have the wrong person!

422
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,012
Sofia! Sofia!

423
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:29,682
- Sofia! Whats happening?!
- What do you want?!

424
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:39,776
Call the police!
Go away! I am serious!

425
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:45,156
I'm going to work!
I have to go to work! These people are crazy!

426
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,075
- What is this car?!
-You'll be late for the studio.

427
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:53,581
- But I'm late for work!
- Get in, Get in.

428
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:56,167
Sofia... come with me.

429
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,852
Hello and welcome to TG3.

430
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:20,107
Today we have a special guest:
Leopoldo Pisanello.

431
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:24,445
- Welcome, Mr. Pisanello.
Welcome to TG3. - Thank you, yes...

432
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:27,740
Excuse me, but why am I here?

433
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,869
To answer our questions,
for our interview.

434
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:34,872
- What did you have for breakfast?
- Me?

435
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:41,087
Er... coffee latte and two slices of bread with butter and jam.

436
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:44,131
Two slices of bread... And how was it?

437
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,884
Good... toasted.

438
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:50,888
- Ah, so you prefer toast.
- Yes, that's right, yes.

439
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,766
Why? Can I ask you?

440
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:59,897
I don't know. I just like it.
I usually prefer toast.

441
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:03,776
- White or whole wheat?
- White.

442
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,237
So we can say without a shadow of a doubt...

443
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,283
.. Leopold Pisanello prefers two slices of bread toasted.

444
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,622
Yes, and a latte... without sugar.

445
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:21,294
Do you shave before or after breakfast?

446
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:32,179
- Extraordinary!
- Me?

447
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:34,265
Me?

448
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:44,525
Still here? Enough! Go! Sofia!

449
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:47,069
Sofia! Go away!

450
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:52,158
Leopoldo! You were great!

451
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,912
- The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
- Yes, but...

452
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:58,706
They want you on tomorrow's news at 8 pm.

453
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,043
- What are you saying! Me? But why?
- You're famous!

454
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:07,375
-95  -95
Oh, I don't know.
I can't find the address.

455
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:10,719
This is 91. So it's...
This goes down.

456
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:12,748
- That's 93.
- Uh-huh.

457
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:15,894
Can't be 95.
95 is a funeral parlour.

458
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:18,425
- Oh, then we're right!
- What do you mean, we're right?

459
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:20,408
Mr. Santoli is a mortician.

460
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,079
You're kidding?

461
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:25,060
He owns a funeral parlour,
and don't make an issue of it.

462
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:28,505
Jeez, the kid's a communist,
the father's a mortician.

463
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:30,643
Does the mother run a leper colony?

464
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,360
I guess they live upstairs.

465
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:37,836
- Excuse me, 9... 95's... 95?
- Yes. 95. Santoli.

466
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,019
Yes, yes.

467
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:42,682
- Someone dead.
- No, but it's early.

468
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,813
No, no.
We're Hayley's parents.

469
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,254
- Hayley's parents?
- Yes.

470
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:50,085
Welcome, welcome!
Such a big pleasure to meet you!

471
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:55,100
Oh... I'm sorry. I've not cleaned up.
I work all day, but...

472
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:57,525
Please, come to our place.
We live over there.

473
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,612
- Please, follow me.
- Thank you, thank you very much!

474
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:02,682
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Oh, it was wonderful, wonderful.

475
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,719
Please, come in.
Mariangela, come here!

476
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:10,201
- Hayley's parents have arrived.
- Oh, hello!

477
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:12,555
- Phyllis, Jerry.
- So nice to meet you.

478
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,298
Good morning.

479
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:17,293
- Oh, Mariangela don't speak good English.
- No... - No.

480
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:21,058
- What do you drink?
- Well... wine would be great.

481
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:24,134
Michelangelo and Hayley
should be here any minute.

482
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,227
But if you excuse me now,
I need to go to clean up.

483
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:32,174
- Mariangela, open the bottle and pour him a drink.
- I'm going to open it.

484
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,178
- Meanwhile you sit down.
- Ok. - Be right back. - Yes

485
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:39,456
- Hello!
- mama!

486
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:40,955
- Hi. Hi!

487
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:43,417
You just find the place OK, right?

488
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,578
We just followed a passing hearse,
and here we are, you know.

489
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:51,280
- You have arrived! Well! - Hello.
- Taste my specialties.

490
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,550
Oh, Mom, the green ones are
like Tapenade. They're so good.

491
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,965
- You should try them, they're amazing.
- Oh, OK.

492
00:33:58,313 --> 00:33:59,726
Oh...

493
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:04,583
Well... I'm sorry.
Excuse me. It's great.

494
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:07,972
I mean, I try and make this,
but I never get this taste.

495
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,102
She could teach you.
Teach her to make croutons.

496
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,927
- Yes, OK.
- No. Oh, no, really.

497
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:17,041
- Come on, free cooking lesson.
- I... I don't wanna be...

498
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:22,017
Have one. I have to kinda...

499
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,810
Please.

500
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,671
Formaldehyde!

501
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:37,740
(Giancarlo) The time has fled...

502
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:46,082
(Giancarlo) And I die in despair!

503
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:54,965
And I die in despair!

504
00:34:55,884 --> 00:35:20,769
And I've never loved life so much!
Victory!

505
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,706
She showed me how to make these, Jerry,

506
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:26,714
but, of course, she gets mozzarella
fresh everyday from Naples.

507
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:30,169
- What do you do, Phyllis?
- I'm a psychiatrist.

508
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:33,678
Oh! A psychiatrist.

509
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:38,013
I've never been to Naples,
but I hear it's beautiful.

510
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:40,327
There's no cooking like in Naples.

511
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:42,530
You see much of Italy, Jerry?

512
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,119
Jerry, he's asking you a question.

513
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,454
Yes... Naples.

514
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,593
Have you... have you ever
taken singing lessons, Giancarlo?

515
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:00,697
Singing lessons? No.
What for?

516
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:05,448
You, well, you have just a natural voice.

517
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,425
I'm no singer.
I sing for me.

518
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:10,481
Since I was a boy.

519
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:15,207
- You have a very very beautiful gift.
- Yeah.

520
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:21,056
But, no. She says that I make only
too much noise around the house.

521
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,690
And no one's ever heard you?

522
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:25,480
No, he's our own private Caruso.

523
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:32,168
You have a fantastic voice, have you
ever thought of doing anything with it?

524
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:34,937
He sings for pleasure, not for money.

525
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:37,636
Well, there's a great deal
of pleasure in money.

526
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:41,859
You know, it's green and crinkly,
you can fondle the bills.

527
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:44,969
Listen, uh... I'm no singer.

528
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,470
I... I don't know, I...

529
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:55,758
Is it possible that... that, um...
after dinner, you could sing something for me?

530
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:59,493
Me? No... I don't know.
I... I become too embarrassed.

531
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,185
No... no, right here,
just among us... right...

532
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:05,879
No... no. Please, Michelangelo,
please tell him too.

533
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:12,997
I... you know, I... I have a friend
in town here, who's in the recording business.

534
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:18,651
And... and if... if you would just... if you
would just sing. He's a very knowledgable man.

535
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,767
And... and... you know, if you just...

536
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,791
When you... when you're not busy,
when you're not cremating anybody,

537
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:27,612
- and we just...
- Look, he's already said no.

538
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,992
Dad's not a singer. I'm sure you don't
want him to make fool of himself.

539
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,670
Jerry, back off.

540
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:40,372
OK, forget it.
I... I'm not gonna say another word. I...

541
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:44,535
Forget it.
But the guy has a fantastic voice!

542
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:49,949
This is... You have...
OK, I'm... I'm finished.

543
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,552
The subject is closed.
But... his voice is great,

544
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,585
somebody's got to do something
with this, because he's... he's...

545
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,455
- Jerry!
- Not me! I'm not saying I would.

546
00:37:57,464 --> 00:37:59,824
But... but he's got a fantastic...

547
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:01,268
- The man is a genius,
- That's enough.

548
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,353
he's got a natural... great natural...

549
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:08,126
I'm not saying anything, you know,
I'm... I'm off the subject.

550
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:13,148
Great voice. Fantastic.
Big star...

551
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:19,461
- What's the name of the hotel?
- I can't remember.

552
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:25,592
- It's in the center? - Yes, more or less.
It was... was red...

553
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:35,102
We're here. Sorry for the delay.
We have been waiting for you.

554
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:38,230
Er... yes... uh...

555
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:46,363
You couldn't find
something more simple?

556
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:49,700
We need to meet people rather important.

557
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:52,745
- We like you dressed like that.
- Like how?

558
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,622
But some of our friends
may not understand.

559
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:59,752
- I lost my suitcase on the train,
- Then that's it. Oh, well.

560
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:04,882
Well, we have organized a trip,
a private Vatican tour.

561
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:10,012
- Beautiful. True love? - Yes,
I know him well. - Come on, then.

562
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:15,017
- I hope they let us in.
- I don't want to go in!

563
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:19,980
- Miss... are you okay?
- Yes, yes, thank you.

564
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,901
Thanks, but...

565
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:28,989
Oh, but... but... but you are...
But you are Pia Fusari?

566
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,494
You recognized me?

567
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:39,041
Yes, but you... Oh, my God, but you
are one of my favorite actresses!

568
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,543
I'm flattered.

569
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:47,549
But you walk down the street here
like a normal person?

570
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,761
We're making a movie here.

571
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:56,183
- You want to come and see?
- Me?!

572
00:39:56,267 --> 00:40:01,313
Yes!

573
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:05,317
But that is Juliet Falcone!

574
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:12,408
No! There is Luca Jump! I love
Luke Salta, he is so charismatic!

575
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,451
No, I do not believe it!

576
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:19,540
It 's amazing. He painted the ceiling
lying on scaffolding.

577
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:24,837
Working all the time lying on one's back!
I can't imagine it!

578
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,714
I can, perfectly.

579
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,348
Shoot, I'm gonna be late to class.

580
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:34,227
- Could you take Monica around today?
- No, I can't. I'm working on my drawings.

581
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:39,511
- Oh, please. She doesn't know Rome at all.
- No, I can't. I do not have time to go...

582
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,563
- ...to the Colosseum for the millionth time.
- Please... just...

583
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,871
Just, please, for me.
Could you do it for me?

584
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:47,541
- Er... OK.
- Thank you.

585
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:56,237
- That is so impressive.
- Oh, I know.

586
00:40:56,252 --> 00:41:00,119
- The lines, the empty space...
- Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of negative space.

587
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:02,528
Are you sure I'm not taking you away
from anything important today?

588
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:06,496
No, I think... I'm just worried
I was taking you away from something,

589
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:08,594
- if you had work to do.
- No, no, I'm fine.

590
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,292
This is actually my favorite thing to do.

591
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:13,014
Yeah. If you weren't here,
I'd probably be doing this alone.

592
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,583
I mean, it's incredible that the Colosseum
is still standing after thousands of years.

593
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:20,607
You know, Sally and I have to retile
the bathroom every six months.

594
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:24,017
These guys were truly...
truly brilliant architects.

595
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:32,506
I just find it so ironic that there was once this
magnificent civilization and now just these ruins.

596
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:39,940
I... I call that futile feeling
"Ozymandias melancholia".

597
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,528
OK.

598
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:46,983
- This is just kind of thing you wanna build?
- Oh, I would be very proud if I'd done this.

599
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,211
Did you always wanna be an architect?

600
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:51,681
Ah, you'll laugh if I tell you
what my ambition is.

601
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:53,906
What? No... no, I won't.

602
00:41:54,069 --> 00:42:00,342
To build radical structures, I mean, to be
scandalous, to change the architectural landscape.

603
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,540
Are.. are you interested in architecture?

604
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:06,770
I'm interested in Gaudi,
Antonio Gaudi.

605
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:11,799
I mean, for me La Sagrada Familia
is poetry in stone.

606
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:15,045
Oh, bullshit!
You went six months of college.

607
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:17,447
You know nothing about architecture
but a few names.

608
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:20,803
You saw the movie, The Fountainhead.

609
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:27,841
I just find something so sexy
about an uncompromising artist.

610
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:35,652
I mean, I would do anything
to spend a night with Howard Roark.

611
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,599
Oh, God save me, save me!

612
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:40,691
Another young woman who wants to
give her body to Howard Roark.

613
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,837
Come on, I mean, she is fun to talk to.

614
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:47,546
Yes, and you buy into her bullshit because
she seems to know all the right things to say.

615
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,803
She knows names,
she knows buzzwords,

616
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:53,950
she knows certain cultural phrases
that imply she knows more than she does.

617
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:57,688
The Anxiety of Influence,
the Bartok's string quartets,

618
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,933
the perversion of the dialectic,
La Sagrada Familia,

619
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:04,077
"The gong-tormented sea".

620
00:43:04,486 --> 00:43:07,767
So what? I should press her and not let
her get away with the namedropping?

621
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:08,922
But you didn't.

622
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:13,014
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of charming
that she's a con artist.

623
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:17,748
Yes, she does have a certain
something which trumps logic.

624
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:23,005
So, go ahead, walk into the propeller.

625
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:27,455
So was it OK with Monica today?
Or did she just drive you crazy?

626
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:30,416
Yeah. I don't have enough time to spend
squiring her around, you know, I'm trying to work.

627
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:33,124
I started having those insecure
thoughts again today.

628
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,146
- Please stop.
- No...

629
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:37,917
Because I thought maybe it was a bad idea that
I put you guys together for the whole day,

630
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:39,807
because what if you ended up attracted to her.

631
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:42,537
Please stop worrying. She's a
self-obsessed pseudo-intellectual.

632
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:43,911
I mean, she's pretty, but so what?

633
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,686
- She is, she's very pretty.
- Yes, she's very pretty.

634
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:50,499
- I mean... I mean, not conventionally.
- I'd like to see her with someone.

635
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:52,087
Who do we know?
We must know someone...

636
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:53,835
- Grazie.
- ...to fix her up with?

637
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:58,050
- Yeah, I'm sure we can scare somebody up.
- Who?

638
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:02,091
What about Leonardo Basso?
Yeah, we exercise together. He's...

639
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:04,205
he's nice-looking, and he's smart,
and he makes good dough.

640
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,681
Actually, I think he broke up with
some girl who was also an actress.

641
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:10,075
- I think he'd be the perfect choice for Monica.
- That's great. Could you... can you call him.

642
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,179
- Yeah. I'll be the matchmaker.
- Great.

643
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:16,318
Please sit down, Mr. Pisanello.

644
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,823
- This will be your new office.
- My new office!

645
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:24,826
.. but I'm not an employee.

646
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:27,829
Very funny.

647
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:33,460
Serafina, come. Look. We have
a famous person in our company.

648
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:36,963
- Good morning.
- Take care of him, Give him everything he needs.

649
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:40,967
- All day.
- With pleasure. - Thank you.

650
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:43,470
- You will take care of me all day?
- Yes

651
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:47,808
- Whatever you need, I'm here.
- Yes

652
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:59,444
Calm down.

653
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:04,366
- How was your day?
- My day?
- Yes

654
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,868
It's been good.

655
00:45:06,953 --> 00:45:11,373
Oh, I did spill coffee on some documents,
but I avoided spilling all of it.

656
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,625
The rest of the day went good.

657
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,462
Did you hear that? Mr. Pisanello
happened to spill his coffee.

658
00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:22,509
But his reflexes avoided a tragedy...

659
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:25,345
.. with no probable loss of human lives.

660
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:27,389
Why did he spill the coffee?

661
00:45:27,473 --> 00:45:30,892
It will be on the news at 9 pm,
with our distinguished guests...

662
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:35,480
.. the leaders of Italy,
the ambassador of Brazil, and the UN.

663
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:37,733
Mr. Pisanello...a statement.

664
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,901
- A statement!
- Yes, a statement.

665
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:46,116
- A statement... so?
- Tell us anything. - So?

666
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,412
I think... I think...
Ah, maybe it's going to rain.

667
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:53,790
You heard it. Pisanello Leopold
says it might rain.

668
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,251
Can you tell us how you will sleep tonight?

669
00:45:56,294 --> 00:46:00,380
Normally I sleep on my back.

670
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:03,175
Leopoldo Pisanello says
he sleeps on his back.

671
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:06,178
You never sleep on your stomach?

672
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:10,932
No, I suffer a bit 'of gastritis.
Not a serious thing...

673
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:13,518
- On my belly I don't like like it that much...
- How much?

674
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:17,814
- Enough! Please! Stop it!
- It 's important! - Enough!

675
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:20,776
Enough! Go!

676
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,404
What do you want from me?! How to sleep...

677
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:30,202
What do you think? I only have these printed dresses.

678
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:33,955
I have to buy something now that you're so famous.

679
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:37,834
Sofia, I'm tired, I have a headache.
Forget it.

680
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:41,421
I had a terrible day.
Let's not go to the premiere of the film.

681
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:46,343
But we must go!
We have to keep up our image.

682
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:49,179
Sofia, but who cares!

683
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:53,600
Do you really think anyone cares if Leopoldo Pisanello
doesn't attend the premier of a film?

684
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:59,439
- Sure!
- But Sofia, I am Mr."Any Fool".

685
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:03,985
And you're my wife, the wife of
Mr. "Any Fool".

686
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,822
But you said you'd go.

687
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:27,467
It's Gina Francone.

688
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:33,265
Ah! It's Tony Branca.

689
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:40,522
There he is. Good evening.
Good evening.

690
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:43,900
But who do I see? Here he is!
Leopoldo Pisanello.

691
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:50,907
He is accompanied by the lovely Sofia.

692
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:55,912
Very elegant, with that dress.

693
00:47:55,913 --> 00:48:00,500
Yes, Sofia is wearing a printed cotton dress.

694
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:04,796
.. And a coat that seems to match.

695
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:09,050
- Yes, definitely.
- And I I've never... a ripped stocking.

696
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:14,264
We're checking. Yes,
it is a run in the left stocking.

697
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:18,810
Lady Pisanello, the run in the stocking,
tell us, is it intentional?

698
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,772
- I have a run?
- Yes, very impressive, very fashionable.

699
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:24,816
You see, Martina?

700
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:28,069
- Then we will see you soon in Cannes?
- Absolutely.

701
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,906
- Well, sorry, but there's Gina Franconi.
- Please.

702
00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:35,702
- Mr. Pisanello.
- Yes?
- I am Marisa Raguso,your fan.
- Thank you.

703
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:41,041
I think you are very, very sexy,
more than all these "frocetti" actors...

704
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,168
.. Making superhero movies.

705
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,422
- Sure.
- It would be nice to have a little
more time to talk.

706
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:51,426
- Let me know what you think of the
cultural situation in Italy.
- Me?

707
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:56,556
Tell you what, I'll give you my phone number.
Call me.

708
00:48:56,557 --> 00:48:59,851
- Your Number?
- Anytime.
- All right.

709
00:49:00,978 --> 00:49:05,982
- Mr. Pisanello, tell us the truth.
Do you wear briefs or boxers?

710
00:49:05,983 --> 00:49:11,863
- Boxers, large, white.
- I knew it! I always knew!

711
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:15,959
It 's clear, a type of boxer.
It 's cool! I knew it!

712
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,377
Do not forget my words, girl

713
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:24,900
You don't know that love

714
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:29,175
is a beautiful thing like the sun.

715
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:33,547
More than the sun, it gives warmth

716
00:49:33,908 --> 00:49:38,380
down slowly through the veins

717
00:49:38,446 --> 00:49:42,788
and gradually reaches the heart...

718
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:48,138
So, er... what're you thinking now that
you've fixed her with your pal?

719
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:48,993
I don't know.

720
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:52,611
Sally and I thought it would be a fun idea
to come out and visit these ruins.

721
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:54,827
Yes, so then what occurred?
What is it?

722
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:58,741
I don't know. I just... I know
I regreted introducing her to Leonardo.

723
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,213
Yes? You're jealous?

724
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,606
Yeah, all of a sudden,
I want to get her alone in a room...

725
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:04,109
...and tell her I've loved her.
Isn't that stupid?

726
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:07,363
I had never felt anything until
this afternoon, and suddenly...

727
00:50:08,121 --> 00:50:16,249
Her face got to me, and I... I loved how
she... she wore her hair. She looks great.

728
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:24,842
- How do you like Monica?
- Oh, she's lovely.

729
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:29,344
- I can't wait to see her again.
- Oh, yeah? You're gonna... gonna see her again?

730
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:33,362
- Tomorrow night.
- I think Sally and I are free Tomorrow night.

731
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:35,034
I think it's better
if there's just the two of us...

732
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:38,482
- Please. Right away. . .
- could you bring the menu, please?

733
00:50:42,217 --> 00:50:45,264
Giancarlo, I took the liberty
of calling my friend,

734
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:47,798
and I set up an audition for you
with the recording comp...

735
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:49,290
I told you, "No".

736
00:50:49,306 --> 00:50:51,960
But why? What do you
have against live people?

737
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:56,162
You... your whole life, you can't just
deal with people that have rigor mortis.

738
00:50:56,176 --> 00:51:01,322
You've got a great voice. You should be...
you should be singing Pagliacci for multitudes.

739
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:02,790
- You... you know.
- Pagliacci?

740
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,161
Pagliacci, yes!
You... you were born to play that.

741
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:08,722
- I've always dreamed of singing Pagliacci.
- Yes, I know!

742
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:10,585
Of course, 'cause you're a natural.

743
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,992
That's... uh, you know, stick with me,
we can go very far, really.

744
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:17,002
- We?
- We, yes!

745
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:18,728
I would... I would manage you,

746
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:22,627
and I... I will direct you or put on
the greatest production of Pagliacci.

747
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:26,340
I'm telling you I know exactly what to do,
I... You have to believe me.

748
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:29,920
I... I don't know why I'm shouting,
you know, you're two inches in front of me.

749
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,578
Trust me.

750
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:41,044
Nessun sleeps! Nessun sleeps!

751
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:47,742
Even you, oh Princess,

752
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:52,004
in your cold room,

753
00:51:52,024 --> 00:52:00,832
watch the stars which tremble with love,

754
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:06,487
and hope!

755
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,914
But my secret is hidden within me;

756
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:18,243
No one will know my name!

757
00:52:18,257 --> 00:52:23,067
No, No! On your mouth ...

758
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:27,073
set, you stars!

759
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,179
Victory!

760
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,367
Victory!

761
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:43,133
How did it go?

762
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:45,888
You know what? Ask your father.

763
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,569
Uh-oh...

764
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:51,938
- I'm so sorry, Jerry. I let you down.
- No...

765
00:52:52,396 --> 00:52:55,733
You should've seen his face.
He knew it was terrible.

766
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:57,720
It wasn't terrible, you know.

767
00:52:57,735 --> 00:53:01,789
Yes, if you... if it was at La Scala where
they would've been throwing fruits and vegetables,

768
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:05,261
yes, they would have.
But, uh... this was a cold audition room.

769
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:09,306
It's all fantasy. You imagine
his voice is better than it really is,

770
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:12,634
because you're searching for an excuse
to come out of retirement.

771
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,962
Hey, don't psychoanalyze me, Phyllis, OK?

772
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:18,983
You know, many have tried, all have failed.

773
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:23,840
I didn't... My brain doesn't fit the usual
id, ego, superego model.

774
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:27,089
No, you have the only brain with three ids.

775
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:30,359
If we eat something,
surely we will feel better.

776
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:33,167
I'm not hungry.
It was a foolish idea to begin with.

777
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:36,929
Well, you father is a grown man,
I mean, he can make his own decisions.

778
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:38,624
I don't know why you showed up at all.

779
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,878
You know, you were sitting there
with a disapproving face,

780
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:45,632
very sour through the whole thing.
Maybe you made your father nervous.

781
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:47,660
I came because he's a simple man.

782
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,473
And I didn't want to send him alone
into a tank of music business sharks.

783
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:55,051
- Tank of sharks?
- Wow, you think my father is a shark?

784
00:53:55,073 --> 00:54:01,854
In the aquatic world, I've been likened to
a spineless jellyfish, but that's about it.

785
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:05,603
Look, you defend your father,
bacause he's family, and I understand.

786
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:09,056
- But he is wrong.
- No, I defend him because you're wrong.

787
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:11,849
There's no sin in trying something and failing.

788
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,832
I don't want to say anything,
but I told you:

789
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:19,568
You choose projects that are doomed to fail.
You get some kind of a payoff out of failing.

790
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:23,316
What projects do I choose
that are doomed to fail?

791
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,301
Rigoletto, with everyone
dressed like white mice.

792
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:34,141
Can you hear him?
Is that not a gorgeous voice?

793
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:37,809
Sure, what good it is
if he can only do it in the shower?

794
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:40,348
Well, but you admit he can...

795
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:46,206
He is right, Jerry.
Everyone sings great in the shower.

796
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:52,258
That's right...
He does it in the shower.

797
00:54:52,307 --> 00:54:55,388
Dad, even you sing in the shower.

798
00:54:56,186 --> 00:54:58,051
I know, I...

799
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:04,144
In life I have a terrible voice, but
when I'm soaping myself under hot water,

800
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:08,566
I sound just like Eartha Kitt.

801
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:10,842
You look strange.

802
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:15,094
Phyllis, I'm having...
There's a psychological term for this.

803
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:18,385
I'm having a breakthrough or an epiphany...

804
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:20,727
Wha... what is that term for what I'm having?

805
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:22,635
A death wish.

806
00:55:25,195 --> 00:55:30,241
Bravo, you were fantastic. Come,
let me introduce a fan of yours.

807
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:34,120
She has seen all your movies.
Milly, right?
- Yes, Milly.

808
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:39,959
- Hi. - I'm sorry.
- So you're one of my fans. - Yes

809
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,839
I have seen all of your films.
- I'm so flattered.

810
00:55:44,882 --> 00:55:49,635
- No, it's true. - Yes? -
I believe that you are an amazing actor.

811
00:55:49,636 --> 00:55:55,725
When you play an Arab or
terrorist or a divorced father...

812
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:59,395
- I always dreamed of being able to meet you.
- Can we have lunch together?

813
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:06,152
- What? You and I! - Eh.
- Together? - I only have an hour.

814
00:56:06,153 --> 00:56:10,406
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

815
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:15,661
You are the sexiest man in Rome,
second in World Film. Did you know?

816
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:17,872
Yes, that's what they tell me.

817
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:19,916
- Shall we?
- Yes

818
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:23,669
Thank you.

819
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:28,674
- Do you want to have many children?
- No, children? No.

820
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:33,179
You become their slave.
Diapers, schools, diseases...

821
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,517
- Then they grow up, they leave,
and you never see them anymore.
- Not so.

822
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,270
For me it was so.
You see, I ran away from home.

823
00:56:41,313 --> 00:56:46,317
My father was a drug dealer and
stole for my mother in stores.

824
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:50,154
What could I do?
Was I not right?

825
00:56:57,955 --> 00:57:00,957
- Look!
- He's a great actor.

826
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:07,422
- There is the actor, Luchino Salta.
- Where?
- Yes, that's him.

827
00:57:07,464 --> 00:57:10,466
But he's married.
Who's that with him?

828
00:57:13,971 --> 00:57:15,972
What's up? What is it?

829
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,808
I'm fine, I'm fine.

830
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:24,564
I cannot believe you are having lunch with me.

831
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:28,109
But I am the lucky one, you know?
I usually eat alone now.

832
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:31,988
No! You alone? You are married,
it is written all over the papers.

833
00:57:32,072 --> 00:57:37,076
Marriage is like wine:
it is a wonder if it is good, if not...

834
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:43,207
We split up. The press does not know.
It's still a secret.

835
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,252
Of course.
No, I won't say anything.

836
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:53,134
- What are they doing?
- He ​​looks into her eyes. He wants her.

837
00:57:54,595 --> 00:58:00,850
I'd like for you to stop by and watch me
on the set this afternoon.

838
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:05,104
So  you can give me some advice,
and you can tell me what you think...

839
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:08,900
Then, perhaps,
we can go to my hotel to talk about it.

840
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:13,029
Because, you are interested in my ideas?

841
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:17,909
- Should I be interested in something else?
- No, no.
- Ah.
- No, absolutely

842
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:22,163
It's just that Anthony, my husband, always says
my head is in the clouds.

843
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:25,041
This, perhaps, is a bit true, but...

844
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,502
He doesn't take your ideas seriously?

845
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:31,172
No, not seriously, respects them, but
they are scientific.

846
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:34,550
Yes, because I am a high school teacher.
I teach astronomy.

847
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:37,178
- Who would have guessed?
- Yes

848
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:42,141
So I doubt you are interested in
my ideas for acting.

849
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:45,645
Astronomy, then the sky,
the planets, the stars...

850
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:49,398
- You're... you are... Wait, I don't mean. .
- I'm saying nothing.

851
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:54,654
- Are you a Libra?
- No, I'm a Sagittarius.
- Oh...

852
00:58:54,696 --> 00:58:56,697
He took her hand.

853
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:03,955
- She should give him a slap.
- No, actually, I'm sure she likes it.

854
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,466
- Are you hurt?
- No. .. no.

855
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:19,720
Good morning. We are at the home of
Mr. Leopoldo Pisanello.

856
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:24,600
It's half past seven, and Mr.
Pisanello is shaving...

857
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:30,481
.. an event that we document
from first to last gesture.

858
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:33,734
Mr. Pisanello is having his hair cut.

859
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:38,364
- Look, just a trim.
- He opted for only a trim.

860
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:54,380
Sorry. We are all full.
There are no tables.

861
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:59,260
- You must be wrong. My husband booked yesterday.
- There must be a mistake.

862
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,638
- How is this possible?
- There's no table? Okay, we'll come back again.

863
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:06,392
- No, Mr. Pisanello.
- Please, this way.

864
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:09,729
- What a shame!
- What manners!
- How dare you!

865
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:12,231
But we are loyal customers!

866
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:15,985
- They are right.
They were in line before us.
- Nonsense.

867
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:18,029
Please, this way. Come in.

868
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:26,912
When I saw you in the office I couldn't resist.

869
01:00:26,997 --> 01:00:29,790
They say that power is an aphrodisiac.

870
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:36,172
- And who is she?
- My best friend.

871
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:41,052
I promised her
you'd have sex with her after me.

872
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:44,138
This will be one of the happiest days of her life.

873
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:47,183
You know, he's worried
because he is married.

874
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:53,689
Mr. Pisanello, for you rules do not count.
You're special.

875
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:58,148
Yes, yes, I... I...
I agree with you completely.

876
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:03,176
I mean, this first time I read The Myth
of Sisyphus, my whole life changed.

877
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:05,656
- Yes, yes.
- And, of course, the Russians.

878
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:07,424
Dostoevsky, thank you.

879
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:09,426
Stavrogin's Confession?

880
01:01:09,441 --> 01:01:10,261
And Kierkegaard.

881
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:12,525
I mean, you can feel his pain.

882
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:15,122
Didn't you say that Rilke
was your favorite author?

883
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:19,765
Ah, Rilke!
"You must change your life."

884
01:01:19,966 --> 01:01:22,220
Or was it Ezra Pound?

885
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,872
"Petals on a wet black bough."

886
01:01:25,912 --> 01:01:29,901
Look at this. She knows one line from
every poet just enough to fake it.

887
01:01:29,914 --> 01:01:32,478
I have such a great idea:

888
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:37,124
Tonight, after they're closed,
we should sneak into the old Roman baths.

889
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,470
Sneak in?

890
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,643
- Leo, you know a way, right?
- Yeah.

891
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:42,087
He knows a way in.

892
01:01:42,104 --> 01:01:44,836
Well, it'll be dark, it'll be spooky,
it'll be fun.

893
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:48,151
You know what? Jack doesn't
do spooky. Believe me.

894
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:52,225
I love entering places illegally. So...

895
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:55,961
No, I mean... Sure, I mean, I don't wanna...
I don't wanna a spoilsport.

896
01:01:55,994 --> 01:01:59,892
First it's Camus and Kierkegaard,
and now I've run out of name dropping,

897
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:03,604
so let's break into some baths. Pretty soon,
she'll have you holding up filling stations.

898
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:07,564
I understand from where you sit
it sounds crazy, but from where I sit...

899
01:02:10,637 --> 01:02:13,944
Oh... Oh, isn't this great?

900
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:15,970
My God, I can't believe we snuck in here.

901
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:18,427
- I've never seen it at night before.
- Yeah.

902
01:02:18,442 --> 01:02:19,991
It's amazing. How're you doing?

903
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:22,385
I'm fine... I'm fine. I'm just...
It looks like it's gonna rain, doesn't it?

904
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,457
- He can't break any rules.
- Wow... wow! OK! That was lightening!

905
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:27,549
- Hey, guys, come on! Let's go!
- Are you afraid? Come on!

906
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:29,488
Well, I'm not afraid.
We're just sitting ducks here. Come on!

907
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,680
- Unbelievable!
- OK, let's go back to the car.

908
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,358
- OK, now it's definitely raining.

909
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:40,074
- Just a little though.
- We have to go. We have to come out.

910
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:41,790
Sally! Sally, come on!

911
01:02:42,213 --> 01:02:44,068
Here! Here, Monica! Here, Monica!

912
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,154
- Sally!

913
01:02:46,214 --> 01:02:49,006
- Come on! Ah!
- Monica!

914
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,752
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Wow! Yeah.

915
01:02:53,763 --> 01:02:59,059
- It's a little loud. Huh! OK.
- That means it's close. It's very close.

916
01:02:59,102 --> 01:03:01,979
Actually I went to school where was
a boy who... who got killed by lightening.

917
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:03,270
Do you hate it?

918
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,355
No, no, I mean, I didn't
mean to imply that I hate it.

919
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,851
I just think the storms are so romantic!

920
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:17,012
You know... you're actually...
You're really beautiful... although wet.

921
01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:22,350
- Ah, you're so sweet to say that.
- No...no, really. You do.

922
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,655
You know, I just, I... I love it here.

923
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:29,539
I mean, I... I... think Rome
is so charismatic!

924
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:32,056
Oh, God! Here comes the bullshit!

925
01:03:32,068 --> 01:03:35,072
Will you keep out of the goddamn scene,
and lemme have a moment alone with her?

926
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:39,755
OK, I will allow you your moment,
but remember, I know how it turns out.

927
01:03:39,855 --> 01:03:43,338
I feel like I have completely
fallen in love with Rome,

928
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:46,401
just this little while that I've been here.

929
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:50,901
I feel like I... I could spend my whole
life here and just never go back.

930
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:54,258
I'm sure... I'm sure meeting Leonardo
has a lot to do with that.

931
01:03:54,502 --> 01:03:56,344
- Oh! Oh, my God!

932
01:03:56,841 --> 01:03:59,819
- Oh, that one scared me.
- Yeah...

933
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:03,842
If we die, we die together.

934
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:37,619
Love forbids you not love.

935
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:54,130
That you would slight me I reject.

936
01:05:54,551 --> 01:06:10,746
When I hold your hand,

937
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:26,530
your eyes say, "I love you"

938
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:46,341
if your lips say, "I will love you!"

939
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:07,276
You were absolutely fabulous.
This guy created a sensation today.

940
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,842
I... I see a big future here.

941
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:10,863
What does this "future" mean?

942
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,861
Well... I see New York,
I see the Vienna Opera House,

943
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:16,499
- I see Paris...
- All in the shower?

944
01:07:16,528 --> 01:07:19,154
Yes, they love it that he sings in the shower.

945
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,768
They... they identify.

946
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:23,924
You know, he's gonna be the most
popular opera singer in the world.

947
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:25,316
Certainly the cleanest.

948
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:27,616
You don't want to really take
this further, do you, Dad?

949
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:28,539
Why not?

950
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:33,614
Yes, I've got big plans for him. I...
I wanna do now a production of Pagliacci.

951
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:36,219
You father was born to sing that role.

952
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,034
This is decadent stupidity!

953
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:40,550
My whole life has seen that role
while I'm in the bathroom.

954
01:07:40,565 --> 01:07:45,000
He wanted to do this his entire life.
You're gonna deny your father his shot?

955
01:07:45,013 --> 01:07:46,432
It's your shot, not his!

956
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,680
I resent your tone with my father.

957
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,514
I happen to think out of the box.

958
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:54,602
Oh, well, the box! That's a
very interesting choice of words.

959
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:59,063
Listen to me: You're retired.
You equate retirement with death.

960
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:03,009
Giancarlo's an undertaker.
He puts people in boxes,

961
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:05,338
but you want to think "out of the box".

962
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:09,539
It's true. If you're channeling Freud,
ask for my money back.

963
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,050
What  "Pagliacci"?! What plans?
What airplane?!

964
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:16,000
Where do you want to take my husband?!

965
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:18,242
I... I failed high school Spanish.
I really don't...

966
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
This is crazy! What does he say?!

967
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,000
They already took away your son.
Now he wants to take away you too!

968
01:08:26,364 --> 01:08:27,800
He's gonna be a big star, big opera star.

969
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Star? But you cannot sing!
It's not true!

970
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,000
He sings only in the shower!
No, he cannot sing! No!

971
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
- Enough, enough...
- I'll kill him! It will make me feel better.

972
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,767
- Oh! No!
- Hold it!

973
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:44,841
Hold it! Hold it! Interpose yourself!
Right... right. Great, go ahead!

974
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:46,408
She... she probably won't stab a woman.

975
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,774
- No!
- Go ahead! Go a...

976
01:08:47,786 --> 01:08:50,872
- Calm, Calm! Relax, relax!
- What?! What?!

977
01:08:50,888 --> 01:08:53,330
You have an attitude problem.
Put the knife down.

978
01:08:53,348 --> 01:08:56,702
We're... This is gonna be our...
our mother-in-law here?

979
01:08:57,756 --> 01:08:59,800
We want to introduce you to some people.

980
01:08:59,884 --> 01:09:02,761
Mr. Massucci, the administrator of your company

981
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,389
has organized this festival to welcome you.

982
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:11,770
It 's an opportunity to learn about the
top business people in Rome.

983
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:15,691
He spoke very highly of you
and we are eager to meet you.

984
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:20,654
It would be a nice chance for your wife
to make a good impression too.
- Oh, sure.

985
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:24,533
- Don't drink too much, honey.
-I'd better have a coffee.

986
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:27,786
- Does anybody want a drink?
- No. - Coffee? - No.

987
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:31,290
Look who's here! Come on.
I want to introduce my nephew.

988
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:35,085
- Good morning! Thank you. Beautiful party.
- Meet Antonio.

989
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:40,841
Pleasure. So, here's the famous nephew.
I've heard such great things about you.

990
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:44,428
You have the perfect image for our community,

991
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:47,598
and image is very important to us.

992
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:51,351
- Do you follow football?
- No.

993
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:59,109
- Is that you?
- Yes.

994
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:02,613
- What are you doing here, Anna?
- Milly!

995
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:04,823
My wife...

996
01:10:04,824 --> 01:10:09,870
- Hello, how are you? - Well, thank you.
- Pleasure. - All mine. - Milly.

997
01:10:09,954 --> 01:10:15,000
- We have to go. - Yes - Sorry.
- Hello. Coffee? Thank you.

998
01:10:19,505 --> 01:10:21,506
Coffee with milk, please.

999
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:26,261
- Anna!
- Hello!

1000
01:10:26,262 --> 01:10:30,265
- Milly. - Since when?
- I'm Milly. - Ok.

1001
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:34,353
- There's my wife.
- Do not worry, do not worry.

1002
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:41,235
- I was just going to call you.
How about Tuesday? - Usual hours?

1003
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:43,862
- Anna!
- Oh God!

1004
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:48,158
- Oh, Lady! Hello.
I did not expect to meet you here. - I am Milly.

1005
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:50,285
Ah, Milly? Anyways, Milly,

1006
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:53,747
can you come by my office
tomorrow at about three?

1007
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,916
- I don't know, I have plans.
- Okay, I get it.

1008
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,001
Well, if you feel like it, come by at about 3:00.

1009
01:10:58,044 --> 01:11:02,381
- I recommend wearing the black bra...
- Yes - The thong... - Yes

1010
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:05,676
- But do you go sailing?
- No.

1011
01:11:05,677 --> 01:11:08,679
- Hunting?
- No.

1012
01:11:10,014 --> 01:11:14,393
- Anna, how are you? - How are you all right!
- Milly. Milly, Milly.

1013
01:11:15,812 --> 01:11:19,564
I'm so nervous!
I can't afford to make a fool of myself.

1014
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:22,943
The most important men in Rome are here.
- Yes, the "cream of the cream".

1015
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:26,905
- It 's the whole list of my clients.
- I'm so nervous...

1016
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:30,784
You're too tense, my friend.
Relax or you'll have a heart attack.

1017
01:11:30,827 --> 01:11:33,787
How can I relax when my
life is falling apart!

1018
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,957
How does your wife put up with you if
you're always so nervous?

1019
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:39,209
Because she loves me for who I am.

1020
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:44,298
- And who is she ... smooching with that
Luchino actor ... what's his name?
- Salta.

1021
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,425
- What smooching?!
- You know.

1022
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:48,844
You said that they only held hands.

1023
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:51,722
No, there must be an explanation, because
for me Milly is like the Madonna.

1024
01:11:51,806 --> 01:11:56,977
The explanation is simple:
He's a movie star, a sex symbol.

1025
01:11:57,061 --> 01:12:00,230
And Milly is beautiful and has never looked
at another man.

1026
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:02,858
But women don't always know themselves.

1027
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:07,112
Especially those who have a hysterical husband
who fears his own shadow.

1028
01:12:07,196 --> 01:12:11,742
Why the hell does he have to smooch
if he seduces with his eyes?

1029
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:15,120
You probably couldn't seduce a woman with your eyes.

1030
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:20,375
I want this job, but
I look like a small minded idiot.

1031
01:12:20,376 --> 01:12:23,503
Was your wife a virgin when you married?

1032
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:27,966
- None of your business.
- I bet she was, yes.

1033
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:32,971
- We did wild things together.
- What do you mean by "wild things"?

1034
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:35,015
Having sex with the lights on?

1035
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:39,853
Believe me, I was not a virgin.
Okay, I was a virgin.

1036
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:46,526
- You need a lesson!
- By whom? Certainly not from you.

1037
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:51,031
And why not?
Everything is already paid for. It 's free.

1038
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:54,034
- But there are people around.
- I don't see anyone.

1039
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,460
- Don't let me forget the carrots.
- OK.

1040
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:06,445
- You really need all this pasta?
- Yeah, I think we need more pasta.

1041
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:08,675
More pasta? We're not
cooking for a small village.

1042
01:13:08,697 --> 01:13:10,200
- Tomatoes.
- OK.

1043
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:13,686
- Whose idea was this enterprise?
- Uh... it was hers. It was Monica's.

1044
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:15,028
We all agreed to have dinner together.

1045
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,829
Since Leonardo's at work all day,
and Sally's at school,

1046
01:13:17,847 --> 01:13:19,259
Monica suggested we do the cooking.

1047
01:13:19,273 --> 01:13:21,105
- Can I make a prediction?
- What?

1048
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,935
- She can't cook.
- Apparently, there are some things she can cook.

1049
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:28,099
- Like what?
- Like chocolate brownies.

1050
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:31,360
Brownies? You're going to have
brownies as the main course?

1051
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,600
Yeah... yeah, I think it should be fun.

1052
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,730
- Do you think it needs more wine?
- Hmm, no...

1053
01:13:38,845 --> 01:13:41,294
I mean, I know the Italians
cook with a lot of...

1054
01:13:41,306 --> 01:13:42,254
There's a lot wine in here.
I can really feel it.

1055
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:44,749
I don't know, it's... you know,
I think it might be the French.

1056
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:45,229
No, let me see...

1057
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:48,666
- I just... I don't want it to be too subtle.
- No, it's definitely not subtle.

1058
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,414
- Can I taste it?
- Yeah, of course, please.

1059
01:13:50,436 --> 01:13:52,897
Hmm... You know, I think it needs...

1060
01:13:52,908 --> 01:13:55,503
You know, I'll get some...
that other wine, that's there.

1061
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,441
The other wine? Are you sure?
We've already finished this one.

1062
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:58,859
- Uh...
- OK.

1063
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:00,551
Oh, oh, we have to put the brownies in.

1064
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,416
- Can you bake?
- Can I bake? You said you bake.

1065
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:07,350
Well, no. I can't... I have... I just...
I left the, um... recipe in Los Angeles.

1066
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:10,436
But, you know, I'll do it. I can do it by
memory. I'm sure I can do it by memory.

1067
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:12,011
Hey, you wanna just
order from a restaurant,

1068
01:14:12,025 --> 01:14:15,171
and maybe dirty up the kitchen
a little bit, and say we cooked it?

1069
01:14:15,186 --> 01:14:17,170
Well... Yeah, let me check this sauce.

1070
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,268
Yeah, you know what?
I'm gonna check it too, actually.

1071
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:21,770
Oh, do you want, um...
penne or rigatoni?

1072
01:14:21,786 --> 01:14:24,481
Don't put the pasta in now.
They're not gonna be home for hours.

1073
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:27,724
- Hmm... What?
- I think I'm a little drunk.

1074
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:28,743
- Really?
- Yeah.

1075
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:29,633
We can just... We can fake it.

1076
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:31,509
- Yeah, I'm... I'm done with this.
- Good.

1077
01:14:31,524 --> 01:14:33,051
- I'm done with the cooking.
- OK.

1078
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:36,037
I just... I promised Leonardo that
I'd make a really great dinner.

1079
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:39,630
Yeah... You know, I'm so... I'm so glad
that worked out between you and Leonardo.

1080
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:43,030
Really. Because, you know,
I'm the one that got you together.

1081
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:46,710
Yeah, I mean, he, uh... he's nice.

1082
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:49,981
Sexy. I think you told Sally.

1083
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:53,084
Hmm... hmm...

1084
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:59,650
You know, I... Look, this is...
this is the wine talking.

1085
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:06,542
He's not the most soulful character,
and he's not, um... he's not a sufferer.

1086
01:15:06,648 --> 01:15:08,649
What's... what's so great about suffering?

1087
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:16,018
Well, I just... There's something attractive about
a man who's sensitive to the agonies of existence.

1088
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:23,942
God, you would... you would be perfect
to play Miss Julie? The Strindberg play?

1089
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:27,975
The Miss Julie tactic, I learned it from
a friend of mine, who's a theater director.

1090
01:15:27,985 --> 01:15:30,633
Tell any actress who would be
perfect for the role of Miss Julie,

1091
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:34,387
- and you could have your way with her.
- Just so amazed that you would say that.

1092
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:39,149
I mean, Miss Julie is... is the role
that I was born to play.

1093
01:15:39,162 --> 01:15:42,812
She is me!
How could you know that?

1094
01:15:42,836 --> 01:15:46,594
I have... a kind of non sequitur
question to ask you now?

1095
01:15:47,386 --> 01:15:48,572
What?

1096
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:52,508
How would you feel if I kissed you?

1097
01:15:54,615 --> 01:15:59,270
Oh, um... That is a non sequitur.

1098
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,902
Our little miss shocked.

1099
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:03,911
Didn't you see that
two minutes ago she popped tic-tac.

1100
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:04,968
What do you think that's about?

1101
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,604
I'm serious. I'm serious.
What... what would you think?

1102
01:16:09,726 --> 01:16:12,695
I would think that you're living
with my best friend.

1103
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:18,219
Yeah, this is true.
And yet, I can't stop myself.

1104
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:26,019
- Oh, that's not good!
- Why? You didn't like it?

1105
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:29,842
No, I... I liked it,
and that's what's not... good.

1106
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:32,583
And you? Will you ever recover from it?

1107
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:36,744
No, no, she's... she's perfect. I mean,
this is... this is too good to be true.

1108
01:16:36,756 --> 01:16:40,609
If something is too good to be true,
you can bet it's not.

1109
01:16:41,414 --> 01:16:43,116
I have to have her.

1110
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:52,917
What are we gonna do about this?

1111
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:56,628
Are you acting?
Was it a performance?

1112
01:16:56,851 --> 01:16:59,286
I can't do this to Sally in her home.

1113
01:16:59,304 --> 01:17:02,488
No... no, it's OK. It's OK, trust me.
She... she won't be home for hours.

1114
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:04,984
- No, I just mean I...
- What?

1115
01:17:05,181 --> 01:17:07,246
I don't wanna do it here.

1116
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,126
For Christ's sakes, what is all this posturing about?

1117
01:17:10,137 --> 01:17:14,363
If you're gonna screw your best friend's boyfriend,
does it really matter what the venue is?

1118
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:17,656
- You will never understand woman.
- That's been proven.

1119
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:21,465
This is not gonna be some ongoing
affair behind Sally's back, right?

1120
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:25,490
This is one rainy afternoon,
I'm a little bit drunk...

1121
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:31,922
And yeah, I'm... I'm turned on by you,
but... just not here, not in her home.

1122
01:17:31,935 --> 01:17:34,470
OK. Look, the time for debating
is... is long passed.

1123
01:17:34,482 --> 01:17:36,556
Let's go down to the car.

1124
01:17:37,128 --> 01:17:41,411
Well, the car is different.
You can fuck me in the car.
I'm fine with that.

1125
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:52,082
Smile! Smile!

1126
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:57,712
My God, you cannot!

1127
01:17:57,713 --> 01:17:59,839
my cousin!

1128
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,052
We met by chance.
I don't have anything to say, nothing. Come on.

1129
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:06,596
Nothing, nothing! Please...

1130
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,849
We met by chance!

1131
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:13,061
I was waiting for my wife.

1132
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:33,498
Be respectful
at least for the procession.

1133
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:46,886
Roberto, I can't take it anymore.
Why me, Roberto?

1134
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:51,516
- What's going on?
- Sir, you must face it.

1135
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:55,895
- You are very, very famous.
- But why?!

1136
01:18:55,896 --> 01:19:00,275
- Look at this, the pills...
This morning it was full.
- Ah. - mama Mia!

1137
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:06,865
- Why am I famous?
- Why? You are famous for being famous.

1138
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:09,659
But I haven't done anything, Roberto.

1139
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:15,415
Excuse me, but, as I see it,
don't all those who are famous deserve it?

1140
01:19:15,499 --> 01:19:18,752
I don't know! You can see that!
You ask for my opinion?

1141
01:19:18,794 --> 01:19:21,796
Everyone's asking for my opinion.
I do not know!

1142
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:24,924
All I do is answer questions.
My life is a living hell!

1143
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:28,136
A journalist asked me two days ago if there is a God.

1144
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:30,555
I said, "What do I know? I don't know,"
and she was upset.

1145
01:19:30,556 --> 01:19:34,559
"Mr. Pisanello doesn't know if there is a God"
And I do not know!

1146
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:37,312
Everyone asks me things...
"Pisanello"

1147
01:19:37,313 --> 01:19:40,565
"How do you scratch your head?
With the right or the left?"

1148
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:42,650
"With both hands."
"Oh, he scratches with both!"

1149
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:46,780
There! I scratch my head with
whatever hand I think is best. Okay?

1150
01:19:46,822 --> 01:19:52,952
Some secret! - The way I see it, sir,
I kind of agree with them.

1151
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:58,458
Being a celebrity,
excitement, special privileges...

1152
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:03,463
.. The adoring crowds who want an autograph,
every woman's dream.

1153
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:07,217
Women! But you do not know...
"I love him!" They kneel!

1154
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:10,094
"Ah, Pisanello! How beautiful!
He's so beautiful!"

1155
01:20:10,095 --> 01:20:13,223
They all want to be in bed with me...
in threes, fours...

1156
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:15,308
I have enough problems with two...

1157
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:20,188
The wife of a man of your caliber
knows he has to be shared with the public.

1158
01:20:20,231 --> 01:20:22,732
It's not normal...
Don't interrupt me...

1159
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:26,486
Can't I speak to someone without being interrupted...

1160
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:28,696
Enough!

1161
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:33,451
Take me home! Enough!
I'll report you for violation of privacy!

1162
01:20:33,494 --> 01:20:36,830
You are heartless!

1163
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:41,125
Bravo!
You're better than I had imagined.

1164
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:44,963
- Why are you so quiet?
- Because I have committed adultery.

1165
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:47,757
Consider it part of your training.

1166
01:20:47,758 --> 01:20:50,468
We did some things I've never done before.
Never.

1167
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:55,223
- Why not?
- Because of Milly. They would upset her.

1168
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:59,727
But with me you had no problem.
Is it because I'm a prostitute?

1169
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:03,898
With you I felt uninhibited.
But now I feel guilty.

1170
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:07,235
Milly would never commit adultery.
She would never betray me.

1171
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:09,404
Maybe she wouldn't mind
that you learned something.

1172
01:21:09,405 --> 01:21:13,408
Some things I can't do with Milly.
She's like a saint.

1173
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:17,996
Yes, like Madonna.
Only where is Saint Milly?

1174
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:21,916
You were the virgin at the wedding, not her.

1175
01:21:27,923 --> 01:21:33,052
- Like this?
- It 's beautiful here!

1176
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:36,556
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks, I cannot.

1177
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,018
But why not?

1178
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:45,648
- Here.
- Thank you.

1179
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:51,279
I love the old songs,
those of my childhood.

1180
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:55,825
- they are very beautiful.
- when I once danced.

1181
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:58,453
Eh, yes?

1182
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:05,460
- Eh? - You are very good.
- Yes, so are you...

1183
01:22:08,213 --> 01:22:10,340
Ma ..  didn't you want to talk?

1184
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:15,595
- Nostalgia is my weakness.
- Memories are so beautiful.

1185
01:22:17,598 --> 01:22:20,183
Did anyone ever tell you
that you're beautiful?

1186
01:22:20,225 --> 01:22:27,190
It is not true, no. My husband maybe
once but never a movie actor.

1187
01:22:27,232 --> 01:22:31,235
Please don't think of me as an actor,
I am a human being like everyone else...

1188
01:22:31,236 --> 01:22:35,865
.. with the same feelings, the same
vulnerabilities, the same desires.

1189
01:22:35,866 --> 01:22:41,871
I'm sorry,...
when you kiss those beautiful women in the cinema...

1190
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:46,250
.. You seem to me, how should I say...
A crazy man.

1191
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:50,380
A kiss is just fiction on film.

1192
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:54,384
Yes, I know, but I've always wondered

1193
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:59,097
.. I wondered what it would be like
kissing Luke Salta.

1194
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:04,143
Now you know.

1195
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,773
- That was beautiful! - Wonderful?
- No, no more.

1196
01:23:08,774 --> 01:23:12,527
- Wait.  Now we take a nap.
- What? A nap?

1197
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:14,654
Well, at this point
I can't go back.

1198
01:23:14,738 --> 01:23:22,036
- You're so charming.
- No, no, no, no. What a mess!

1199
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:25,915
- I don't see the problem.
- Yes there is a problem.

1200
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:28,502
I would love to make love with you...

1201
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:33,297
.. So I could tell my grandchildren something,
but I can't commit adultery.

1202
01:23:33,298 --> 01:23:35,299
Forget the semantics...

1203
01:23:37,928 --> 01:23:40,054
I love all of you.

1204
01:23:40,055 --> 01:23:45,059
My Lady, I don't know what to do.
I do not know what to do.

1205
01:23:45,144 --> 01:23:50,064
I love my husband, but I am so curious.

1206
01:23:50,065 --> 01:23:54,277
Life is so short, there are certain moments
already written in destiny.

1207
01:23:54,319 --> 01:24:00,658
- This is one of those moments.
- No, wait a moment, please.
I must go to the bathroom.

1208
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:04,912
Don't move. Don'tt move from there.
Do not go.

1209
01:24:28,743 --> 01:24:30,670
I swore we wouldn't do this.

1210
01:24:30,878 --> 01:24:35,473
I know... I know, I know. Me, neither.
I, uh... I have to tell Sally.

1211
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:39,629
But you said your relationship was winding
down, I mean, this cannot be because of me.

1212
01:24:39,653 --> 01:24:44,014
No... no, don't say that!
No... no, it is, it is. It's winding down.

1213
01:24:46,605 --> 01:24:51,589
I... I had fantasies yesterday
of us being together.

1214
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:52,965
Really?

1215
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:56,210
Exploring Italy, and...

1216
01:24:57,099 --> 01:25:03,176
looking at all the great architecture
of Milan and Venice and Naples.

1217
01:25:04,858 --> 01:25:07,993
- You could teach me.
- I'm a good teacher.

1218
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:17,956
We could stay in little towns
in bed-and-breakfasts.

1219
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:22,545
Listen, Sally's taking her exams
next week at the university, I just...

1220
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:24,341
I just don't wanna bring this
to her before then.

1221
01:25:24,357 --> 01:25:25,415
No, of course.

1222
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:29,784
Yeah, but right after, right after.
I... I love you.

1223
01:25:45,514 --> 01:25:47,765
Okay.

1224
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:55,439
Who is that?
He seems interesting!

1225
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:04,323
We're on the road with Aldo Romano.
It is true that you are a bus driver?

1226
01:26:04,324 --> 01:26:06,659
What do you want? I don't understand?

1227
01:26:06,702 --> 01:26:10,329
- It 's true that you bring your clothes to the laundry?
- Yes, but what do you want?

1228
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:13,708
- Do you like hamburger?
- No, I don't like it.

1229
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:17,170
- Is that a stain on the jacket?
- Yes, it's marinara sauce.

1230
01:26:17,212 --> 01:26:20,715
- How did this happen?
- Do I have to tell everyone?

1231
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:25,970
I was eating a plate of rigatoni.
Why does it matter to you?

1232
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:45,823
- Gabriel, Camilla, Sofia.
- Hello, Dad! - Hello! - Hello!

1233
01:26:45,824 --> 01:26:48,576
You know it's all over?

1234
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:51,871
It's back to business as usual.
I'm so happy!

1235
01:26:51,872 --> 01:26:54,749
Now Aldo Romano is all over the news.

1236
01:26:54,833 --> 01:27:00,213
To celebrate we'll go get a pizza in Velletri.
I'm buying.

1237
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:03,007
- Who is it?
- Aldo Romano.

1238
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,338
- I think I did really well on the exams.
- Of course, you did.

1239
01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:10,661
Yeah, you sailed through it,
because you studied hard enough.

1240
01:27:10,674 --> 01:27:11,917
I worked hard.

1241
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,483
Yeah, you did. She doubts herself
for no reason, I don't know why.

1242
01:27:14,499 --> 01:27:16,816
- Do you guys want something else?
- Uh...

1243
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:18,179
- Sure. No!
- No.

1244
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:20,659
Oh, OK. Alright, well...

1245
01:27:21,677 --> 01:27:23,050
OK.

1246
01:27:25,686 --> 01:27:27,875
You see how confident she is?

1247
01:27:27,893 --> 01:27:31,360
So I'm gonna... I'm gonna take her to dinner,
and I'm gonna tell her tonight.

1248
01:27:31,387 --> 01:27:33,240
- OK. Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1249
01:27:33,256 --> 01:27:35,217
In fact, I planned out an
amazing trip for us.

1250
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:37,865
Believe it or not, I've never been
to the Acropolis or the Parthenon.

1251
01:27:37,884 --> 01:27:39,976
- Can we go to Sicily?
- Yeah, of course. You know what?

1252
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:42,181
Actually, we could... we could hire a
sailboat and go around the boot,

1253
01:27:42,199 --> 01:27:43,848
- if you want to.
- I've always seen pictures of Palermo,

1254
01:27:43,867 --> 01:27:46,559
- I just think it is so romantic.
- Well... you can see pictures compared...

1255
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:49,322
...to nothing to being there,
in the real place. We...

1256
01:27:49,629 --> 01:27:51,847
- If you wanna... Yeah, sure.
- Excuse me.

1257
01:27:52,374 --> 01:27:53,416
Hello?

1258
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:55,542
No, I can't... Hello?

1259
01:27:56,258 --> 01:27:58,168
- OK, I'm gonna see if I can...
- Sure.

1260
01:27:58,253 --> 01:27:59,541
Hello?

1261
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:06,885
- It's sad.
- What is?

1262
01:28:07,466 --> 01:28:09,731
That you're in love with Monica.

1263
01:28:09,766 --> 01:28:11,854
I just... something about her.

1264
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:14,880
- You know that Sally's in love with you, right?
- I know.

1265
01:28:15,303 --> 01:28:18,819
And your common sense tells you that
Sally is the much more sensible choice.

1266
01:28:18,831 --> 01:28:22,131
Yeah, I know.
I know all of that, and yet...

1267
01:28:22,286 --> 01:28:25,571
- I can't explain it.
- I understand.

1268
01:28:26,555 --> 01:28:27,682
- Guess what?
- What?

1269
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,560
- I got a part.
- A part?

1270
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:30,901
I get a part...

1271
01:28:30,918 --> 01:28:34,780
...in a movie. It's a high budget,
it shoots in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

1272
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:36,703
- But where?
- I have to leave tonight.

1273
01:28:36,717 --> 01:28:38,739
What was that about sailboat and Sicily?

1274
01:28:38,755 --> 01:28:42,333
- They need me for like five months.
- Five months in Japan?

1275
01:28:42,354 --> 01:28:44,964
Uh... one month in Los Angeles,
four in Japan.

1276
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:47,108
I mean, assuming it all goes on time.

1277
01:28:47,164 --> 01:28:49,143
Oh, I cannot wait to go!

1278
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,891
I mean, it is like my dream and life
to spend time in the far east.

1279
01:28:52,905 --> 01:28:55,154
- That's your dream?
- Who's in it?

1280
01:28:55,174 --> 01:28:57,808
Justin Brill, Ricardo Ramirez...

1281
01:28:57,827 --> 01:28:59,946
Ricardo Ramirez?
He's a very attractive man.

1282
01:28:59,982 --> 01:29:03,250
And I worked with Justin Brill before,
like when he was married to Rebecca Wright,

1283
01:29:03,261 --> 01:29:08,049
- and he had this big mad crush on me.
- Well, he's available now.

1284
01:29:08,072 --> 01:29:10,080
This is so exciting!

1285
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:13,849
I can't wait to get back to Los Angeles,
see my acting coach.

1286
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:16,920
I mean, no matter what it is like to
visit a place, there's nothing like home.

1287
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:19,267
- Who's the directing?
- Max Trommel.

1288
01:29:19,282 --> 01:29:22,342
I... adore him.
I adore his work.

1289
01:29:22,355 --> 01:29:24,843
And you know what?
He's like the only director...

1290
01:29:24,852 --> 01:29:27,547
...that I would trust to direct
the nude scenes that I have to do?

1291
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,834
And although, I mean he does a lot of drugs,

1292
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:35,923
and somehow, that burnt-out look is
just so... it's just so sexy on him.

1293
01:29:37,142 --> 01:29:38,841
I have to lose some weight.

1294
01:29:39,162 --> 01:29:45,867
I mean, the writer saw me on that TV thing,
and he just... he flipped out over my quality.

1295
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,342
I'm like five pounds or so. . .

1296
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:49,845
"I'll just start running again.
I'll start running again."

1297
01:29:49,964 --> 01:29:53,965
This part is such a great show case for me.

1298
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,973
I... I just hope I can bring my dog.

1299
01:29:55,993 --> 01:29:59,205
I hope it's not like London
where it's so hard to bring a pet.

1300
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,186
Milly Stay calm, stay calm.

1301
01:30:02,187 --> 01:30:05,064
Is it better to go to bed and have a regret...

1302
01:30:05,148 --> 01:30:09,068
or just leave and have a regret for life?

1303
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:13,072
What shall I do? Better remorse, no?

1304
01:30:13,156 --> 01:30:17,326
Better remorse, absolutely.

1305
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:28,295
- Yes, better remorse.
- Shut up.
- What?
- Shut up or I'll kill you.

1306
01:30:30,215 --> 01:30:35,719
Now open the door and let's go.
Not a word.

1307
01:30:36,972 --> 01:30:40,975
- Are you ready love?
- Don't even open your mouth.

1308
01:30:41,059 --> 01:30:44,979
If you do what I say
it will be okay.

1309
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:48,983
- Got it?
- Yes
- Then give me your money and jewelry.

1310
01:30:49,067 --> 01:30:54,447
- You know who I am?
- No, I don't and I don't give a damn.

1311
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,367
- Shut up and stop crying.
- Here.

1312
01:30:58,368 --> 01:31:03,122
- Give me your wallet.
- But don't get up.

1313
01:31:03,206 --> 01:31:07,126
- Give me your watch. - Yes
- The watch. - Yes

1314
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:09,628
Open up.

1315
01:31:09,713 --> 01:31:14,633
Open up, I am in charge of hotel security.

1316
01:31:14,718 --> 01:31:17,011
Open up, Luke! I know you're there.

1317
01:31:17,012 --> 01:31:21,640
- My wife! That's my wife.
- Your wife?
- Yes

1318
01:31:21,725 --> 01:31:25,227
- But you said you were separated!
- Oh, what a fool!

1319
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,106
- I do not want to end up like the other woman
in the paper.
- I'm finished.

1320
01:31:29,107 --> 01:31:31,484
Oh...

1321
01:31:31,526 --> 01:31:35,279
Listen to me.
Let's do this... you're not finished yet.

1322
01:31:35,363 --> 01:31:39,033
Let's do this. Go to the
bathroom and hide in the shower.

1323
01:31:39,034 --> 01:31:42,745
- I'll put her in bed.
- Yes
- Go and shut the door.

1324
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:47,041
- Together.
- Yes, good.
- Close the door. . . .Go to bed.

1325
01:31:47,876 --> 01:31:50,127
Open up!

1326
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:56,175
- Now sir, explain why you didn't open the door.
- Come on.

1327
01:31:56,176 --> 01:31:59,011
- Come near the bed.
- Didn't you hear me knocking?

1328
01:31:59,054 --> 01:32:03,307
- What's going on? Are you crazy?
- Didn't you hear?

1329
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:07,186
Didn't I hear what?
I'm here with my girlfriend and I was...

1330
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,438
He is not the woman's husband?

1331
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:12,816
- We didn't know!
- She said it was her husband.

1332
01:32:12,817 --> 01:32:16,570
You're all crazy! I will sue!

1333
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:19,573
Please forgive us and please excuse us.
What have you done?

1334
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:25,829
I do not understand what is happening.

1335
01:32:25,914 --> 01:32:28,207
- It was not my fault.
- Leave.

1336
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:32,169
- Look, this was not my fault.
- Madam, be patient!

1337
01:32:32,212 --> 01:32:38,050
- I'm sorry. - I'll call lawyers.
- Sorry.

1338
01:32:38,426 --> 01:32:42,179
- Anyway, I...
- Come, madam. Thank you.

1339
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:47,726
- It shouldn't have to end like this.
I don't know what happened...
- Take it easy, ma'am.

1340
01:32:50,188 --> 01:32:52,856
- But...
- Enough!

1341
01:32:54,442 --> 01:32:56,735
- Thank you. A million thanks.
- Imagine.

1342
01:32:56,736 --> 01:33:00,447
I take my leave now.

1343
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:06,328
In fact, here is the watch.
I'll also give you my ring. Take it all.

1344
01:33:06,371 --> 01:33:08,706
- Thank you. Really, thanks.
- Thank you.

1345
01:33:08,748 --> 01:33:12,876
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye.

1346
01:33:12,961 --> 01:33:15,379
I can't believe it.

1347
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:24,263
Of course... right,
you're really cute.

1348
01:33:24,264 --> 01:33:28,517
- What?
- He's right, you're pretty.

1349
01:33:28,602 --> 01:33:34,898
Thank you. Ma .. you are a thief, right?

1350
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:40,904
Yes, I'm a thief specializing in hotels.

1351
01:33:40,905 --> 01:33:45,534
- But I also do some mugging.
- Oh yeah?

1352
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:51,290
- Ah. Exciting.
- You're exciting.

1353
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:58,797
You know I've never made love with a criminal.

1354
01:33:58,798 --> 01:34:04,011
- My husband is a businessman, very respectable.
- Yes?
- Yes

1355
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:11,310
You know what they say:
Opportunity makes one a thief.
Shall we take this opportunity?

1356
01:34:11,394 --> 01:34:16,065
- Sure. - Of course.
- We are in a hotel room.

1357
01:34:16,066 --> 01:34:22,071
- We're in bed, you're in your underwear.
- I'm already undressed.

1358
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:25,282
- So. - So what?
- So, anyway...

1359
01:34:40,035 --> 01:34:42,572
I guess I'll never hear from Monica again.

1360
01:34:42,615 --> 01:34:45,243
Yes, but you can read her about
in the gossip columns...

1361
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:49,639
...dating Justin Brill,
vacationing in his Aspen lodge.

1362
01:34:49,996 --> 01:34:53,032
Consider yourself lucky.
You saved your own life there.

1363
01:34:53,082 --> 01:34:59,498
A year with her, she would let you freefall
parachuting and adopting Burmese orphans.

1364
01:34:59,651 --> 01:35:04,216
- With age comes wisdom.
- With age comes exhaustion.

1365
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,797
- Look, here is where we first met.
- Yeah.

1366
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:09,117
I should be getting back
to the Excelsior.

1367
01:35:09,129 --> 01:35:11,556
Oh, it's a nice hotel.
Obviously you're doing well.

1368
01:35:11,705 --> 01:35:17,264
- There's a lot of dough in shopping malls.
- You sold out.

1369
01:35:17,419 --> 01:35:20,857
As a foolish man once said,
"Stuff happens."

1370
01:35:21,818 --> 01:35:24,578
- I'll leave you here.

1371
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:25,952
Goodbye.

1372
01:35:47,532 --> 01:35:50,159
How nice!

1373
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:56,165
Tonight there's a film preview.

1374
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:59,501
We can go without casino
and enjoy the film.

1375
01:35:59,544 --> 01:36:02,880
We can't be out there posing for journalists.

1376
01:36:05,925 --> 01:36:10,387
- Look, we were not invited.
- Ah...

1377
01:36:10,388 --> 01:36:13,515
Then we can stay at home and enjoy the film.

1378
01:36:13,558 --> 01:36:20,939
And I no longer have to share you with
models, actresses and sexy secretaries.

1379
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:25,944
Ma ..  Hey! Hey! Hey!

1380
01:36:26,029 --> 01:36:28,655
I am Leopoldo Pisanello.

1381
01:36:28,698 --> 01:36:31,909
Good morning, ma'am.
This morning I had breakfast...

1382
01:36:31,951 --> 01:36:35,162
.. I put butter on two slices of bread,
and jam.

1383
01:36:35,205 --> 01:36:37,790
Then I made lather with the shaving gel

1384
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:42,711
Because that's how I shave
with gel. I really like the lather.

1385
01:36:42,712 --> 01:36:46,715
I am Leopoldo Pisanello.
Good morning. Want an autograph?

1386
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,845
I'm Leopoldo Pisanello. You want it?
I'm Leopoldo Pisanello. Lady!

1387
01:36:51,846 --> 01:36:56,809
I'll give you a scoop: I wear boxers.
Do you want to see them?

1388
01:36:56,851 --> 01:37:03,357
Do you want to see the boxers? Here they are.
I wear white boxers, large.

1389
01:37:03,358 --> 01:37:06,735
Here they are. It 's a scoop!

1390
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:13,075
Lady! I'm Leopoldo Pisanello.
Do you think a trim would be better?

1391
01:37:13,117 --> 01:37:17,329
And she's my wife.
Miss, look. A tear in her stockings.

1392
01:37:17,372 --> 01:37:22,876
The run is fashionable.
It's a "trend".

1393
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:28,257
Do you want to see Pisanello on one leg only?
Here it is, on one leg.

1394
01:37:28,258 --> 01:37:32,886
E 'scoop exceptional.
This morning I had breakfast...

1395
01:37:32,887 --> 01:37:39,351
Enough paparazzi!
Enough paparazzi! Enough!

1396
01:37:39,394 --> 01:37:43,397
- Excuse me, but I know you. - Yes ..
- Yes, I remember the face.

1397
01:37:43,481 --> 01:37:45,524
You are... What was your name?

1398
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:49,236
- I'm Leopoldo Pisanello.
- That's it.
- You want an autograph?

1399
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,908
- Yes, if you want to... my notebook.
- I'll give you an autograph.
- Thank you.

1400
01:37:54,993 --> 01:38:00,247
- I'm Leopoldo Pisanello, if you remember.
- Thank you.
- It's me.

1401
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:05,043
- You see?
- Yes, let's go home, our children are there.
- Come on.

1402
01:38:05,044 --> 01:38:10,007
Here, here.
Surely he remembers me.

1403
01:38:10,049 --> 01:38:14,303
This gentleman was once my driver.
Right?

1404
01:38:14,387 --> 01:38:20,183
- Yes - There.
- I told you life is sometimes very cruel.

1405
01:38:20,268 --> 01:38:23,562
It doesn't give satisfaction,
neither to the rich and famous . .

1406
01:38:23,563 --> 01:38:26,064
.. nor to the poor and unknown.

1407
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:31,820
But, between the two,
being rich and famous is definitely better.

1408
01:38:32,822 --> 01:38:36,533
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- Thank you. - Lord. - Goodbye.

1409
01:38:38,202 --> 01:38:40,954
Come on.

1410
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:46,168
- You know what he said?
- Yes, I understand... I get it.

1411
01:38:54,969 --> 01:39:03,226
- Milly? Milly?
- Where were you? I was worried.

1412
01:39:03,311 --> 01:39:07,356
- What happened to you?
- I went to find you.

1413
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,984
Then I lost the phone.
I was lost in Rome.

1414
01:39:11,069 --> 01:39:13,070
But where were you?

1415
01:39:13,112 --> 01:39:15,864
With my uncles, but I was thinking of you
every single minute.

1416
01:39:15,949 --> 01:39:19,743
- Did it go well?
- We're going home.

1417
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:22,371
- Home?
- Yes, let's go back to Pordenone.

1418
01:39:22,372 --> 01:39:25,374
- But we just got here.
- It doesn't matter.

1419
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:29,336
You don't want to meet my uncles
and their jerk friends.

1420
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:32,250
I don't want that job.
I want my old job back.

1421
01:39:32,256 --> 01:39:35,630
Maybe we won't be rich,
but we will have a better life
.

1422
01:39:35,635 --> 01:39:41,348
- Don't you still want to teach?
- Yes. Yes, but... - No "but".

1423
01:39:41,391 --> 01:39:43,760
We'll go back home and have a life...

1424
01:39:43,768 --> 01:39:48,897
.. A life much better, with children.

1425
01:39:52,986 --> 01:39:57,406
And I can... I can paint a little.

1426
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:07,541
Okay. I'm surprised.
I don't know what to tell you.

1427
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:10,877
Don't say anything. Let's make love.

1428
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,631
- How?
- Before leaving, we'll celebrate.

1429
01:40:14,674 --> 01:40:17,801
Now I'll teach you something about the stars.

1430
01:40:20,263 --> 01:40:25,809
- I will ravage you. So, don't be surprised.
- Ravage me.

1431
01:41:42,386 --> 01:41:45,639
I'll say my lines.

1432
01:41:46,891 --> 01:41:54,481
A great show for twenty-three hours.

1433
01:41:54,524 --> 01:41:59,277
Put on your costume...

1434
01:41:59,278 --> 01:42:05,408
.. and your face.

1435
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:15,794
The people pay and they want to laugh.

1436
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:26,179
And if a Harlequin shall steal your Columbine,...

1437
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:32,394
.. laugh, clown...

1438
01:42:32,436 --> 01:42:37,274
..  and everyone applauds.

1439
01:42:37,775 --> 01:42:45,031
Laugh, clown...

1440
01:42:45,074 --> 01:42:58,336
.. your love is broken.

1441
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:01,548
Laugh.

1442
01:43:01,591 --> 01:43:08,597
- No! - The name!
- Devil! But really...

1443
01:43:08,598 --> 01:43:12,475
(chorus) - What are you doing?
- To you! To you!

1444
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:18,607
In the throes of death you will tell!

1445
01:43:18,608 --> 01:43:22,736
- Help!
- Edda!

1446
01:43:24,113 --> 01:43:29,743
Ah, are you? So be it!

1447
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:40,962
The comedy is over.

1448
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:15,518
Dad, the critics says you were wonderful,
"a voice from the golden era".

1449
01:44:15,535 --> 01:44:20,460
It is so great, I... I can't believe it!
But no more for me?

1450
01:44:20,478 --> 01:44:24,100
- I've proved myself enough.
- You are beautiful here.

1451
01:44:24,117 --> 01:44:28,026
Mama don't fly, I don't tour,
my life is fulfilled.

1452
01:44:28,068 --> 01:44:30,302
I've had a great family. I stay home.

1453
01:44:30,321 --> 01:44:32,971
I relax. I bury people. I'm happy.

1454
01:44:33,407 --> 01:44:35,991
- You're not going away then?
- No. I've had enough.

1455
01:44:36,014 --> 01:44:37,680
Tonight I owe everybody an apology.

1456
01:44:37,724 --> 01:44:41,145
We should get to the Spanish Steps
for Max's cocktail party.

1457
01:44:41,373 --> 01:44:42,296
We're late?

1458
01:44:42,312 --> 01:44:45,320
No, I mean, he's an old friend of my father,
he's not gonna mind if we're a bit late.

1459
01:44:45,336 --> 01:44:46,853
- But we should go soon.
- Alright.

1460
01:44:46,879 --> 01:44:51,176
- Do you forgive me?
- Oh, I'm so happy for your husband.

1461
01:44:51,206 --> 01:44:55,390
And as for you, how can I
not forgive you? I love you.

1462
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:58,912
"Another Caruso, and in difficult conditions."

1463
01:44:58,974 --> 01:45:01,764
Oh, goodness, they weren't very kind
to my father, were they?

1464
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,620
Uh... Wait, I think it's better
you don't hear that.

1465
01:45:04,646 --> 01:45:07,347
No, no, I can take it.
Just don't tell my Dad.

1466
01:45:07,357 --> 01:45:09,668
Thankfully, he doesn't understand
the word of Italian.

1467
01:45:09,689 --> 01:45:14,261
Alright, um...
"Except from Mr. Santoli's magnificent voice...

1468
01:45:14,281 --> 01:45:17,890
Magnificent! His voice is the most beautiful of all!

1469
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:23,069
- Whatever, "whoever imbecile..." imbecile?
- Yeah, imbecile.

1470
01:45:23,081 --> 01:45:28,164
"whoever imbecile conceived
this moronic experience...

1471
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:32,207
"...should be taken out and beheaded."

1472
01:45:32,257 --> 01:45:34,798
Oh, well, he's gotten worse.

1473
01:45:34,822 --> 01:45:37,838
This has to be the most beautiful
terrace in all of Rome.

1474
01:45:37,888 --> 01:45:40,744
Yeah, for my wife and I is a
privilege to live up here.

1475
01:45:40,766 --> 01:45:44,202
Yeah, I mean, the Spanish Steps
right there, the people watching...

1476
01:45:44,227 --> 01:45:47,628
Phyllis, the review was so great.
I mean, the press... what...

1477
01:45:47,647 --> 01:45:50,677
The press called me, um...
not... not, what's the word they used?

1478
01:45:50,692 --> 01:45:54,784
not a maestro,
but uh...uh... an "imbecille"!

1479
01:45:54,811 --> 01:45:57,948
- I... What... what does it mean?
- Means you're ahead of your time.

1480
01:45:58,004 --> 01:46:01,256
Ahead... you know, your mother,
I'm happy to say, lucky woman,

1481
01:46:01,269 --> 01:46:02,478
married an "imbecille".

1482
01:46:02,495 --> 01:46:07,491
- So I toast to my future father-in-law.
- Ah, well, good luck to you guys.

1483
01:46:07,542 --> 01:46:10,457
- Honey, let's go to see the piazza.
- Yeah. - Get a click.

1484
01:46:10,587 --> 01:46:14,088
I'm so glad to see them.
They make a lovely couple.

1485
01:46:15,237 --> 01:46:18,586
Oh, this city is unbelievable.

1486
01:46:19,036 --> 01:46:21,966
I think we should get married
right in front of the fountain there.

1487
01:46:22,015 --> 01:46:24,012
Anything you want.

1488
01:46:24,622 --> 01:46:28,405
Oh, I could stand here all night.
It's so beautiful.

1489
01:47:03,681 --> 01:47:08,851
It's me, that knows Rome best,
not the traffic policeman or anyone.

1490
01:47:08,874 --> 01:47:11,766
I see all from here.

1491
01:47:11,887 --> 01:47:17,548
The Romans, the students,
the lovers on the Spanish Steps.

1492
01:47:18,529 --> 01:47:22,896
There're many stories.
Next time you come.
