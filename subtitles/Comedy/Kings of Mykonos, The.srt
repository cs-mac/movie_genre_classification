3
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,407
Yo, dawg.

4
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,993
Konichiwa.

5
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,195
- What?
- Konichiwa.

6
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,438
Konichiwa means:
"What's up?"

7
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:11,217
- So what the fuck's up?
- We know what it means.

8
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,994
You wanna smoke?

9
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,642
Read the paper??? yourself clean.

10
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,907
Couple of these and you'll be
fucking like beasts.

11
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,685
- Boys like pussy, right?
- Hey!

12
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:24,255
Yo, do we look like fucking
tweakers (speed addicts) to you?

13
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,251
- So you got the shit or not?
Yeah. You?

14
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,760
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.

15
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,992
It is a machine gun.

16
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:43,037
- The kind you can carry.
- Couldn't get none of those.

17
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,311
This baby's got character,
Korean war vintage.

18
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,421
Maybe we mowed down
one of your grand-papa sans,

19
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,652
when he was charging the wire
in China.???

20
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,875
Shit, it's fuckin' stuck.

21
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,136
Fuck it! Take it right. 3 large,
($3000) (and it's yours).

22
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,075
Nigger, I drive a $100,000 car.

23
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,807
We want your fagotty ass right
or we'll jack (take) it from you.

24
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,726
Cool. Down to insult right now.

25
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,455
Konichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.

26
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,077
How am I supposed to tell
if you can't?

27
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,392
'fuck's that supposed
to mean, white boy?

28
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,674
Means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, you talk black,

29
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,529
and drive dukes?? (gay cars).
So how am I supposed to know

30
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:15,751
what kind of zipperhead (Asian)

31
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,551
dog-munching thing you are,
if you don't

32
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,248
Yo.

33
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,616
You know what the fuck we are?

34
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,939
Yes, you're a couple of
panheads (peasants)...

35
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,768
buyin' a machine gun out of a trunk.

36
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:29,847
What's up?

37
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,512
- Take him up.
- Get your ass up!

38
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:39,901
Shit.

39
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,696
What do you mean, shit?!

40
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,006
- Konichiwa, bitch.
- Let's go.

41
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,792
Where?

42
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,224
* Missing
Call Missing Children Hotline

43
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,911
(Shit! )

44
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:33,048
It' okay.
I'm a cop.

45
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,238
Captain Wander, congratulations on
breaking the case.

46
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,677
Can you tell me how
you've found the twins?

47
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,555
Truly, my people turned this city
upside down, looking for these girls.

48
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,836
I could not be prouder of my men.

49
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,655
Ma'am, excuse me.

50
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,641
How can you shoot a guy
taking a dump?

51
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,330
I mean, seriously, that's sacred.

52
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,919
That's like shooting
the man in a church.

53
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,079
Or a Dodger game.

54
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,032
Whatever it takes to be a hero,
any time, any place, right, Lud?

55
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:16,709
I guess so...

56
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,639
I hate these slit-eyed
kiddy-raping bastards.

57
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:21,012
At least kidnap some full-grown
ladies with shapes.

58
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,431
Wow. Maybe we should check his
closet next, eh, Lud?

59
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,009
The girls are being examined by
a physician right now.

60
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,940
Both twins are in good health

61
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,422
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.

62
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,849
L.A. Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say:

63
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,562
"Vice detective rescues missing twins."

64
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:40,048
Detective.
Singular.

65
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,691
Yeah, maybe we've been sittin'
around on our asses and doin' jack shit

66
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,051
- and all during the last month.
- Hey!

67
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:46,471
You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.

68
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,966
I mean, you could've
just saved some for us.

69
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,239
[What do you want], Santos?

70
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,713
You wanna see their faces every night?
You wanna be a killer?

71
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,440
You know what? Shut the fuck up!

72
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,713
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Hey!

73
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,241
This is real professional.

74
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,735
What if I walk in here
with the chief? Huh?

75
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,192
Santos, go get your ass outside.

76
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,633
Find Ted Berman and make sure

77
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,350
that that crime scene lot
is in order.

78
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,868
- Yes, sir.
- Ride along, boy.

79
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,534
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey, secure that bullshit, right?

80
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,364
Both of you.

81
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:14,712
Clady, you take DeMille back
to the ward and start writing.

82
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,244
I want something to red-pin by midnight.

83
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,156
- Tell your buddy he's
gonna do his writing.

84
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,548
Got it captain. Let's go.

85
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,914
This is crazy.

86
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,129
You fucked 'em up.

87
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,290
This is beautiful.

88
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,634
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.

89
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,763
I know you hate to wait,
but it's better this way.

90
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:48,733
- You all right?
- Yeah.

91
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,672
- I got shot.
- Yeah, but you're okay?

92
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,695
Yeah. I'm okay, Jack.

93
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:57,075
Because I know you're not tripping
about these...these assholes, right?

94
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,930
Fuck, it's cool.

95
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,088
You were toe to toe with evil,
and you won.

96
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,302
You saved those girls.

97
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,233
This is lovely, Tommy.

98
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,999
Come here, man.
Give me a hug.

99
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,414
Come on.

100
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:17,377
Not so tight.
What are you hiding from?

101
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,207
You've been drinking.

102
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,900
You know, that thing
they say about vodka?

103
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,461
That you can't smell it?

104
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,962
It's bullshit.

105
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:27,933
The D.A. (district attorney)...

106
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,440
shooting team is in rut
right now (do their job).

107
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,559
And your're not ready
for public consumption.

108
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,655
So...come on, I wanna
get you to a hospital.

109
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,305
Get you away from all of this.

110
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,650
Thanks, Jack.

111
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,044
If that aint L.A.'s deadliest white boy.

112
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:57,109
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?

113
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:00,196
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun butt.

114
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,594
I'll be praying for
the families of your victims.

115
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,717
They're called "suspects."

116
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,942
The victims are the
14-year old school girls...

117
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:09,746
the suspects kept in a cage
and sold to chicken hawks (paedophiles)

118
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,933
to poke prod (harrass)
put on the Internet.

119
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,770
"Suspects," Washington.
"Suspects."

120
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,290
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.

121
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,043
There is gonna be some
blowback (revenge)...

122
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,477
from the Korean community on this one.

123
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:25,158
Now that you're off limits,
why don't you just say it?

124
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:26,827
You think I'm a racist.

125
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,850
- Do you have another explanation?
- No, I don't,

126
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,150
because if I rule and
determine a suspect...

127
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,478
is black, yellow or brown

128
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,505
I blow them out of their socks.

129
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,292
But if they are white,
I give them a ride home.

130
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,270
You know why?
Because I am a racist. Fuck you.

131
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,790
Man, I would give you my right arm
to have that shit on tape.

132
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,336
What happened to you, Terrence?
We used to be brothers.

133
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:48,574
Hey, hey!

134
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:52,273
Stay on point, Washington.
You stay on point (focus).

135
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:55,718
Always, Captain Wander.
Always.

136
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,031
Tom. Come on,
let's get you out of here.

137
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,097
Don't go near that piece of shit.

138
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,504
He's got it coming, Jack.

139
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,622
Do not go near him.
Stay away, far away.

140
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,175
- Fuck him.
- That's an order.

141
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,121
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.

142
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,604
I did the same thing
with this girl once.

143
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:25,398
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.

144
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,860
I'd sit in her section and
won't let anybody else serve me.

145
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,133
If they changed sections,
I'd change tables.

146
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,291
Persistence, that's the key.

147
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,355
Wait a second.

148
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,305
You're that cop. You're that--
I've just seen your face on tv.

149
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,105
You rescued those
Korean twins, right?

150
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,491
Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

151
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,620
No.
Yeah.

152
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,531
How about you?

153
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,593
Me? I sell insurance.
Life, auto, casualty.

154
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,421
That was some heavy shit, man.

155
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:07,791
So those guys, they shot first, right?

156
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,835
Excuse me?

157
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,030
The whole city was looking
for those kids.

158
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:19,386
- How'd you find them?
- That's my job.

159
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:25,533
Excuse me, Captain.
Sorry to interrupt.

160
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,287
Deputy Chief??? is trying to raise you
on the simplex (radio).

161
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:32,499
Insurance, Tom.
I sell insurance.

162
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,012
If you ever need any,
and you will,

163
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,672
why don't you give me a call?

164
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,769
No one has to know but us.
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.

165
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,934
CAPTAIN JAMES BIGGS.

166
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,740
Listen, for your own good...

167
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,587
Don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.

168
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,507
See you sometime.

169
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,046
Who was that?

170
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:07,250
Copper??? cops.
Jesus.

171
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,227
- Who?
- Nobody, Grace.

172
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,014
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,755
Hold this.

174
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,141
You know, you can just
stop by sometime.

175
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,419
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.

176
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,538
Why? I like it like this.

177
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,093
Don't you?

178
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:31,598
No, I don't.

179
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,710
I don't.

180
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,737
No.????

181
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:38,911
I work here. I'm not losing
my license for you.

182
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,084
- I am a cop.
- No.

183
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:49,863
I keep the door open after
identifying myself as a police officer.

184
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:51,341
Upon entry, I was fired upon

185
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,221
by a suspect in the living room
with a silver automatic.

186
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,599
I returned fire,
he goes down.

187
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,857
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun
fire from the second suspect.

188
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,057
Point of entry?

189
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,135
Front door in the
west side of the structure.

190
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,233
Why didn't you call
for backup?

191
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,202
Exigent (urgent) circumstances.

192
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,537
I heard screams
emanating from the house,

193
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,816
and assertained a crime was in progress.

194
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:43,170
Great work you did there.
Thanks a lot.

195
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,665
Now it's a party.

196
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,416
Oh my goodness, now it's
a bandage???, captain.

197
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,376
How you doin'?

198
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,345
Steady, steady.
Yeah, he's in.

199
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:54,423
What's with you?
Clady give you a 'happy ending'?

200
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,842
Is that any way to address a commander?

201
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,512
Got the call from the
chief this morning.

202
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,708
[The promotion] is next week.

203
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,774
Congratulations, boss.

204
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,917
We're gonna have the keys to the city.

205
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,086
Do you believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.

206
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,297
Let's get a toast to that.
Toast to the king.

207
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:10,923
King Wander.

208
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,800
Yo boss, gotta be your driver
when you make chief?

209
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,886
- You got it, you got it if you want.
- All right.

210
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,898
You know, I owe you one, Tom.

211
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,470
That pot twins caper,
that gave me the edge.

212
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,977
You know, the chief,
he's breaking tradition.

213
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,048
????

214
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:26,373
The first commander's slot?? always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs,

215
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,373
that's the way it is.

216
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,900
That's because they got
so much dirt on everyone.

217
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,454
That's right,

218
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,095
and they're always
looking for more, huh?

219
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,772
Yeah.

220
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,599
You know this prick?

221
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,977
Came at me like "Joe Concerned Citizen"
asking procedural questions.

222
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:42,239
Yeah, we got a history, this--

223
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,301
See, if they'd show up
during the daytime,

224
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,676
you would know who your enemies are.

225
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,219
What did you tell him?

226
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,697
I couldn't help myself clearly,
I told him everything.

227
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,497
Attaboy.

228
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,550
You know, this is a typical
Biggs bullshit move,

229
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,635
???
Backdoor is all they fuckin' got.

230
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,762
Why is Internal Affairs
after my ass all of a sudden?

231
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,180
It's Washington, brother.

232
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,841
Your ex-partner is a snitch.

233
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,073
Holy shit.

234
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,800
Jack, talk to me.

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,760
Washington has had several meetings...

236
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,971
with Captain Biggs over
the last few weeks.

237
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,540
They're no secrets in the department,

238
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,293
so when I became cognizant (aware)
of the problem, we threw a tail on him,

239
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,287
I followed this guy,
Eastside, Westside, Southside.

240
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,259
Next thing I know, he's ringing Biggs'
doorbell in??? land.

241
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,118
Who's Washington given up?
(betrayed)

242
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,764
You, Tom.

243
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,086
- Me?
- Yeah.

244
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,809
- Why now?
- Because I shitcanned (fired)

245
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,228
him from this unit
and he is a vindictive bastard.

246
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,898
And now he is on a mission
to pull the??? from under my best guys.

247
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:46,743
All my best guys,
that's what this shit's about.

248
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,136
Tommy, Tommy.

249
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,242
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk to my friend.

250
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,535
- No, you 're not. You're not.
- You wanna talk?

251
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,016
Let's talk about my foot up your ass

252
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,372
if you don't sit the fuck down
here on your chair right now.

253
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:00,759
Have a seat.
Come on.

254
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:04,179
What the fuck is wrong with you?

255
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,726
Do not, and I repeat, do not
hand Washington your badge.

256
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,013
I know you two have done some
??? (shit) together,

257
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,808
But we gotta hold the line,
you and me.

258
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,372
We've been here before, haven't we?

259
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,687
When the gates of hell
opened up on you, Tom.

260
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,390
I took care of you then,
I'm gonna take care of you now.

261
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,119
- All right?
- Okay.

262
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:07,626
Washington.

263
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,305
Drop it.
- What are you doing?

264
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,881
Do you want to kill me, partner?

265
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,550
Are you crazy, we've
got a 211 in park rest???.

266
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,385
I got you.
I got you and Wander.

267
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,731
Listen to me, you idiot. We've got two
gang bangers rolling in hot.

268
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,074
Shit.

269
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,506
Washington.
Stay with me, partner.

270
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,246
- Don't move! Let me see your hands!
- I'm a cop...

271
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,519
I'm a cop,
I'm a fucking cop!

272
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,166
Fuck.

273
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,460
- It's Ludlow.
- Give me an ambulance now.

274
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,079
Holy shit.

275
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,634
He's a cop too?

276
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,192
Yeah.

277
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,561
Where's the video?

278
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,701
- Who else has seen this?
- Just us, boss.

279
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,203
It was a straight 211 that went south.

280
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,163
That's not what it was,
that's what it looks like.

281
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:51,449
But it's not what it looks like.
It's not.

282
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,376
That's all there is, Tom.

283
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,262
What it looks like.
What everybody sees.

284
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,622
You knew that.

285
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,095
Right, if anybody in the
department sees this video,

286
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,491
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?

287
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,620
The department?
If the D.A. sees this...

288
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,076
- he's going to prison.
- Why?

289
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,065
Because Washington was
in the wrong place at the wrong time?

290
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:09,796
No, because you were.

291
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:13,254
Washington's problems are over.
Yours are just beginning.

292
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:16,536
Try to think
two moves ahead, for once.

293
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:20,077
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs (criminals) off the street

294
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:21,999
went after a cop who
was diming (selling) you out

295
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,723
to Internal Affairs.

296
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:24,707
It writes itself.

297
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,813
I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.

298
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:30,639
I gave you a direct order:
Stay away from him.

299
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,700
Give me your goddamn gun.
Now.

300
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,303
Give me your goddamn gun.

301
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,451
You don't give a shit about yourself,
that's pretty obvious,

302
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,729
but you gotta think about the unit.
You really fucked us on this one.

303
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,982
Clady, give me a minute, please.

304
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,568
Yes, sir.

305
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,700
I can't afford to lose you.

306
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,541
Who would do what you do?

307
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:05,290
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

308
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,420
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

309
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,577
Maybe...

310
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,860
the clerk...

311
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,652
forget to put a disk
in the recorder today.

312
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,849
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom.

313
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:35,278
And you ran to the aid to Washington.

314
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,417

00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:09,950
Detective Washington was tireless

475
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,100
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family...

476
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,874
and his dedication to this department.

477
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:20,336
Uniform detail,
atten-hut!

478
00:35:20,936 --> 00:35:24,457
Fire guard,
port arms.

479
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,603
Half right, face.

480
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:31,864
Ready.
Aim! Fire!

481
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,250
Aim!
Fire!

482
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,048
Aim!
Fire!

483
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,641
Uniform detail,
present arms!

484
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,888
- Go back to work.
- Yes sir.

485
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:11,625
Let's go get 'em.

486
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:12,729
Sir.

487
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,163
Mrs. Washington?

488
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:34,453
- I was the first scene.
- Yeah, of course you were.

489
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,247
Excuse me.

490
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:55,076
Are you Diskant?

491
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:56,442
Yeah.

492
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,575
You're working on Washington?

493
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,362
Yeah.

494
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,823
You know who I am?

495
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,208
Yes.

496
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,903
Are you not interviewing me?

497
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:10,876
You are on my list.

498
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:13,745
Let's get rolling.
Where do I start?

499
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:18,021
Gang books, mug shots (photos)?
211 ("robbery") reports?

500
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:20,715
If you want.

501
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:23,343
Come on, Diskant.
You've worked for homicide before.

502
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,429
I'm 242 ("battery": brawls, fights).

503
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,750
Okay, 242.
You got the ballistics report?

504
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,850
No.

505
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,594
The bullets are still at the coroner's.

506
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:35,955
Yeah, but they've given
you updates, right?

507
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,795
Did they tell you how many different
calibres they dug out of Washington?

508
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:41,152
- What do you want?
- How many?

509
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,867
Goodbye, detective.

510
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:58,554
Harry, I thought you were dead.

511
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,604
[Department of Coroner]
[Administration Operations]

512
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,993
I'm from Vice Special.

513
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,613
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

514
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,562
I handled your wife's autopsy.

515
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:31,101
That was you?

516
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:33,004
The asshole, remember?

517
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,010
Right.

518
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,188
The guy who washed away all the
hair and fibre evidence.

519
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:41,079
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

520
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:43,748
The guy who left me
with nothing to go on.

521
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,075
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

522
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,353
How can I help you?

523
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,892
Pulled these out of Washington?

524
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,499
Yep. 18 rounds. Ten .45 calibre...

525
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,782
full metal jackets,
seven 9 millimeter FMJs

526
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,322
and a single .38 hollow point...

527
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,606
mushroomed against the
scapula (shoulder blade).

528
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:08,039
Serious overkill.
Must've really pissed off the shooters.

529
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:13,136
Did you get what you were looking for?

530
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,977
I am Detective Diskant, we spoke
on the phone earlier.

531
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:20,064
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How're you doing?

532
00:39:20,664 --> 00:39:24,289
- When can I expect the report?
- In about an hour, sir.

533
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,320
- Can you fax this to my office?
- Okay.

534
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,364
Thank you, Doc.

535
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,554
Diskant, talk to me.

536
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,549
You got three different calibres,
that means three weapons.

537
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:46,077
What's your take went
on down in that market?

538
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,613
Two bad guys come through the front door...

539
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,531
to rob the place, one
of them sees the clerk,

540
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:51,993
cut's him in half, the other one sees

541
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,646
Washington, whose weapon
is already drawn,

542
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:55,828
empties his clip into him.

543
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:58,117
His buddy joins the party,
till he runs dry,

544
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,736
then one of them pulls a .38,

545
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:02,719
pumps a final "fuck you"-round
into Washington's back.

546
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,596
They leave, you show up
after they're gone.

547
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,594
Got it all figured out.

548
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:15,031
I got your back here,

549
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,425
but you got to keep your distance
and let me work this case.

550
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,294
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

551
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,197
Are you fucking kidding me?

552
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,899
They get a pass and you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

553
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,318
What are you talking about,
"the shooters get a pass"?

554
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,349
I don't understand.
Clady said you were on board.

555
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:30,767
Not with this.

556
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:33,332
What is the deal?
You throw in this case for a promotion?

557
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,676
If I were you I'd be
more morried about yourself.

558
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:38,293
Hey, you piece of shit! You got a
187 (homicide) on a police officer

559
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:40,293
and you're fucking
lettin' the suspects walk?

560
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:42,095
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?

561
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:43,782
- So they can put you out in the????
- Fuck off!

562
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:44,911
Place you in the store
before the shooting?

563
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,829
Do you want to catch
a felony for obstruction?

564
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,166
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

565
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,094
This is your mess,
and I'm cleaning it up.

566
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,046
Yeah, it pisses me off.

567
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,133
Diskant.

568
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,284
Yeah.

569
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:03,213
Yes, hang on one second.

570
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,165
All right, go ahead.

571
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,101
All right, thank you.

572
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,507
Bye bye.

573
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:17,639
You write in codes.

574
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,739
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and a bandana outside the store.

575
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:22,932
The DNA corresponds to those two names.

576
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,863
Congratulations, you
I.D. ed the shooters.

577
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:26,886
Yeah, normally I would be pretty happy.

578
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,204
Pull the rep sheets. Give me copies.

579
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,308
I'll see you around.

580
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:40,217
The computer says you
arrested these guys.

581
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:43,345
Fremont and Coates.

582
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,389
Good guys.
Say hi from me.

583
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,890
Do you remember them?

584
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,354
Who can forget?

585
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:51,936
Heroin dealers with a
taste for blood.

586
00:41:52,536 --> 00:41:56,190
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much.

587
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,237
They never left.

588
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:00,470
Yeah, we hooked these fine gentlemen
on a rape/mutilation caper.

589
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,174
It seems they had a
three day hostage fest

590
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,112
with this cute little Guatemalan chick.

591
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:07,993
They snatched her up
when she was walking over from school.

592
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,061
Hurt her bad.

593
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:11,647
- Then why are they on the streets?
- They walked from the????.

594
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:13,202
One of our own felt we violated

595
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:15,290
Mr. Coates' and Mr.
Fremont's civil rights

596
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:17,286
and told the city attorney.

597
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,505
- Washington dimed you out.
- Yeah.

598
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,255
Why do you think they put that dude
community relations?

599
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:24,819
Are you shittin' me?

600
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,605
Washington kicked loose
the very guys who whacked him?

601
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:29,403
Damn ironic, isn't it?

602
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:32,924
Hello, guys.
What is this, a garage sale?

603
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,775
Hello, Lud?
What's this?

604
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,199
Why...uh...

605
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:39,600
Why do you have this?

606
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,994
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

607
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,637
Sarge, we can get these guys.

608
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:46,336
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

609
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:47,742
Besides, these two animals?

610
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:49,214
These guys,
they'll take care of each other.

611
00:42:49,314 --> 00:42:50,528
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

612
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:51,971
Probably shoot
each other's fucking faces off.

613
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,064
no one needs to.

614
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:54,210
You know how this shit it works.

615
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,476
This week's suspect,
next week's victims.

616
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,300
Right?

617
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,922
Yeah, right.

618
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,690
- What are you doing here, Tom?
- Let's talk.

619
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:33,571
I'm sick of this shit, man.

620
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:36,273
It's the same damn song for three years.

621
00:43:36,373 --> 00:43:38,292
Crying about your wife.

622
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,295
She's gone, Tom.

623
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:43,674
What's it going to take
to bring you back from Mars?

624
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:47,906
Have I ever asked you for anything?

625
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:49,804
You know what,
you ask me for shit all the time.

626
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:51,566
Big things, Jack?

627
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,466
Important things.

628
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:55,159
What's up, Tom?

629
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,727
Give me a green light to...

630
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:58,930
take out the assholes
who did Washington.

631
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,355
Come on, Jack.
King's X. (time-out, truce)

632
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:05,373
What the hell is this?

633
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:08,464
I can lay them out like
I did those Koreans, but off the books.

634
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:10,570
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.

635
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,597
Who's going to know?
Who's going to care?

636
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,320
The Koreans...

637
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,247
that was business.

638
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,110
This is some crazy bullshit...

639
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,218
wrapped around in that
drunk ass mind of yours.

640
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:22,269
Look at yourself.

641
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:24,731
Look at yourself Tom, you're a mess!

642
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,042
When did you start drinking today?

643
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:30,333
You're little airplane bottles of vodka.

644
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,200
And you drove over here intoxicated.

645
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,606
You want a second DUI?
(driving under influence)

646
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:35,298
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!

647
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,600
You're not listening to me!

648
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,115
You're not listening to me!

649
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:39,946
No, you listen to me.

650
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:43,267
This is much bigger than that.

651
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:46,686
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

652
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:49,439
He has a PhD in catching cops slipping.

653
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,064
You know this.
You know all this.

654
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:56,287
You gotta hold your mud (stay strong).

655
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:58,365
Can you do that?

656
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:02,403
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

657
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:14,430
They took $200.

658
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,663
I had forgotten about this
until I saw this.

659
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,487
That's the man.

660
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:22,647
That's him.

661
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:26,969
They took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

662
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,288
The cookie jar.

663
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:32,265
That's what he said.

664
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:37,721
I'll be right back.

665
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:53,804
What do you want, Disco?

666
00:45:55,346 --> 00:45:58,383
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

667
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,921
Why are you telling me this?

668
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:05,799
I think you know why.

669
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:08,685
I know why.

670
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:13,815
- Got it in this? Huh?
- That's a new phone.

671
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:15,988
You're working for Internal Affairs.

672
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,962
You made one deal,
maybe you made two?

673
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:21,924
Did Captain Biggs
flip you to the dark side, punk?

674
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,901
You know what?

675
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,931
They're right about you.
You are fucking out there (mad).

676
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,376
From now on you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

677
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:36,538
Hold on, Disco.
Hold on.

678
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,775
I gotta watch my own back
these days, you know?

679
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:42,810
Come on.
Don't be mad.

680
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,688
Washington was dirty.

681
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:49,776
Hit me, princess.
Come on.

682
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,771
Couple of things.

683
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,773
You know, we found $50,000 in cash
??? at the store?

684
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:58,860
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash
but not in itself damning.

685
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,866
Oh, but this is.

686
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:02,321
Looks like an evidence tag.

687
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:03,656
I found it in Washington's truck.

688
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,362
I had SID (Scientific
Investigation Division)...

689
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:06,826
scan it, corresponds
to a kilo of heroin.

690
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:09,637
Guess who comes along
and signs up the dope?

691
00:47:09,737 --> 00:47:11,143
Washington.

692
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:14,093
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

693
00:47:16,977 --> 00:47:18,972
Guys who worked (killed) him moved dope.

694
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:23,316
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape [charge] on a technicality.

695
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,967
No, I did not know that.

696
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:27,563
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

697
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:29,849
Maybe it was a hit?
(assassination)

698
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,993
That would explain
the heavy artillery.

699
00:47:34,203 --> 00:47:36,414
Washington deserved it, right?

700
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:38,584
He was dirty, so fuck him.

701
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,611
I feel much better
about the suspects walking,

702
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:45,007
And you must feel better, too, right?
We're doing the right thing.

703
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:50,471
No shame if you want to take your pass.

704
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:57,303
This has to be you and me.

705
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:01,507
Why do you think we're
in the goddamn bathroom?

706
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:25,139
This is it. The last known address.

707
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:41,946
We are cops.

708
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:43,928
Do you live here?

709
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:45,209
How long have you been living here?

710
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,440
Three months.

711
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,566
Who's living with you?

712
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:52,559
My mum, my dad, my sisters and brothers
and my cousin Grisella.

713
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:53,752
No one else?

714
00:48:58,387 --> 00:48:59,587
Okay.

715
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,138
Family or not.
Our boys are long gone.

716
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:09,666
All right, Disco.

717
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,752
See those yahoos (idiots)?
I'm gonna jam 'em.

718
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:14,802
And when I do,
one of them is gonna bolt (run).

719
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:16,257
That's the one that has to do it.

720
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,063
Are you bored or something?

721
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:20,960
This is their (neighbor)hood.

722
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:23,055
If anyone knows Fremont
and Coates, they do.

723
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,652
- Fuck it.
- Look at those guys.

724
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:36,994
Get him.

725
00:49:42,206 --> 00:49:44,201
Suck on my balls!

726
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,254
Go home.
You're in the wrong neighborhood.

727
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:53,510
Watch out!

728
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:01,910
Run, amigo.

729
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:24,474
Spencer.

730
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:05,841
I had him.

731
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:08,943
Why are you running, man?

1
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:12,046
Get me the fuck down here.
I just????.

2
00:51:13,646 --> 00:51:16,496
- Get me the fuck down, man.
- What else?

3
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:20,062
What the fuck are you doing, man?

4
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,847
So what do they call you?

5
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,866
They call me fucking Quicks, man.

6
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:27,152
"Quicks"?
Not quick enough.

7
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:30,042
Hey, get me the fuck down.
This meshes are cutting me up.

8
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,249
Fremont and Coates, they used to live...

9
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,893
across from were you were
partying at. You know them?

10
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,245
I don't fucking know the fools, man.

11
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,865
I 'm a fucking Southsider, right?

12
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:41,103
I won't fuck nobody with
my brothers and shit.

13
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:42,459
Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

14
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,685
They're from Belize.

15
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:45,843
Who knows them?
Who knows them?

16
00:51:45,943 --> 00:51:47,043
Who knows them?!

17
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:50,437
Look, look.
Check this out, man.

18
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:51,396
Should you listen...

19
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:53,420
[I know a guy from]
San Pedro, all right?

20
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,689
Dude's name is Grill.
He's from 40ies Town, you know?

21
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,507
- Grill, 40ies Town.
- Yes.

22
00:51:57,607 --> 00:51:59,272
Grill, man.
The motherfucker, he knows all of them.

23
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:00,565
All right, let me--Hey!

24
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:02,165
Hey!

25
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:03,772
What about him?

26
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,407
- The fucker is not going to jail.
- Hey!

27
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:06,866
I wanna run Grill through [database],

28
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:08,827
- see if I can get an address.
- Hey! Fucking whiteboys!

29
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:21,799
Fuck.

30
00:52:26,068 --> 00:52:27,504
Shit.

31
00:52:28,304 --> 00:52:30,057
Police!

32
00:52:31,257 --> 00:52:32,617
Get on your face!

33
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,678
What the fuck did I do, man?

34
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:38,748
Get your ass in here, Disco.

35
00:52:38,848 --> 00:52:40,602
- No one's telling me
what the fuck I did.

36
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:41,702
Shut up.

37
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:07,879
Shit.

38
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,553
You got two strikes, Grill.

39
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:13,953
This is three strikes.

40
00:53:14,453 --> 00:53:15,727
25 (years) to life.

41
00:53:15,827 --> 00:53:17,812
That ain't my fuckin' shit.
Fuck you!

42
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:19,864
You put that shit there.

43
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,809
Dirty ass punk ass cop.

44
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:33,002
What are you--?

45
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
Shit!

46
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:36,824
Ludlow!
- What the fuck, man?

47
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,273
Stop!

48
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:44,039
Fuck man.
Listen to your boy, man. Shit.

49
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,599
Don't you have to ask
him something first?

50
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,809
Homey, right. Aren't you
supposed to ask me some shit first?

51
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:49,865
Fremont and Coates,
where're they at?

52
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,752
Aww man,
stop hitting my fucking head first,

53
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,369
and I'll tell you.

54
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,135
Where do they fucking stay?

55
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,156
You're fucking crazy, man.
I don't know where they're headed.

56
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:03,450
???????????

57
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,544
If I catch them, I'm gonna
bust their motherfucking head, man.

58
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:09,457
Answer the fucking question!
How do we find them?

59
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:13,186
Only cass?? (guy)I know
didn't know them.

60
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:14,986
It's up in the county (jail) man.
High Powell.

61
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,273
- I'm gonna book you into county.
- For what, man?

62
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:20,575
Talk to your friends.
Find me Fremont and Coates.

63
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:21,818
and you'll be out by tomorrow,

64
00:54:21,918 --> 00:54:24,019
otherwise I'm gonna
book you for tomorrow.

65
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,488
Fuck man, fuck!

66
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,697
- I ain't no fucking snitch, man.
- I know that.

67
00:54:34,597 --> 00:54:36,291
There won't be no jacking,
no papers.

68
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:37,926
It's just you and me.

69
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,829
Fuck, man.

70
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,066
Come on, they ain't nothing to you.
I want them.

71
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:46,344
All right, man.
Fuck it.

72
00:55:27,475 --> 00:55:29,194
Mrs. Washington?

73
00:55:32,688 --> 00:55:34,400
Can we talk outside?

74
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,071
Terrence had $ 50,000 in cash on him.

75
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:51,250
This just might be more than just
wrong place, wrong time.

76
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:54,878
"Might be"?

77
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,574
How many people knew he was
talking to Internal Affairs?

78
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:02,361
My husband had a good heart.

79
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:06,486
And when he started listening to it,
he became a pariah.

80
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:09,004
His eyes opened.

81
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:11,037
When will your eyes open?

82
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,386
Terrence always said
you were the worst one.

83
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:17,587
Because with all the shit
going on around you,

84
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:19,873
you choose not to see.

85
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:22,363
Look, I came here to help you.
- Help me?

86
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,716
You came to help
yourself sleep at night.

87
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:27,147
That $ 50,000.
Do you think Terrence was stupid?

88
00:56:27,247 --> 00:56:30,659
He knew he has a bull's eye in his back
the second he went to Captain Biggs.

89
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:33,775
So we sold our house.

90
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:36,921
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.

91
00:56:37,921 --> 00:56:39,782
To start over.

92
00:56:40,682 --> 00:56:42,777
Silly of us, wasn't it?

93
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:47,376
Anything else, detective?

94
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:50,476
No.

95
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,948
Lud.

96
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:03,147
What the fuck?

97
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:07,871
- How's complaints?
- You've just missed your wife.

98
00:57:07,971 --> 00:57:09,311
- She was here?
- Yeah.

99
00:57:09,411 --> 00:57:10,913
That's cute.

100
00:57:11,913 --> 00:57:13,599
I got something for you.

101
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:22,366
That's for you.

102
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:26,819
- Is that it?
- That's it, yeah. That's it.

103
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:31,312
You can keep it as a nice souvenir
for yourself???.

104
00:57:31,712 --> 00:57:33,485
I mean, it is over.

105
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:39,413
Tom, this is over.

106
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:43,279
We got your back, Tom.

107
00:57:55,882 --> 00:57:58,177
[PROJECTILE]
[WASHINGTON, TERRENCE]

108
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,840
- Yeah.
- It's your man at High Powell.

109
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,967
- I got the name.
- Fire away.

110
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:17,487
It is an old Cheetoh (crook).
He sells a little this, a little that.

111
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:19,134
He drives an old S Cadillac.

112
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:22,304
- Name.
- Scribble. They call him Scribble.

113
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:25,383
His real name's Winston or some shit.
I don't know.

114
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:27,001
All right, [now get me out of here. ]

115
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,107
It's on its way.

116
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:33,098
I can't believe this shit worked.
Scribble. It's catchy.

117
00:58:33,398 --> 00:58:35,643
We got a metro unit tailing him.

118
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:38,178
Go get him, Disco.

119
00:58:38,278 --> 00:58:41,087
- Make me proud.
- You're not coming?

120
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,793
- Watch it, watch it!
- Are you married, Diskant?

121
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:55,450
Engaged. And I'd like
to see her again.

122
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,144
Have you ever heard of something
like the cookie jar

123
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:01,006
in reference to corruption.
Shakedown, Serpico shit?

124
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:04,371
- No, why?
- A complaint I'm working on.

125
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:07,449
We are eastbound, Vernon passing.
[Should we stop him? ]

126
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:09,584
That's a negative,
just keep eyes on him.

127
00:59:09,684 --> 00:59:10,940
I call it out. We're en route.

128
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,035
Watch it!
Crosswalk.

129
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,655
There he is.

130
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:20,792
- We got him. Break out.
- That's a roger.

131
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:25,965
Shit.

132
00:59:36,691 --> 00:59:38,536
Hands where I can see them!

133
00:59:42,605 --> 00:59:45,267
Who are you supposed to be, man?
Narcs?

134
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:47,706
Yes, we're Narcs (Narcotics).

135
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:51,097
Look how pinned out your eyes are.
Take a little off the top?

136
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:52,903
A little Jones maintenance?

137
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:54,334
You need to kick that shit.

138
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:56,545
I got a lawyer, you might wanna
talk to him. I got his card.

139
00:59:56,645 --> 00:59:58,755
You wake up.
Nothing's happened yet.

140
00:59:58,855 --> 01:00:01,925
But FYI (for your information),
I know you've got a no bail warrant.

141
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,724
I put the cuffs on now,
you're locked up until the Apocalypse.

142
01:00:04,824 --> 01:00:06,788
Whatever, man.
Take me on a ride right now, dawg.

143
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:07,981
I mean, read me my Miranda (rights).

144
01:00:08,081 --> 01:00:09,983
Put your hands back
on the fucking wheel!

145
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:12,402
Yo, "242".
Watch those fucking jokers.

146
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:14,688
Get back!
Ga the fuck back!

147
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:18,458
- Fuck you're looking at, whiteboy?
- Get the fuck back!

148
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:20,648
Do you really wanna
kick heroin in County?

149
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:23,487
Wanna see that judge all sick,
shitting and puking yourself?

150
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:26,141
That'll look real good.
And for what?

151
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:28,159
You are just a rung in
a ladder I'm climbing.

152
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:29,582
What ladder, man?

153
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:33,232
How do I find Fremont and Coates?

154
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:38,728
Look, I ain't got no love
for them banana boat motherfuckers, man.

155
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:40,062
But those dudes are straight masters,

156
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,767
they'd put me in a box
if they think I'm snitching.

157
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:44,118
I am not asking to finger
(fuck) the guys...

158
01:00:44,218 --> 01:00:44,671
on an open court,

159
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:46,294
I just wanna find them.

160
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:48,276
Once I do,
you're out of the net.

161
01:00:49,576 --> 01:00:51,199
I ain't seen them in a week, man.

162
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,786
- Got a number?
- No, I ain't got no number.

163
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:57,322
Look, all they do is drop
phones all the time.

164
01:00:57,422 --> 01:00:58,423
They call me, man.

165
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:00,525
Look man, your man makes me nervous,
could you--

166
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,256
Look at me.
Look at me!

167
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:05,281
You wanna see that judge?
You're gonna help me find 'em.

168
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:11,516
Look. I did business with
them one time in El Sereno.

169
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:14,982
In their badass house,
way up in the hills.

170
01:01:15,082 --> 01:01:16,082
That's it.

171
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:20,378
Show me.

172
01:01:20,578 --> 01:01:23,365
You expect me to leave
my car in the hood, man?

173
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,146
Someone had a party.

174
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,446
Smell that?

175
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,390
Want me to put it out?

176
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,764
No, get the murder book.

177
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:17,781
Yes, it's Fremont.

178
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:24,837
And this is his buddy, Coates.

179
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:30,681
- We found them.
- Great. Case closed.

180
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:34,480
Now these guys have been here a while,
there's no way they killed Washington.

181
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,632
You think?

182
01:03:37,232 --> 01:03:40,110
Fuck you.
I'm doing my best.

183
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,113
If Fremont and Coates
didn't kill Washington, who did?

184
01:03:43,413 --> 01:03:45,756
- Who are we chasing?
- The assholes who smoked these guys.

185
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:48,518
harvested their DNA and
planted it in the market, that's who.

186
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:52,214
I'm with you.
But why do you frame two dead dudes?

187
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:55,209
We're gonna ask them.

188
01:03:56,484 --> 01:03:58,362
Let's go.

189
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:06,093
What's up, man?

190
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:08,159
You know it's coyotes
out here and shit, right?

191
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,015
Yo, they've been gone a minute.

192
01:04:10,115 --> 01:04:12,301
Do you know these guys?

193
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,822
No man, I ain't never seen these dudes.

194
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:19,316
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you,
set up a meeting.

195
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:22,494
You tell them I can do for them
what Washington can't anymore.

196
01:04:22,594 --> 01:04:24,472
They'll know what you mean.

197
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:32,646
All right man, I hook it up.
Now you take me back to my car?

198
01:04:33,446 --> 01:04:34,932
Sure.

199
01:04:56,386 --> 01:04:59,640
- This way.
- Yeah, thank you.

200
01:05:01,191 --> 01:05:04,278
I hope you guys will play nice
with the new girl.

201
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:08,203
- Is Tom taking care of you?
- I take care of him.

202
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:10,652
How's complaints, Lud?

203
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,805
Another scrape on a body
and it's a traffic collision.

204
01:05:15,205 --> 01:05:17,224
So, Tom here falls apart
when he's not chasing bad guys.

205
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:18,409
He's always been like that.

206
01:05:18,509 --> 01:05:20,443
He was born without fear.
I could tell you some stories.

207
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:20,959
- Tell me.

208
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:22,755
No, we don't get so intolerant here.???

209
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:24,632
I got the classic Tom Ludlow story.

210
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:27,885
When he was a rookie,
I took him under my wing.

211
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:30,660
It was a Friday night,
and we were in Crib city,

212
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,789
that's a [bad area]

213
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:33,891
lots of dope and shootings,
whatever, what have you.

214
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:36,831
So, we get to this quarrel
that shut down this house party.

215
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,443
And Tom, he's like the
saltiest boot ever,

216
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:40,543
and I think:

217
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:42,608
Let's give him a lesson
in humility.

218
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,673
So I sent him in there.
Alone.

219
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:48,305
And all of a sudden,
all hell breaks loose, right?

220
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:51,617
They got guys coming out of the doors,
others flew out of the windows...

221
01:05:52,117 --> 01:05:54,560
Everybody is screaming inside,
I rush in, I charge in,

222
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:55,887
and there's Tom,
busting heads.

223
01:05:55,987 --> 01:05:57,690
They wouldn't turn the music down.

224
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:02,502
Tom's always gonna be Tom.
He's like a guided missile, locks on...

225
01:06:02,602 --> 01:06:04,139
That's it.

226
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:25,768
- Yeah?
- Hey, so I just talked to Scribble.

227
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:29,713
Fremont and Coates, or whoever they are,
want to meet us.

228
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:33,234
- When?
- Tonight.

229
01:06:34,634 --> 01:06:36,504
I see you at Vice in an hour.

230
01:06:47,455 --> 01:06:49,450
I know it's late,
I'm sorry.

231
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:53,767
- I wanted you to have this.
- And that is?

232
01:06:55,067 --> 01:06:57,120
It's the video
of your husband's murder.

233
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,789
It shows everything.

234
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:02,021
Why are you doing this?

235
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:05,191
Because I know how not knowing hurts.

236
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,562
When I lost my wife,
she was with another man.

237
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:14,484
She had a blood clut in her brain,
and then it burst.

238
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,656
The bastard dumped her outside
of the hospital and...

239
01:07:21,656 --> 01:07:23,785
she died quite alone on the sidewalk.

240
01:07:27,562 --> 01:07:28,943
Linda...

241
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:31,742
I am sorry for wanting to hurt Terrence.

242
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:33,762
and I'm sorry for your loss.

243
01:07:35,362 --> 01:07:37,586
I want you to know
he didn't die alone.

244
01:07:38,386 --> 01:07:40,935
and that the men who killed him
are gonna pay.

245
01:07:51,669 --> 01:07:53,740
That won't bring him back.

246
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,693
And that won't bring your wife back.

247
01:07:58,893 --> 01:08:00,521
I don't care.

248
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:06,135
Not in my name.
Please.

249
01:08:07,135 --> 01:08:08,997
Not in my name.

250
01:08:10,597 --> 01:08:12,609
That doesn't wash away blood.

251
01:08:14,409 --> 01:08:16,311
Shouldn't we roll with backup?

252
01:08:16,411 --> 01:08:19,065
- Fuck backup.
- What? Why?

253
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:22,859
What do you think
is going to happen tonight?

254
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:24,869
Do you think I'm
throwing the cuffs on these boys,

255
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:28,081
drive them back to the barn
and write it up?

256
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,835
Here's the deal:

257
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:34,655
I'm going out there
and you go now,

258
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:38,116
and we never ever gonna
discuss any of this again.

259
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:39,443
What? What do you mean?

260
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:42,540
It means Fremont and Coates
never existed and we never met.

261
01:08:47,266 --> 01:08:49,086
I'm not going home tonight, Tom.

262
01:08:49,486 --> 01:08:50,992
Look, Paul...

263
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:54,349
This thing you want,
that you think you want,

264
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:56,065
you don't want.

265
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,779
You don't know
who I am or what I want.

266
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:01,416
Who are you to judge me?

267
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:05,395
You want to be a gunfighter, huh?

268
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,435
Then let's do it.

269
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:33,548
Back on the nightwatch, Tom?

270
01:09:35,398 --> 01:09:38,445
You two keep
being seen all over town.

271
01:09:40,653 --> 01:09:44,111
Tom, did you really think
I was gonna do nothing about you?

272
01:09:44,874 --> 01:09:47,811
If you're gonna do something,
do it now.

273
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:53,742
I know you want my scalp
nailed to your wall,

274
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:55,168
but then who's gonna
go in when the law won't?

275
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:57,446
You, Captain?

276
01:09:58,346 --> 01:09:59,556
You?

277
01:10:00,056 --> 01:10:02,080
You gonna clean up the needles
and baby parts?

278
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:06,128
No. You need me
and our company of men.

279
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:08,925
You hate me
but you need me.

280
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:13,293
Ludlow...

281
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:16,870
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need you,

282
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,528
but goddamn if you don't need me, son.

283
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,044
Hey, detective.

284
01:10:29,544 --> 01:10:30,929
You've ever asked yourself

285
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,540
if Washington's dead
because he was dirty

286
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,710
or because he came clean?

287
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:49,640
Swap your rounds out.

288
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,926
We don't want the coroner digging...

289
01:10:52,026 --> 01:10:53,853
department issue ammo
out of these assholes.

290
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:58,149
Use the gloves.

291
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:03,154
Jesus,
these are some serious man slappers.

292
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:07,192
So we just go in there and kill them?

293
01:11:09,284 --> 01:11:11,787
No, I 'm gonna ask
them some questions.

294
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:14,765
Then we're gonna kill them.

295
01:11:57,206 --> 01:11:58,743
Fucking time, man.

296
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:01,412
No gun?

297
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:04,372
You know that's some bullshit, right?

298
01:12:04,472 --> 01:12:06,333
These dudes is monsters, right?

299
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:10,488
I mean, if they can't fuck it, rob it
or kill it, they don't want it.

300
01:12:13,056 --> 01:12:15,584
- Ready?
- Yeah.

301
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:21,814
- Make the introduction.
- All right. Tried take.???

302
01:12:46,297 --> 01:12:48,925
Get fucking in here.
- Shit, man.

303
01:12:49,025 --> 01:12:50,878
You, move to the fucking wall.

304
01:12:51,128 --> 01:12:53,337
What the hell is this?
You know we're cops.

305
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:54,739
Get over there.

306
01:12:54,839 --> 01:12:57,685
- They're cool, man.
- Shut the fuck up, Scribble.

307
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,187
Get in here.

308
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,393
Yo, do you think I'm fucking playing?

309
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:05,749
Get your asses against the wall
before you find your brains up here.

310
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:07,047
We're here to do business.

311
01:13:07,147 --> 01:13:09,229
If you want me feel me up,
come on and try it.

312
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:12,060
Oh, shit. You want a fill of shit?

313
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,102
Cause he ain't taking it out for you.

314
01:13:15,702 --> 01:13:18,851
Shut the fuck up, Richard.
Scribble say they good.

315
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:21,749
- Scribble, what's up
with these fools, man?

316
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:23,068
They good, man. They cool.

317
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:26,355
- Nigger, take a seat.
- Fucking asshole!

318
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:30,952
- You wanna drink?
- No, we're good.

319
01:13:34,262 --> 01:13:36,908
Man, we got the one time
opportunity.

320
01:13:38,608 --> 01:13:42,621
Motherfucking PoPo.
Is there any square cops out there?

321
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:45,661
Or is everybody out for theirs?

322
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:48,226
Everyone's out for theirs.

323
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:50,633
- Way of the world.
- Duh.

324
01:13:50,933 --> 01:13:52,606
Cops are like weeds...

325
01:13:52,706 --> 01:13:55,866
You pull one out,
and two more fucking grow back.

326
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:58,805
Well, Washington got greedy.

327
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:05,753
Don't shoot me now, I'm just
gonna get something out of my pocket.

328
01:14:09,714 --> 01:14:11,584
This is just a sample.

329
01:14:12,684 --> 01:14:14,419
We're all about weight.

330
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:17,205
We can help you transport.
letting you know if there's heat.

331
01:14:17,405 --> 01:14:19,724
letting you know if you're selling
to a narc or a snitch,

332
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:22,404
or bust people
and sell you their shit.

333
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:35,600
We're all about weight, too.

334
01:14:37,192 --> 01:14:40,087
Look at that shit.
That's sexy right there.

335
01:14:40,887 --> 01:14:42,906
That's better than pussy.

336
01:14:43,406 --> 01:14:47,540
That's better than money.
Ain't no Mexican tar neither.

337
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:51,190
That's their worldwide war
on terror dope, nigger.

338
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:54,151
Pure Afghan home.

339
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:57,095
Lord, we know this chap.

340
01:14:57,395 --> 01:15:00,137
That's the same motherfucker
that was in the market...

341
01:15:00,237 --> 01:15:02,100
the day we pushed Washington??? back.

342
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:04,539
Hell, yeah.

343
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:07,081
That was you, right?

344
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:09,314
Come on, man, cool, man.

345
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:12,602
Y'all just chill out.
I see where this is going, all right?

346
01:15:12,702 --> 01:15:13,644
Everybody just be cool, man.

347
01:15:13,744 --> 01:15:15,146
We got all these
thrilling opportunities.

348
01:15:15,246 --> 01:15:19,051
- I'm gonna pump me some of this shit--
- Shut your fat ass up.

349
01:15:22,412 --> 01:15:24,519
Is that what you're here for, dawg?

350
01:15:25,019 --> 01:15:26,772
You here to get some get-back...

351
01:15:26,872 --> 01:15:29,300
for that sorry ass
nigger, Detective Ludlow?

352
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,650
No, you guys did me a favor.

353
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:39,046
So you know who I am
and I know who you're not.

354
01:15:39,746 --> 01:15:43,643
If you're not Fremont and Coates,
then who the hell are you?

355
01:15:45,476 --> 01:15:48,256
Who are we, detective?

356
01:15:50,481 --> 01:15:52,851
We're straight nightmares.

357
01:15:53,151 --> 01:15:57,719
We're the walking, talking
"exigent circumstances".

358
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:01,352
Ludlow, wait!
I know these guyss!

359
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:21,805
It's all over, detective.

360
01:16:22,605 --> 01:16:24,007
Shit!

361
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:25,967
I will do your bitch ass
like my nigger did our partner.

362
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:27,411
Hold on, Diskant, hold on.

363
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:29,083
What the fuck are you doing?

364
01:16:29,183 --> 01:16:31,440
Nigger, pick that gun up and
blast the motherfucker!

365
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,509
[I'm scared, ] dawg.

366
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:36,988
The next one in your
dome (head), nigger.

367
01:16:39,322 --> 01:16:41,650
- Winston, don't do it!
- "Winston"?

368
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,620
Winston? What the fuck is that?
That's your slave name, nigger.

369
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,522
Do it, nigger.
Man, kill them whiteboy!

370
01:16:47,722 --> 01:16:50,730
Yo, white man killed a whiteboy.????

371
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,755
- I can't, man.
- Fuck this nigger!

372
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:58,835
Comin' out, dawg, cover me.
Come on.

373
01:17:04,263 --> 01:17:05,878
Hang on.

374
01:17:06,078 --> 01:17:07,336
Hang on.

375
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:12,981
- Let me see.
- Why are you crying?

376
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,813
Take that off.

377
01:19:19,866 --> 01:19:21,577
Sit down, Tom.

378
01:19:24,028 --> 01:19:25,606
It went bad, Grace.

379
01:19:26,206 --> 01:19:27,683
I know...

380
01:19:27,933 --> 01:19:29,310
I know.

381
01:19:33,913 --> 01:19:35,716
I should have gone alone.

382
01:19:36,016 --> 01:19:38,020
I took a boy to a gunfight.

383
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:42,698
Why are you crying?

384
01:19:42,998 --> 01:19:44,882
What's wrong?

385
01:19:44,982 --> 01:19:46,962
What's wrong?

386
01:19:49,896 --> 01:19:51,890
<i>...in our coverage of tonight's story</i>

387
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:55,927
<i>Detective Tom Ludlow, an 18 year veteran
of the Los Angeles police department,</i>

388
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:57,605
<i>is wanted in connection
with the shooting deaths</i>

389
01:19:57,754 --> 01:20:01,659
<i>of two undercover deputy sheriffs
in the early hours of the morning.</i>

390
01:20:01,758 --> 01:20:03,423
<i>Officials have yet to confirm...</i>

391
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:06,044
<i>a third victim who may
also be a police officer.</i>

392
01:20:06,162 --> 01:20:08,192
<i>In addition, they have
stated Detective Ludlow...</i>

393
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:09,983
<i>was off duty at the
time of the shootings</i>

394
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,941
<i>- and is the only suspect in yet another</i>
- Cunts.

395
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,852
tragedy of the L.A. law enforcement.</i>

396
01:20:14,525 --> 01:20:15,780
<i>Of course we will
continue to bring you...</i>

397
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,534
How do they know that?
That they were cops?

398
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:21,833
I just left.
It's on the news?

399
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:24,340
Did you do it?

400
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:28,126
Of course you did it.

401
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:30,149
I had no idea
they were deputies,

402
01:20:30,249 --> 01:20:31,613
but I should have.

403
01:20:31,713 --> 01:20:34,317
"Exigent circumstances".
Jesus!

404
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,095
What is wrong with you?
Huh?

405
01:20:38,395 --> 01:20:41,965
Why can't you have
a normal life like everyone else?

406
01:20:42,365 --> 01:20:44,059
- I should go.
- No.

407
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,854
- No, you're not going out there.
- This is gonna be a nightmare, Grace.

408
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:49,648
- I gotta go.
- No, Tom.

409
01:20:49,748 --> 01:20:51,567
The door is staying closed.

410
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:55,229
Every cop in L.A. is hunting for you,
you wanna get killed?

411
01:20:57,455 --> 01:20:59,941
You need to get away from me, okay?

412
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:02,262
You need to get far away.

413
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:06,099
Everything I touch dies.

414
01:21:07,599 --> 01:21:09,168
Down on the fucking floor!

415
01:21:09,768 --> 01:21:13,221
- ???????
- Now!

416
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,411
- Don't say a fucking word.
- No, please.

417
01:21:15,711 --> 01:21:17,310
Shut up.

418
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:20,421
Get up.

419
01:21:23,765 --> 01:21:26,435
You're an asshole. You're going down.
You killed two fucking cops.

420
01:21:26,535 --> 01:21:28,246
What's the matter with you?

421
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:31,333
Get that piece of shit out of here.

422
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:46,555
- Downtown is the other way.
- We're not going downtown.

423
01:21:46,655 --> 01:21:48,358
Where are you going?

424
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,486
That bitch of yours is fine.

425
01:21:52,586 --> 01:21:55,201
- What?
- Saw you with Washington's widow.

426
01:21:55,601 --> 01:21:57,729
You're fucking them both, huh?

427
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:01,528
- Which one are you feeling, Dante?
- I like Linda.

428
01:22:01,628 --> 01:22:04,156
You shouldn't have given
her the video, Lud.

429
01:22:04,256 --> 01:22:06,283
What the fuck were you thinking?

430
01:22:06,383 --> 01:22:08,383
- You handed that bitch
your death sentence.

431
01:22:08,484 --> 01:22:09,878
The hell are you talking about?

432
01:22:10,086 --> 01:22:11,746
We've been watching you, asshole.

433
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:14,116
How many times were
you told to let it go?

434
01:22:14,466 --> 01:22:16,480
- How many?
- Let's go home.

435
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,378
Fuck him.
Look what he's making us do.

436
01:22:18,478 --> 01:22:20,297
Smug fucking punk.

437
01:22:20,397 --> 01:22:21,798
Did you figure it out, Lud?

438
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,392
How do Fremont and Coates
make it to the market that day?

439
01:22:24,492 --> 01:22:27,713
After Washington got them kicked
loose, you picked 'em back up.

440
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:29,931
You took them to the hills
and popped their melons, right?

441
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:31,558
You should be a detective.

442
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:34,853
- We took some DNA samples first.
- Little bit of hair, a little spit.

443
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:36,688
Voil.
Fremont and Coates did it.

444
01:22:36,788 --> 01:22:40,108
Who signed out the dope
wasn't Washington. You.

445
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,836
That was gonna be
incinerated. Might as well...

446
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,528
sell it and make a dollar
out of it, you know?

447
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:45,497
For you or the cookie jar?

448
01:22:50,293 --> 01:22:53,463
You're not that smart, Santos.
Who is in?

449
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,966
Silky?
Clady?

450
01:23:02,222 --> 01:23:03,848
Wander.

451
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,477
Wander.

452
01:23:12,023 --> 01:23:14,150
It's a Wander caper all the way.

453
01:23:15,277 --> 01:23:17,437
He's the only one who
could pull those strings.

454
01:23:17,537 --> 01:23:19,614
He should have pulled
your string years ago.

455
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:21,950
We couldn't figure out why the fuck
he kept you around all this time.

456
01:23:22,117 --> 01:23:25,987
He's Jack's little pet. He's been doing
the man's dirty missions for years.

457
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:28,456
Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs.

458
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:34,713
He was giving up the big dog.
He was giving up the king.

459
01:23:35,005 --> 01:23:37,799
Wander played your fool ass, puto.
We all have.

460
01:23:38,758 --> 01:23:40,302
You're a fucking chum, bro.

461
01:23:46,933 --> 01:23:49,469
Washington's killers,
were they really cops?

462
01:23:49,569 --> 01:23:51,783
Yeah, they were. Couple
deputies from the ghetto,

463
01:23:51,883 --> 01:23:53,265
having the time of their lives.

464
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:54,579
And they were making a lot of money.

465
01:23:54,679 --> 01:23:55,966
Those were gonna punch
your ticket (kill you),

466
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:56,767
but you punched theirs.

467
01:23:56,785 --> 01:23:58,570
Yeah, now we gotta punch yours.

468
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:00,488
Up in the hills.

469
01:24:00,614 --> 01:24:02,023
Up in hte hills, brother.

470
01:24:02,123 --> 01:24:04,025
First we bite your hair,
saliva and blood.

471
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,319
When they finally know
Washington's corps,

472
01:24:06,419 --> 01:24:08,321
guess whose DNA gonna be all over it?

473
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:09,873
And what is it gonna look like?

474
01:24:10,707 --> 01:24:13,610
Like you finally snapped
just like everyone knew you would.

475
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,829
That little nurse of yours, Lud?

476
01:24:15,929 --> 01:24:17,867
You knw, I'm popping a 100 milli Viagra

477
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,508
and I'm gonna work
that little brown ass.

478
01:24:21,092 --> 01:24:23,011
And then I'm gonna break her neck.

479
01:24:29,726 --> 01:24:32,270
Get the fucking cuffs off me!

480
01:24:37,817 --> 01:24:40,153
Get off, you motherfucker!

481
01:24:40,904 --> 01:24:43,031
Motherfucker!

482
01:24:50,622 --> 01:24:52,457
Motherfucker!

483
01:25:04,386 --> 01:25:07,831
Well hello there, handsome.
Did you have a nice nap?

484
01:25:32,747 --> 01:25:35,083
Santos, your girlfriend's getting away.

485
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:42,841
What are you doing, Lud?
Are you crawling to your own grave?

486
01:25:43,508 --> 01:25:45,844
Watch me play with this fool.
Hey pendecho.

487
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:03,445
Oh, yeah.

488
01:26:07,365 --> 01:26:09,576
Who is the boy now, motherfucker? Huh?

489
01:26:10,327 --> 01:26:12,195
Homeboy wants to bury himself.

490
01:26:12,295 --> 01:26:14,372
Just do the fucking????
and let's go.

491
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:27,127
This is it, Lud.

492
01:26:29,512 --> 01:26:32,591
- This is how it ends.
- DeMille, what the fuck? Let's go, bro!

493
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:34,601
Shut up, I'm having fun!

494
01:27:22,357 --> 01:27:24,902
Where is the fucking disk?

495
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,240
Where is the disk?

496
01:27:54,848 --> 01:27:56,216
Come here.

497
01:27:56,316 --> 01:27:57,492
You're a lot tougher than...

498
01:27:57,592 --> 01:27:59,469
that piece of shit
husband you used to have.

499
01:28:01,187 --> 01:28:02,814
????? is off.

500
01:28:05,317 --> 01:28:07,444
We 're gonna be here all night.

501
01:28:19,956 --> 01:28:23,376
You gotta go, Linda.
wherever it is, you gotta go.

502
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:25,712
I have everything packed.

503
01:28:26,671 --> 01:28:28,590
Take care of yourself, detective.

504
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:36,681
Where do you wanna go, copkiller?

505
01:28:54,366 --> 01:28:56,168
I let myself in.

506
01:28:58,127 --> 01:28:59,796
Clearly.

507
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:03,333
You all right, Tom?
I've been worried about you.

508
01:29:04,292 --> 01:29:07,579
Apparently I killed two deputies.
Diskant is dead.

509
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,217
Santos and DeMille
dragged me out to die,

510
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:11,466
so I put them down.

511
01:29:12,759 --> 01:29:13,914
- Can you fix this, Jack?

512
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:15,845
Oh, I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna fix it.

513
01:29:16,054 --> 01:29:17,687
You know, I suspected that
Santos and DeMille...

514
01:29:17,787 --> 01:29:19,210
were capering with with
Washington, but...

515
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,594
I don't want to believe that this
kind of shit was going on in my unit.

516
01:29:22,694 --> 01:29:24,062
Yeah, me neither.

517
01:29:24,396 --> 01:29:27,307
Boss, you better get Clady up here.
I need you guys.

518
01:29:27,407 --> 01:29:28,817
I'll get him in the loop.

519
01:29:29,276 --> 01:29:32,362
Better plan what we're doing.
You need an alibi.

520
01:29:32,696 --> 01:29:37,200
You were sleeping on a
couch after the party.

521
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:41,037
Santos and DeMille, they killed
those deppies, not you. Not you.

522
01:29:50,297 --> 01:29:52,757
[He's here. Kill him. King's X. ]

523
01:29:55,176 --> 01:29:58,930
This is Clady's phone,
and his badge.

524
01:30:00,265 --> 01:30:02,634
All this is you.
It's you, Jack.

525
01:30:02,934 --> 01:30:04,795
No, it's you.
It's you, Tom.

526
01:30:04,895 --> 01:30:07,264
Honor it!
Fucking honor it!

527
01:30:07,772 --> 01:30:08,857
You knew they were cops.

528
01:30:08,957 --> 01:30:10,824
Those guys are so deep
undercover that they--

529
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:12,152
They lost their fucking minds!

530
01:30:12,452 --> 01:30:13,937
Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them.

531
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:16,732
You set me up.
You sent me into dying, Jack!

532
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:18,108
I didn't set you up!

533
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:21,278
You set yourself up!
I was trying to save you.

534
01:30:21,378 --> 01:30:23,029
You're backing up in a fucking corner--

535
01:30:23,129 --> 01:30:25,582
- You killed Washington!
- Fuck him!

536
01:30:25,707 --> 01:30:29,419
Fuck Santos. Fuck DeMille. Fuck Clady.
Fuck 'em all.

537
01:30:29,628 --> 01:30:31,204
Fuck them all!

538
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:33,089
They are a dime a dozen (worthless).

539
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:34,608
You.

540
01:30:35,217 --> 01:30:38,845
You man.
You're special.

541
01:30:39,137 --> 01:30:41,932
- You're special to me.
- Diskant.

542
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:44,309
He is special.

543
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:46,962
I've watched a good man die
because of you.

544
01:30:47,162 --> 01:30:50,750
That is entirely your fault.

545
01:30:52,108 --> 01:30:53,568
Come on, Tom.

546
01:30:53,777 --> 01:30:55,746
I know we can get past this.

547
01:30:58,573 --> 01:31:01,368
We got a destiny,
you and me.

548
01:31:03,286 --> 01:31:04,996
Nobody's getting past this, Jack.

549
01:31:05,956 --> 01:31:09,626
Everything ends now.
You end now.

550
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:02,295
I surrender.
I surrender.

551
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:04,923
Hook me and book me.

552
01:32:07,517 --> 01:32:09,811
Come over right there.

553
01:32:10,604 --> 01:32:14,474
Put it out. One for
transport. Goddamn.

554
01:32:14,574 --> 01:32:17,119
Tom Ludlow, he's got his man now.

555
01:32:22,407 --> 01:32:27,412
I've found you
and I've made you...possible.

556
01:32:30,415 --> 01:32:32,542
Now you need me more than ever, Tom.

557
01:32:33,585 --> 01:32:36,796
What did you think I'd do
when I found out?

558
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:42,052
Wait, man.
Wait.

559
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:44,930
Wait.

560
01:32:50,143 --> 01:32:51,645
In my wall.

561
01:32:53,772 --> 01:32:56,191
It is all there in the wall.

562
01:32:57,359 --> 01:32:59,736
These secrets, they're killing us.

563
01:33:07,244 --> 01:33:08,995
???, open it up.

564
01:33:12,457 --> 01:33:14,751
Open it up.
Tear it down.

565
01:33:27,681 --> 01:33:29,474
Tear it down.

566
01:33:34,854 --> 01:33:36,314
Hit it.

567
01:33:40,443 --> 01:33:41,861
Here it is.

568
01:33:50,328 --> 01:33:52,647
This is my power.

569
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:57,168
This is my crown.

570
01:33:58,712 --> 01:34:01,006
I'm the king of secrets, Tom.

571
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:03,880
I know which city council man is
doing lines,

572
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,710
I know who likes boys.

573
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:08,839
I know who's selling contracts.
I know who's beaten his wife.

574
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:12,684
I own them!
Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom.

575
01:34:13,894 --> 01:34:18,064
How you think that I've been able
to protect you all these years?

576
01:34:19,107 --> 01:34:23,820
What do you think is it you're doing?
All these missions.

577
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:28,834
How do you think you're able
to touch the untouchables?

578
01:34:30,285 --> 01:34:32,120
I'm gonna be chief!

579
01:34:32,787 --> 01:34:34,497
I will be chief!

580
01:34:34,706 --> 01:34:36,416
I will be mayor!

581
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:39,794
This is our world, Tom.

582
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:42,297
So let's take it.

583
01:34:42,672 --> 01:34:44,591
Is that why you put a hit on Washington?

584
01:34:44,716 --> 01:34:46,968
Why you tried to kill me?

585
01:34:47,093 --> 01:34:49,546
So you can keep stuffing
money in your wall?

586
01:34:49,646 --> 01:34:51,719
But this is our money.

587
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:54,393
The unit's.

588
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,167
Who do you think paid for

589
01:34:57,267 --> 01:35:00,065
Silky's defense, doing
all those law suits?

590
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,027
Who's going to pay for your retirement?

591
01:35:05,195 --> 01:35:08,073
I just corrected a
flaw in the system, Tom.

592
01:35:08,365 --> 01:35:11,510
This is about cops helping cops.

593
01:35:13,286 --> 01:35:18,333
And if a teacher
or a fireman could do it,

594
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,252
they would do it, too.

595
01:35:23,088 --> 01:35:26,341
What happened to just
locking up bad people?

596
01:35:28,677 --> 01:35:31,346
We're all bad, Tom.

597
01:35:49,698 --> 01:35:52,117
You were my best friend.

598
01:35:56,913 --> 01:35:59,165
We were family.

599
01:36:30,614 --> 01:36:32,282
Drop it, Ludlow.

600
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:44,628
It's been enough killing.

601
01:36:49,307 --> 01:36:51,243
I came as soon as you called.

602
01:36:51,902 --> 01:36:53,721
Guess you're first on scene.

603
01:36:57,341 --> 01:36:59,235
No, you were.

604
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:11,655
Looks like Jack's friends
got greedy, came after the money.

605
01:37:12,981 --> 01:37:14,967
Is that what it looks like?

606
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:20,030
This your plan, Captain?

607
01:37:20,622 --> 01:37:23,717
Just sit back and
let us all kill each other?

608
01:37:23,817 --> 01:37:25,686
You were the plan.

609
01:37:28,213 --> 01:37:30,257
No one else could touch him.

610
01:37:30,882 --> 01:37:35,053
Once your eyes were opened,
there was no other outcome.

611
01:37:39,332 --> 01:37:41,260
Decisions were made, Tom,

612
01:37:41,768 --> 01:37:45,105
- by powerful men with powerful secrets.
- Captain?

613
01:37:46,273 --> 01:37:48,100
They were afraid of Jack

614
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,018
and they asked me to help.

615
01:37:52,153 --> 01:37:57,434
One day, you will pass the chief
in the hall and he will give you a nod.

616
01:37:57,834 --> 01:37:59,536
And you will know why.

617
01:38:02,831 --> 01:38:04,633
Because you were right, Tom.

618
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,028
We do need you.

619
01:38:34,918 --> 01:38:38,618
Transcript by rogard.
Say "Thank you", because...

620
01:38:38,951 --> 01:38:41,052
you just looked at
several hours of my life.: -)
