1
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:41,120
"A belief in a supernatural source
Evil is not necessary.

2
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:45,199
Men, by itself,
are quite capable of all evil ... "

3
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,740
My God ...

4
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,269
How did we get to this point?

5
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,167
GIVE WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS
GIVE PROTECTION TO WOMEN

6
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:03,275
Directed by ...

7
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,483
How do you feel, soft?

8
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:25,622
I'm fine.
It still hurts a bit the head.

9
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,370
Nothing! Well you said.

10
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:34,366
Sorry, Trixie.
It was supposed to run well.

11
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:22,218
Do not get up, Mija on Shoes!

12
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,941
They must be kidding me.

13
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,214
I trusted you, Boom-Boom.

14
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:39,275
- E betrayed me.
- Sorry.

15
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,921
Are you feeling sad, honey?

16
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,859
Thankfully,
stabbed in the back!

17
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:47,996
So much for subtle wit, Gage.
Know why we are here.

18
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,230
Who hell are you?

19
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,884
Besides a good chunk of vulva
I loved beating like a door.

20
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,469
Where, Gage?

21
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,338
Well, honey ...

22
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,386
... not sure
to what you're referring to.

23
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:04,871
And even though he knew, would have to ask you,
very politely, of course ...

24
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,829
for mo ... branches.

25
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,125
Whatever.

26
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,563
Here we go.

27
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,394
Are you still screwed me, Camero?

28
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,517
Obviously not.

29
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,808
Yes ..

30
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,654
That's right.

31
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,352
That's right.

32
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:30,145
I knew you could not resist
Mr. Sticky much longer.

33
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,983
- You said you liked the area.
- That's right.

34
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:38,999
- Where is the material?
- Chupa-mos, the dyke psychopath.

35
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:46,372
If I tell you where they are buried,
'll kill me with it.

36
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:50,269
So why did you and the
your entourage of stuffed rats

37
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,647
not join and make me a tip?

38
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:58,682
How about doings thou me one to me?

39
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:00,603
So are buried.

40
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,852
You are laughing at you for what?

41
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,228
You.
I'm laughing at the thought of you.

42
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,451
Always with his nose
briefs in the other.

43
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,448
I do what I want when I want.

44
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,771
Muff as you are
that will always be used.

45
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,420
I told you never to call me that.

46
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,257
Lets you, please leave it.

47
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:33,104
Fuck you, loose!
It is because of you that he is here.

48
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,852
4 HOURS BEFORE

49
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:48,421
- What happened?
- Open the bag!

50
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,894
Let.

51
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,421
What the fuck!

52
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,874
What the hell is wrong with you?

53
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:03,329
How difficult was it to put a
single tablet in the cup?

54
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,531
- What are you doing?
- She is a brunette with blond pussy, Hel.

55
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:09,581
- With the taste of dog with two dicks.
- Enough!

56
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,952
- Behave yourself.
- You promised me that she was capable.

57
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,433
- What happened?
- I do not know. I did everything you said,

58
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,967
... the fault is not mine!
- The hell is that it is not!

59
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,125
Everything is destroyed.
Now I'll never find them.

60
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,879
- 35.34.08.81 N. ..
- What?

61
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,994
The Gage wrote it in a photograph.
A kind of desert, seen from space.

62
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:29,794
- And that serves us so?
- Can be coordinated vector.

63
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,929
- Are you sure about the numbers?
- Yes.

64
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,424
I have photographic memory.
My mother used to say he wanted

65
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,291
I was born a dwarf ...
- Come on!

66
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,802
Tell us where to dig and the door rises.

67
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,964
It's as simple as that.

68
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,739
- What is happening to it?
- My heart ...

69
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,435
- Gage?
- No, Trixie, stop!

70
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,458
Cow stupid shit.

71
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,169
More stupid than a door.

72
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:14,526
Now ... take me away ...

73
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,493
... or childbirth her neck.
- Party at home. Are we the shit.

74
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:18,514
What?

75
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,108
Give me the keys and the gun ...

76
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,619
... right now.
- Okay.

77
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,281
Do him no harm.

78
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,491
Okay ... now the pistol.

79
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,223
Holy shit.

80
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,860
I blew up with the tomatoes.

81
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:46,349
That's two you owe me,
Spit semen.

82
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,444
- My God, you could have hit me!
- But do not hit.

83
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,507
- You're crazy!
- No problem.

84
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,721
He finished the game, Gage.
Next stop: village brown.

85
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,665
If I tell you ...

86
00:10:56,997 --> 00:11:00,206
The Pinky ... I will do things
not even imagine.

87
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:02,902
Pinky?

88
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,082
What is the Pinky to do with it?

89
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,457
With that shit think
they are dealing?

90
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,306
- You work for Pinky?
- Yes

91
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,586
Now you are no longer
so smart, do you?

92
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:16,528
His goats stupid
Pinky when you know it ...

93
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,263
... are all dead.

94
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,639
What is he talking about?
Who is Pinky?

95
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,872
If it helps us,

96
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:30,518
not only let you live, how you
take for a safe place.

97
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,484
What? No, it was not
part of the agreement.

98
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,271
I can not.

99
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:44,981
I was hoping you said that.

100
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,629
Tell them and ready, Gage.
Please tell them.

101
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,878
Okay, okay.

102
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,018
Piece of shit.

103
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,599
Are there.

104
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,687
The 15 steps east of the van.

105
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:10,331
Trixie, get those blades
alongside the caravan.

106
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,645
Camero, is over time.
Covers her mouth and put it in the car.

107
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,594
- What? Let's not even ...?
- Who knows if you are lying?

108
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,975
If they come trouble,
we need something to negotiate.

109
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,466
- This is bullshit.
- Do it and go!

110
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,727
You receive orders rather than
a young boy in Bangkok.

111
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,912
Shut your fucking mouth.

112
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:42,000
You can have an agreement with her,
but do not have one with me.

113
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:44,966
Who are they?

114
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,143
Puppets
to get what I want.

115
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,289
How do you know you can trust them?

116
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,733
Especially that.
The fucking stripper.

117
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,416
It is dangerous.
You put yourself to stick with it.

118
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,904
Will you stop moving.

119
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,145
Do not turn your back on this crazy!

120
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,546
She will betray you. As did
with others in the Glory Hole!

121
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,479
What is he talking about?

122
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:15,302
They do not know, do you?

123
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,829
- You were the Glory Hole?
- Was, yes indeed.

124
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,263
It was a Camero that killed Liberty e. ..

125
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,998
Bye-bye, Dick Mole.

126
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:38,601
4 HOURS 3 MINUTES BEFORE and

127
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,921
CAN NOT SEE!
WHAT?

128
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,432
I love Home Depot.

129
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,170
Now, listen, your bitch.

130
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,182
I have a reputation
to be very persuasive.

131
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,264
And I know that thou art virtuous
with those neck muscles.

132
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,188
So it's good you start to talk ...

133
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:40,757
... or shove it up for your cousin above.

134
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,631
You passed up?
This was not part of the plan.

135
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:08,559
- Perhaps not part of your plan.
- You told me that nobody would hurt.

136
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,898
- You promised me!
- I know, Trixie. I know.

137
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,905
We could not keep Gage alive.
He was dangerous.

138
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:16,420
No! I said right at the outset:
we did not kill anyone!

139
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:19,686
Now all we have is a corpse
leading to Pinky. And nothing in his hands.

140
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,829
- My God, will hold us forever.
- Shut up, Raw Machado.

141
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,023
Shut up.

142
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,070
- What did you say?
- Back, Camero.

143
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:28,829
No, why not let the Cleavage of
Ravine defend itself?

144
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,844
What did you mean with the Gage
"Also you will betray us"?

145
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:31,998
You are fucking up the court, Hel.

146
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,547
And why not say that
been in the Glory Hole?

147
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:34,929
And why did not you tell me
you knew the Gage?

148
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,550
Why not know.
He was lying.

149
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,042
Exactly.

150
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,439
It was this same person-Drawn fucks
conspirator was trying to do.

151
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,087
What we turned in
against each other.

152
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,632
He is a master manipulator, Hel.

153
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,113
Also,
told us where is the material.

154
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,363
Where is hope!
He could be trying to gain time.

155
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,487
He trusted me ...

156
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,750
... and now is dead.

157
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:00,495
6 HOURS BEFORE

158
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,042
Yes, it's great.

159
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,110
That's right.
Shows what you have there.

160
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,696
- You like that?
- Yes, Daddy likes.

161
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,970
Then try this.

162
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,391
Goddamn.

163
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,623
I call this movement
"Shock and Awe".

164
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:38,430
Never felt so
for a girl.

165
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:43,049
You are so cute.

166
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,489
And you are decent and pure,

167
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,281
and I love you.

168
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:49,415
Now, because
to put them together,

169
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,590
we are beautiful somersaults,
and treat such clams your thirsty?

170
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,048
Drink to that.

171
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,715
Damn.

172
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,237
Have got to be strong and
you concentres, Trixie.

173
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:12,572
Remember why we are here.
All we need it.

174
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,025
Especially you ...

175
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,383
What is this?

176
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,615
Comes from Gage.

177
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,871
Indicative of the Los Angeles area.

178
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,677
I thought I told you
for you search the pockets.

179
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,831
- What is stress? Serves.
- Stress?

180
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,150
With the right equipment,
anyone finds this phone.

181
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,481
If this is the Pinky,
or some of the men Gage

182
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,392
they now know it and we
are even here.

183
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:53,533
My God ...

184
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,983
See? This is what happens
when you do not do what you're told.

185
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,055
Fuck you, Hel! I reviewed it.
He had no phone when we left.

186
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,686
- Obviously had.
- Are you calling me a liar?

187
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,842
- I'm calling you careless.
- Stop! Both!

188
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,446
What do we do now?

189
00:18:09,897 --> 00:18:11,394
I know what I'll do.

190
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:17,085
Relax, Hel!
That call did not mean anything.

191
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:21,228
It was probably one of his whores
used to want to be leased for a while.

192
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:22,795
We can not risk it.

193
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:26,423
We find that
come and get out of here. Fast!

194
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:30,154
For me, fine. Sooner
blow up with this hole, the better.

195
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:33,343
And Gage?

196
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:35,671
Leave it for now.

197
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,041
Bury him when we're done.

198
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,534
This was supposed to have been easy.

199
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,157
So ...

200
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,457
... who is this Pinky?

201
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,191
Guys?

202
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,333
The Pinky is a personality
famous underworld.

203
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:09,856
It sells drugs, weapons,
smuggling industrial ...

204
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,036
Organizes groups of killers
fleets of counterfeit material ...

205
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:15,007
The rumor that has contracts
governmental murder

206
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,801
and arms to terrorist cells.

207
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:20,337
Nobody talks to Pinky directly.
And no one even knows how it is.

208
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,376
Many believe
that Pinky is a ghost.

209
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:25,317
Others think
who sold his soul to the devil.

210
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,400
I think he is the devil.

211
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,317
Come ...
They're just trying to scare me.

212
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:32,252
Listen there, Entesoada,

213
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:37,187
've seen their victims hanging
hooks and open as lambs,

214
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:40,173
holding his bowels in his hands
and plead for death.

215
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,446
A few years ago ...

216
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:47,403
called a Russian oligarch
Vladimir 'The Butcher' Popmeov

217
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,843
was behind with Pinky
50 of his best assassins.

218
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,317
The Pinky come that
shit storm armed only

219
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,189
with a sword old and dusty.

220
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,127
When finished ...

221
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:01,384
... the only thing that remained was
a lot of 5 meters

222
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:04,897
dismembered bodies
and the head of Popmeov

223
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:08,787
stuck on top as the
shooting star of the Christmas tree.

224
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,966
No single fret on the street
I die not afraid of him.

225
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,188
And now this guy walks behind us?

226
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,671
Crap.

227
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,170
3 NIGHTS BEFORE

228
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:30,139
My God is so good!
Power, baby.

229
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:38,029
Get off me.
Gotta go.

230
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:50,264
Where is the key, Black Ice?

231
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,642
Fuck you, Mamalhuda.
Not have.

232
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,176
Fuck up, bitch!
Give me the stick.

233
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,710
Darling,
want to go to the back of your life?

234
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:23,868
What?

235
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,164
Nothing.

236
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,741
Fuck.

237
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:39,632
The Gage!

238
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:47,580
Let's put him in the trunk.
Trixie, slap the blood.

239
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:52,549
Come!

240
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,982
This is crazy!

241
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,867
Let's tell the truth
and end this!

242
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,757
Do not say a word!
No way I go back to prison.

243
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,680
- If you have to do, kill him.
- No!

244
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:14,072
Shut up and the two
let me be me talking.

245
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:43,105
Ladies ...

246
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,381
... it's all right here?

247
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,979
We are so glad to see him ...

248
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,359
I saw that the fence was down,
the highway.

249
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,996
You should not be here.

250
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,167
The government used
here to test atomic bombs.

251
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,579
If you stay too long
you grow a third eye.

252
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:05,038
Anyway, how
ladies get here?

253
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:09,567
Well, Officer,
is quite a story.

254
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,801
I have to my sisters

255
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:16,577
are part of the Choir of Virgins
Holy St. Ave, Arizona.

256
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:19,820
Supposedly we
have come today to sing in Mojave.

257
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:23,090
Since we were so far from home,
the director of the local parish suggested

258
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,779
who kindly slept here.

259
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:31,024
Well, when we were all
aconchegadinhas our bed only.

260
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,697
We heard loud music and laughter
coming from outside.

261
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,426
Look outside and saw
all members of the parish

262
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:39,903
dancing and laughing ...

263
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,473
and smoking something
did not seem to be smoking.

264
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,626
They tried to caress our boobs.

265
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:48,129
And yet convinced Bambi Lynn
Hosts of the fire inside ...

266
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,701
Ahead. We went out there and fled to the
our car, but they chased us.

267
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:55,310
Thank God that the Cheyenne
know how to drive and Bambi Lynn knows how to turn,

268
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,048
because we lose them.

269
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,997
But then
were three in the morning ...

270
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:03,166
was dark ...
and we were scared.

271
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,659
And someone is not very good
following statements.

272
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:09,190
And, well ...
we finally get here.

273
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,891
And now
der to believe it ...

274
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:14,075
... our car died.

275
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:21,031
I see.

276
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,019
We tried to put it to work but ...

277
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,093
... can not.

278
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:30,160
That is why we
all dirty and desperate.

279
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:33,377
- You must think the worst of us.
- No.

280
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:35,289
Do not be silly.

281
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:39,361
Already called the trailer
and are way, officer ...

282
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:41,846
... Fuchs.

283
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:45,853
Fuchs. Is a ...

284
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,485
Fuchs, ma'am.

285
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,007
You know, let me take a look.

286
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:56,526
Sometimes, you just have to know
manage these old beauties.

287
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:58,121
This will not be necessary.

288
00:25:58,394 --> 00:25:59,716
Why not?

289
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:02,083
What happened to your hand?

290
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,716
I cut myself on my crucifix.

291
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,714
You know what?

292
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:15,617
The company already in the trailer
charged $ 200 to come here.

293
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,293
They said they would arrive
around noon.

294
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,495
Maybe you can save that money.

295
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:33,771
I no longer do so.

296
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,917
Today it is only
computers and sensors ...

297
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:40,384
You have to work for
NASA just to change the oil.

298
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,892
Well, can give the key?

299
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,559
See? Nothing.

300
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,550
This is strange.
It should be a start.

301
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,947
You know what?

302
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,229
Sometimes, these old cars come with a
toolbox beyond the monkey.

303
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:41,407
You can not!

304
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,262
You can not!

305
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,236
Why not?

306
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:51,031
- Because ...
- Because the lock is rusted.

307
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,782
Not open for years.

308
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:01,588
- She is right?
- It will be great.

309
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,702
Still troubled
with last night.

310
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:06,362
That boys choir
tried to rape her.

311
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:08,519
Listen ...

312
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:11,176
... you have been so helpful and kind.

313
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:14,137
The least I can do
is back and cook for you.

314
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,500
Let ... dinner on Friday?

315
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:23,879
It's a tempting offer but ...

316
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,802
... do so ...

317
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,296
... pass by here later
to make sure that the ladies

318
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:30,795
departed safely.

319
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,753
Have a nice day.

320
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:53,152
I bet you are
Bury us now.

321
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:56,963
We should have told you.
It seemed like a nice guy.

322
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,433
He did not suspect a thing.

323
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:16,868
5 NIGHTS BEFORE

324
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:21,279
DEPARTMENT
Homeland Security

325
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:13,079
Who wants to enter the
my doors of Paradise?

326
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:14,970
I! I want!

327
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,413
I am a priest!

328
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,332
Disappear.

329
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,383
I am in Trixie.

330
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:05,806
Your piece of Paradise.

331
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:10,239
I'm in love.

332
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:11,861
Good girl.

333
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:45,300
- You know, I was thinking.
- Oh, dear.

334
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,159
Is stealing from a criminal
is better than being a criminal?

335
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,700
I have a better for you, Princess.

336
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:56,378
What was the site most extravagant
where have you had sex?

337
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,725
Why do you want to know?

338
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:01,991
Curiosity only.
It says much for a woman.

339
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:07,612
Or was sex in the stands at three
Shock agricultural fair,

340
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:12,146
or on top of a horse-drawn wagon
Amish land with Stelf Jakey.

341
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:13,929
Hel?

342
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:18,209
How about less verbiage and more digging?

343
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,261
Let me start this
your secrets one day, Hel.

344
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,013
I have no secrets.

345
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,276
What about you, Camero?

346
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:32,142
My best fuck
was a contortionist,

347
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:35,399
behind the tent show
aberrations at Circo Nudieus.

348
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,217
I could not straighten
for days.

349
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,464
I never asked her name.

350
00:32:49,978 --> 00:32:52,380
7 NIGHTS BEFORE

351
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,347
Good night, Hot Wire.

352
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,257
Did not see your filthy pillowcase
from the Glory Hole.

353
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:27,744
I was just following orders, Camero.

354
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:28,964
Without ofen ...

355
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,710
Murf! Crap! Pino! Mijo!
... sa, okay?

356
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:34,318
Where's Gage?

357
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:38,601
I do not know.

358
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:45,101
I have no time to be
Dry fucked tonight.

359
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:19,006
Honey, I'm undefeated here.

360
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:20,169
Okay, okay.

361
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,792
The Gage organized another
bash chicks hot babes.

362
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,967
This Friday. At midnight.

363
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,645
The temperature continues to rise.

364
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:52,934
No longer take it anymore!

365
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,986
Do not waste all a. ..

366
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,660
Grab me in the balls
and call me Sally.

367
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:18,887
You might want to cover up.

368
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:21,639
What?

369
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:25,640
Do not tell me they do not want
rather than have to sell.

370
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,288
I'll put up all wet.

371
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,284
Stop these games, Trixie.
I'm serious.

372
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,221
Goat shit.

373
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,552
Not think about it.

374
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,771
His goats are dead!

375
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:46,423
10 DAYS BEFORE

376
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:00,791
Satellite data
communications coincide.

377
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:05,590
"Goats Voluptuous
American Graduate Feminist "

378
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,153
The Gage must
a sick sense of humor.

379
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:15,844
And a desire to die.

380
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:19,926
- The girl suspected of something?
- No, Phoenix.

381
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:22,776
Everything is going as planned.
Mobilize operating.

382
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,348
Hence the five days went into action.

383
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:26,930
The nanoswarm is active
and there will be lots of victims ..

384
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,233
Time to go.
We were located.

385
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:46,296
You okay?

386
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,089
Is something
to bite me rabiosque.

387
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:51,724
What is this?

388
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,713
Help me to dig.

389
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,092
I think it is.

390
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,691
Hooray for us.
We are the greatest!

391
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:17,410
God!

392
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,638
It seems that is not here
long.

393
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,359
Maybe a few weeks.

394
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,359
No one I know.
Poor fellow.

395
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:32,269
Did not die quickly.

396
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,941
Someone was
trying to get information.

397
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,595
The Gage?

398
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:40,582
No. He was dark,
but not so dark.

399
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:44,006
There is only one person
that would make this kind of thing.

400
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,241
We are being observed?

401
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,704
This is crazy! Now I come!

402
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,885
- I want to go home!
- Calm down, Trix.

403
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:09,206
Calm down? All I know say that, Hel,
but people continue to die!

404
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,335
I can not end up like him.

405
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:18,780
- We are running out of time.
- Your friend is going on.

406
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:21,227
- She will be fine.
- I'm not stuck because of it.

407
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:22,939
I said that it will be fine.

408
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:25,145
Scan the perimeter.

409
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:38,295
Sorry, Hel.

410
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:40,933
I thought I could do this.

411
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,615
I thought I could be strong.

412
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:47,441
No, Trixie ...
I disappoint you.

413
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,184
I shouldn 't
have sought to do this.

414
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,122
Do not force me.

415
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,884
I wanted to be here ...

416
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,045
... with you.

417
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:13,649
You're the first person in all
my life who believed in me.

418
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:24,857
We should not.

419
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:28,419
Not here.

420
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,517
Please ...

421
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,248
... I need you.

422
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,309
I never felt this before ...

423
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,580
... for anyone.

424
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:44,482
So why do not you kiss me ...

425
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,386
... now?

426
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,923
What the fuck!

427
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:01,325
Camero ...

428
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,700
... I can explain.

429
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:08,329
I'm out there to pull the leather and
you are here to give a loose to?

430
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:11,535
And Gage was right.
I can not trust you.

431
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:13,243
- You can, yes.
- Lies!

432
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:14,994
What else are not telling me?

433
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:17,821
- They plan to get rid of me too?
- Do not be ridiculous.

434
00:43:17,822 --> 00:43:20,884
- Who is being ridiculous, Hel?
- It's my fault, Camero.

435
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:22,515
Hel I asked not to tell.

436
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,741
Did you know you gonna come along and
make you even more uncontrollable.

437
00:43:26,663 --> 00:43:28,425
So I need to be controlled?

438
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,827
- Is that what you think? It?
- No!

439
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,576
Why not I who is exploring
the depths of delicious sprout

440
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,741
to pretend I'm something I'm not.

441
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,549
I knew it davas trouble.

442
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:42,720
Never should have left
Hel to bring up.

443
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:45,516
We would not have found
this place without her, remember?

444
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:47,729
Truth.
So now we can kill it.

445
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,821
Kill her and you must
I kill me too.

446
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:55,042
And then you will not have anyone to sell
the material or treat contacts.

447
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:56,637
That's what you want?

448
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,780
Sorry, Camero.

449
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,426
Should have told you
on us from the beginning.

450
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:06,411
But I never thought
to betray you in this business.

451
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:08,400
We're all in this ...

452
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:10,188
... until the end.

453
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,903
Or won all,
or lose all ...

454
00:44:13,204 --> 00:44:16,541
... and now lose
has a price too high.

455
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:32,279
Mind again and killed the two.

456
00:44:56,504 --> 00:44:59,126
Excuse
it was my fault.

457
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:01,586
I could not control.

458
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,294
Never apologize parts
for being you own.

459
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,452
It scares me, Hel.

460
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:10,066
Are you sure that she
will not try anything?

461
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:13,319
With the Camero is not quite clear.
Help me up, okay?

462
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:29,591
It seems that the Gage
was prepared for war.

463
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,400
Camero!
Come on, we have found something.

464
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:38,389
K-14, a pirate with spool gun.

465
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:42,080
Based carbon fiber,
system soundproof hellfire ...

466
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,480
... a laser aiming zion.

467
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:49,419
This is really a
powerful secret weapon.

468
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,432
How do you know all this?

469
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,802
My father was part of ghost
recognition of the CIA in the 80s.

470
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:02,480
Camero, you hear me?

471
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,760
Where was she?

472
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:17,948
Camero!

473
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,351
Where are you?

474
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:34,408
Trixie, enter the car, quick!

475
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:37,051
'Okay, well, bitches!

476
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:54,120
You're not kidding, Kinki.
Looks like a jam chicks.

477
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:57,751
- Who the hell are you?
- Think of us as ...

478
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,540
... debt collectors.
Rata, boat, perfect!

479
00:47:58,724 --> 00:48:01,137
Naughty ...

480
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:03,506
Kinki slapping.

481
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:08,772
Relax!
Relax. You okay.

482
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:18,661
It seems that this time we are
Would you have the tomatoes, Camero.

483
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:21,421
You know these two?

484
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:25,468
When she came in search of Gage
I quickly noticed that something was going to spend big.

485
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,809
He bought me a long time,
cheater!

486
00:48:27,832 --> 00:48:29,557
We have been following you.

487
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:31,985
So ...

488
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:36,501
... the legendary treasure of the Gage
existent.

489
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:38,272
Where is it?

490
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:40,710
- We do not know.
- Do not try to cheat.

491
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:44,044
No way to say 2 times the Kinki ...
Should be allowed! Twinkie perfect!

492
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:45,694
... you get to face.

493
00:48:45,837 --> 00:48:49,110
The Gage lied to us.
It is buried where he said.

494
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:53,922
So it is better to continue to dig.

495
00:48:54,158 --> 00:48:58,005
That fuck. I will not dig
anything for you unless your grave.

496
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,521
Enough!

497
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,585
Let's dig.
But let her alone.

498
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:10,798
I like to leave you hit
seven shades of shit out of you two!

499
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:21,267
You still ...
The lodge of my old Barney!

500
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:23,163
Camero ... the same as always.

501
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,903
Now start digging.

502
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:32,066
I want to ...

503
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,945
Not you, honey.

504
00:49:35,544 --> 00:49:37,911
You stay here.

505
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:43,235
Do what he says.

506
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:54,974
The Kinki likes you.

507
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:59,204
The Kinki want to play ...

508
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:07,535
She wants to play what?

509
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:15,514
7 WEEKS BEFORE

510
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:34,997
I need help to get out of here.

511
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,629
I miss you, Camero.

512
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:42,548
Certain animals
my stay in prison.

513
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:45,868
Recluse 1138, get ready
for processing.

514
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:49,040
It's safe. Open the cell 2187.

515
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:50,592
But ...

516
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:52,122
I told you,

517
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:53,994
I can still get you out.

518
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,159
But you must give me something in return.

519
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:00,610
Eat your favorite food, Camero.

520
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:03,280
Well, come on.

521
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,950
Can I trust you?

522
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,736
Of course.

523
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:18,761
Take me out and divided
200 million in diamonds you.

524
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:30,397
Arre!

525
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:33,378
Dammit.
Come on, faster.

526
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:36,346
You are my horse.
Come on, faster.

527
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,451
Ride him, Kinki!

528
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:44,724
Dammit.
Come on, faster.

529
00:51:52,097 --> 00:51:54,550
This show is private.
Back to work!

530
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:02,933
If I make a diversion
and run to the arms

531
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:05,382
think you can get to Trixie?

532
00:52:10,986 --> 00:52:13,204
What, now not talking to me?

533
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:17,960
- Come on, Camero, I need you.
- To save Mrs. Boca Magic?

534
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,224
No way.

535
00:52:20,177 --> 00:52:21,527
You took something?

536
00:52:22,378 --> 00:52:24,336
I no longer know who you are!

537
00:52:24,337 --> 00:52:28,499
I never should have trusted you.
Certainly not me should have love.

538
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,054
That's it.

539
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,350
Get up.

540
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:50,873
Get up.

541
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:58,887
Forget it.

542
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:02,128
We can do this.
It's just us now.

543
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:06,721
No! No!
Stop! Help me!

544
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:11,373
Found something!

545
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:15,103
Garlic! Orgia solo!

546
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,187
Move. Come on, Cu Raso.

547
00:53:23,463 --> 00:53:24,552
Clears it!

548
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:27,476
Clears it!

549
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:37,825
Open it.

550
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:39,446
I said to open!

551
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:42,859
Knees, Mamas Floridas!
It is the only place where you are good!

552
00:53:48,907 --> 00:53:49,997
Open it!

553
00:53:59,427 --> 00:54:01,468
Perhaps there is some kind of code.

554
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:02,694
And who knows o. ..

555
00:54:03,516 --> 00:54:05,736
Plums when they are cooked!
... code?

556
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,148
Who knows?

557
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:10,966
Nobody?

558
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,297
The Kinki is right. If no one speaks,
there is no reason to keep you alive.

559
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:20,515
Wait!

560
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:22,261
Let me try.

561
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:25,704
Let me try.

562
00:54:25,705 --> 00:54:27,150
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

563
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:29,365
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- Okay.

564
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:50,288
Thank you,
now take care of this.

565
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:51,800
- Kinki, kill!
- Okay.

566
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:53,705
High!

567
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:56,353
I knew that if
something happening here.

568
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:58,045
Drop it!

569
00:54:59,134 --> 00:55:01,308
Everyone in the ground now!

570
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,642
Let her go, I say! Come on, drop it.

571
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:10,491
Well, this is the last time.
Put the gun down and lie on the floor!

572
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,651
Well, come on.
Come! Come on!

573
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:34,234
- No. ..
- Away!

574
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:37,768
Anyone have a problem here.

575
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:40,161
- Away!
- Here I come ...

576
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:03,975
The fortune cookie says:
future is not promising.

577
00:57:08,877 --> 00:57:09,913
Who!

578
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,300
- Stop!
- You! You!

579
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:13,725
Camero, stop!

580
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:16,982
No! Stop, Camero! Stop!

581
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,590
Was the limit, parola! I beat you
directly to China.

582
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:30,004
Enough!
Cocks fuck me!

583
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,774
I have been through my hair with this shit.
It'll be over now!

584
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:37,633
- A start to lose your cool, no?
- Let's meet in the caravan.

585
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,277
Let's stop this bastard now.

586
00:57:39,278 --> 00:57:42,273
No matter who you are, is not going to betray
if you suck daisy roots.

587
00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:44,473
Today not kill anyone else.
Period!

588
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:48,533
Were over 7 in 10 years, Hel.
How did you get in less than 3 weeks?

589
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:52,361
And how I got my cock
release with 12 years to be served?

590
00:57:54,098 --> 00:57:58,299
Well, this is America. She is sexy,
full of money and has contacts high.

591
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:01,669
- Bullshit.
- I just save up your ass! Again.

592
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,951
The hell that is saved!
Had everything under control.

593
00:58:03,952 --> 00:58:05,551
You're making up
a burden, Camero.

594
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:07,958
Not to mention,
a martyr with selective memory.

595
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:10,388
You look so shit in mocada
andas to take the one you are irrational.

596
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:11,624
Fuck you!

597
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:14,958
I finally see you
by who you really are.

598
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:18,701
What is she talking about?

599
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:22,415
Prison. Weapons. Money.

600
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,547
Your expertise in Honduran sex.

601
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:29,917
Want to tell the Good and Plenty
what brand, or should I tell?

602
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:32,773
75,650.

603
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:34,183
As you read this?

604
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,421
God!
Why did you do that?

605
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:42,922
I had no choice, Trixie.

606
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:45,487
Clearly, she suffers from delusions
and completely lost his mind.

607
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,739
Get her handcuffs
and holds it inside.

608
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:49,753
What are you doing?

609
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:53,018
What needs to be done.

610
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:12,880
Sorry.

611
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:16,700
Thanks, Trixie.

612
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,226
How do you know my name?

613
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:27,563
Who are you?

614
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:30,908
I am a big fan.

615
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:34,245
A what?

616
00:59:35,502 --> 00:59:39,676
An aficionado of your ass ...
that is, goods.

617
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:42,444
I saw you in the Pope's Picaloo
Knotty Knickers Round Up

618
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:45,451
You are ... amazing e. ..

619
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,045
... my God, amazing.

620
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:51,684
When I was here earlier ...

621
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:55,484
... I recognized you.
I realized that something was wrong,

622
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:57,351
was worried about you.

623
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:06,663
Sorry, you must think I
some crazy stalker.

624
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:09,885
You were worried about me?

625
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:14,028
What's your name?

626
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:16,164
Roy.

627
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:21,969
Agent Roy Eugene Fuchs,
madam.

628
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,218
It's a beautiful name.

629
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:32,665
What are you been?

630
01:00:33,189 --> 01:00:34,943
Who are those women?

631
01:00:35,044 --> 01:00:37,292
I think I do not know.

632
01:00:37,745 --> 01:00:39,818
Let me help you, Trixie.

633
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,393
Let.

634
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:01,774
I'll be back.

635
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,607
It's not too late to
make the right decision, Trixie.

636
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:07,096
Anyway ...

637
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,715
... I'm here if you need.

638
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:45,544
Where is the Camero?

639
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:52,441
Chained it?

640
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,727
She looks good. Let.

641
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,621
I'm afraid, Hel.
What is happening?

642
01:01:58,622 --> 01:02:02,427
You'll have to trust me, Trixie.
Now come on.

643
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:07,759
Sorry.

644
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,442
Better you pray to your God
I come out here.

645
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,128
3 MONTHS BEFORE

646
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:28,097
What disturbs you, sister?

647
01:02:28,298 --> 01:02:30,439
You must help me, Mother Superior.

648
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,322
My impure thoughts
already go beyond inanimate objects,

649
01:02:34,323 --> 01:02:38,464
and evolved in Crave
by Latvian gymnasts robust.

650
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:39,804
No!

651
01:02:46,072 --> 01:02:47,500
Sister Sara.

652
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,697
Ma fucking fuck.

653
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:58,278
Sister Prudence Bangtail.

654
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:01,353
- This was the last straw.
- Save it, Cota.

655
01:03:01,354 --> 01:03:04,285
'Tou no go.
This site is a drought.

656
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:22,303
May God have mercy on your soul.

657
01:03:33,494 --> 01:03:34,621
Alto, sister!

658
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:39,152
Put your hands in the air right now.

659
01:03:45,737 --> 01:03:47,878
Well, well ...

660
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:53,075
Hidden in a convent,
the doings up through nun ...

661
01:03:53,091 --> 01:03:57,008
... the juggling of chicks circus
pornographic, it is distasteful.

662
01:03:57,143 --> 01:03:58,955
Even for you, Camero.

663
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,801
Okay, guys

664
01:04:13,102 --> 01:04:16,514
unafraid
used excessive force in this.

665
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,632
I can not see anything.

666
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:29,878
Turn thee.

667
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:02,983
What is all this?

668
01:05:03,895 --> 01:05:06,361
All the Gage robbed Pinky.

669
01:05:07,646 --> 01:05:11,716
That clever bastard has gone
to divert the material from Pinky years.

670
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:14,482
That's why I hid it all here.

671
01:05:14,683 --> 01:05:18,127
To sell secretly
merchandise when arranged buyers.

672
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:20,541
How do you know all this?

673
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:23,896
If you sleep with criminals ...

674
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:28,870
Be careful.
There are dangerous shit down here.

675
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:19,314
Hel, look at this.

676
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,532
It's beautiful.

677
01:06:22,673 --> 01:06:26,422
- Can I have it?
- Yes, of course.

678
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:44,770
I found them.

679
01:06:55,393 --> 01:06:56,709
Perfect.

680
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,542
There are marked.

681
01:06:59,187 --> 01:07:01,270
And they are all ours.

682
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:06,461
And now?

683
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,631
Time for us to go.

684
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:25,981
Crap.

685
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:29,361
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Get in the car and turn it on.

686
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:30,931
- But we can not abandon the Roy.
- Go!

687
01:07:30,932 --> 01:07:33,272
- But ... but ...
- Get in the car!

688
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:45,971
I'll do you in chopped!

689
01:07:48,813 --> 01:07:50,498
Camero, calm down!

690
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,911
We have the diamonds.
Okay? The plan worked.

691
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,015
All we have to get going
and won.

692
01:07:56,016 --> 01:07:57,252
Bullshit!

693
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,763
Already trusted you before.
Look where it got me there.

694
01:07:59,764 --> 01:08:02,384
Fuck, Camero!
I'm not gonna let it ruin it now!

695
01:08:02,385 --> 01:08:04,227
Put that power and hits the brain.

696
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:07,237
Time to test your loyalty
and see what you really are done.

697
01:08:07,824 --> 01:08:11,223
Mata Polly Vagina
and you're forgiven

698
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:12,991
whoever you are.

699
01:08:13,702 --> 01:08:14,760
Come ...

700
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:18,583
You and I started this
and we must be to end it.

701
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:20,198
No!
We are in this together.

702
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:21,665
Okay!

703
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:25,351
So, I will give you cable canastro
once and for all.

704
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,530
You want me?

705
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:35,672
Come and get me.

706
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:43,924
Come on, guys, do not do it.
Please do not do it!

707
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:18,353
Come on, guys, stop!

708
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:43,344
I said, stop!

709
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:34,165
Stop! Camero, stop!

710
01:10:35,156 --> 01:10:37,090
You're next, Panties Loose!

711
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,113
Do not get up, Camero.
Do not make me kill you.

712
01:11:09,793 --> 01:11:11,682
Check there also like, bitch.

713
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,321
We even
I managed to win?

714
01:11:49,457 --> 01:11:50,301
Trixie ...

715
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:51,903
Trixie!

716
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:16,187
Trixie!

717
01:12:23,348 --> 01:12:25,390
Fire in your hole.

718
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:54,109
Until loguinho, goats.

719
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:04,122
Swallow this in your Pssara
roast goat.

720
01:13:05,493 --> 01:13:07,323
SETTING

721
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,864
Roy!

722
01:13:23,548 --> 01:13:24,650
Roy!

723
01:14:15,343 --> 01:14:16,902
Force, kill me ...

724
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,300
I do not want to know.

725
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:25,930
It's all a lie, right?

726
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,473
Yes

727
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:37,103
Why?

728
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:39,925
Who are you?

729
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:43,806
- You ...
- No.

730
01:14:45,573 --> 01:14:47,430
I'm not Pinky.

731
01:14:49,937 --> 01:14:51,324
I ...

732
01:14:52,657 --> 01:14:55,366
3:17 MONTHS BEFORE

733
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,671
Give me the specifications, Deiter.

734
01:15:19,918 --> 01:15:21,893
Specifications!
Already!

735
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:24,462
You have the wrong person.

736
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:27,221
I know nothing of this pest
deadly of which you speak.

737
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,809
Wrong answer, Deiter.

738
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,157
Congratulations Foxy69.

739
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:46,051
Mission accomplished, Phoenix.
I have the data of anti-toxin.

740
01:15:46,152 --> 01:15:49,256
I have another mission
requires your immediate attention.

741
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:52,838
As you know, the Glory Hole
was an unfortunate miscalculation,

742
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,390
but we have another opportunity
regaining nanoswarm.

743
01:15:58,681 --> 01:16:02,515
I will send you to a women's prison
to infiltrate and contact data

744
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,594
a former partner of Gage.

745
01:16:04,595 --> 01:16:07,761
- It uses the pseudonym "Camero".
- I have to do it.

746
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:08,952
Great.

747
01:16:09,153 --> 01:16:13,295
Now bury all the evidence
and go home. Phoenix, finished.

748
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:26,045
FACT OF ARREST:
It ONLY ADD WATER

749
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:35,454
My God ...

750
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:41,707
Are you an undercover agent set as the
shit disguised as sex tycoon?

751
01:16:46,428 --> 01:16:48,579
My task was to retrieve it.

752
01:16:48,732 --> 01:16:53,977
A bottle of armed nanoswarm synthetic
the Gage stole a CIA transport.

753
01:16:54,084 --> 01:16:57,280
It is full of trillions of robots viruses
that self-reproducing

754
01:16:57,281 --> 01:17:00,492
and cling to any
living organism and suck all the carbon,

755
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:02,055
until you, me ...

756
01:17:02,056 --> 01:17:04,959
... and even the cockroaches, we just
a viscous gray.

757
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:08,334
Might end up with an entire continent
if positioned correctly.

758
01:17:08,435 --> 01:17:10,680
Had to get before
Gage tried that again

759
01:17:10,681 --> 01:17:14,307
sell it to another country at war
or libertarian crazy.

760
01:17:14,308 --> 01:17:17,142
So the plan, the diamonds ...

761
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:18,955
... we

762
01:17:19,283 --> 01:17:21,480
were all lies?

763
01:17:21,581 --> 01:17:22,995
No.

764
01:17:23,495 --> 01:17:25,178
We do not, Trix.

765
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:28,895
What am
does not change what I feel for you.

766
01:17:29,584 --> 01:17:31,651
Everything between us is real.

767
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,829
You changed me.

768
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,767
You made me look at life
I have been missing.

769
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:42,876
Wishing, in fact.

770
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:48,641
Do not want to be the Foxy69.

771
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:53,691
But you can not just leave, Flush
Foxy Force with a wink and goodbye.

772
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:56,369
I needed something to negotiate
and enormous financial resources.

773
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,993
The bottle and diamonds
give us both.

774
01:18:00,312 --> 01:18:03,151
Now you, Lily and I can ...

775
01:18:03,313 --> 01:18:06,394
disappear together
to a small island in Micronesia.

776
01:18:07,018 --> 01:18:08,525
Forever.

777
01:18:09,973 --> 01:18:12,406
And to struggle in the game
the waves of the sea?

778
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:16,672
Among other things.

779
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:20,151
I love you.

780
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,098
The goat back, baby!

781
01:18:37,387 --> 01:18:41,268
It hurts, right?
When you take the person you love.

782
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:45,599
- The fault was not hers, Camero.
- Fuck you! The fault was all her.

783
01:18:46,182 --> 01:18:47,572
Nothing.

784
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:50,543
Nothing!

785
01:18:50,854 --> 01:18:53,779
And it's all because of it!
And you.

786
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:03,134
I'll kick you and queer
that damn tail

787
01:19:03,235 --> 01:19:05,920
to be turned
to the inside.

788
01:19:06,302 --> 01:19:10,407
Then I'll crush you
breasts into pieces

789
01:19:10,408 --> 01:19:13,795
before you send the two
to the ground!

790
01:20:50,339 --> 01:20:52,651
Open your mouth, psycho bitch!

791
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,378
Lubricates me breasts, licks muff!

792
01:21:38,604 --> 01:21:40,000
Did I come?

793
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:43,031
No. And you?

794
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:48,377
Suck my pussy.

795
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:28,235
Lick my ass!

796
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:53,867
No. ..

797
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:00,477
Stop, Camero!

798
01:23:13,313 --> 01:23:15,656
Please, no!
No, stop!

799
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,336
No!

800
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:31,391
No. .. no.
Hel, no!

801
01:23:43,237 --> 01:23:45,730
Now just us, baby.

802
01:23:46,318 --> 01:23:47,949
Get away from me.

803
01:23:48,684 --> 01:23:51,442
- Get away from me!
- Mrs. D. Cona ...

804
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,946
... the Trixie can not die?

805
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:01,913
Come on, give me fight!

806
01:24:03,919 --> 01:24:06,373
I'm too fragile and vulnerable.

807
01:24:07,758 --> 01:24:10,860
Well!
If you will not fight, like you!

808
01:24:10,861 --> 01:24:13,236
- Stand in the way, bitch!
- Stop, Camero!

809
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:15,928
It's time for giving me
what you have given to Hel.

810
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:18,586
Stop!
No, please!

811
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,922
Hello, bichaninho!

812
01:24:29,362 --> 01:24:31,448
4 MONTHS BEFORE

813
01:24:32,129 --> 01:24:34,833
SHOW ABERRATION
CIRCUS NUDIEUS

814
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:58,415
I will eat you all, sweet cheeks.

815
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:07,641
You are ... it?

816
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,913
You're my best fuck ever?

817
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:14,517
Surprise.

818
01:25:14,869 --> 01:25:18,077
You fucking piece of shit liar!

819
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,910
The Women's Movement
forever will raise my skirt.

820
01:26:16,173 --> 01:26:17,743
My God ...

821
01:26:19,712 --> 01:26:21,570
My God ...

822
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:24,123
How did we get to this point?

823
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,103
6 MONTHS BEFORE

824
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:43,338
CASINO AND PLACE OF APALPANOS

825
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,993
How did we get to this point?

826
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:51,460
Let me tell you.

827
01:26:51,725 --> 01:26:53,507
Nature.

828
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:59,042
The principles of Christianity tell us
the 7 deadly sins of humanity.

829
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:03,887
I'm not sure if the lust,
gluttony, greed, sloth,

830
01:27:03,888 --> 01:27:07,754
anger, envy and pride
are sins of human ...

831
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:11,500
... or the characteristics
human that define them.

832
01:27:14,904 --> 01:27:16,246
Foxy69,

833
01:27:16,647 --> 01:27:18,083
target in sight.

834
01:27:18,084 --> 01:27:20,866
Understood.
Arrival in 20 seconds ...

835
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,232
19 ... 18 ...

836
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:24,584
17 ...

837
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,860
Foxy69 in position.

838
01:28:13,223 --> 01:28:15,058
Do not move!
We get it.

839
01:28:24,655 --> 01:28:26,405
It's a bit scary, right?

840
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,794
Foxy, slaughter them!

841
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:35,139
Piss turtle!

842
01:28:44,313 --> 01:28:45,368
My God.

843
01:29:37,353 --> 01:29:38,572
Camero!

844
01:29:46,637 --> 01:29:48,099
What the hell is that?

845
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,311
Yes

846
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:43,955
Yes ..

847
01:32:36,749 --> 01:32:38,422
Trixie, Why?

848
01:32:39,674 --> 01:32:41,237
What can I say ...

849
01:32:43,033 --> 01:32:45,735
We are all bitches in the end.

850
01:33:10,552 --> 01:33:12,041
Who are you?

851
01:33:12,468 --> 01:33:14,359
I think you know.

852
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:18,135
But why me?

853
01:33:18,644 --> 01:33:20,221
Why Camero?

854
01:33:20,825 --> 01:33:22,695
You were lost souls ...

855
01:33:23,115 --> 01:33:25,271
... and I thought it would be fun.

856
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:27,385
And Phoenix?

857
01:33:28,309 --> 01:33:31,267
The Phoenix works for me.
Always worked.

858
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:33,958
That worked.
Became careless.

859
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:37,246
I think we know where it led.

860
01:33:40,108 --> 01:33:41,947
So it all ...

861
01:33:42,257 --> 01:33:44,968
... my mission, our meeting ...

862
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,422
... the Camero.

863
01:33:51,122 --> 01:33:52,948
It was all for it.

864
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:59,662
Made in the sixteenth century
by the master craftsman Humate Nayoji.

865
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:03,493
This has seen naginata
battles won and empires to fall

866
01:34:03,494 --> 01:34:05,540
for over 600 years.

867
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:08,716
It's the only thing that I love
this damn world.

868
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:12,060
And Gage was stupid enough
to think that I would not mind.

869
01:34:13,662 --> 01:34:15,543
How could you do this?

870
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:17,652
Making the victim.

871
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:19,394
I loved you.

872
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:22,159
A girl has to go
seek excitement somewhere.

873
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:27,233
And I really like to see girls fight.

874
01:34:28,533 --> 01:34:32,043
- You were spectacular.
- Are you waiting for what?

875
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:33,677
Might!

876
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:35,721
Terminate your sick little game.

877
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:40,606
"They ask us to forgive
our enemies ... "

878
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:44,529
"... but nothing is said ..."
- "About forgive our friends."

879
01:34:44,856 --> 01:34:48,590
Cosimo de 'Medici, 1454

880
01:34:56,342 --> 01:34:58,199
Go to hell, Trixie!

881
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:03,626
The latest entrant is a rotten egg.

882
01:35:25,121 --> 01:35:28,065
All wars
are based on deception.

883
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:31,442
Hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable.

884
01:35:31,443 --> 01:35:34,791
When we use our forces
we must seem inactive.

885
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:38,494
When we close, we make
the enemy believe we are far away.

886
01:35:38,495 --> 01:35:41,992
When we are away, we do
him to believe that we are close.

887
01:35:41,993 --> 01:35:44,911
Place baits to attract the enemy.

888
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:48,482
Pretend disorder and crush him.

889
01:35:49,006 --> 01:35:53,331
Sun Tzu
"The Art of War", 380 A.C..

890
01:36:13,933 --> 01:36:23,931
THE END
