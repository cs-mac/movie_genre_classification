00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,087
You know, he didn't give
me a budget for that.

164
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,524
I'm, I'm just the kid's
nanny, but... Sorry.

165
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,192
Okay, uh...

166
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,327
Our most progressive
couple...

167
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:54,032
Caitlin, Sophie. Manuel's
mama and... mommy.

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,800
- His name is Manny.
- It's Manny.

169
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,204
Manny. Yes. I was
wondering if he has any...

170
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,406
specific nutritional
guidelines?

171
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,042
We could have some rice,
some beans, some chips,

172
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,777
over at the snack bar,
if need be.

173
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,380
Well, considering when we
adopted him,

174
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,750
he was eating dirt off the
floor of a hut, umm...

175
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,352
I think he's, he's, uh, he's
doing just fine.

176
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,955
And, uh, just a suggestion
for you.

177
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:21,393
If you spent less time
taking pictures of food

178
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,195
and putting them into
binders, and more time

179
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,131
doing useful things like,
umm...

180
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,033
perhaps you could talk to
the city about having

181
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,968
- less handicap spaces...
- Mmm.

182
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,038
...for parking. So that real
normal people could park

183
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,372
in the parking lot

184
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,708
I-I second the lady's
motion there about

185
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,743
the handicap parking
spots. They should either

186
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,946
eliminate the ones that
aren't being used or

187
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,380
put on some kinda drive
to get more

188
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,983
handicapped people to
come out to the ball
games.

189
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,051
That could be a lot of fun.

190
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,986
We could get them out on
the field with games,

191
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,056
and just kinda stir up the
enthusiasm.

192
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,726
I think we're good.

193
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,527
All right.

194
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,495
You are bat shit crazy.

195
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,997
You know,
you're a big man...

196
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,198
- Hello ladies. How are ya?
- Hello.

197
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,299
Marty, whaddaya say?

198
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,201
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Max!

199
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,336
Max, how are ya?

200
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,638
Hiya, Harold. How you

201
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,906
I'm well, thank you. How

202
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,975
I'm, I'm good.
Good, good to see ya.

203
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:10,842
World of comedy good?

204
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,312
Are you still doing that bit
about, uh...

205
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,648
with the chicken,
and the broiled

206
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,184
and the baked chicken?
Is that you?

207
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,185
No.

208
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,586
That's not you?

209
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,320
No, no. But thank you.

210
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,221
[stammering]

211
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,757
I happen to love comedy.
I love watching you.

212
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,791
Yeah. Oh, hi honey.

213
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,425
Hi!

214
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,326
How are ya, Ava?

215
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,194
Hi, I'm good.

216
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,797
[stammering] Would you
just mind to let Ava sit
here?

217
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,798
I'm sorry.
Come on, please.

218
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,434
Oh, thanks.

219
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,535
- Oh, hey.
- Umm...

220
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,204
Sorry I didn't bring you
a water.

221
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,171
- Hey Harold?
- I'm fine.

222
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,107
You know what, I need to
talk to Ava just

223
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,608
for a minute or two.

224
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,443
I'll, I'll, uh...

225
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,611
Okay.

226
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,546
I'll, I'll, but I'll come sit
down in a little while,

227
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,080
later in the game.

228
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,850
It's nothing, It's nothing.
It's good.

229
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,818
We'll talk comedy later.

230
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,887
Oh, geez. He means well.

231
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,822
- I know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,958
Ah, pitcher, I know where
your family lives!

233
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,193
Stop brushing my boy
back!

234
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,928
And how about some
more balls?

235
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,096
[umpire] Time!

236
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,331
That's a warning.

237
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,466
Warning? I'm a grown-up.
I'm not in school.

238
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,669
I don't care, ass-dick.

239
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,536
[umpire] You're gone!

240
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,772
I'm gone!
Hey everyone, I'm gone!

241
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,774
Come on man, come on!

242
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,575
What are you doing
to me right now?!

243
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,879
- It's his fault!
- You're killing me right
now!

244
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,947
Hey! That's your dad?!
That's your dad right
there?!

245
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:23,848
Whoa, whoa. Lets not
make this any messier
than it already is.

246
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,018
Your dad's a jerk!
Your dad's a jerk!

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,021
I'm nobody you need to
mess with right now, okay?

248
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,224
Do you ever have
a kid here?

249
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,993
Hey, touch me, I sue you,
okay?

250
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,295
Hey, let's not make this
messy in front of the kids.

251
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:37,962
- Who is this guy?!
- Okay, let's go.

252
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,830
Who are you?!

253
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,698
Go away!

254
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,099
That's my son!

255
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,902
I'll be in the car Barneby!

256
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,205
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

257
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:47,706
[sighs]

258
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,974
- Bye-bye.
- Don't touch me.

259
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,142
You're outta here.

260
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,478
Whoa. Why would
someone behave that way?

261
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,047
[stammering] This is
an adult. An adult.

262
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,248
- So sad.
- Seriously.

263
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,217
- Sad.
- It's sad. It is sad.

264
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,320
And it's confusing. W-What
is his private life like?

265
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,688
What are their
private lives like

266
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,423
that make them act
like this?

267
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,225
What are they missing
in their lives

268
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,260
that make them act
like idiots?

269
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,528
Unbelievable.

270
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,165
Seriously unbelievable.
In front of the kids.

271
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,401
[indiscernible whispering]

272
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,670
All right, let's hear some
chatter! Come on!

273
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,406
Let's get it up!
Let's get it up!

274
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,174
Don't say, "let's get it up."

275
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,577
Let's get it up.

276
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,680
[distant chatter
and clapping]

277
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,088
They're, they're a bit
touchy. They're kinda nuts.

278
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,389
Wow, they're crazy.

279
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,126
I mean, everything offends
them. So, everything!

280
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,829
I mean, what is wrong with
these people?!

281
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,300
What is wrong with these
people?

282
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,370
[yelling] What is wrong
with these people?!

283
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,005
These people, right there!

284
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,673
Take this.

285
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,976
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back?

286
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,612
I gotta go talk to a man
about a horse. I'll be back.

287
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,780
Are we waiting for you?

288
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,549
Wait for me!

289
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,684
Commissioner Gordon.

290
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,988
No talking to the
commissioner before
scores are official.

291
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,257
Okay? I'm gonna need you
to step over here.

292
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,491
Right there.

293
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,795
All right.

294
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,967
You don't have to keep
your eye on me, I'm not
going to...

295
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,068
I know, I don't.

296
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,236
Forest, you can trust me.

297
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:29,741
You can go to the other
side and I'll wait here.

298
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,910
It's okay, Max.

299
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,978
[laughing incredulously]
Forest, I'm telling you...

300
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,147
Okay.
You can keep telling me.

301
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:36,848
All right.

302
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,184
I don't work for you.

303
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,953
Is that a quadruple
rainbow? [chuckles]

304
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,456
A quadruple rainbow? I've
never seen one of those!

305
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,692
What would cause a
quadruple...?!

306
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,929
The way..
Wait, that's impossible!

307
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:54,132
Pots of gold?!

308
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,601
Really? Pots of gold?

309
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,369
Pots of gold.

310
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,304
You're a comedian.

311
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,272
I am a comedian.

312
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,374
- Really?
- Yeah.

313
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,976
So you're not
that popular then.

314
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,779
I'm really into comedians
and I think I would know if

315
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,414
you're a comedian, if
you're a popular one.

316
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,216
No, I'm a popular
comedian.

317
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,384
Not in the top 100.

318
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,253
Tell you what, not only am
I in the top 100,

319
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,888
I'm probably top 20.

320
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,822
Top 20?

321
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,158
Top 20.

322
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,758
- Yeah.
- Okay.

323
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,659
All right.

324
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,995
How many Twitter
followers do you have?

325
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,129
About 100,000.

326
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,965
No, that's not top 20.

327
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,699
Score's official.

328
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,334
[yelling] Score's official!

329
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,501
Score's official.

330
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,236
Thank you, Forrest.

331
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,637
Thank you.

332
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,572
Max.

333
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,207
Hello Commissioner
Gordon.

334
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,980
I would never think of
calling you Steve,
Commissioner...Gordon.

335
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,048
Commissioner Gordon...

336
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,116
[laughing hysterically]

337
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,518
If you see the Riddler or
the [raising voice]

338
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,723
Catwoman, you and Chief
O'Hara should...

339
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,992
It's really funny actually.

340
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,428
It's just something I love
doing. Anyhow, uh...

341
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,999
I've decided that my next
movie...hopefully...

342
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,367
There's a lot of steps
involved in this.

343
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,868
I'm gonna be doing some
research.

344
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,837
And the research I'm
doing, I'm gonna be talking

345
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,742
to, uh, parents, uh,
coaches, and uh...

346
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,578
everybody involved with
my kids baseball team.

347
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,981
Like a documentary on the,
the uh...the benefits of

348
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,550
SFV-LA baseball for, for
young children...

349
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,753
Documentaries are big
right now.

350
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,922
No, it's, it's a comedy.

351
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,455
A comedy.

352
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,859
Like a "how to" video for
parents if they wanna get

353
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,428
their kids into SFV-LA
baseball?

354
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,664
And the benefits of
learning how to be a

355
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,999
team member, and the
fundamentals of,

356
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,634
of building blocks for uh,

357
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,171
becoming a responsible
citizen and a good adult.

358
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,041
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

359
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,475
Yeah, that would be good.

360
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,279
You know...a little change
of the subject here.

361
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,282
Your nanny is so
ridiculously beautiful.

362
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,451
I don't even know how
you...wow!

363
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,221
Well, Angela's the charge
of my, my son, Bennett.

364
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,257
There's nothing sexual
about her.

365
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,895
Oh, there's something very
sexual about her. Yeah...

366
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,863
Sorry I brought that up.
Okay.

367
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,231
All right, see you guys
later.

368
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,967
Okay, just stay off the
field, though. Please...

369
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,535
I'm not going back on, I
know 'cause you water it...

370
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,304
We water it and then we do
the chalk.

371
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,038
Stay off the diamond, Max.

372
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,874
I'm not going on the
diamond.

373
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,843
I don't think that's such a
great idea.

374
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,580
It'll be fun to spend time
with the crazy parents.

375
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,449
I don't know about that,
dad.

376
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,484
I...that's exactly what I
was just gonna say.

377
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,221
I...listen, I would not opt
to be with these people

378
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,557
on purpose, you know...

379
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,659
Well, you know, it's part,
it's the hard part

380
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,494
of my job. It's the
research.

381
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,098
It's the down-and-dirtiness
of comedy,

382
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,767
is figuring out what you're
gonna write about.

383
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,269
Sometimes grownups get
really weird.

384
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,139
Grownups always get
weird. Always.

385
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,208
Not sometimes.
They're just weird.

386
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,777
Just think, "people are
weird." They're weird.

387
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,713
What if I told you
another little secret?

388
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,750
She's a bit weird.
I'm a bit weird!

389
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,152
You have weird parents.
You're not weird yet.

390
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,756
I don't want you to think
that all grownups are
insane.

391
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,592
Well actually,
they are all insane.

392
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,229
Don't trust anybody over
the age of, of...

393
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,130
22.

394
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:12,830
No, actually, ten.

395
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,734
Ten. Don't trust a 13-year-
old, they're too worldly.

396
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,603
'Cause they all have their
own phones and...

397
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,471
That's when it all breaks
loose.

398
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,339
By the way, we're not
doing that with him.

399
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,140
No, we're not doing that
with you.

400
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,341
You know that, right?

401
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,743
Yeah, you have friends now
who have phones,
don't you?

402
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,445
Yeah, I know.
That's a bunch of crap.

403
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,546
Not gonna happen.

404
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,782
Max, I'm not sure about
spending more time than

405
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,750
is necessary with
that crowd.

406
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,685
You know, I don't have to
spend that much time

407
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,989
with them. Just a...few
hours.

408
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,957
What?

409
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,293
Nightmare.

410
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:47,965
I'd be happy to help.

411
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,101
I have a lot of
ideas for movies.

412
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,670
Okay, it's not...I just
wanna talk and get to...

413
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,905
I wanna get to know
the parents...

414
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,039
Here's my thing.
Here's my thing.

415
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,407
- Yeah?
- As long as it's educational

416
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,910
and instructive
for the kids...

417
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,111
The kids learn...
'cause kids are sponges.

418
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:00,945
We were just talking
about that.

419
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,814
How much like
sponges they are.

420
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,950
And I will help write it, act
it, shoot it,

421
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,786
I don't know how to do
any of that stuff...

422
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,088
They just keep absorbing.

423
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,322
But I'll tell you what, I
work at a copy shop,

424
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,857
in case you didn't know.
And I think you did.

425
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:16,527
Uh, and we can make
copies of he script there.

426
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,196
And then you can hand
them out next week,

427
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,564
and we'll learn our lines
and do it.

428
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,431
What's the title?

429
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,333
What's the script?

430
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,035
Well, no no,
I don't know yet.

431
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,069
Is it from a book?

432
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,905
No, it's gonna be from the
research that I do

433
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,607
when I spend time with...

434
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,209
What's the rating?

435
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,179
Oh, dear God.
Oh, that's wrong.

436
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:35,880
What's up, guys?

437
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:41,919
He wants to uh, do, some
research on my method

438
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,255
of uh, coaching. He's
watching,

439
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,090
he's paid attention. I think
he sees what I'm doing...

440
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:46,924
It's a great idea.

441
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,059
All right guys,
talk to you later.

442
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,794
Right on, man.

443
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,930
Why is it, whenever he
works with Rickey,

444
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,098
he's gotta take off his
shirt?

445
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,032
He's hot.

446
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,535
The man gets hot, he
wants to take his shirt off.

447
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,570
Did you ever hear of
shirts and skins?

448
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,639
Yeah I've heard of shirts
and skins, playing football.

449
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,640
He does it in life.

450
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,641
That's what it is.

451
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,343
Those who can do skins, do
skins.

452
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,211
Those who can't do skins,
they don't do skins.

453
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,480
- What side are you on?
- I'm clearly on the shirts
side.

454
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,248
See?

455
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,516
Except when I shower.

456
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,784
Work on the slide!

457
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,154
Because Jimbo says so,
thats why!

458
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,455
Don't answer me back!

459
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,890
Run through the base!

460
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,758
Through the bases!

461
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,694
All right, so what I'm
gonna be doing is that

462
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,963
I got the blessing from...

463
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,533
I got the blessing from
Commissioner Gordon.

464
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,235
It's research for
a comedy movie

465
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,704
that I might or might not
even write.

466
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,473
So it might not
even happen.

467
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,408
I'm just sort of getting to
know everybody

468
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,576
and seeing if there's a
movie there

469
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,611
about the parents and the
coaches and such.

470
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,246
So you show up,
do research,

471
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,982
interview everybody, for
something that might not
happen?

472
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,485
Yes. That's the first thing
you nailed exactly.

473
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,386
Sounds like a waste of time
to me.

474
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,121
Uh, if we don't win the
championship,

475
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,856
I'm gonna pull the plug,
so...

476
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,025
I'm not shooting a movie!

477
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,827
It's gotta end with us
winning, or I'm not, uh...

478
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,196
- A waste of time.
- ...approve.

479
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,798
I'm not gonna sign off
on it.

480
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,999
Either of you wanna be
interviewed?

481
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,734
- I do!
- You do?

482
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,837
I'm doing you first.
You're #1.

483
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,707
Number one on my
interview list. First.

484
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,711
All right, see you guys
later.

485
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,281
Hey, could I have, uh,
everybody's attention,

486
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:21,118
just for one second. It's
not a big deal. Umm...

487
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,656
As some of you...hey!
Some of you know, uh...

488
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,559
I am a comedian.

489
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,296
And I have decided that
there might be some...

490
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,167
material here ripe for
comedy. I'm going to...

491
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,170
It's a lot of steps to it.
But I'm gonna do some
research,

492
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,173
spend some time with you,
and umm...

493
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,976
get to know you a little bit.
Uh...

494
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,178
for possibly my next movie
project.

495
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,280
Excuse me, Orson Welles?

496
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,750
I have to go on record
in front of all the
other parents,

497
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,654
saying that I refuse
to take part in this.

498
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,788
That's okay.

499
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,924
Good.

500
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,627
I'm not saying, "I don't
wanna do it." I'm just...

501
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,996
I just wanna be clear
because this hap...

502
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,297
I fell for this one ti...

503
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,733
This isn't one of those, you
get in a room...

504
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,701
"You're so pretty, you're so
pretty. Take your top off.

505
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:14,438
I'm gonna film you" kinda
thing, is it?

506
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,008
That is so far from...
my intentions...

507
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,844
What are some of the
questions you'll be asking
us?

508
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:22,146
You talking to me?
You talking about me?

509
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,615
I'm talking to you, about
your job, about your life...

510
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,753
Why would that possibly,
possibly be of interest?

511
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,789
Well, we'll see after I talk...
When I'm all done,

512
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,725
it could not be interesting.
There's a great chance of it

513
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,628
not being interesting at all
and I won't make a movie.

514
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,897
Well, I'm very excited.
I'd like to go first.

515
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,232
Unfortunately,

516
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,567
I have offered that up
to coach Jimbo.

517
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,002
Why?!

518
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,737
Because he's first,
I talked to him first.

519
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,439
But I'm asking...
I'm the first to ask.

520
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,841
I'll have undue pressure.
I don't know,

521
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:51,442
I don't know what I'm
gonna be talking...

522
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,343
Pressure from what?!

523
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,611
Because you're gonna be
interviewing.

524
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,478
There'll be a camera in my
face.

525
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,646
I'm not filming you.

526
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,249
I am just hanging out with
you. There's no pressure.

527
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,985
Max, can I recommend an
actress to play me?

528
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,453
Halle Berry.

529
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,188
Halle Berry.

530
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,657
And for Manny, I don't care
who, who,

531
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,727
just as long as it's not one
of the, the fuckin' Will,

532
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,395
one of Will Smith's kids.

533
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,064
Are we invited to the
premiere?

534
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,065
This is very exciting.

535
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:18,235
Yeah. All right, I'm uh...I'm
just...

536
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,838
Just watch them practice.
I'm good. That's all I need.

537
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,740
Work on the slide, baby!
Slide!

538
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,876
Thank you, Coach Ted.
Thank you, everybody.

539
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,379
Uh, I guess whatever
he asks me.

540
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,980
Get it up!

541
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,315
You didn't talk to anyone?

542
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,983
I have not talked to
anyone.

543
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,620
I am talking to you first.
No one has been talked to.

544
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,956
You are #1.

545
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,560
[exhales loudly]

546
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,095
This is it.

547
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,964
All About Printing.

548
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:50,167
The owners had a real uh...
foresight, you know,

549
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,437
because they didn't wanna
limit it. All About Printing.

550
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,906
So it can be printing,
copies,

551
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,208
Anything that's
about printing.

552
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,776
Anything! It's about,
or even,

553
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,778
marginally associated
with printing...

554
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,747
- We can do.
- Mmm-hmm.

555
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,715
Or we can...potentially do.

556
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,884
We don't have, we don't
necessarily do it now.

557
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,955
But it's uh, the hub. And
this right here,

558
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,124
is my command center.

559
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,992
This is where I
operate everything...

560
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,195
In this whole, everybody
can hear me, see?

561
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,864
It's not so big that
they can't hear me

562
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,832
So I can just shout from
here

563
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,335
and everybody hears me.
[bells chimes]

564
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,404
Everyone can hear that
bell. No, no. No, no.

565
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:26,971
Oh.

566
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,105
I'm standing here

567
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,641
If you see the bell go off,
or hear the bell go off,

568
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,710
and I'm standing here, you
don't need to come up.

569
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,644
I'll handle the customer.

570
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,513
Oh, when my uncle hired
me he told me...

571
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,915
Katie, put it away.
[laughs]

572
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,684
And I'll tell you what, the
reason that I coach

573
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,021
the kids, is because
I'm in charge here, okay?

574
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,122
Mmm-hmm.

575
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,190
All About Printing.

576
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:51,162
And, it's...a...madhouse.

577
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,164
- It is a madhouse.
- Mmm-hmm.

578
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,499
You know, and baseball is
pastoral.

579
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,802
And it's quiet and it's calm,
you know?

580
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,070
And the kids are out there,
and they're dropping the
ball,

581
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,539
and they're not hitting it
and uh...

582
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,340
So it's not really
about the kids,

583
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,242
it's more about you
and getting your release.

584
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,877
Yeah, it's about getting
the...it's about release

585
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,845
And it all comes from here.

586
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,580
All comes from working
here.

587
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,282
And the customers that
come in and...

588
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,650
Do you know something
here?

589
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,919
Do you know the insurance
bill on this place?

590
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:18,255
Let me tell you something,
pal. Okay?

591
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:22,993
That machine right there,
is German precision.

592
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,261
And it can print about...

593
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,696
[yelling] Hey, hey hey! You
can't come back here!

594
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,465
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
to yell.

595
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,233
Stay behind that line,
would ya?

596
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,868
- W-what, what line?
- Imaginary line, right
here.

597
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,169
From that counter to that
counter.

598
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:32,837
Across. All right.

599
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,571
Stay behind it.

600
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,638
I'm right...I'm good.

601
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,706
- Insurance.
- Mmm-hmm.

602
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,141
- Safety.
-Mmm-hmm.

603
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,110
So I love get...hitting the
field after a week of this,

604
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,646
Because of the runaround
at this place.

605
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,516
and the pressure.
The pres... Listen...

606
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,684
to the traffic out there.

607
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,586
You can hear every car
and bus.

608
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,255
Hello sir!
[rings bell twice]

609
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,923
You don't have to do that
'cause I already did it.

610
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,925
Stay back in the back!

611
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,060
Picking up my package.

612
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,094
Okay, what's your name,
sir?

613
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:01,732
We usually put the...the
orders. Oh, that's...

614
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,334
Is that it? Is that you?

615
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:07,371
That's not him. Take this
back. Did you call earlier?

616
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,239
Yes I did.

617
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,540
Uh-huh. Who did you
speak to?

618
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,875
Jimbo.

619
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,444
Well, that's me!
[both laugh]

620
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,712
- Good to meet ya.
- Hey.

621
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,380
- And I spoke to you?
- Yes.

622
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,884
Hey!
[paper crinkling]

623
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,185
- Great.
- Right there!

624
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,987
I even signed it.

625
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,489
Oh, there's no coupon
allowed with this. Sorry.

626
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,157
I don't have one
to give you.

627
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,559
Because you ordered that
two weeks ago...

628
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,529
And the coupon
starts today,

629

00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,014
Good.

788
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:51,782
Okay, let's go.

789
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:54,284
All right, it was so nice
talking to you.

790
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,420
Me too.

791
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,692
Oh, look.

792
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,428
Yeah?

793
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,429
Jack, hold up.

794
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,463
Come take a ride.

795
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,966
Take a ride in my
brand new Camry.

796
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,133
Is this a beaut?

797
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,803
I just got it.
Let's do the interview now.

798
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:13,437
I...don't know.

799
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,939
It's a hybrid! I just got it.

800
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,241
I just picked it up!

801
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,376
We'll ride around and
we'll glide around.

802
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,278
I'm all pumped up on
coffee. In the showroom,

803
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,513
I had two cups.
It was free. Come on.

804
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,681
Is it all right?

805
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,484
Oh! Whatever you want.

806
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,219
All right,
I'll meet you at home.

807
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,555
I'm gonna go ride
in a brand new Camry.

808
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,657
I am gonna clip a coupon
and order something.

809
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,292
[cell phone ringing]
Okay, sounds good.

810
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,226
I'll see you later.
Hey, you guys...

811
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,128
- Bye dad!
- What do you feel like?

812
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,731
- Bye!
- Hello.

813
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,698
[cell ringing]
Hello? Hold on.

814
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,133
Hold on!

815
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,635
Hello!

816
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,303
You know how
Bluetooth works?

817
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,239
Rosie's calling, I don't
know how to answer it.

818
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,675
I'm pushing every button
and... Oh God, all right.

819
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,111
Let's go. We'll just drop by
the house

820
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,746
first for just a second. How
'bout that?

821
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,748
Sure, we'll drop by. This is
a beautiful car.

822
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,416
Okay, go ahead. Ask.
What do you wanna know?

823
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,485
Listen to how quiet.

824
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,593
Listen to that.

825
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:14,665
This car...running makes
less noise than most cars

826
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,167
when they're turned off.
It's a gorgeous car.

827
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,735
And listen, listen, listen.
You can't hear anything.

828
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,171
Listen.
Barely hear the door slam.

829
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,607
It's like a powderpuff.

830
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,475
It's not...I can hear it
slam. It's not loud,

831
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:30,948
When I was a kid, I wanted
a '67 Mustang. I got mine.

832
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,882
Here, come on in.

833
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:33,717
All right.

834
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,319
Honey?

835
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,187
Rosie?

836
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,056
Come in. Come in, please.
Let's see...

837
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,758
Rosie?
Oh, she's not here.

838
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,926
Well, this is where
it all happens.

839
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,895
This is where
the magic happens.

840
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,196
Every week,

841
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:50,500
we order pizzas
from around the world.

842
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,936
What are pizzas from
around the world?

843
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,839
I, you know, most people
have their favorite pizzeria,
you know.

844
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,475
We order pizza from,
literally, I'm telling you,

845
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,944
20, 30 miles away. You just
get a flavor from...

846
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,045
[stammering]

847
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,314
There's one way out call...
Hinojosa's,

848
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,917
and it's delicious. It's a
wonderful thing to have.

849
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,719
Mmm-hmm.

850
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:19,463
Memories, memories,
memories.

851
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:23,500
[silence]

852
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,540
Pictures. Very nice.

853
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,611
This is the one
I'm most proud of.

854
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,248
We were in Mesa, Arizona.

855
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,684
- You ever been to Mesa?
- No.

856
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,486
It's hot.

857
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,521
I mean, it was burning.

858
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,989
You know, the type of
burning, you know,

859
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,991
you could be in sandals,
you could be in sneakers.

860
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,327
It doesn't matter. You still
feel it beneath your feet.

861
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,262
And we rented the
sombreros, the ponchos,

862
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,998
even had guns. He's got a
gun. You can't see my gun.

863
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,767
Look at the tenacity on
that kid's face.

864
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,136
And the women were
scared. I'll give you that.

865
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,971
We were scared.

866
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:04,107
But dammit, we weren't
gonna let anything
cross us.

867
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,511
But you took that at, like, a
photo, uh, place, right?

868
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,945
No, no, no. Not a ph...

869
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,281
It's one of those expansive
places, you know?

870
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,384
I mean, way out, is, is, are
the souvenirs and
everything.

871
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,018
But just sort of...

872
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,653
A kiosk of some sort?

873
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,489
Wasn't a kiosk.

874
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:23,527
It was... You've got a
photographer out there

875
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,462
and you, you, you go out...
And you go out.

876
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,031
It was the west! We were
in Mesa!

877
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:28,598
Mmm-hmm.

878
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,501
It was a...
No!

879
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,337
No.

880
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,607
It was anything but
a kiosk.

881
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,877
[light knocking on door]

882
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,212

[whispering]
S.O.F. [exhales]

885
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,160
Yeah.

886
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:57,994
That's great.

887
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,763
What's S.O.F.?

888
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,064
[whispering]
"Soldier of Fortune."

889
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,366
"Soldier of Fortune."
Why you guys whispering?

890
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,668
[whispering]
I can't let Rosie know

891
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,570
that I'm getting
"Soldier of Fortune."

892
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,405
If she knows that I have
"Soldier of Fortune,"

893
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,639
she'll kill me.

894
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,408
[whispering]
Kill him.
[chuckles]

895
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,542
- Okay.
- Yeah.

896
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,810
That's great.

897
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,745
I can't believe... Have you
been to the range?

898
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,214
[whispering]
Every night.

899
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,182
Yeah.
That's cool.

900
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,517
All right, I gotta hide this.

901
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,419
Okay, thanks buddy.

902
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:27,424
[exhales]

903
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,325
[both whispering]
How you doing?

904
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,993
- Good, how you doing?
- Good.

905
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,195
- I'm Max.
- Hi, Max.

906
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:36,333
- I'm Tony.
- Hey, Tony.

907
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,402
[loud, extended breath]

908
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,043
Is it hot out there?

909
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,979
It's great today.

910
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,080
Yeah, I was just out there.

911
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:51,648
I don't know why I even
asked you if it was hot,

912
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,116
because I was just
out there.

913
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,551
- It's great.
- Yeah.

914
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,620
it's okay.

915
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,988
We're just whispering.

916
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,257
Well, it's just all part of
the S.O.F. thing.

917
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,192
I don't wanna give it up
and ruin it for you.

918
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,393
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

919
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,163

920
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,065
Take care, Tony.

921
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,400
Nice to meet you, Max.

922
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,435
Pleasure.

923
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,105
Honey?

924
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,974
I don't see her.

925
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:21,711
We started doing, uh,
like Pennsylvania art.

926
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,147
Pennsylvania Dutch
type of art, uh...

927
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,050
I like to call it
"America Primitive."

928
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,387
It's a lot of wood. It's a lot
more wood than I wanted.

929
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,055
This, believe it or not,

930
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,892
is where everything
I have is kept

931
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,929
I've got shirts, I've got my
pants, I've got my ties.

932
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,531
But this, this, this
dresser...

933
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,633
To you, it's a little dresser.
To me,

934
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,036
it's, it's my
gargantuan world.

935
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,238
This is, this is my
existence right here.

936
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,439
No, it's my dream...

937
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,209
to someday, maybe have
an armoire, like, right
here.

938
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,444
Harold, you don't need
an armoire.

939
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,247
I don't need an armoire?
Forget it, forget it!

940
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,884
Hartman called. He said it's
a no-can-do on the Camry.

941
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,787
And I already, I drove it
out of the lot already.

942
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,656
I'm so sorry! [stammering]
I jumped way too quick.

943
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,125
I... 'cause I already drove
it off the lot. I'm sorry.

944
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,428
I'm sorry, I always leap
before I crawl

945
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,763
and I'm sorry. And I should
have called him.

946
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:14,864
I should have asked you.

947
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,567
And, and I knew it.
I'm, I was wrong.

948
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,268
How's little Jackie?

949
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,269
Oh, he's great.

950
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,403
- Aww...
- Thank you for asking.

951
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,338
He's a great boy.

952
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,475
Yeah. He loves nature,
doesn't he?

953
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:29,045
I suppose. As much as
any kid loves nature.

954
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,315
So... I'm gonna get going.

955
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,283
Can you give me
a ride home?

956
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,852
Oh, the flatbed's gonna
be here any second

957
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,686
to load the Camry.

958
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,188
Already?

959
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,556
No, I'm sorry.

960
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,525
Yeah, can you use Rosie's
car and uh, take me home?

961
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,594
That's a no-go.

962
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,631
No.

963
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:48,531
How about you, Rosie?

964
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,800
Can you give me
a ride home?

965
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:54,704
Max... No-can-do.

966
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,710
I can call you a cab.

967
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,680
[sighs]

968
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,955
Shouldn't you guys uh,
be practicing baseball?

969
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,657
No, we like soccer.

970
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,991
All right.

971
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:15,859
I gotta tell ya...

972
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,028
[laughing] What?
What's with the cab?

973
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,298
Uh...
[sighs]

974
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,134
They uh, wouldn't
give me a ride home.

975
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,736
My imagination couldn't
come up with the stuff

976
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,339
that I"m seeing.
This behavior.

977
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,240
You know, when
I wondered,

978
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,042
"what is her
personal life like?"

979
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:32,776
I had no idea.

980
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:36,413
I don't know what
I'm thinking.

981
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,647
[sighs]

982
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,549
- Come on!
- Oh.

983
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,650
Dammit!

984
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,686
Follow through, Jackie!

985
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,586
Sweet stuff.

986
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,989
How's he doing?

987
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:46,589
[metal bat hitting ball]

988
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,524
Oh! There you go.

989
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:48,825
Relax, relax.

990
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,893
Faster!

991
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,261
All right, get out.
Out.

992
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:52,629
Come on out.
You're done.

993
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:56,533
Jack.
That was great, man.

994
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,233
It's not a science.

995
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,203
Hey! Got a sec?
Excuse me.

996
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,171
Who told you that?!

997
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:05,241
It is a science. That kid
liked to you, all right?

998
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,943
What do you think
these numbers are?

999
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,812
Now listen.
Next time you go up,

1000
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,914
I want you to glue that bat
to your shoulder.

1001
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,916
I don't want you swinging.

1002
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,951
That's how you get a walk.
[chuckles]

1003
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,921
Okay?
You know what else?

1004
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,123
Try to get hit. Okay?

1005
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,224
It doesn't hurt that much.

1006
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,225
Have you ever got
a shot at the doctor's?

1007
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:25,128
It hurts like that.Takes
a second. Goes away.

1008
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,930
And then you get on base.
Good!

1009
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,298
Manny!

1010
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,599
Do we play games
with our shoes untied?

1011
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,401
Do we play games
with our shirt untucked?

1012
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,302
No.

1013
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,737
Do we play games
with our belt undone?

1014
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,639
No we don't. We don't live
in a barn, Manny.

1015
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,408
We're going to tuck in
our shirt because...

1016
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,244
we're not animals, right?

1017
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,645
What does mommy
always tell you?

1018
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,646
"Go big or go home."

1019
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,715
No. "Don't fuck up." Okay?

1020
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,283
And you know what?
I want you to have fun.

1021
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,752
That's most important,
okay?

1022
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,020
And keep your elbows up.
Got it?

1023
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,622
Go have fun, killer.
Elbows up!

1024
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,890
I'm excited about
coming over.

1025
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,091
Oh...
[laughs]

1026
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,961
Oh, I'm really good with it.
You're gonna enjoy it.

1027
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:58,728
Okay, cool.

1028
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,929
Bring all your tools.

1029
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:00,930
Bring all my tools?

1030
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:01,765
Yeah, bring your tools.

1031
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,099
Bring all the stuff
you need.

1032
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,434
For what?

1033
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,935
For whatever happens!

1034
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:06,770
I'm just gonna talk to you.

1035
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,171
Just bring a bunch of stuff.

1036
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,973
When you say "a bunch of
stuff," it's just so random.

1037
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,241
It's random,
but just bring anything.

1038
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,343
- Hey coach!
- [laughs]

1039
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:14,477
- Hey!
- Have a good game.

1040
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,146
Motivated. Motivation!

1041
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,181
- That's what it's about.
- That's right.

1042
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,249
Bring whatever
you wanna bring.

1043
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,317
Uh...
No snacks.

1044
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,252
- No.
- Just stuff.

1045
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,253
Okay.

1046
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,254
All right? I'll see you
later on, all right?

1047
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,255
Have a good game, coach.

1048
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,656
You damn right!

1049
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,258
[cheering]
Way to go, Stevie!

1050
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,626
Throwing smoke!

1051
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,661
Throwing smoke!

1052
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:35,031
Good arm!
Good... arm!

1053
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,836
[gasps]
Max. Hi...

1054
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,604
Umm...

1055
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,173
- I hate to be nitpicky.
- Mmm-hmm.

1056
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,341
Just wondering when
you're gonna have

1057
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:46,709
that money ready?
We...

1058
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,978
are just keeping
a running tab for you

1059
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,146
and little Jackie!

1060
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,247
- [chuckles]
- Mmm-hmm.

1061
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,783
Uh, little Jackie took one
of my healthy muffins...

1062
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,018
- He had one of
the healthy muffins?
- I was so proud of him!

1063
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,352
- Yes!
- Oh, okay.

1064
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,487
They give you a lot
of energy.

1065
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,889
But I will...
when I have some...

1066
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,191
I don't have any
extra cash today.

1067
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,158
- Okay.
- So I will...

1068
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,326
Because they go
towards the team

1069
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,894
and towards the
coach's gifts.

1070
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,296
- I know... For everything.
- Okay.

1071
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,397
By the way, I think
everyone should pay.

1072
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:07,997
I'm with you.

1073
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,033
- So I'm not against it.
- A few bucks?

1074
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,334
But I will.
More than a few bucks.

1075
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,302
I'm gonna throw in
a big 20.

1076
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,136
- Okay.
- Okay.

1077
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,804
- All right.
- All right.

1078
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,573
Okay.

1079
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:20,410
[whooshing sound]
[bat hitting ball]

1080
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,516
When I played...
and you were coaching...

1081
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:27,550
Mmm-hmm?

1082
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,651
What were the
parents like?

1083
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,919
Were they like these idiots?

1084
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,921
I don't know.
I didn't know most of 'em.

1085
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,590
You didn't know 'em?

1086
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,892
No. How would I get
to know 'em?

1087
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,428
They drop off their kids,
they, they leave.

1088
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,563
They didn't even hang out?

1089
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,265
No.
Why would they hang out?

1090
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,435
Parents got things to do.
That's...

1091
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,604
What's wrong with
you people?

1092
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,672
That's what's wrong
with you people.

1093
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,609
You're so involved.

1094
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,745
You know? Playing catch
with your kids is good.

1095
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,548
Showing up and saying,
"Hey, nice job!"

1096
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,950
or you know, whatever.
That's good.

1097
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,052
But all this involvement.

1098
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,555
We just said what
whatever coach says.

1099
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:07,423
You don't remember the
stuff your coach did?

1100
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,292
And I was, like,
"whatever, it's the coach.

1101
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,727
Whatever coach says."

1102
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:11,895
Okay. What if the coach
tells your kid

1103
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,229
to keep his bat
on the shoulder

1104
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,364
every time he goes
up to bat?

1105
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,634
That's what the coach said!
See, that's my point.

1106
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:19,369
We're in agreement.

1107
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:19,869
Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,904
We think alike.

1109
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,906
I think just like you.

1110
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:25,208
Do you know how often I,
like, do something

1111
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,143
and I go, "That's what dad
would've done"?

1112
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,177
Do you know how many
times I do that?

1113
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,913
- All the time.
- Oh.

1114
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,247
I learned a lot from you.

1115
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,315
Well...

1116
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:33,816
You're welcome.

1117
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,952
Well, thank you.
Thank you big time.

1118
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,854
Big time.

1119
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,958
I just don't buy it,
I'm sorry.

1120
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,793
I should have explained.

1121
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,295
Now let me ask you guys
a question.

1122
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:48,698
And I want you to take this
serious. Really consider it.

1123
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,334
How much for you to go on
the field and run in a circle

1124
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:54,637
around the whole field
during the game?

1125
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,205
During the game,
while people are watching?

1126
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,741
People are watching. Yep.

1127
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,510
Why would you do that?
You'd be...

1128
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,078
You'd be a jackass.

1129
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,748
- How much money
to be a jackass?
- Oh!

1130
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,483
2500 bucks.

1131
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,718
2500 bucks.

1132
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,286
That makes it
just tempting.

1133
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,788
Let's not get
Uncle Sam involved.

1134
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,655
- Yeah.
- All right.

1135
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:13,690
2500 cash, up front.

1136
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:15,258
Sure... cash, my friend.

1137
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,193
Yeah, how much
would you do it for?

1138
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,528
- I wouldn't do it.
- What?!

1139
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,529
- Stop it.
- I wouldn't do it.

1140
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,598
$250,000.

1141
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,799
- Give me another number.
- What?!

1142
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,300
- A million dollars.
- Nope.

1143
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,703
- Two million dollars.
- Nope.

1144
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:27,804
Five million dollars.

1145
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,339
It's not what I'm made of.

1146
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:31,207
I'm just thinking
sometimes, if we were

1147
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,508
to play in
one of these games,

1148
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,477
how we would dominate.

1149
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:34,978
Who, you and me?

1150
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,578
Oh man, yeah.

1151
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,183
It must be like how
McGwire felt playing,

1152
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,518
standing up there.

1153
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,221
[smattered applause and
distant chatter]

1154
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,493
This is um, Hans.
This is Max.

1155
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:51,961
Hi Hans!

1156
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,363
[Austrian accent]
Nice meeting you.

1157
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:54,330
You're the first Hans
I've ever met.

1158
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,865
Really? Want some?

1159
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh I'll have a couple,
thank you.

1160
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,401
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1161
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,503
We used to be roommates
together in Paris

1162
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:01,704
when we went to
culinary school.

1163
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,006
That was a great time,
wasn't it?

1164
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,207
- Oh, how about that?
- That was fun.

1165
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,808
- We had
a really good time.
- Oh cool!

1166
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,577
- Um... I gotta go...
- You and Hans.

1167
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,145
Yeah, I-I...
I'm gonna be right back.

1168
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,648
I gotta go to the loo.
Will you...

1169
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,649
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

1170
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,683
I'll be back in a second.

1171
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,718
- Just... hold my spot,
yeah?
- For sure.

1172
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,887
She's going to the loo.

1173
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:21,090
Which is normal to you.
To me, it's uh...

1174
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,759
it's usually the bathroom or
the restroom.

1175
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:24,093
Yeah.

1176
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,328
So how long you
been here for?

1177
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,263
Just arrived.
A couple days.

1178
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,097
And your first time
in America?

1179
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,565
First time America.

1180
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,101
Wow! Wow, wow.
You enjoying it?

1181
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,870
I love it. I just don't get
this sport here.

1182
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:34,837
It looks fun and...

1183
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,239
It's very confusing,
baseball,

1184
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,907
for someone from...
where you from?

1185
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:38,741
I'm Austrian.

1186
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,109
Austria. Hans from Austria

1187
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,377
would not understand
this right away.

1188
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,612
I'm more soccer
and skiing, you know?

1189
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:44,547
Soccer's more simple to
understand. You kick it.

1190
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:45,915
You stop it.
You kick in a goal.

1191
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,216
You count the goal.
It's easy.

1192
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1193
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,352
But here... What is this
guy, for example,

1194
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,653
doing there? He's just
standing around

1195
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,723
The ball to be hit to him,
maybe?

1196
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,893
Yeah. So you've never...

1197
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:58,361
You've never even seen a
baseball game?

1198
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,729
First time.

1199
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:03,166
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.

1200
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,935
Hey! Hey!
[laughing]

1201
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,471
Stranger on the field!

1202
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:12,375
[laughing hysterically]
Stranger on the field! Hey!

1203
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,543
How you doing?

1204
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,677
Get him off!

1205
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:15,611
Who are you?

1206
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,580
I'm Hans.
Who are you?

1207
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:18,414
I'm Jack.

1208
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,816
Nice to meet you, Jack.

1209
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,317
Max, who is that?!

1210
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:22,719
I don't know!

1211
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:23,820
Get outtta there!

1212
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:24,620
Part of the game, coach?

1213
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:25,621
No, it's not part of
the game!

1214
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,056
It's gonna be
an automatic out.

1215
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,558
Where's Hans?

1216
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,592
Um... right there.

1217
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:30,727
Bring it in!
Off the diamond, now!

1218
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,428
- What's he doing
out there?
- Hi, I'm Hans.

1219
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,063
- That's it, let's go!
- Nice meeting you.

1220
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,998
That's illegal, dude. What
you're doing is...

1221
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,666
Great man.

1222
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:40,002
Ooh, yeah!

1223
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:41,738
See that?!

1224
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,407
That's what happens
around here!

1225
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,844
[mild applause and
distant chattering]

1226
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,116
What are ya...
What are you writing?

1227
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,484
What I'm writing in here,

1228
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:57,687
you could not comprehend
in your brain of brains.

1229
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,122
If I let you read this,

1230
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,690
you would throw it down
on the ground

1231
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,158
and run to
a mental institution

1232
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,694
and check yourself in
and request...

1233
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,996
[bat hitting ball]
a straightjacket.

1234
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,631
You're very intense.

1235
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,932
Throw it home!

1236
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,667
Throw it home!

1237
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:14,837
Steven, I swear to God,
get up right now!

1238
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,940
Steven! Get up!
Throw it home!

1239
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,675
- You know that's her son,
right?
- Go! Go! Go!

1240
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:22,845
and he should throw
the fucking ball.

1241
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,848
For a little kid,
he's a huge pussy.

1242
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,818
Suck it up!
Suck it up!

1243
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,855
Suck it up.

1244
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,124
The compound, baby!
Right?

1245
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,392
This is your compound?

1246
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,493
The compound.

1247
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:38,861
Gotta use the bathroom?
Use it now.

1248
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,029
The porta-potty's
over there.

1249
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,130
Port-a-potty?

1250
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,332
By putting a port-a-potty
on my property,

1251
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,400
people can't use
my bathroom.

1252
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:47,470
is people sitting their ass
on my toilet.

1253
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,573
Shangri-la! You know?
Pool over there.

1254
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,875
I sleep over there.
Ladies?!

1255
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,377
My buddy Max, right here.

1256
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:55,978
Hi, Max Morris.
How are ya?

1257
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,013
Jackie.

1258
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,247
- How are you, Jackie?
- "The Chocolatier."

1259
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,149
- Hi.

take off their clothes...

we do a radio show...

that our clothes are off...

Can I...get you a glass
of wine or something?

1413
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,176
- No, I'm fine.
- Okay.

1414
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:30,479
Can you just do me
a favor, and stay behind...

1415
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,081
right there?
You could lean,

1416
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,517
do whatever, I just, this is,
you know, kind of a...

1417
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,886
cooking space and
it needs to be sanitary

1418
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:38,954
and all that stuff, so...

1419
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,456
Okay, sure.

1420
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,190
- Right here is good?

1421
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:41,991
- Yeah, perfect!

1422
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:42,858
All right.

1423
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,995
Can I get you anything?
Noth... Hey!

1424
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,997
Keep those sneakers away
from my kitchen.

1425
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,564
Uh-huh.

1426
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,299
Mmm. All right.

1427
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:54,069
So your place has a
lesbiany vibe to it.

1428
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:57,206
It really does. I feel like
I'm in a lesbian home.

1429
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,175
There's lesbiany and not
lesbiany...

1430
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:00,409
Excuse me, what do you
mean? What should...

1431
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,844
[stammering] Is the house
lesbiany?

1432
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,280
What should a "house
lesbiany" be...

1433
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:05,381
- ...in your opinion?
- I don't know...

1434
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,483
I've never been in a
lesbian house.

1435
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:08,584
Actually, to be honest,
it is quite lesbionic.

1436
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,754
It's very lesbian.

1437
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:12,655
Lesbionic?

1438
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,089
- Well...
- Is that a real word?

1439
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:17,593
I think as real as lesbiany,
but it's, it's very...

1440
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:20,062
Oh, baby!
Hi, sweetheart!

1441
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:21,430
- Hi.
- How ya doing?

1442
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:22,765
Did you have fun?

1443
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:23,832
- I'm good.
- Did you wash your
hands?

1444
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:24,567
No!

1445
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:28,103
We're gonna eat in like an
hour.

1446
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:30,506
Permission to enter
my own fucking kitchen?

1447
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:32,575
Yes, but can you take off
your shoes, babe?

1448
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:33,776
No, I'm not taking off my...

1449
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:35,377
We have guests! I'm not
taking off my shoes.

1450
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,645
I know but, don't touch!

1451
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:40,115
What are you making?
It stinks in here.

1452
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,050
- Babe, I'm making
a quiche.
- Ich.

1453
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:41,784
A fantastic quiche.

1454
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,153
you're gonna make
a huge quiche for who?

1455
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:47,022
Manny's gonna eat it
and you're gonna eat it
and I'm gonna eat it.

1456
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:49,258
Manny needs red meat.
He has a game coming up.

1457
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,593
Why are you feeding my
son quiche?

1458
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,360
What's wrong with quiche?

1459
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,095
Don't feed my son quiche.

1460
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,663
She's trying to
turn him gay.

1461
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,532
I believe it. You know,
this is her dream.

1462
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,933
Don't tell me this isn't
your dream.

1463
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,134
- That's charming.
- This is her dream.

1464
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:00,469
- Super-charming.
- I croak...

1465
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,737
because I'm
a super athlete

1466
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,106
and we always die young.
'Cause even though...

1467
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,242
you know, we work
our bodies like a horse...

1468
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,142
- I die young...
- Thoroughbred.

1469
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,143
she moves to
New York City,

1470
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,245
which she never stops
talking about,

1471
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,145
in a little apartment

1472
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,981
with her gay son...

1473
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:13,349
- He's not gay.
- ...and his lover.

1474
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,084
- Manny is so not gay.
- She's trying to make him
gay.

1475
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,653
...and his lover,
because here's her theory.

1476
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,188
Gay men take care
of their moms.

1477
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,057
That's not a theory,
that's a fact, my friend.

1478
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,092
So he'll make her up, put
a wig on her, slap some...

1479
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,760
take her to the Met ball.

1480
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:25,894
That's what she thinks!

1481
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:29,565
It's very specific 'cause
it's just occurring to me.

1482
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:34,970
Why is it that lesbians,
who clearly...like women,

1483
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,472
they seem to...

1484
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:38,841
One of them tends to be
more masculine

1485
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,309
than the other one.

1486
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:43,445
And it seems to be that
they're almost mimicking

1487
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,649
heterosexual couples
in a way.

1488
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,818
Who do you think that is
in this couple?

1489
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,722
You know what's
interesting?

1490
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,893
You're like the exception
to the rule.

1491
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,862
You guys are.

1492
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,736
[bouncy, jazz music ♪]

1493
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,287
It's a long fly ball, going
back towards the wall!

1494
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,456
He's going back!
He's going back!

1495
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,059
And he snags it!
[laughs]

1496
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:31,627
Just in front of the wall.
I do that every time.

1497
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,395
That's a... here, take one.

1498
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:34,897
A double off the wall,
in your case.

1499
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,031
That looks really
comfortable.

1500
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:39,735
It isn't really, but it's worth
the joke every time.

1501
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:41,503
- Oh my god.
- So...

1502
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,172
This is a great place to
hang out

1503
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,306
and watch the ball game.

1504
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,741
Ah-hah.

1505
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,843
Yeah, I love baseball.
I love watching it.

1506
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:51,213
I played it. I had dreams of
uh, of being good.

1507
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:55,718
I played, I got an... offer of
a scholarship to Ball State,

1508
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,552
but I didn't wanna go...

1509
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,855
You know, I thought it
would be a lot of jokes.

1510
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,523
You turned down
a scholarship

1511
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,624
based on
the school's name?

1512
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,393
I was cocky, you know?
I thought...

1513
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:06,328
And then I wanted to
go down to Stetson.

1514
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,496
Did you ever hear of that?
That's down in Florida.

1515
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:08,430
Yeah, that's in Florida.

1516
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,498
Near Orlando,
if I'm not mistaken.

1517
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,400
Yeah, it is on
the east coast.

1518
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:12,368
But someone said, "Oh,

1519
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,603
you're gonna go into
the hat business?

1520
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,739
So, it's uh, it's gonna be
a good season.

1521
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:19,007
Your kid is a pretty
cracker jack ball player.

1522
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,143
You think so?
I don't think so.

1523
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,211
No? Well, I don't know.

1524
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,213
Your son's the one
who's good.

1525
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,181
Well, we're looking ahead.
We're looking to college.

1526
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:27,349
I want him to get a, uh...

1527
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:29,618
I'm hoping for
scholarship, uh...

1528
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,188
I'm hoping for pro ball.
Making the big show.

1529
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,123
That's what I'm
concentrating on.

1530
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:39,194
Yeah, I just have a feeling.
He's not there yet, but um,

1531
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,597
I'm gonna keep pounding
and keep after him. And uh

1532
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,065
make sure he wants
to do it.

1533
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,366
You know,
sometimes he's not sure

1534
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,802
and I have to tell him, uh,
that he wants to do it.

1535
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,371
I take him out to the
ball game and he loves it.

1536
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,573
Sometimes kids don't
know what they want.

1537
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,477
Um, I've actually pitched
to Rick.

1538
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,380
And what you've got to do
is hit him a couple times

1539
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:00,182
with the ball. Then they're
not afraid of it anymore.

1540
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:01,717
You hit him? What, you
pitch the ball and hit him?

1541
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,051
Just pitch at him.
Watch out!

1542
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,521
Don't tell him I said that.

1543
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,323
Can you imagine me
telling your son

1544
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:10,592
that you throw at him, uh,
on purpose?

1545
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,261
And the trouble is,
he's still afraid...

1546
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:13,395
That made him
more afraid.

1547
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:15,464
It would make me
more afraid too.

1548
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:16,565
That's the craziest logic
I've ever heard.

1549
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,635
But now he knows what
it feels like to be...

1550
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:20,702
But, I mean, he's ten.

1551
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,771
Shouldn't it just be
for fun now, or...

1552
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,739
Why does it have to be
so serious?

1553
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,274
Yeah, it could be
for fun now.

1554
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,942
You know, you gotta
think of the future.

1555
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:30,012
If you let kids
just have fun, uh...

1556
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:32,281
they wouldn't do anything.

1557
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,117
Oh crap.
Why do we bet on horses?

1558
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,618
I-I don't get on horses.

1559
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,288
[sighs] Well... It can be fun
if you ever win.

1560
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,657
But you don't know what
the hell is going through
their mind.

1561
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,293
Well that's it. Thanks so
much for stopping by.

1562
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,428
Good luck
with your project.

1563
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,198
Aren't we gonna go
look in the house?

1564
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,302
Uh, you can't get in
the house now, umm...

1565
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:56,338
I can't get in?
You live out here?!

1566
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,174
Yeah, yeah, temporarily.
I'm, uh...

1567
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:01,777
This is where I crash, uh...

1568
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,946
- Right now...
- Where does Ricky live?

1569
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:06,281
He's with wife number two.

1570
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:06,882
Mmm-hmm.

1571
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:09,518
Andrea's number...

1572
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,320
I'm joking, she's just
number four.

1573
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,121
Uh...but she's the one...

1574
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,224
I-I think we're gonna
get back together.

1575
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,059
But I wanna give her
some time.

1576
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:21,830
And right now, I don't want
any part of that.

1577
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,701
Very nice house.

1578
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:26,869
Thank you.

1579
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,437
You know,
can I just say something?

1580
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:29,171
Sure.

1581
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,406
Just a... I just wanna say...

1582
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:35,143
It is so...nice of Marty...

1583
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,546
to let you have
this beautiful house

1584
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,047
while he sits out there.

1585
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:40,916
And I'm not saying that
you should feel guilty

1586
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,551
or invite him in.
You're divorced. I...

1587
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:44,586
You've...
However you've done it,

1588
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:46,054
you've earned this place,
what have you, but...

1589
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,723
What are you
talking about?

1590
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:50,425
I'm paying this house,
not him.

1591
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,327
I'm letting him stay.

1592
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:53,529
You're letting him stay?
[cell phone ringing]

1593
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,597
Yeah. Oh, wait.
I've gotta take this call.

1594
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,799
- Hold on a sec, please.
- Okay.

1595
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,276
[sighs]
[phone continues to ring]

1596
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:21,123
Hey! Umm...
Today's not a good day.

1597
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,424
Oh, it's not?
All right.

1598
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:25,427
Well I appreciate your time
anyhow. Thank you.

1599
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,762
- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

1600
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,363
I didn't mean to
bother you or anything.

1601
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,699
It's all right.

1602
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,535
So it's really important
to ice the shoulder

1603
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:35,504
that you don't use
as much?

1604
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:36,471
Oh yeah. Yeah.

1605
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:38,307
That's just as tired as
the throwing arm.

1606
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,776
Huh, all right.
You eat a lot of fruit.

1607
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,978
Oh yeah, I love fruit.
In the morning, though.

1608
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,812
A lot of vegetables?

1609
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:44,813
Love veggies.

1610
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:45,647
Work out a lot?

1611
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:47,549
Every day.

1612
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:49,718
Yeah, I don't know
how you live like that.

1613
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,186
It's not for everybody.

1614
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,055
Yeah.

1615
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,122
Get it in! Get it in!

1616
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,158
Come bring it over here!

1617
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,159
Coach Jimbo's got
something to say!

1618
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,260
Parents too!

1619
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,127
You going over to
the meeting?

1620
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:00,162
Yeah, we'll be there
in a minute.

1621
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:02,497
All right.

1622
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,465
Line 'em up!

1623
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,100
- Line 'em up.
- Parents too, please!

1624
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,736
Parents, you understand?
Team parents.

1625
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:10,806
Line up, parents!
Make a circle.

1626
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,077
I can't express to you how
important this Friday is.

1627
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,311
But he will!

1628
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:19,815
If we win Friday,
we get in the playoffs!

1629
01:00:19,817 --> 01:00:20,782
Playoff time!

1630
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,818
If we don't win, we're out!

1631
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,086
We out!

1632
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,954
- If we lose.
- If we lose.

1633
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:26,755
We're gonna win!

1634
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:27,489
But we gonna win.

1635
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:28,523
Here's what we're gonna
do!

1636
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,826
We don't have the field
before the game!

1637
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,961
That means you gotta
practice at home!

1638
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,796
That means, parents!
[snaps fingers]

1639
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,265
Down to the batting cages!

1640
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,534
And bring the kids with
you!

1641
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,670
Three things!

1642
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,872
No skateboarding.

1643
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,440
- No scootering.
- Please!

1644
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:48,777
No swimming.
But most importantly...

1645
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:49,945
[whispers]
...no swimming.

1646
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:52,514
- No baths!
- No swimming!

1647
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:54,282
Do not get in the water!

1648
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:57,552
Okay, I don't need any
injuries!

1649
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:59,988
You can take a bath.
They can take a bath.

1650
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,790
But I'd prefer a shower.

1651
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,659
Don't submerge your body
under water!

1652
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,327
That's right.
You can shower!

1653
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,795
All right, you got
your marching orders!

1654
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,330
Let's go!
Go Cubs!

1655
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,865
Go get 'em!

1656
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:14,403
Ah, I think I got through to
them. Not sure.

1657
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:19,775
[Coach Jimbo]:
I'm gonna call,
followup with an email...

1658
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,646
Hezekiah,
you have my word,

1659
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,715
this is the last time
I'm gonna ask you.

1660
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:29,151
But it would just mean so
much to me,

1661
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,619
if I could just spend a
minute with you.

1662
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:34,756
Here. Now. Just like, let's
just talk. Just for a minute.

1663
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,591
I couldn't even if
I wanted to.

1664
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:39,027
I'm already talking to
somebody about a movie.

1665
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,896
You're talking to somebody
about a movie? Who?

1666
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,331
Don't worry about it.
Somebody. People.

1667
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,900
Somebody on the team?

1668
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:46,935
I can't tell you that.

1669
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:51,006
I can tell you that Barnaby
and I are gonna be living
the high life.

1670
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,910
Okay.

1671
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:58,613
That's right.
Walk away.

1672
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,083
Baby, you're not breathing.
[bat hitting ball]

1673
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,351
Ah! That's my...
that's a breathe. You see?

1674
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,886
Of course he's breathing.
He has to breath.

1675
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,722
What do you know about
baseball anyhow,

1676
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:07,622
that you're telling him this?

1677
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:10,892
Jack, that's it, because
you're breathing, honey!

1678
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,594
Well, lemme tell you this.
Hezekiah?

1679
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:14,930
- Yeah.
- He's planning on a movie.

1680
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,932
He's planning on making
a movie, come on!

1681
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:19,634
Oh please, come on.
That's not important, Max.

1682
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:22,237
It's just not.
This is what's important.

1683
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,772
All right, Jack.
What do you say,

1684
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,907
after we're done here
we go swimming?

1685
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,275
I'd love to go swimming!

1686
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,744
He'd love to go swimming!

1687
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:29,611
No swimming!

1688
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:30,445
- Yes.
- No swimming.

1689
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:31,279
- Yes.
- No swimming.

1690
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,347
Yes.

1691
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,122
You go.
Your turn.

1692
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:42,390
Okay, okay.

1693
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:43,892
- What?
- Enough. Good.

1694
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,227
That's enough swimming.
Good.

1695
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:48,130
It's enough swimming?
We've hardly been in here.

1696
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:48,964
That's it!

1697
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,332
That's crazy.

1698
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,100
It's not crazy,
it's the coach's orders.

1699
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,301
Everybody out of the pool!

1700
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,103
Can't you see that the
coaches orders

1701
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,738
make no sense
whatsoever?

1702
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,540
I actually do not see that,
to tell you the truth.

1703
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,208
I think they make
a lot of sense.

1704
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,576
What could possibly
happen to him?

1705
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,311
I'm just...
I'm supporting the coach.

1706
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,546
What's wrong with
supporting the coach?

1707
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,214
Let me tell you something
about supporting
the coach.

1708
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,050
I just had a little talk
with Jack, okay?

1709
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,752
And we have decided...

1710
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,754
You're in agreement
with me, correct?

1711
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:15,590
He is no longer going
to keep the bat
on his shoulder.

1712
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:17,559
When he sees a pitch
he wants to hit,

1713
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,694
he's going to swing away.
Is that correct sir?

1714
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:20,695
Yep.

1715
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,898
That is correct.
Did I force you to say that?

1716
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,400
Did I intimidate you
in any way?

1717
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:28,637
Okay, your honor, I, uh...

1718
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,237
Max.

1719
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,405
I rest my case.

1720
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,574
You're teaching him
to go up against authority.

1721
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:33,942
You know what?
You're right.

1722
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,777
I apologize.

1723
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:39,748
Jack, you do not
automatically go up
against authority.

1724
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,117
But I'll tell you something,
man. Big lesson.

1725
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,318
You're a little young
to bring it up,

1726
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,519
but I'm gonna tell you
right now.

1727
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:47,522
Question authority.
Question it constantly.

1728
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:48,990
Question, question,
question.

1729
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,458
I'll tell you something else.

1730
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,828
He's more concerned with

1731
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,832
what snacks they serve
after a game. That's right.

1732
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,767
So let's say you have a
choice.

1733
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:03,171
You can have cupcakes for
a snack after the game.

1734
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,107
Uh, but if you do that, your
team loses nine to six.

1735
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:10,712
Or you guys win nine to six
and you...get celery.

1736
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:12,547
Which would you choose?

1737
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,516
Lose and get a cupcake.

1738
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,284
Lose and get a cupcake!

1739
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,452
These are great life
lessons.

1740
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,553
I say that's the attitude of
a winner!

1741
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:20,789
Yeah, no. These are uh,
just the greatest

1742
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,257
life lessons you are
teaching our son.

1743
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:25,460
I don't even wanna do this
movie anymore.

1744
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,494
- No more research.
- Good!

1745
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,364
I just wanna go
watch my son...

1746
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,333
have fun playing baseball.

1747
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:33,034
I wanna watch our son,
too,

1748
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,836
have fun, winning at
baseball.

1749
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:37,239
I think it's actually
rude of us and wrong

1750
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,940
to even watch him play.

1751
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,476
I think the one thing kids
don't need to play baseball

1752
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,477
is parents.

1753
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,846
For parents
one game a season.

1754
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:46,381
They can call it
"Parents Game."

1755
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,817
And the kids will know that
that game sucks.

1756
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:50,852
And what are you gonna do
when parents can come?

1757
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:53,989
Jack?
Your coach is your leader.

1758
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,991
You have to respect
what he says.
-All right.

1759
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:58,093
If he tells you to keep
the bat on your shoulder,

1760
01:04:58,095 --> 01:04:59,327
he knows how to win.

1761
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,897
The coach knows
how to win, Jack.

1762
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,032
Oh my God.

1763
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,333
Bring it in! Bring it in!l

1764
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,067
Oh my God.

1765
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,035
Everybody bring it in!

1766
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,670
What the hell's going one?

1767
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:09,437
Bring it!

1768
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:10,772
Gather round!
Gather round!

1769
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:12,207
Gather round!

1770
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:12,841
The coach is rolling in.

1771
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:17,379
Not all right.
Uh, parents, take a knee.

1772
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,381
Take a knee.
Parents, take a knee.

1773
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,484
Um, if you don't mind,
I'm not gonna take a knee,

1774
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,386
because I've got pebbles
in there and it hurts.

1775
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,854
I'll do it on the grass.
Not here, please.

1776
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:27,622
Okay, okay. So listen.

1777
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,491
We've got a challenge, all
right?

1778
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:30,725
It's called a challenge.

1779
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:33,428
I know that I told you
a few days ago...

1780
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,596
no swimming!

1781
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,298
He said no swimming
at all!

1782
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,799
Well, the other night, I...

1783
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,267
thought I'd take
a quick dip.

1784
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,035
He dipped!

1785
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:42,404
No! No! No!
No swimming!

1786
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:43,338
- No swimming!
- I'm not proud of it.

1787
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,140
Ah!

1788
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:46,408
Coach is human.

1789
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,709
That's what they learn
today.

1790
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,378
They find out I'm human.
I'm not a god.

1791
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,447
I'm not perfect
like they thought.

1792
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,782
You know what I have to
say?! Poof! Poof!

1793
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,150
The game goes poof.

1794
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:56,952
Hey! Coach's lesson.

1795
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,320
This is not
a coach's lesson.

1796
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,188
I hope...
it was worth it, coach.

1797
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,590
Because this is
the most important day

1798
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,659
of these kids' lives.

1799
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,294
It's a very important day
for all of us, coach!

1800
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,729
And what are we gonna do
now, huh?

1801
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:09,164
- Our kids don't win this
game today,
- Turn me around.

1802
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,598
they don't win the game
next week!

1803
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,133
I'm not looking at you until
you look at me...

1804
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,570
with admiration!

1805
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,271
Fuck you!

1806
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:17,973
Don't you ever! Ow!

1807
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:21,343
Don't watch! Don't look!
Don't look! Turn away!

1808
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,577
Turn around, turn around.

1809
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,147
The children mustn't see
the coach in a moment of
weakness!

1810
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,782
Turn around.
Everybody turn around.

1811
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:30,185

That's it!

1815
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,823
Way to go, Ricky!

That's it, Manny!

That a boy!

1818
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,760
What's on going on out
there?! You all good?!

1819
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:41,363
[chuckles]
Man!

1820
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,097
Hello.

1821
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:42,764
Oh, hi.

1822
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,299
I'm good. How are you?

1823
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,033
You enjoying your day
today?

1824
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,935
Yeah, it's been fabulous.

1825
01:06:46,937 --> 01:06:47,936
Everyday is fabulous,
right?

1826
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:48,803
It is.

1827
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,205
Must be really nice
being sunshine.

1828
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:50,839
Yeah.
-Right?

1829
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:53,508
Ah! I should have
my dark shades on.

1830
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,976
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

1831
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,213
You know? A lot of guys
would see a lady like you...

1832
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,581
and go for a home run.

1833
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,348
Oh...

1834
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,816
You know what I
prefer to do?

1835
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,651
- I like hits.
- Yeah?

1836
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:04,886
Right?
Like getting on base.

1837
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:07,055
First base. Second base.
Third base.

1838
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,523
Mmm-hmm.

1839
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,791
Load the bases up.

1840
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,559
And then what happens?

1841
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,261
[bat hitting ball]
- Oh!

1842
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,130
I bring everybody home.
[cheers and applause]

1843
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:16,164
You like that idea?

1844
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,700
- I love it.
- Heart that?

1845
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,235
They're cheering for me
right now!

1846
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,904
What did I miss?

1847
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:25,073
Oh! The coach broke
his leg!

1848
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:27,042
- What?
- He showed up in a cast.

1849
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,144
A full body cast
up to his hip!

1850
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,412
'Cause he was swimming!

1851
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:31,846
He went swimming.

1852
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:35,016
- The coach broke
his leg swimming?
- Yes!

1853
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,017
You're kidding, right?

1854
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:37,552
No.
No, we don't have a coach.

1855
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,454
After all that?!

1856
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:41,656
Oh my god!
That's hysterical!

1857
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,058
No, it's not hysterical.

1858
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,659
It's the furthest thing
from hysterical!

1859
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:45,660
We don't have a coach!

1860
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:49,330
- Okay.
I won't, uh, enjoy it.
- Ah!

1861
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:52,100
Eyes forward! Have you
guys seen Coach Ted?

1862
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:52,934
[altogether]:
No!

1863
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:53,935
No, we haven't seen him
anywhere.

1864
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:55,236
We'd love to know
where he is.

1865
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,938
Ambrose,
can you cover first?

1866
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,873
- It's gonna cost you,
coach.
- How much?

1867
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,241
Only $100.

1868
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,376
- 100 bucks?!
- Yep.

1869
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,577
No!
[scoffs]

1870
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,446
- No!
- I'll do it.

[exhales]
Woman cannot coach!

1872
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,949
Who else? [stammering]
Who can cover first?

1873
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:08,917
- Come on!
- I can, coach.

1874
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,051
No, not gonna happen.
