1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,140
It is a beautiful day in Chicago.
Temperatures in the upper 70's.

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,415
Right now, 75 at the lakefront,
74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,658
Tom!

4
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,418
- What's the matter?
- It's Ferris Look at him

5
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,460
Ferris?

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,369
He doesn't have a fever, but his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots

7
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,368
- What's the matter, Ferris?
- Papa?

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,414
Feel his hands,
they're cold and clammy

9
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,259
- I'm fine I'll get up
- No!

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,577
- I have a test today
- No

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,934
I must take it I want to go to a good
college, so I can have a fruitful life

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,371
Honey, you're not
going to school like this

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,973
- What's his problem?
- He doesn't feel well

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,977
Dry that one out,
you can fertilise the lawn

15
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,219
Jeanie, is that you?

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,890
I can't see that far Jeanie?

17
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,729
Jeanie, I

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,936
- Bite the big one, junior
- Jeanie, you get to school

19
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,055
If I was bleeding out my eyes, you'd
make me go to school It's so unfair

20
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,496
Jeanie, don't be upset with me
You have your health, be thankful

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,012
That's it! I want out of this family

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:11,377
I'm okay I'll just sleep
I'll have an aspirin around noon

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,812
I'm showing some houses
to that family from Vermont today

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,377
My office will know just where I am
if you need me

25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,371
- I'll check on you too, pal
- I have such loving, caring parents

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,176
You're both very special people

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,778
- You get better, pumpkin
- Okay, pumpkin

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,893
I'll be home at six sharp
If you need anything, call

29
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,375
Ringy-dingy

30
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,929
- We love you, sweetie
- I love you, too

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,413
Call if you need us

32
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,379
They bought it

33
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,696
Incredible! A terrible performance,
and they never doubted it for a second

34
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,094
How could I be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

35
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,490
This is my ninth sick day It's tough
coming up with new illnesses

36
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,332
If I go for ten, I'll have to barf up a lung
So I'd better make this one count

37
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,057
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,538
It's a good non-specific symptom
I'm a big believer in it

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,255
A lot of people will tell you
to go for a phoney fever

40
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,808
But if you get a nervous mother, you
could wind up in a doctor's office

41
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,534
You fake a stomach cramp

42
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,291
When you're bent over wailing,
you lick your palms

43
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,697
It's childish and stupid,
but then, so is high school

44
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,094
Life moves pretty fast

45
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,852
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

46
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,657
I do have a test today,
that wasn't bullshit

47
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,092
It's on European socialism
What's the point?

48
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,579
I'm not European, so who
gives a crap if they're socialists?

49
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,489
They could be fascist anarchists,
it still wouldn't buy me a car

50
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,297
I recall Central Park in fall

51
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,732
how you tore your dress
what a mess, I confess...

52
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,013
It's not that I condone fascism,
or any "ism"

53
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,977
A person should not believe in an
"ism", he should believe in himself

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,776
I quote John Lennon: "I don't believe
in Beatles I just believe in me"

55
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,575
A good point there
After all, he was the walrus

56
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,614
I could be the walrus,
I'd still have to bum rides off people

57
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,380
Adams
Adamly

58
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,290
- Here
- Adamowlsky, Adamson

59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,776
- Adler
- Here

60
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,258
- Anderson Anderson?
- Here

61
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,496
Bueller

62
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,090
Bueller

63
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,815
Bueller Bueller

64
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,812
He's sick My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend -

65
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,172
- saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavours
last night I guess it's pretty serious

66
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,168
- Thank you, Simone
- No problem whatsoever

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,769
Frye

68
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,656
Frye Frye

69
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,893
- Hello?
- Cameron, what's happening?

70
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,249
- Very little
- How do you feel?

71
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,497
- Shredded
- Is your mother in the room?

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,409
She's in Decatur
Unfortunately she's not staying

73
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,732
- Where are you?
- I'm taking the day off, come on over

74
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,296
- I can't, stupid, I'm sick.
- That's all in your head

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,051
- Come on over.
- I feel like shit I can't go anywhere

76
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,971
I'm sorry to hear that
Now come on over and pick me up

77
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,730
I'm dying

78
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,090
You're not dying. Youjust
can't think of anything good to do.

79
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,012
Cameron really needs a day off

80
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,136
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he goes to college

81
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,212
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

82
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,493
let my Cameron go.

83
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,578
Cameron is so tight -

84
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,852
- that a lump of coal stuck up his ass
would turn into a diamond

85
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,736
- Katie Bueller
- Edward Rooney, Dean of Students.

86
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,970
I'm so sorry
I completely forgot to call

87
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,971
- You know your son isn't in school?
- Yes. Ferris is home sick.

88
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,573
I had a meeting this morning.
I forgot to call. I'm very sorry.

89
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,658
Are you also aware -

90
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,775
- that Ferris does not have
an exemplary attendance record.

91
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,379
What?

92
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,050
He has missed an unacceptable
number of school days.

93
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,889
Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.

94
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,571
I've spent my morning
examining his records

95
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,333
If Ferris thinks he can coast through
to graduation, he is sorely mistaken

96
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,498
I have no reservation whatsoever-

97
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,693
- about holding him back
another year

98
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,132
- This is all news to me
- It usually is

99
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,654
- He has been absent nine times
- Nine times?

100
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,933
- Nine times
- He hasn't been sick nine times

101
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,214
That's probably because he
wasn't sick, he was skipping school

102
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,059
Wake up and smell the coffee

103
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,889
It's a fool's paradise He's leading
you down the primrose path

104
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,934
- I can't believe it.
- It's right here in front of me

105
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,370
He has missed nine days

106
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,852
I asked for a car I got a computer
How's that for being born unlucky?

107
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,213
Grace!

108
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,252
Mr Rooney, Ferris is home
and he is very ill

109
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,533
- I debated even leaving him.
- Grace!

110
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,369
At this time of year, children
are prone to taking the day off

111
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,778
But I can assure you
that Ferris is a very sick boy

112
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,813
Never had one lesson

113
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,775
In 1930 the House of Representatives,
in an effort to alleviate the effects of

114
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,538
Anyone?

115
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,292
The Great Depression
Passed the anyone?

116
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,698
The Holly-Smoot Tariff Act

117
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,812
Which raised or lowered?

118
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,458
Raised tariffs in an effort to collect
more government revenue

119
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,858
Did it work?
Anyone know the effects?

120
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,292
It did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Depression

121
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,255
Today, we have a similar debate
over this Anyone know what this is?

122
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,339
Anyone seen this before?

123
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,259
The Laffer curve
Anyone know what this says?

124
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,612
It says that at this point
on the revenue curve -

125
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,689
- you will get exactly the same
amount of revenue as at this point

126
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,894
Does anyone know
what Bush called this in 1980?

127
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,335
Anyone? Something-doo economics
Voodoo economics

128
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,376
Jeanie, I'm really sorry
about your brother

129
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,140
What are you sorry for?
I have to live with him

130
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,731
- I heard he's really sick
- Who said he's sick?

131
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,932
A bunch of people
say he's close to death

132
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,931
I heard that if Ferris dies, he's
giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder

133
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,735
He's such a sweetie Got to go

134
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,818
- Hi, Jeanie
- Shut up

135
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,012
How desperate is the situation?

136
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,893
Did you see "Alien"?

137
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,649
When the creature
was in that guy's stomach?

138
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,897
It feels like that
Freshman

139
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,810
- Are you kidding?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

140
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,695
- It's Ferris Bueller
- He got me out of summer school

141
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,690
We appreciate you letting us
know how you're doing.

142
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,495
I hope he doesn't die
I can't handle summer school

143
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,410
- Give me somebody else
- Sure, hold on

144
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,499
- Did you see "Alien"?
- Yeah, why?

145
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,737
Hello? Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

146
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,172
You're dying?

147
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,453
- Is it serious?
- I hope not

148
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,370
- I may need a kidney transplant
- Shit! Are you upset?

149
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,408
- Excuse me
- Will you be alive this weekend?

150
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,579
- Yeah, I'd say so
- Great Maybe I'll see you

151
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,420
I don't trust this kid
any further than I can throw him

152
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,219
With your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody It's true

153
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,858
What is so dangerous about him
is that he gives good kids bad ideas

154
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,818
The last thing I need is 1,500 Bueller
disciples running around these halls

155
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,490
He jeopardises my ability
to govern this student body

156
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,969
- He makes you look like an ass
- Thank you, but you're wrong

157
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,853
He's very popular

158
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,372
Sportoes, motorheads, geeks,
sluts, bloods, wasteoids, -

159
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,290
- dweebies, dickheads,
they all adore him

160
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,258
That is why I have got to catch him

161
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,170
To show these kids that his example
is a first-class ticket to nowhere

162
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,771
Ed! You sounded
like Dirty Harry just then

163
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,734
Really?

164
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,013
Thanks, Grace

165
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,613
- You can't make me wait like this
- Let me rot in peace.

166
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,293
It's my ninth sick day If I get caught,
I won't graduate I'm doing this for you

167
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,539
- Do you know what my diastolic is?
- Take some Pepto Bismal

168
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,176
- Get dressed and come on over
- Shut up

169
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,774
Hold your water for a second
I've got another call Hello?

170
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,977
- Ferris. You sound terrible.
- Darn, I thought I was improving.

171
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,536
- Were you sleeping?
- Dad, can you hang on for a second?

172
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,573
- Sure, pal
- Hang on

173
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,375
- Cameron, it's my dad
- Great Keep me out of it

174
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:28,371
If you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend

175
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,258
Dad, all this talking has made me
kind of light-headed

176
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,818
- I think I ought to lie down
- Wrap a hot towel round your head

177
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:48,529
- Wrap a hot towel round my head?
- Make some soup, then get a nap

178
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,972
- Ferris, I love you, pal
- I love you, too

179
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,497
I bet Cameron is sitting in his car
debating whether or not to go out

180
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,412
He'll keep calling me until I come over

181
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,532
He'll make me feel guilty

182
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,176
This is ridiculous I'll go I'll go

183
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,690
I'll go Shit!

184
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,097
Goddammit!

185
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,253
Forget it That's it

186
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,530
In what way

187
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,251
does the author's
use of the prison

188
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,937
symbolise

189
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,330
the protagonist's struggle?

190
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,816
And how does this relate -

191
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,299
- to our discussion
of the uses of irony?

192
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,415
Mr Nolan, may I interrupt, please?

193
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,135
Sloane Peterson,
may I have a word with you, dear?

194
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,460
I'm afraid that I am the bearer
of bad tidings

195
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,495
Your father called
Your grandmother has just passed

196
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,297
- No
- Oh, darling! Honey

197
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,016
- Dead grandmother?
- That's what Mr Peterson said

198
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,054
I had Florence Sparrow
notify the poor little lamb

199
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,209
- Who is this girl going out with?
- It's so hard to tell these days

200
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,016
I do see her with Ferris Bueller
quite a bit

201
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,372
Would you get me
Mr Peterson's daytime number?

202
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,772
- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is George Peterson.

203
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,531
Please hold
What do you know, it's Mr Peterson

204
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,937
Do you still want
his daytime number?

205
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,694
- Ed Rooney
- Ed, this is George Peterson.

206
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,610
- How are you today, sir?
- Well, we've had a bit of bad luck.

207
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,814
Yeah, I heard I'm all broken up
Boy, what a blow

208
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,729
Yeah, it's been a tough morning.

209
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,500
We've got a lot of family business.

210
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,329
If you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.

211
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,179
Sure, I'd be happy to

212
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,692
You just produce a corpse,
and I'll release Sloane

213
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,495
I want to see this dead grandmother
first-hand

214
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,728
It's all right, it's Ferris Bueller
I'm setting a trap for him

215
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,012
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?

216
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,613
Yeah, roll her old bones over here
and I'll dig up your daughter

217
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,290
That's school policy
Was this your mother?

218
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,095
No, my wife's mother.

219
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,091
- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is Ferris Bueller for Mr Rooney

220
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,695
Hold

221
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,939
I'll tell you what, dipshit,
if you don't like my policies, -

222
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,611
- you can come down here
and smooch my big old white butt

223
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,496
- Pucker up, Buttercup What?
- Ferris Bueller is on line two

224
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,134
Mr Rooney,
I'm not feeling very well today.

225
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,289
Could my sister bring home
any assignments from my classes?

226
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,139
Have a nice day.

227
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,729
Mr Peterson
I think I owe you an apology

228
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,252
- I should say you do
- I

229
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,418
I think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake

230
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,659
A family member dies and you
insult me! What's wrong with you?

231
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,739
Well I really don't know

232
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,137
I didn't think I was talking to you.

233
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,690
You know that I would never
deliberately insult you like that

234
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,735
Pardon my French,
but you're an asshole! Asshole!

235
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,695
You're absolutely right, sir
Find out where she is

236
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,212
- This isn't over yet Do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Mr Peterson

237
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,538
- Call me sir, goddammit!
- Yes, sir

238
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,856
That's better.

239
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,178
You mind your P's and Q's,
and remember who you're dealing with

240
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,770
Bueller Ferris Bueller

241
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,132
I'm scared
What if he recognises my voice?

242
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,571
Impossible You're doing great

243
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,010
Rooney!
Rooney, calm down

244
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:23,774
- Just a moment
- Just a little office difficulty

245
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,338
I don't have all day to bark at you,
so I'm going to make this short

246
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:35,570
I want my daughter out
in front of the school by herself

247
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,533
- What?
- That's too suspicious

248
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,015
- Talk
- You!

249
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,609
- Talk!
- Rooney! Pay attention

250
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,655
I want you out there with her
I want a few words with you

251
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,575
We don't have time to talk right now
We'll get together over lunch

252
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,137
- What's wrong with you?
- Wait!

253
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,936
- Where's your brain?
- Why did you kick me?

254
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,579
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

255
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,296
I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked

256
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,497
I didn't hit you
I lightly slapped you

257
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,294
You hit me

258
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,569
Don't ask me to participate in your crap
if you don't like the way I do it

259
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,533
You make me get out of bed
and come here

260
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,131
You make me make a phoney call
to Edward Rooney

261
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,730
The man could squash my nuts

262
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,579
- And you deliberately hurt my feelings
- No

263
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,855
I did not deliberately
hurt your feelings I didn't

264
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,132
- What are you doing?
- See you later I'm going home

265
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,615
- Have a nice life
- Cameron, wait a minute

266
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,658
I didn't mean to lose my temper
I'm sorry, it was uncalled for

267
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,818
- Seriously?
- Yeah

268
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,894
- Here you go
- Thank you

269
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,978
You did screw up though, right?

270
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,813
- Not that it was completely your fault
- Why?

271
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,095
To fix the situation, I'm going
to have to ask you for a favour

272
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,170
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California

273
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,300
Less than a hundred were made

274
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,459
My father spent
three years restoring this car

275
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,050
It is his love It is his passion

276
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,139
It is his fault
he didn't lock the garage

277
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,413
Ferris, what are you talking about?

278
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,849
My father loves this car more than life

279
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,851
A man with such priorities
doesn't deserve this fine automobile

280
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,411
No

281
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,375
Apparently you don't understand

282
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,415
He never drives it
He just rubs it with a diaper

283
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,250
Remember how insane he went
when I broke my retainer?

284
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,372
That was a piece of plastic
This is a Ferrari

285
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,533
We can't pick up Sloane in your car

286
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,618
Mr Rooney would never believe
Mr Peterson drives that piece of shit

287
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,938
- It's not a piece of shit
- It is

288
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,339
Don't worry I don't even have
a piece of shit I have to envy yours

289
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,694
I'm sorry
There's nothing else we can do

290
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,819
- He knows the mileage
- He doesn't trust you?

291
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,332
- Never has, never will
- This is real simple

292
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,089
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off

293
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,690
- We'll drive home backwards
- No

294
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,294
No, Ferris, forget it
I'm putting my foot down

295
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,255
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat

296
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,808
We could call a limo
A stretch job with a TV and a bar

297
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,538
Come on, live a little

298
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,179
Let me tell you how deeply saddened
I am by your loss

299
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,010
I had a grandmother once
Two, actually

300
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,615
"Man hath but a short time to live
and is full of misery"

301
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,256
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flower"

302
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,577
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow -

303
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,977
- and never continueth in one stay"

304
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,695
Oh, dear

305
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,331
Between grief and nothing,
I'll take grief

306
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,569
Great

307
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,456
Sloane, dear, hurry along now

308
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,529
I guess that's my dad
I've got to go

309
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,099
Mr Rooney Ed

310
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,497
- You're a beautiful man
- Thank you

311
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,889
I want to thank you
for your warmth and compassion

312
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,850
Shit!

313
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,850
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy?
- Are you kidding?

314
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,058
So that's how it is in their family

315
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,292
- Hi, Cameron, are you comfortable?
- Hi, Sloane No

316
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,777
- What are we going to do?
- What aren't we going to do?

317
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,529
Don't say
we're not going to take the car home

318
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,860
If you had access to a car like this,
would you take it back right away?

319
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,574
Neither would I

320
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,335
Ferris, don't go so fast

321
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,053
Save Ferris
God bless you You're very generous

322
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,093
Save Ferris Bueller

323
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,291
- Save Ferris?
- What?

324
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,858
We're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

325
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,938
- Go piss up a flagpole
- I'm sorry?

326
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,371
- You should be
- Hey!

327
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,493
What if you need a favour someday
from Ferris Bueller?

328
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,820
Peterson home on line one
Watch your mouth this time

329
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,376
Go suck your hat

330
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,530
We can't come to the phone now.
We've had a death in the family.

331
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,768
Ferris Bueller is behind this,
there is no doubt in my mind

332
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,859
- Now Sloane Peterson is involved
- Her grandmother, too

333
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,369
You pinhead

334
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,937
If you need to reach us,
we'll be at the following number.

335
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,774
I did not achieve my position by having
a punk leave my cheese in the wind

336
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,213
You have reached
the Carlton Brothers Mortuary.

337
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,572
If you leave your name and number,
we'll get back to you.

338
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,730
Something is going on,
and I'm going to find out what it is

339
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,853
I'm going to catch this kid
and put a dent in his future

340
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,975
15 years from now, when he looks back
on the ruin his life has become, -

341
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,252
- he will remember Edward Rooney

342
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,088
- Wrong
- What?

343
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,895
Not here
We're not leaving the car here

344
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,775
- Why not?
- I want the car home where it belongs

345
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,495
- Let's go
- What can happen in a garage?

346
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,218
It could get wrecked, stolen,
scratched, breathed on wrong

347
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,776
- A pigeon could shit on it
- Calm down

348
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,414
I'll give the guy a fiver to watch it

349
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,612
What guy?

350
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,817
Hey, how are you doing?
You speak English?

351
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,854
What country do you think this is?

352
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,850
Okay, I want you to take
extra special care of this vehicle

353
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,620
No problem Trust me

354
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,019
- Sir
- Come on

355
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,173
Relax

356
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,898
You have nothing to worry about
I'm a professional

357
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,331
A professional what?

358
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,536
See what a finski
can do to a guy's attitude?

359
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,255
Come on

360
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,730
Bless his little heart

361
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,129
Nine times.

362
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,213
- You think the car's all right?
- Sure

363
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,299
- This is the world's tallest building
- I don't feel too good

364
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,928
Here, climb up on this

365
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,656
Come on, everybody Cameron

366
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,093
Okay, lean forward
against the glass like this

367
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,852
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't that great?

368
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,575
The city looks so peaceful
from up here

369
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,455
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet

370
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,338
- I think I see my dad
- We've got a lot to do Let's go

371
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,773
Shit! The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere

372
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,297
- You want to get married?
- Sure

373
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,775
Today? I'm serious

374
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,178
- I'm not getting married
- Why not?

375
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,931
- Think about it
- Besides being too young

376
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,734
Having no place to live

377
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,455
You being the only cheerleader
with a husband

378
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,290
- Give me one good reason why not?
- Look at my mother and father

379
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,094
- They hate each other
- So what?

380
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,216
It's like that car
He loves the car, he hates his wife

381
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,933
Thank you

382
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:13,049
Can we please get out of here?
This place gives me the creeps

383
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,373
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,095
- Hello, may I help you?
- You can sure as hell try

385
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,772
I'm Abe Froman, party of three for 12

386
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,739
- Is there a problem?
- You're Abe Froman?

387
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:39,334
- The sausage king of Chicago?
- Yeah, that's me

388
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,775
I'm very busy Why don't you kids
go back to the clubhouse?

389
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,655
Are you suggesting
I'm not who I say I am?

390
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,934
I'm suggesting that you leave
before I have to get snooty

391
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,894
- Okay, Abe, let's go
- I'm not going anywhere

392
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,938
- No, we'd like to be seated
- I'm going to have to call the police

393
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,530
- You're going to call the police?
- Yes

394
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,938
- Fine! I'll call them myself
- Yes

395
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,418
Call the police This'll be a hoot

396
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,257
Give me the phone
I have another call

397
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,499
You touch me, I yell rat
Find another phone

398
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,136
Wonderful

399
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,299
I weep for the future

400
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,655
- Ferris, let it go
- Please, you've gone too far

401
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,852
You're going to get busted

402
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,293
You can never go too far,
and I won't be busted by a guy like that

403
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,539
- Come on, Abe!
- Ask for Abe Froman

404
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,972
- Chez Quis?
- May I speak to Abe Froman?

405
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,891
- The sausage king of Chicago
- Let me check the restaurant

406
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,695
- Could you describe him for me?
- Leatherjacket

407
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,097
White T-shirt, sweater vest.

408
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,372
Devastatingly handsome

409
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,368
- Hold on one moment.
- Thank you

410
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,815
Froman, this is Sergeant Peterson,
Chicago Police.

411
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,255
- I appreciate your understanding
- Don't think twice

412
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,695
Understanding allows people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself

413
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,138
- Thank you
- Don't mention it

414
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,170
Enjoy your luncheon

415
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,371
Darling, you were wonderful

416
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,777
Cameron, you thought we wouldn't
have any fun Shame on you

417
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,368
Maybe I'm overreacting.
Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

418
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,732
After all, I got a car.
He got a computer.

419
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,776
Still, why should he get
to do whatever he wants?

420
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,733
Why should everything
work out for him?

421
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,216
What makes him
so goddam special?

422
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,138
Screw him

423
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,252
I used to think that my family was
the only one with weirdness in it

424
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:02,652
Then I saw Cameron's family
His home life is really twisted

425
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,569
That's why he's sick all the time
It really bothers him

426
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,216
He feels better when he's sick

427
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,175
If I had to live in that house,
I'd pray for a disease, too

428
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,295
The place is like a museum
It's very beautiful and very cold

429
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,298
You're not allowed to touch anything

430
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,813
Can you appreciate what it must
have been like to be there as a baby?

431
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:36,608
I'm amazed that I got the car out
I caught Cameron digging the ride

432
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,130
It's good for him
It teaches him to deal with his fear

433
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,173
Plus, I must be honest here

434
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,816
I love driving it It is so choice

435
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,969
If you have the means,
I highly recommend picking one up

436
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,217
- Thank you
- Yes, sir

437
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,088
Jeanie, who's bothering you now?

438
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,292
- Is Mr Rooney in?
- No, can I help you?

439
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,573
- I doubt it When is he back?
- I don't know

440
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,659
- He's out on personal business
- What's that supposed to mean?

441
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,899
I suppose it means
it's none of your business, young lady

442
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,854
Nice attitude

443
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,009
- Is Mrs Hagel expecting you in class?
- Probably

444
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,296
What an asshole

445
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,210
- Raise your advertising budget
- We don't have the money

446
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,096
If you want to sell, you have
to spend It's as simple as that

447
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,213
4,000 restaurants in the area
I pick the one my father goes to

448
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,695
We're pinched for sure

449
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,098
Only the meek get pinched
The bold survive Let's go

450
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,690
- Let's surrender
- Never

451
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,739
Dave, I'm telling you
that it's not the case

452
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,173
- We don't have the money
- Dave, you know what it takes

453
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:26,296
We're going to go heavy on TV
We'll lighten up on radio and print

454
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,378
Come on back to my office

455
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,936
We know you've got the money
We just have to spend it bonehead!

456
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,610
Bueller.

457
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,974
Lesjeux sont faits.
Translation: The game is up

458
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,456
Your ass is mine

459
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,249
Runner at first base, nobody out.

460
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:23,659
The first hit since the fifth inning,
only the fourth hit in the game.

461
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,570
0 and 2 the count. There's a drive.
Left field.

462
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,615
Twisting into foul territory.

463
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,577
I'm really surprised
they didn't go for it in that inning.

464
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,294
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing

465
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,015
- Who's winning?
- The Bears

466
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,296
- I think I broke my thumb
- Hey, batter, batter Swing, batter

467
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:23,216
Do you realise that if we played by
the rules, right now we'd be in gym?

468
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,614
Come on, boys, let's go

469
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,654
We'll never get out of here Move!

470
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,374
I hate him

471
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,695
Who is it?

472
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,050
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris
I'd like to have a word with you

473
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,334
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

474
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,409
- I could take a spill down the stairs
and suffer further school absences.

475
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,011
- Save it, Ferris Come down here
- You can reach my parents at work.

476
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,736
Thank you for stopping by.
I appreciate your concern.

477
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:02,298
- Come down here and talk to me
- Have a nice day.

478
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,617
You're in big trouble

479
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,975
Ferris

480
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,172
Ferris

481
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,419
- Who is it?
- You know damn well who it is

482
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,614
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

483
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,292
- I could take a spill down the stairs
and suffer further school absences.

484
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,015
You can reach my parents at work.

485
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:47,819
Thank you for stopping by.
I appreciate your concern.

486
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,057
Have a nice day.

487
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,891
Mud

488
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,692
Son of a bitch!

489
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,059
My shoe

490
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,772
Hi, doggy

491
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,694
Stay, boy

492
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,937
Stay
Stay!

493
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,614
Sit!

494
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,095
Sit! Heel! Stay!

495
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,128
- We'd better go and get the car
- We have until six

496
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:13,654
I know you don't care,
but it does mean my ass

497
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,852
That hurts, Cameron

498
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,736
- What have you seen today?
- Nothing good

499
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:28,095
Nothing!
What do you mean, nothing good?

500
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,531
We've seen everything good,
we've seen the whole city

501
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,256
We went to a museum
and saw priceless works of art

502
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:42,456
What? What's wrong?

503
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,571
Look over there

504
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,416
- What's he doing?
- He's making obscene gestures

505
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,896
What?

506
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,417
- He didn't leave
- It really busts my hump

507
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:12,410
- He didn't ditch us
- He might be back at school

508
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:19,890
- He would not go back to school
- He'd do it just to make me sweat

509
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:27,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to play a little tune for you.

510
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,494
I dedicate it to a man who doesn't think
he's seen anything good today.

511
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,533
Cameron Frye, this one is for you.

512
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,173
- Get off the float!
- What are you doing?

513
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:29,209
As long as I've known him,
everything works for him

514
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,811
There's nothing he can't handle
I can't handle anything

515
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,219
School, parents, the future
Ferris can do anything

516
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:47,848
- I don't know what I'm going to do
- College

517
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,655
Yeah, but to do what?

518
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,848
What are you interested in?

519
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,496
Nothing

520
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,851
Me neither

521
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,497
You're crazy!

522
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,014
What do you think
Ferris is going to do?

523
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,371
He's going to be a fry cook

524
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,892
Christ

525
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,289
Look what Uncle Ed has for you,
you little fucker

526
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,938
Jesus!

527
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,219
Sleep tight, pooch

528
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,050
I knew it!

529
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,495
Well, where is she?
This is her daughter

530
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,692
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?

531
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,858
Do you know anything?

532
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,895
- Ferris
- Bueller

533
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,530
You're psychotic
You're out of your mind

534
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:51,336
I can't believe you went
on a goddam parade float!

535
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,259
Okay, wait

536
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:59,898
"Yeah, this tune
is one of my personal favourites"

537
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,934
- A lot of people saw you
- You are nailed

538
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,098
Who'd believe I was in a parade?

539
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,374
Anybody who would nail me
wouldn't go to a parade

540
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,970
That was so quick

541
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:23,291
- This looks okay to me, Cameron
- It looks great Let's roll

542
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,889
Here you go Thank you

543
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,936
You're a very generous individual
Come back anytime

544
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,338
- Watch the seat
- Sorry

545
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,730
See you later

546
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:49,298
We've got to do this again

547
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:56,258
This is not a phoney call
There is an intruder, -

548
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,659
- male Caucasian,
possibly armed, in my kitchen

549
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:06,058
My name's Bueller

550
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,293
You hope my brother's feeling better?
I'm in danger!

551
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,450
I am very protective of my body
I do not want it violated or killed

552
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,174
I need help!

553
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,089
Speak any English? Dickhead

554
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:41,576
Excuse me, if you're still in the
house, I'vejust called the police.

555
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:47,013
If you have any brains whatsoever,
you'll get out real quick.

556
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,056
I also have my father's gun
and a scorching case of herpes.

557
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,457
Wait, that's my car!
I'll move it

558
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,733
He got my keys

559
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,932
You shithead!

560
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,130
I feel pretty good I feel real good

561
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:29,731
Those guys at the garage were nice
I was a little worried about them

562
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,649
It turned out good

563
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,490
Hey

564
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,734
- Cameron
- Yeah?

565
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,694
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

566
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:53,416
126 and halfway
between three and four tenths

567
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:58,853
Why? How many miles are on it now?

568
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,775
Here's where Cameron goes berserk

569
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,532
Cameron, are you okay?

570
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,016
Cut that out

571
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,969
Who is it?

572
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:40,049
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

573
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,933
- I could take a spill
down the stairs...

574
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,851
God bless the police
I'm saved Thank you, God

575
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,929
- Thank...
- I heard that you were feeling ill

576
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,098
headache, fever and a chill

577
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,178
I came to help restore your pluck

578
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,099
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

579
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,210
This may very well be for real

580
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,969
He might have blown
a microchip or two

581
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,856
He's always been a little keyed up
I just wanted to give him a good day

582
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,291
We're going to graduate soon

583
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:30,528
We'll have the summer
He'll work and I'll work

584
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,050
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends

585
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,889
Then he'll go to one school
and I'll go to another

586
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,649
Basically that will be it

587
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:46,331
Sloane's as big a problem

588
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:51,136
She has another year of high school
How do I deal with that?

589
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:55,174
I was serious
when I said I'd marry her I would

590
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,655
Cameron?

591
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:01,933
Can you hear me?

592
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:06,691
Cameron, blink if you understand me

593
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,974
Cameron has never been in love
Well, nobody has been in love with him

594
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:18,016
If things don't change for him, he's
going to marry the first girl he lays

595
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,577
And she's going to treat him like shit,
because she will have given him -

596
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:28,013
- what he has built up in his mind as
the end all, be all of our existence

597
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,529
She won't respect him

598
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:35,734
You can't respect somebody who
kisses your ass It just doesn't work

599
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:41,890
Ferris, we'd better try something else
This isn't working

600
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:49,299
Are you feeling better, Cameron?

601
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,574
Why don't you come in here?
It's really nice

602
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:03,609
Cameron, I can flip out real easy, too
It's okay

603
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:08,336
Sooner or later,
everybody goes to the zoo

604
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:17,494
Maybe he's really sick
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself

605
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,659
Hey! Hey, Cameron!

606
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:08,615
Cameron, wake up

607
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:13,496
Come on, Cameron Wake up!

608
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:22,414
- What is that?
- Ferris Bueller, you're my hero

609
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:28,217
- That was pretty impressive, man
- You son of a bitch

610
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,528
It's not funny

611
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,010
Drugs?

612
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:08,178
Thank you, no I'm straight

613
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,658
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

614
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:16,216
- Why are you here?
- Drugs

615
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,698
- I don't know why I'm here
- Why don't you go home?

616
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,779
Why don't you
put your thumb up your butt?

617
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,014
You wear too much eye make-up

618
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,091
My sister wears too much
People think she's a whore

619
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,339
- You don't want to talk about it?
- With you? Are you serious?

620
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,816
- I'm serious
- Blow yourself

621
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:00,656
All right,
you want to know what's wrong?

622
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:05,092
I know what's wrong
I just want to hear you say it

623
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,372
In a nutshell, I hate my brother
How's that?

624
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:12,937
That's cool Did you
blow him away or something?

625
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:17,372
No, not yet

626
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:23,928
He was ditching school When I went
home to check, some guy was there

627
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,938
The cops picked me up
for making a phoney call

628
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,450
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

629
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:34,573
- Everybody else has to go
- You could ditch

630
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:40,218
- I'd get caught
- Yes

631
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:45,096
You're pissed off because he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

632
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,180
- Basically
- Basically

633
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:54,249
- Your problem is you
- Excuse me?

634
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:59,534
Worry about yourself,
not about what your brother does

635
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:05,457
- That's just an opinion
- What are you, a psychiatrist?

636
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:09,016
Keep your opinions to yourself

637
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:16,411
There's somebody you should talk to

638
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,528
If you say Ferris Bueller,
you lose a testicle

639
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,856
Oh, you know him

640
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:37,448
That whole time
I was just thinking things over

641
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,936
I was like meditating

642
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,893
Then I sort of watched myself
from inside

643
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,616
I realised it was ridiculous
being afraid

644
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,654
Worrying about everything
Wishing I was dead

645
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:01,773
All that shit I'm tired of it

646
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,969
It was the best day of my life

647
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,410
I'm going to miss you guys next year

648
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:26,220
Cameron, can I ask you a question?

649
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,571
Yeah

650
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:34,331
Did you see me change
out of my clothes by the jacuzzi?

651
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,094
Did you?

652
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:44,739
You saw me?
I thought you were catatonic

653
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:51,410
That's okay I'm not embarrassed

654
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,977
I better check on the car

655
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,178
Hey, Ferris!

656
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,372
Yeah?

657
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:21,371
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse

658
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:30,136
No
I thought that might be a problem

659
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:35,812
We have to open the odometer,
roll it back by hand

660
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:39,137
No, forget it

661
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,491
Forget it

662
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,729
I've got to take a stand

663
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:56,009
I'm bullshit

664
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,414
I put up with everything

665
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:08,092
My old man pushes me around

666
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,532
I never say anything

667
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:19,933
He's not the problem
I'm the problem

668
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,376
I've got to take a stand

669
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:32,209
I've got to take a stand against him

670
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:38,016
I am not going to sit on my ass -

671
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,530
- as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life

672
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:46,495
I'm going to take a stand and defend it

673
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:52,058
Right or wrong,
I'm going to defend it

674
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,492
I'm so sick of this shit

675
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,009
I can't stand him
and I hate this goddam car

676
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,293
Who do you love? You love a car

677
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,049
You son of a bitch

678
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,291
Shit

679
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:42,416
I dented the shit out of it

680
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:49,289
Good

681
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:55,132
My father will see what I did
I can't hide this

682
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,536
He'll come home
and he'll have to deal with me

683
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:04,618
I don't care I really don't

684
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:08,529
I'm just tired of being afraid

685
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,012
The hell with him

686
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:22,135
I can't wait to see the look
on his face

687
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,970
What did I do?

688
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:07,858
- What did I do?
- You killed the car

689
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,779
Whoa!

690
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:50,098
Holy shit!

691
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,539
It's my fault
I'll take the heat for it

692
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:12,531
When he comes home, we'll tell him
that I did it He hates me anyway

693
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,697
No, I'll take it

694
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:23,813
- I'll take it
- No, you don't want this much heat

695
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,739
If I didn't want it,
I wouldn't have let you take the car

696
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:33,732
- I made you take that car
- I could have stopped you

697
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:38,092
I want it
I'm going to take it, that's it

698
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:45,217
When Morris comes home,
he and I will just have a little chat

699
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,971
It's cool
No, it's going to be good

700
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,331
Thanks anyway

701
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:04,612
This is a shock to me
I don't know why she left school

702
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:08,972
And why would she come up
with a story about an intruder?

703
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:13,696
For whatever reason she did it,
she's had a scare

704
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:20,214
I appreciate you calling We'll have
a long talk with her at home

705
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,729
Thank you

706
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,250
- I hope your son is feeling better
- Pardon?

707
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,772
Tell him all the guys at the station
are pulling for him

708
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,335
Right

709
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,612
- Hi
- Don't "hi" me, young lady

710
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,731
I want to get out of here now
Now

711
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,172
Okay Fine!

712
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:02,816
- She's a little hyper
- Yeah

713
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:07,650
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, okay?

714
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:13,378
- You didn't tell me your name
- It's Jean

715
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,856
But a lot of guys call me Shauna

716
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:20,848
- Okay, Jean
- Cool

717
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,574
That's great

718
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:27,489
I'll see you, okay?

719
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,734
Jeanie, now!

720
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:37,138
- Now!
- Okay

721
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,291
- I had a great time today
- Yeah, it was pretty cool

722
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,493
Will Cameron be okay?

723
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,852
Yeah, sure,
for the first time in his life

724
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,335
He's going to be just fine

725
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:11,173
You knew what you were doing
when you woke up this morning

726
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:14,929
Me? No

727
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,979
Oh, shit!

728
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,978
I have to go

729
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:41,058
- I'll call you tonight
- Okay

730
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:47,499
- I love you
- I love you, too

731
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,454
He's going to marry me

732
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:59,176
Do you know what it's like to pick up
your daughter at the police station?

733
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:05,296
I was about to close the deal
with the Vermont people

734
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:13,300
I was going to take my commission
and buy Ferris a car

735
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:17,891
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to kill us?

736
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:22,332
Look at this mess I'll never
get these papers back in order

737
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,132
- Slow down
- I can't drive with you yelling at me!

738
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,490
Hi, I'm Ferris Bueller

739
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:43,258
No, don't get up
That smells delicious

740
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:46,418
- Dinner's ready
- What? Who was that?

741
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,135
What's wrong?

742
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:26,336
Everything I just picked up Jeanie
at the police station

743
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:31,295
She got a speeding ticket and I lost
the Vermont deal because of her

744
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,850
Looking for this?

745
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:53,732
I got you, Ferris

746
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,728
How's Ferris?
Let's go in and check on him

747
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:03,896
I have dreamed about this
And this time

748
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:09,652
you little bastard,
I've got you right where I want you

749
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:12,772
Ferris, we're home

750
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:20,819
How would you feel
about another year at high school?

751
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:25,616
Under my close,
personal supervision?

752
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:29,733
Hi

753
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:34,650
Thank God you're all right
We've been worried sick about you

754
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:42,458
Thank you, Mr Rooney,
for driving him home

755
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,699
Go upstairs and get in bed

756
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,695
Scoot!

757
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:04,099
Can you imagine someone that sick
trying to walk home from hospital?

758
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,530
Kids!

759
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:13,813
By the way, you left your wallet
on the kitchen floor

760
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,654
Honey

761
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:22,648
- He's still awfully warm
- How do you feel?

762
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,296
150% better, thank you

763
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:32,575
Don't make me stay home again
I want to go to school

764
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:37,456
I have to graduate in June,
and I

765
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:42,688
Ferris, you're sick Don't push it
and make yourself worse

766
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:47,132
- Maybe you're right, Dad
- I know I'm right, pal

767
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:53,688
- How did you get to be so sweet?
- From years of practice

768
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,458
Blanket

769
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,296
Get well

770
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:25,173
I'm going to get myself settled,
then I'll bring you a hot cup of soup

771
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:40,174
I've said it before and I'll say
it again: Life moves pretty fast

772
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:44,851
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

773
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,770
Four years I've been chasing this kid

774
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,974
Four years he's been
making a fool of me

775
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:16,259
Hey, Mr Rooney, what's going on?

776
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,651
Did you get in a fight?

777
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:24,091
Do you want a lift?

778
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,449
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before

779
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,533
Gummi bear?

780
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:28,018
They've been in my pocket
They're real warm and soft

781
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:16,579
You're still here?

782
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,817
It's over

783
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:22,853
Go home

784
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,336
Go
