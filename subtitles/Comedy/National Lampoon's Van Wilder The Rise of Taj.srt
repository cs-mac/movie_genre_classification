1
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,405
That was beautiful--

2
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,421
Take it, Russ.

3
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,634
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

4
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,471
Sure, Russ. We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

5
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,142
...by heading out into the country
in the old front-wheel drive sleigh...

6
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,811
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

7
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,106
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

8
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:55,318
We're not driving all the way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

9
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,656
-...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we?
-No, I have one of those at home.

10
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:04,369
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

11
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,007
-What's the matter?
-Some jackass is riding my tail.

12
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,345
Slow down and let him pass.

13
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,568
Clark! Don't provoke them.

14
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,070
Hey, kids, look a deer.

15
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,177
Clark, slow down!

16
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,888
You wanna ride behind somebody
who does that?

17
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,390
I'll pull around them
and leave them behind us.

18
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,228
Burn some dust here. Eat my rubber.

19
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,398
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber," and, "Eat my dust."

20
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,192
Whatever, Russ. Whatever.

21
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,408
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

22
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,413
Okay. That's enough of that.

23
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,088
Speaking of Christmas trees, kids,
can one of you tell me...

24
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,799
...what the first tree displayed
at the White House was?

25
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,134
Dad, they're back.

26
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:51,268
Clark, stop it!
I don't want to spend the holidays dead.

27
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,771
Honey, please! I'll do the driving, okay?

28
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,233
Will you just take it easy, Ellen?
I'm in complete control.

29
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,236
I'll get around this egg timer.

30
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,742
Dad. Dad.

31
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,674
-We're all right! Thank God, we're all right!
-Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

32
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,636
-Do you honestly think I don't know that?
-Come on, you guys, don't fight.

33
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,180
For chrissake,
I didn't do this on purpose!

34
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:37,188
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

35
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,275
And forgive my husband.
He knows not what he does.

36
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,110
Amen!

37
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,531
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

38
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,713
Made pretty good time.

39
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,557
Dad, didn't they invent Christmas tree lots
so people wouldn't have to drive...

40
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,769
...all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

41
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:20,190
They invented them because people forgot
how to have an old-fashioned Christmas...

42
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,734
...and are satisfied with scrawny,
overpriced trees...

43
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,612
-...that have no special meaning.
-My toes are numb.

44
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,699
-Kids, this is what our forefathers did.
-I can't feel my leg.

45
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,620
They walked out into the woods, picked out
the tree and cut it with their hands.

46
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,581
-Mom, I can't feel my hips.
-Clark.

47
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,668
-Yes, honey?
-Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

48
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,379
That's all part of the experience, honey.

49
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,674
There it is.

50
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,445
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

51
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,956
-Isn't it a little big?
-It's not big, it's just full.

52
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:23,128
-Dad, that thing wouldn't fit in our yard.
-It's not going in our yard, Russ.

53
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,755
It's going in our living room.

54
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,096
-Look at it.
-It really is beautiful, Clark.

55
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,765
-It's something else, huh, Russ?
-Yeah, Dad.

56
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,601
-Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?
-She'll see it later, honey.

57
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,187
Her eyes are frozen.

58
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,941
Most enduring traditions of the season
are best enjoyed in the warm embrace...

59
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,277
...of kith and kin.

60
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,614
This tree is the symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

61
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,618
Dad, did you bring a saw?

62
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,667
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room ceiling.

63
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,809
Hey, Griswold. Where do you think
you're gonna put a tree that big?

64
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,354
Bend over and I'll show you.

65
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,398
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

66
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,235
I wasn't talking to you.

67
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,253
Clark, do you think there's enough room
for the angel?

68
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,215
Oh, sure, honey. I have
a little more trimming to do...

69
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,759
...but that won't be a problem.
Ready?

70
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,555
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

71
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,940
There's a lot of sap in here.

72
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,111
It looks great. A little full. A lot of sap.

73
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,053
-Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?
-And?

74
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,765
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas too.

75
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:27,896
-It's not too late to change our plans.
-No, no, that's great. That's great.

76
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
You're forgetting how difficult
it's gonna be...

77
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,151
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

78
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,154
Honey, they're family.
They're not strangers off the street.

79
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,783
-All they do is argue.
-Christmas is about resolving differences...

80
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,202
...and seeing through the problems
of family life.

81
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,790
Yeah. And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

82
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,961
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip.

83
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,548
-And then they don't speak to each other--
-Your mother waxes her upper lip?

84
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,969
-She has for years.
-It doesn't show.

85
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,139
-I don't know, Sparky. I have this feeling--
-Ellen.

86
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,975
I want to have Christmas
here in our house.

87
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,355
It means a lot to me. All my life
I've wanted to have a big family Christmas.

88
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,398
I know.

89
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,821
It's just that I know how you build
things up in your mind, Sparky.

90
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:24,202
You set standards that no family event
can ever live up to.

91
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,829
When have I ever done that?

92
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:36,214
-Parties. Weddings. Anniversaries.
-Good night, honey.

93
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,510
-Funerals. Holidays.
-Oh, great.

94
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,763
Vacations. Graduations.

95
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,288
You should be looking at
a fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

96
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,209
Word is you're an excellent choice to be
named Food Additive Designer of the Year.

97
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,045
I'm not kidding.

98
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,381
What's that new thing you got
at Food and Drug?

99
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,218
Oh, the crunch enhancer?
Yeah, it's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

100
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,388
It's semipermeable, not osmatic.
It coats and seals the flake...

101
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,057
-...prevents the milk from penetrating it.
-Yeah.

102
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,518
-It's a beautiful product.
-I like it, yeah.

103
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,021
The question is,
what will you do with that bonus?

104
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,566
-Gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.
-Me? Heck, no.

105
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,735
Take a look at this.

106
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,241
I hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

107
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,536
Oh, my God, you're putting in a pool.

108
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,340
I went ahead and I put a $7500
deposit down on it.

109
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,426
You're the last true family man.

110
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,890
-Mark.
-Clark.

111
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,351
That's Bill, sir.

112
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,228
Were you working on that
non-nutritive cereal varnish?

113
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,440
-Yes, sir.
-I've got to give a speech to a trade group.

114
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:22,195
I'd like to mention it. Write a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

115
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,155
-My pleasure.
-Layman's terms.

116
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,991
None of that inside bullshit jargon
nobody understands.

117
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,827
Yes, sir.

118
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,084
Oh, Mr. Shirley. We got
your Christmas card the other day...

119
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,295
...and my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

120
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,632
Corporate cards.

121
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,472
-Don't forget that report, Bill.
-Yes, sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

122
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,974
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

123
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:57,480
Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.
Happy Hanukkah.

124
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,591
Can I show you something?

125
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:37,478
I was just smelling-- Smiling.
I was just blouse-- Browsing.

126
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,524
For your wife or your girlfriend?

127
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,278
What? What happened?

128
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,703
I guess it wouldn't be any--

129
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,540
Wouldn't be the Christmas shopping
season if stores were less hooter--

130
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,376
Hotter than they are.

131
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,129
-It is warm in here.
-You have your coat on.

132
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,090
-Yes. Oh, do l? How did that happen?
-Because it's cold out.

133
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:12,013
Yes. Yes. It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean, nippy out.

134
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,599
What did I say, nipple?

135
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,895
-There is a nip in the air though.
-Can I take something out for you?

136
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,367
I was just.... I was just looking
at something for my wife.

137
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,579
-God rest her soul.
-Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

138
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:42,460
Oh, no, no, she's not dead.
We're just divorced. She's history.

139
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,464
Obviously she doesn't wear underwear.
And there are plenty of shopping days left...

140
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,302
...until adultery-- Adulthood.
Which is to say Christmas, as in Yule.

141
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,307
Yule log. Not a log, I don't have a log.
But, I mean, you know, just if I had a log...

142
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:01,729
...not in the sense that you think
I said I did. Good golly.

143
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,774
'Tis the season to be merry.

144
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,276
-Well, that's my name.
-No shit.

145
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:20,498
What do these do? Do they clip on here?
Down there?

146
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,084
-Would you like this one?
-Sure.

147
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,129
These are cut really high on the hip.
Look, I'm wearing something similar.

148
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,173
See? You can't see the line.

149
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,842
-You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
-No.

150
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,636
No.

151
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,849
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

152
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,646
Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...

153
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,315
...an angel gets his wings.

154
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,019
Folks! Folks! Folks! Merry Christmas.

155
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,525
-Hey! How you doing, son?
-Fine.

156
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,195
There he is! Oh, my boy.

157
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,199
-Look at how big you've gotten.
-Merry Christmas.

158
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,160
-Mom.
-Sweetheart.

159
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,497
Oh, knock on the door.
Lift up the ladder.

160
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,958
-Listen. Doesn't Nora look old?
-You promised.

161
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,378
-Of course I do.
-They took a pint of fluid out of my back.

162
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,714
Do you see this mole?
This mole on my neck?

163
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,382
-Think it's changing color?
-No.

164
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,720
-You keep touching it, it's getting redder.
-I got hemorrhoids. Can you believe that?

165
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,930
-Oh, Mother.
-Isn't that terrible?

166
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,600
-You're not getting the garage space.
-After what you did--

167
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,643
I'm doing the parking.
Russ, you want to help?

168
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,855
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy, Mom.

169
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,359
Sweetheart. Your grandma Nora's
got a real painful burr on my heel.

170
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,861
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a whole quarter.

171
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,781
-A quarter. A quarter.
-I'll give Audrey a quarter too.

172
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,326
-I'm gonna put my car in the garage!
-He damaged my car, you believe that?

173
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,577
I'll park the cars.

174
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,664
This is what Christmas is all about.

175
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,794
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage...

176
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,422
...and yeah, I'll be outside for the season.

177
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,011
We're gonna have the best-looking house
in town.

178
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,681
-I've always wanted to do this.
-That's a lot of lights, Dad.

179
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,768
I'm sure it's a lot of work too,
but if I'm out in the cold...

180
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,105
...and I'm committed to decorating
the house, I'm gonna do it right...

181
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,732
...and I'm gonna do it big.

182
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,610
You want something you can be proud of,
don't you?

183
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,446
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Sure you do.

184
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:04,453
-You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?
-When was the last time I overdid anything?

185
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,582
Come on, unravel these.

186
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:14,422
You have to check every bulb.
Got a little knot here. You work on that.

187
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,510
I'll get the other box.

188
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,984
-I hope he falls and breaks his neck.
-I'm sure he'll fall.

189
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,945
But I don't think we're lucky enough
to have him break his neck.

190
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,159
Let's go.

191
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,815
Boy, these gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with that giant nutcracker float.

192
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:19,195
At this point I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.

193
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,532
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

194
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,912
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.
These look like giant nuts to me.

195
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,624
Yeah, I'm reminded of a couple years ago,
the winds were so high here...

196
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,210
...we almost lost Santa's reindeer.

197
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,215
Rudolph's red nose took out a third floor
window at Marshall Field's.

198
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,552
They better keep their eyes out
on their nuts before someone gets hurt.

199
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,615
Would it be indecent to ask
the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

200
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,284
Audrey.

201
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,120
Well, can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

202
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,207
Alex called this morning. Grandpa Clark
told him I couldn't come to the phone...

203
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,712
-...because I was going to the bathroom.
-We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

204
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,047
Everybody? Do you sleep with your brother?

205
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,633
Do you know how sick and twisted
that is, Mom?

206
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,179
Well, I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

207
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,016
I have nightmares about
what he does in his bed...

208
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,059
...when I'm not lying right next to him.

209
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:20,357
Well, I don't know what to say except
it's Christmas and we're all in misery.

210
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,986
Ellen, are you smoking again?

211
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,530
No!

212
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,168
Hey, Dad, where do you want
these reindeer?

213
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,254
Just put them down there on the lawn,
Russ.

214
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,008
I can't find the Santa Claus.

215
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:51,013
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

216
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:52,616
-Clark. Dinner's ready.
-Okay, honey. I'm starving.

217
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,928
Obviously something
had to break the window!

218
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,098
Something had to hit the stereo!

219
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,904
-And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?
-I don't know, Margo.

220
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,123
You want to hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

221
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,919
Two hundred and fifty strands of light,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

222
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,883
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported ltalian twinkle lights.

223
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,179
-Twenty-five thousand.
-Well, I hope nobody I know drives by...

224
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:59,224
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at the house in my pajamas.

225
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,144
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

226
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,146
Fire it up, Dad!

227
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:09,818
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

228
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,740
Drum roll, please.

229
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,660
Drum roll.

230
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:55,030
-Beautiful, Clark.
-Talk about pissing your money away.

231
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:00,410
I hope you kids see
what a silly waste of resources this was.

232
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,665
-He worked really hard, Grandma.
-So do washing machines.

233
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,880
Let's get in where it's warm.

234
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:17,845
Clark, baby, I can picture it in my mind.
And it's breathtaking.

235
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,600
-Thanks, Mom.
-It's probably a bad bulb, son.

236
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,062
You know, if one goes out,
the whole thing doesn't work.

237
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,566
Now, if I were you
I'd personally check each one.

238
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,735
-I did that, Dad. I can't--
-Now, look, if you need any help...

239
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:38,198
-...give me a holler. I'll be upstairs, asleep.
-Thanks.

240
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,662
Sorry, Daddy. It looks good
even if they're not lit.

241
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,747
Thank you, sweetheart.

242
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:57,259
-Well, Dad, it was a good try.
-Thanks, Russ.

243
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,219
-Russ.
-Yeah?

244
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:05,434
-We checked every bulb, didn't we?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of it.

245
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,230
I thought so. Well, maybe
we ought to go up there and just get--

246
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:17,362
Jeez! Look at the time. I gotta get to bed.
Brush my teeth. Feed the hog.

247
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,825
I've still got some homework to do.
Do the laundry. Wash the car.

248
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,745
I've still got those bills to pay....

249
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:29,458
Clark, don't stay up too late.

250
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,816
Get off me, you little fungus.

251
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,939
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

252
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,295
Hello?

253
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,131
-I need to get a few more--
-Pay by check.

254
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,677
-I will. Not a card?
-No. If they return it, then it's a hassle....

255
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,097
Russ!

256
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,229
-Help!
-Daddy, is Clark coming?

257
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,439
-How would I know?
-Is he in the house?

258
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,442
If he isn't farting around
with his lights, he must be inside.

259
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,362
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

260
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:51,493
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pills.

261
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,734
Ellen! Hey! Ellen!

262
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:57,489
I want to take off these clothes,
sit with a glass of wine and kiss your body.

263
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,908
-After you shower, of course.
-Of course.

264
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,802
-Sparky?
-Yes, honey.

265
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,940
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

266
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,610
No. I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

267
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:40,073
In the meantime, I can light the Santa and
the reindeer and the Merry Christmas sign.

268
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,868
That should look good. Ready?

269
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:49,290
-You want me to do the drum roll thing?
-No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

270
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,799
I don't understand it.

271
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,303
The house lights don't work,
the flood lights don't work.

272
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,974
Is it plugged in?

273
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,768
Do you honestly think I would check
thousands of lights...

274
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,187
...if the extension cord wasn't plugged in?

275
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,776
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

276
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,408
Maybe the kids have been fooling
around with it. I'll check in back.

277
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,638
Clark!

278
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,850
Todd! What's that light?!

279
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,394
Clark!

280
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,022
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

281
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,373
I can't see.

282
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,376
No, no, no--
Oh, my God--

283
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,685
This ought to do it.

284
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,199
Ellen, I fixed it!

285
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,911
Oh, God!

286
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,540
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

287
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,801
-Get a towel.
-Okay!

288
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,807
-Wait a minute. I don't believe this!
-What's all the yelling about?

289
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,727
What?! But--
What's going on here?

290
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,982
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

291
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,987
-What's he doing, Clark?
-I haven't the foggiest.

292
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,281
What?

293
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:31,119
What the hell? What is wrong with this?

294
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,623
Damn it! Damn it!

295
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,713
You goddamn light!

296
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,940
Go! Go! Do it!

297
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,455
Dad, it's beautiful!

298
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,680
Oh, my carpet!

299
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:46,694
-Oh, Clark, it's so lovely.
-Mom.

300
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,783
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

301
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:58,122
-It's a beaut, Clark. It's a beaut.
-Dad, Dad, Dad.

302
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,084
You taught me everything
I know about exterior illumination.

303
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,003
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,131
Russ. Audrey.

305
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,054
Dear, dear Francis.

306
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,184
I hope this adds to your enjoyment
of the holidays.

307
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,729
-It's just wonderful.
-Yeah.

308
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,109
Arthur. Art.

309
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,653
Dad.

310
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,324
-Thanks for being here.
-The little lights are not twinkling.

311
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,577
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

312
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,917
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

313
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:49,257
Thanks, Eddie. I hope it enhances
your holiday spirit. Dear Cathrine.

314
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,051
Eddie?

315
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:57,432
-Oh, the house is gorgeous, Clark.
-Eddie?

316
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,893
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

317
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,605
Kids, come on out here and see what
Uncle Clark's done to the house.

318
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,274
Eddie?

319
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,991
Eddie?

320
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,955
Yeah. If you don't remember,
this here is Rocky.

321
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,584
-You got a kiss for me?
-Better take a rain check on that, Art.

322
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,128
He's got a lip fungus
they ain't identified yet.

323
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:34,469
-You remember Ruby Sue?
-Oh, yeah.

324
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,596
Oh, my gosh!

325
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,601
-Her eyes aren't crossed anymore.
-That's something, ain't it?

326
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:46,355
Falls in a well, eyes go crossed. She gets
kicked by a mule, they go back to normal.

327
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,983
I don't know.

328
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,697
And this here's our pride and joy. Snots.

329
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,866
Pretty name, Ed.

330
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,952
We named him that
because he's got this sinus condition.

331
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,123
Snots, you roll over and let
Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

332
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,338
You ain't never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

333
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,881
That's okay, Eddie.

334
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,009
That's something, ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

335
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,386
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

336
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,515
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

337
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,560
We were gonna call, but Eddie
wanted to make it a surprise.

338
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,523
-Yeah. You surprised?
-Surprised, Eddie?

339
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:33,361
If I woke up with my head sewn
to the carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised.

340
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,741
We have plenty of room.

341
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,371
We have plenty of towels.
We have plenty of everything.

342
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:49,335
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight...

343
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:53,047
-...but we didn't come to impose.
-Hell, there's plenty of room.

344
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,925
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

345
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,804
Cathrine and l, we're pretty
comfy in there, you know.

346
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,391
But maybe you wouldn't mind
the youngsters shacking up with you.

347
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:08,771
After that long drive, we could
use a little private time together.

348
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,776
Why don't you run and get the kids' things?
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

349
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,571
Come on. I wanna show you the home.

350
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,740
Audrey, help me get some
hot chocolate. It's cold.

351
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,112
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.
Is it real?

352
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,990
Yeah. Yeah, I dug it out
of the ground myself.

353
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,785
-Is that a fact?
-Hey, get out of there. Snots! Yo!

354
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,289
Don't worry about it, Clark.
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

355
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,167
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

356
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:16,464
Boy, when he lifted his leg
the next morning....

357
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,176
If he drinks the water, the tree's
gonna dry up. Come on, out of there.

358
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,428
-Snots.
-Out, out, out.

359
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,472
Get out of there.
Get in the kitchen now.

360
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,808
Get in the kitchen there and get
you something to eat. Go on.

361
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:33,648
He's cute, ain't he? Problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

362
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:38,819
If the mood catches him right, he'll
grab your leg and just go to town.

363
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:43,574
Don't want him around if you're wearing
short pants, if you know what I mean.

364
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:50,164
A word of warning, though. If he does lay
into you, it's best to just let him finish.

365
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:55,586
I can't believe you're actually standing
here in my living room, Eddie.

366
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:00,007
-Never thought the day would come.
-Yeah, I'm excited about it too.

367
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,886
It's a crying shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

368
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,935
I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
Let me get it.

369
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:18,317
Yeah, I got the daughter in the clinic,
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

370
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:23,030
And the older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

371
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,699
-College?
-Carnival.

372
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,369
-You gotta be proud.
-Oh, yeah.

373
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:32,581
Yeah, last season he was
a pixie-dust spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

374
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,542
He thinks maybe next year...

375
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,920
...he'll be guessing people's weight
or barking for the Yak Woman.

376
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,757
-You ever see her?
-No.

377
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,428
She's got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

378
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,181
Yeah, she's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.
And a hell of a good cook.

379
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,892
Can I refill your eggnog?
Get you something to eat?

380
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,562
Drive you out to nowhere
and leave you for dead?

381
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,858
No, I'm doing just fine, Clark.
Just glad to be here.

382
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:03,863
Yeah. So when did you get
the tenement on wheels?

383
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,116
Oh, that there? That's an RV.

384
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:11,370
Yeah, yeah. I borrowed it off a buddy
of mine. He took my house...

385
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:15,791
...I took the RV.
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

386
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,252
Yeah. Looks so nice parked
in the driveway.

387
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:22,506
Yeah, it sure does. But don't
you go falling in love with it now.

388
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,885
Because we're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

389
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,898
Well, get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures.

390
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,609
Oh, retooling. That's a great excuse.

391
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,906
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

392
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,161
-Mr. Shirley, merry Christmas.
-Who's that?

393
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,623
-It's me, Clark Griswold.
-What do you want?

394
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,837
My wife and I came up with a little
something special. It's a gift.

395
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,634
Put it over there with the others,
greaseball.

396
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:20,648
By the way, I hope my report
helped out at the trade show.

397
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,239
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

398
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:32,159
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of an important call.

399
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,830
Get me somebody. Anybody.

400
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,374
And get me somebody while I wait.

401
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,101
This is a new silicon-based kitchen
lubricant my company's been working on.

402
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,021
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than any cooking oil.

403
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,524
We're gonna fly down
the hill with this stuff.

404
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,361
-Has anyone ever used it on a sled?
-Not that I know of, Russ.

405
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:13,534
Well, don't go putting
none of that stuff on my sled, Clark.

406
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,787
-You know that metal plate in my head?
-How could I forget?

407
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,749
I had to have it replaced because every
time Cathrine revved up the microwave...

408
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,044
...I'd piss my pants and forget
who I was for a half-hour or so.

409
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:29,592
Over at the V.A. they had to replace it with
a plastic one and it ain't as strong, so....

410
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,012
I don't know if I ought to go down
no hill with nothing between...

411
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,390
...the ground and my brain
but a piece of government plastic.

412
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:44,398
-You really think it matters, Eddie?
-The plate runs underneath my part here.

413
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,401
Over here it's, you know, nothing.

414
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:52,364
But here, if this gets dented,
then my hair just ain't gonna look right.

415
00:49:55,075 --> 00:50:00,206
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I better try this first, see how it works.

416
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,584
-Well, you be careful there.
-There's nothing to worry about, Eddie.

417
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,756
Going for a new amateur recreational
saucer-sled land-speed record:

418
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,759
Clark W. Griswold Jr.!

419
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,764
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

420
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:23,604
Later, dudes. Let her rip. Hang 10.

421
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,107
Oh, shit!

422
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,290
This is great! It's great! It's great!
I'm dead!

423
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,186
Look out!

424
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,588
Bingo.

425
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,021
-Clark? You staying late?
-Oh, hi, Bill. Yeah.

426
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,983
Just finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

427
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,445
Well, have a really Merry Christmas.

428
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,739
You too.

429
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,369
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

430
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,582
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

431
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,043
I just talked to my son.

432
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,379
Company messenger brought something
to the house. I guess that's it.

433
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:17,009
Nothing like waiting till the
last minute, huh? Did you get yours?

434
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,555
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it's on its way.

435
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,185
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

436
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:31,398
-Don't sweat it. It'll come. Merry Christmas.
-Same to you.

437
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,767
Me?

438
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,364
Santy Claus!

439
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,867
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

440
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,036
What?

441
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,041
You scared me.

442
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,252
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

443
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,467
I wish I was.

444
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,929
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

445
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,390
-Rocky bit my thumb.
-What?

446
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,352
Him's nervous because
Christmas is almost here.

447
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,773
-Nervous or excited?
-Shitting bricks.

448
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,070
-You shouldn't use that word.
-Sorry. Shitting rocks.

449
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,906
I see. Good.

450
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:29,993
Him's nervous because he don't
know if he's getting nothing.

451
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,707
I don't think he should be nervous
and you shouldn't be either.

452
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,585
Because if you're good, Santa knows it.

453
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:43,757
If you believe in him and you believe
in your mom and you believe in your....

454
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,260
Your dad.

455
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,931
If you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus is gonna bring you something.

456
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:55,102
Sometimes I think all that
Santa crap is just bull.

457
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,647
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

458
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,483
We didn't do nothing wrong
and we still got the shaft.

459
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,321
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

460
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,575
And in the next couple of days...

461
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,910
...somehow I'm gonna prove it to you.

462
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,456
You know, every year he comes
to our house. I've seen him.

463
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,503
-That's true?
-Cross my heart.

464
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,884
-So it's good you came to stay with us.
-I love it here.

465
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,762
You don't gotta put on your coat
to go to the bathroom.

466
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,432
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

467
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,063
I think you'd better go back to bed now.

468
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,776
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

469
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,240
Oh, I was just looking for something.

470
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,539
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

471
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,750
Nope. How come?

472
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,252
Oh, just wondering.

473
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,676
Now you get back to bed. Come on.

474
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,685
Uncle Clark, are you sure
you ain't Santy Claus?

475
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,105
I'm sure.

476
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,613
I can't even afford to be an elf.

477
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,543
Two containers of K rations!
Two containers of K rations!

478
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,214
Then I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears.

479
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,341
Oh, bullshit!

480
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:03,563
-Aren't you having any breakfast?
-I'm not in the mood.

481
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,566
What are you looking at?

482
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,445
Oh, the silent majesty of a winter's morn.

483
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,782
The clean, cool chill of the holiday air.

484
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,619
And an asshole in his bathrobe emptying
a chemical toilet into my sewer.

485
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,752
-Shitter was full!
-Yeah.

486
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,672
-Have you checked our shitters, honey?
-Clark, please.

487
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,258
-He doesn't know any better.
-It's illegal.

488
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,595
It's a storm sewer. If it fills with gas, I pity
the person who lights a match near it.

489
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:03,957
Merry Christmas. Shitter was full.

490
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:21,767
I have a terrible suspicion Cathrine
and Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

491
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:27,689
Rocky said something about Eddie telling
him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

492
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:32,110
Yeah. Ruby Sue said something
like that last night.

493
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:36,031
-How can they have nothing for the kids?
-He's been out of work for seven years.

494
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,325
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

495
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:42,621
Cathrine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

496
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:51,671
-So how's the live-bait business, Eddie?
-Well, I can't complain. How you doing?

497
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,632
Not that good, actually.

498
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:57,135
Your company kill off all them
people over in lndia not long ago?

499
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:03,016
No. We missed out on that one. You're
pretty set so far as shopping goes?

500
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,438
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark. The truth
is, things ain't going too good at all.

501
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:13,902
You know, I told you I borrowed the RV
from my neighbor? Nope. It's mine.

502
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:19,908
We live in it. I had to sell off
the house, the barn, the 10 acres.

503
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:26,498
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

504
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,376
If only I had back the money
that me and Cathrine...

505
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:34,005
...sent that TV preacher that was
screwing the hockey players.

506
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,049
What about the kids?

507
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:39,886
-His kids can fend for themselves.
-No, your kids.

508
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,557
Oh, well, that's the bitch of it.
See, I don't know what to do.

509
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:48,937
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurnee.

510
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,648
Eddie....

511
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,111
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

512
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,739
-Clark, I couldn't do that.
-No, no, we insist.

513
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,409
Oh, no. I'm not one
for charity, now.

514
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,079
Oh, I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

515
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,585
-I don't know about that.
-Now, come on.

516
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,547
If you don't tell me what they want,
I'll go out and get it on my own.

517
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,595
Oh, boy.
This is a surprise, Clark.

518
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:27,976
This is just a real nice surprise.
Just a real nice surprise.

519
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:37,110
Here's a little list.
Alphabetical, starting with Cathrine.

520
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:41,239
And if it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

521
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,284
Something really nice.

522
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:05,222
-Is your house on fire, Clark?
-No, Bethany. Those are Christmas lights.

523
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,767
-Don't throw me down, Clark.
-I'll try not to, Aunt Bethany.

524
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,354
-Is this the airport, Clark?
-We're here!

525
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,316
Hey, Gris, me and Bethany
figured out the perfect gift for you.

526
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,152
Oh, Uncle Lewis, you didn't
have to buy me anything.

527
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,322
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

528
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:26,785
Oh, that was fun.
I love riding in cars.

529
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:30,664
When did you move to Florida?

530
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,418
Ellen, are you still dating Clark?

531
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:41,174
Oh, Aunt Bethany, you know
you shouldn't have done that.

532
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,010
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

533
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,847
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?

534
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,559
Hell, no. She means presents.
You shouldn't have brought presents.

535
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,897
It isn't every day somebody
moves into a new house.

536
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,191
They didn't move into a new house.

537
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,528
-Mom?
-In the living room, Russ.

538
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,367
This house is bigger
than your old one.

539
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,953
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

540
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,165
Aunt Bethany, why don't you go with
Francis and Cathrine into the living room...

541
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,835
-...and say hello to everybody.
-Hello, everybody?

542
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,129
-Just in the living room.
-I should say it?

543
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,257
-You should say it.
-Hello, everybody!

544
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,010
-Mom.
-What?

545
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,388
-This box is meowing.
-Let me see it.

546
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,896
-She wrapped up her cat.
-Take it in the kitchen and open it up.

547
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,066
-Then we'll have a cat running around.
-You can't leave it in the box.

548
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,652
Why would somebody
wrap up a cat in a box?

549
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,364
She gets confused, Rusty. She and
Uncle Lewis don't have much money...

550
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,784
...so she takes things from the house
and gives them as presents.

551
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,870
Great. Can't wait to see what I got.

552
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:55,123
This one here is leaking.

553
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,799
-It's lime.
-That's her Jell-O mold. I'll take it, Eddie.

554
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:08,762
Why don't you go back in the living room
and enjoy yourself? Russ?

555
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,263
Come on, boy.

556
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,433
Let's go find your sister.

557
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:39,459
Before we begin, since this is
Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

558
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,671
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

559
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,923
Great.

560
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,718
What, dear?

561
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,471
Grace!

562
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:56,476
Grace? She passed away
30 years ago.

563
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,978
They want you
to say grace.

564
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,983
The blessing.

565
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:26,214
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America...

566
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:30,093
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

567
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,679
...one nation under God,
indivisible...

568
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:38,101
...with liberty
and justice for all.

569
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,687
-Amen.
-Amen.

570
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,737
Cathrine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

571
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,782
...I think we're all in
for a very big treat.

572
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,160
Thank you.

573
01:05:56,828 --> 01:06:00,373
-Save the neck for me, Clark.
-Okay, Eddie.

574
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,592
Look at that.

575
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,723
Sorry.

576
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,186
-Why are you crying?
-I told you we put it in too early.

577
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:25,565
-Oh, it's just a little dry. It's fine.
-It looks good to me.

578
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,609
Here's the heart.

579
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,255
Aunt Bethany?

580
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,591
Does your cat, by any chance,
eat Jell-O?

581
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,639
Well, I don't know about the cat,
but I sure am enjoying it.

582
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,153
Hey, kids?

583
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:59,784
I heard on the news that a pilot spotted
Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

584
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,209
You serious, Clark?

585
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:15,633
Art, you want to load me up with
a little more there. It is good.

586
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,018
-Ed?
-Yeah, Clark.

587
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,020
What's wrong with the dog?

588
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,236
Oh, he's just yacking on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

589
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,699
Maybe if you wouldn't
feed him from the table.

590
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,536
No, no.

591
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,706
He's probably just nosing
through the trash there.

592
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,843
Hey, Gris, if you're not doing
anything constructive...

593
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,347
...run into the living room,
get my stogy.

594
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:06,267
Is there anything else I can
do for you, Uncle Lewis?

595
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,854
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

596
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,815
If he keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

597
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,559
That should be it.

598
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,609
Honey?

599
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:08,371
-You had too many plugs in one outlet.
-Oh, God.

600
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,457
What is it?

601
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:16,170
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

602
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,968
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

603
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:30,852
If you don't mind, Clark, I'd like to see
if I can fumigate this here chair.

604
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,813
It's a good, quality item.

605
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:39,986
If you don't mind me asking,
how much it set you back?

606
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,988
You smell something?

607
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,117
Fried pussycat.

608
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:51,664
It's not the chair. It's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

609
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,796
Lewis?

610
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,591
My tree!

611
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,886
So, what's the matter with you?

612
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,932
Look what you've done to my tree!

613
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,061
Lewis.

614
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,324
It was an ugly tree, anyway.

615
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,868
At least it's out of its misery.

616
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,371
-Dad's gonna flip out.
-Nobody's gonna flip out.

617
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:16,207
We're gonna have
a wonderful Christmas.

618
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,878
What the hell do you want?

619
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:26,217
I have a delivery for Clark W. Grisman.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

620
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:31,430
...but it fell between the seats,
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

621
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,939
Merry Christmas.

622
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,358
Merry Christmas.

623
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,989
-I can't believe it.
-What is it?

624
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:51,325
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nut house?

625
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,452
It's from my company.

626
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,163
-Your bonus.
-My bonus.

627
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,796
Open it, Clarkie.
Open it.

628
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,966
Yeah, I hope it's a fortune, Clark.

629
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,093
I bet you do, Eddie.

630
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,390
I was afraid....

631
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,476
Are you gonna bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

632
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:24,650
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to tell
you all this, but what the heck.

633
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,863
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

634
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,995
That's it. That's the big one!

635
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,373
Open it!

636
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,046
I'm sorry if I've been a little short
with everyone lately.

637
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,340
I've been waiting
for this bonus.

638
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,176
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

639
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,012
...I had to pay in advance.
And until this arrived...

640
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,349
...I didn't have enough in my account
to cover the check.

641
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,726
-Tear the sucker open, Dad.
-Yeah.

642
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,731
Drum roll. Just kidding.

643
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:14,325
If there's enough left over, I'm gonna fly
you all down here to help us dedicate it.

644
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,539
I can't swim, Clark.

645
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,125
I know that, Eddie.

646
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,433
Clark, what's wrong?

647
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,060
Honey?

648
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,855
It's bigger than you expected?

649
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,652
Smaller?

650
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,656
What is it?

651
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:58,661
It's a one-year membership
in the Jelly of the Month Club.

652
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,829
Oh, God.

653
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:04,417
Clark, that's the gift that keeps
on giving the whole year.

654
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:09,797
That it is, Edward.
That it is, indeed.

655
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,050
I'm sorry. Clark....

656
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:19,098
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got. Goddamn it!

657
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,725
Son.

658
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:37,950
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

659
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,289
Hey!

660
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:49,628
If any of you are looking for any
last-minute gift ideas for me, I have one.

661
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,631
I'd like Frank Shirley, my boss,
right here, tonight.

662
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,136
I want him brought from his happy
holiday slumber on Melody Lane...

663
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:00,389
...with all the other rich people,
and I want him right here.

664
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,975
With a big ribbon on his head.

665
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,644
I wanna look him straight
in the eye and tell him...

666
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,689
...what a cheap, lying, no good,
rotten, four-flushing...

667
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,984
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

668
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:16,906
...ignorant, bloodsucking, dog-kissing,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

669
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,826
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

670
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,996
...worm-headed sack
of monkey shit he is!

671
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:28,459
Hallelujah! Holy shit!
Where's the Tylenol?

672
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:46,560
-He's got that crazed look in his eye.
-I told you we should've gone to Hawaii.

673
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,980
Turn that thing off
and get in the house!

674
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,191
I'll talk to him, Mom.

675
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,030
You know, Dad.
I've been thinking.

676
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,408
Good talk, Dad.

677
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,834
Aren't you a bit sorry we didn't
get a Christmas tree?

678
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,546
Even though they're dirty and
messy and corny and clich·d.

679
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:17,216
Well, where you gonna find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

680
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,237
What's the matter?

681
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,907
Was that really necessary?

682
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,870
-We needed a tree.
-May I remind you that--

683
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:50,249
That this was all my idea. No.
No, no. I'm well aware of that, honey.

684
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,878
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

685
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,423
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

686
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:04,096
We needed a coffin.
I mean, a tree.

687
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,348
There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

688
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,477
Lewis burned down my tree,
so I replaced it as best I could. yo···.

689
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,440
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, honey.

690
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,758
Fixed the newelpost.

691
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,615
What's that sound?

692
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,308
Do you hear it?
It's a funny squeaky sound.

693
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:36,563
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

694
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,942
I hear it too.

695
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,244
I don't hear it anymore.

696
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,759
What was it?! Oh, my God!

697
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,476
Quiet! Shut up!

698
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,408
Mom, don't move.

699
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,412
We can't let it get out
of the living room.

700
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,915
Where's Eddie? He usually eats
these goddamn things.

701
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:42,087
Oh, not recently, Clark. He read that
squirrels were high in cholesterol.

702
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,089
Thank you, Cathrine.

703
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,383
I'll try and trap it.

704
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,469
-Russ!
-Right here, Dad.

705
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,096
Oh, there you are.

706
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,265
Go get the hammer.

707
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,559
Clark, what do you need
a hammer for?

708
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:59,271
I'm gonna catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

709
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,989
I'm going in with him.

710
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,786
Nora?

711
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,581
-Nora!
-Is it gone?

712
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,793
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

713
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,961
Squirrel!

714
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,796
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

715
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:09,007
-I can't just attack someone.
-If you're not man enough...

716
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,094
...to put an end to this shit,
then I am.

717
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,999
Oh, my God!

718
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,795
What happened to you?

719
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:57,389
Beautiful. God.

720
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,977
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

721
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,813
Nobody's walking out
on this family Christmas.

722
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,399
No, no. We're all in this together.

723
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,569
This is a full-blown, four-alarm
holiday emergency here.

724
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,364
We're gonna press on, and we're gonna
have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas...

725
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,867
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny Kaye.

726
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,329
And when Santa squeezes his ass
down that chimney tonight...

727
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:24,458
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nut house.

728
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,126
You're goofy.

729
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,086
-Don't piss me off, Art.
-Clark?

730
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,340
-It's over.
-Not according to Santa's watch.

731
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,342
-Come on, son.
-Stay out of this, Dad.

732
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,553
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

733
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,098
-Before things get worse.
-Worse?

734
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,767
How could they
get any worse?

735
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:46,313
Take a look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell.

736
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,457
Son?

737
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,253
I love you.
We all love you.

738
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:13,674
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

739
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,135
You losing your temper with
the whole family only makes things worse.

740
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,305
You're too good a father
to act like this.

741
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:26,144
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us.

742
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,147
And how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

743
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,317
-Well, I just--
-You just cocked it up.

744
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:37,114
Oh, it's okay. It happens.

745
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,995
-Our holidays were always such a mess.
-Oh, yeah.

746
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,539
How did you
get through it?

747
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,167
I had a lot of help
from Jack Daniels.

748
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,803
I love you.

749
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,348
-Dad?
-Yeah.

750
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:07,352
Are you gonna recite
The Night Before Christmas?

751
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,564
It's your house.
It's your Christmas.

752
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,358
I'm retiring.

753
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,279
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds...

754
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,907
...while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

755
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,744
And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

756
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,705
...had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

757
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,916
When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter...

758
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,544
...I sprang from my bed to see
what was the matter.

759
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,005
Away to the window,
I flew like a flash...

760
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:37,841
...tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

761
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:42,262
The moon on the new-fallen snow
gave a luster of midday to objects below.

762
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:48,393
When what to my wondering eyes should
appear but a miniature sleigh and...."

763
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,230
And Eddie with a man in his
pajamas with a dog chain...

764
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,983
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the--?

765
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,904
Stay here.

766
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:07,245
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Clark.

767
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,957
You about ready to do some kissing?

768
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:15,253
Yes, officer, it seems my husband's
been abducted.

769
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,422
The man was...

770
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:22,135
...wearing a blue leisure suit,
and the plates were from Kansas.

771
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:25,764
He was a huge, beastly,
bulging man and--

772
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,350
I've never been treated
like this in my life.

773
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,937
I'm sorry. This is our family's
first kidnapping.

774
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,273
You're fired. And where's the phone?
I'm calling the police.

775
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,444
Hey, just hold your wad there, fella.
Clark had nothing to do with this.

776
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,780
This here was my idea.

777
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:45,784
All right. He's still fired,
and you are going to jail.

778
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:49,246
Oh, no. Eddie, it was my fault.

779
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,207
I lost my temper
when I got my bonus.

780
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,460
-I guess I said some things I shouldn't have.
-Bonus?

781
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,964
How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

782
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,341
Yeah. Thanks for telling us.

783
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:05,595
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

784
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,850
Seventeen years with the company. l've
gotten a bonus every year but this one.

785
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:11,810
You don't wanna give bonuses, fine!

786
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,771
But when people count on them
as part of their salary...

787
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,482
-...well, what you did just plain--
-Sucks.

788
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:21,153
Thank you, Russ.

789
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,322
My...

790
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,492
...cousin-in-law, whose heart
is bigger than his brain--

791
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,911
I appreciate that, Clark.

792
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,915
Is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this.

793
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:38,670
On behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

794
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,690
Look...

795
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,195
...sometimes things look
good on paper...

796
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:07,365
...but lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

797
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,577
I guess a healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much...

798
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,997
...if to get it you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

799
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,919
It's people that make the difference.

800
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:21,213
Little people, like you.

801
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:26,009
So, Carl...

802
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,304
...whatever you got last year...

803
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:32,057
...add 20 percent.

804
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,559
Our pool!

805
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,524
Dad.

806
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,571
Go away, Todd.

807
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:32,492
If you wanna come in, you are gonna have
to break down the goddamn door!

808
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,923
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

809
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,312
Freeze!

810
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:04,149
Not you, them!
Them!

811
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,285
This way, please.

812
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:21,708
-I think you've made a terrible mistake.
-I told you to freeze, mister.

813
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,501
May we blink?

814
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,757
Frank.

815
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,926
-Helen!
-Thank God, you're all right.

816
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,928
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

817
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,263
It was a big misunderstanding tonight.

818
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,683
Excuse me. Would you and
Mrs. Shirley like to step outside...

819
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,936
...so we can take care
of business here?

820
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,688
There's no business.
I'm not pressing any charges.

821
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,940
-What?
-It was a mistake.

822
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,152
Mistake? Frank, honey,
you were kidnapped.

823
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:53,031
I did something I shouldn't have,
and these people called me on it.

824
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,242
This is Clark Griswold
and his family.

825
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,536
Welcome to our home.

826
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,747
What's left of it.

827
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,875
-Release B Squad.
-What's going on here?

828
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:09,089
Remember how I was toying with the notion
of suspending the Christmas bonuses?

829
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:14,094
You didn't. Well, of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

830
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,889
That's pretty low, mister. If I had
a rubber hose, I would beat you to--

831
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,183
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating the bonuses.

832
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,229
Look!

833
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,899
Look, look!

834
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,569
Look!

835
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,447
Ruby Sue, sweetheart.

836
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:40,412
-It's Santa Claus.
-What? What's wrong?

837
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:45,375
-What?
-She thinks she sees Santa.

838
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,420
No, it's the Christmas star.

839
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,589
And that's all that matters tonight.

840
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:57,053
Not bonuses or gifts
or turkeys or trees.

841
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,013
See, kids...

842
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:02,267
...it means something different
to everybody.

843
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,479
Now I know what it means to me.

844
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:13,653
That ain't the frigging Christmas star, Gris.
It's a light on the sewage treatment plant.

845
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,280
Sewer gas.

846
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,075
Don't drop that!

847
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,833
Play ball!

848
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,344
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

849
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,055
Merry Christmas, honey.

850
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,350
Come here.

851
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,293
I did it.
