{1415}{1470}I'll tell you this about my father.
{1471}{1499}Aah!
{1501}{1551}He had a heart of gold.
{1553}{1592}He was honest to a fault.
{1630}{1694}And he almost always smelt|like talcum powder.
{1811}{1902}He just really loved|his Johnson's baby powder.
{1904}{1984}No, but, I mean, like, a lot.
{1986}{2073}He'd sprinkle the stuff on himself...
{2075}{2131}over himself, under himself...
{2133}{2221}and then just for good measure,|under himself again.
{2262}{2369}Because, as he was fond of saying,|''You never know.''
{2371}{2460}To this day, if you cover my eyes|and put me across the room...
{2462}{2511}I couldn't tell you|the difference between...
{2513}{2572}a freshly bathed baby|and my father's balls.
{2608}{2657}I'm not saying that's a healthy thing.
{2658}{2722}I'm just saying|it's something I remember.
{2865}{2919}The best time I ever had|with my father...
{2921}{3007}was when he was having|maybe the worst time of his life.
{3009}{3075}Go figure, right? You never know.
{3077}{3112}Mom, make her stop!
{3114}{3146}- Lilly!|- What?
{3147}{3185}Are you jumping on the couch?
{3186}{3213}No.
{3215}{3251}I'm going to come in there|and turn off the TV.
{3253}{3296}- Why?|- Why? Well, did you do your reading?
{3298}{3334}Yeah.
{3336}{3393}- Well, it's getting late. It's time to--|- Lilly, quit it!
{3395}{3430}- Lilly!|- It's mine!
{3432}{3535}All right, now, it says here five-bedroom|rustic retreat with its own lake.
{3537}{3609}What does that mean?|It has, like, its own lake?
{3611}{3658}Really? Like, how big is the lake?
{3660}{3693}A lake? Who buys a lake?
{3694}{3721}- How much?|- Well...
{3723}{3802}All right, when you say you can rowboat,|like, how far could you rowboat?
{3804}{3860}- Grape.|- Daddy.
{3862}{3887}You could rowboat a long time...
{3889}{3949}or you could paddle two or three times|and then you got to turn around again?
{3951}{3984}You know what?|You're choking Daddy.
{3986}{4055}Well, that's--See, that's--|That doesn't sound to me like a lake.
{4057}{4110}- That's more like a pond, frankly.|- Honey, forget it.
{4111}{4174}Maybe not even a pond.|That could be just a small wet area.
{4176}{4206}I'm not kidding around! Quit it!
{4208}{4262}Who? The owner?
{4263}{4298}He has to interview us?
{4299}{4380}- Oh, see, that just sounds crazy.|- What does that mean? Huh?
{4382}{4422}OK, girls, come on, bed.
{4423}{4462}- Mean it.|- Really?
{4464}{4493}Come on.
{4495}{4546}You think it might be gone that fast?
{4547}{4582}Jeez. Wow.
{4583}{4614}Hello?
{4616}{4683}Oh, yeah, just to tell you,|a Mr. Kleinman is on his way up.
{4685}{4732}- Mr. Kleinman?|- I don't have to--
{4734}{4774}Honey, are we doing something|with your parents?
{4776}{4801}My parents?
{4835}{4862}Uh...
{4864}{4933}Not going to stay long.|Just came by for a quick howdy do.
{4935}{5002}- Hi.|- What--Where's--Where's Mom?
{5003}{5095}Uh, she's, uh...|Uh, she's going to come later.
{5097}{5142}She--So, you came by yourself?
{5143}{5177}- Yeah.|- Hiya, Papi!
{5178}{5272}Oh. Did you get more beautiful?|Huh? Huh?
{5274}{5311}I think you did.
{5313}{5337}So, you just came just like this?
{5339}{5412}Yeah. Look at this face. Mmm.
{5414}{5480}- Well, is everything OK?|- Huh? Yeah, sure. Why?
{5482}{5515}Well, no, I mean, because|you usually don't--
{5517}{5587}- Hi, Papi.|- Oh, there she is.
{5589}{5631}- Oh, yeah.|- I--I'm just--
{5633}{5676}What are you doing in the city?
{5678}{5747}It's a problem for a person|to come and say hello?
{5749}{5780}No, of course you can, but, I mean--
{5782}{5843}Uh-oh.|You're probably in the middle of dinner.
{5845}{5878}- Dinner was--|- Dinner? No, no.
{5880}{5920}We're actually just|getting the girls to bed.
{5922}{5947}Because I can come back another time.
{5949}{6005}No, no, don't be silly.|Girls, go and brush your teeth.
{6007}{6091}- Now, you're sure?|- Absolutely. Girls, go.
{6093}{6153}- They're not going.|- What did Mom say? Go, go, go, go.
{6155}{6205}- Come on, come on, school.|- I'm not washing my whole face.
{6207}{6279}All right, well, just do|the sticky parts, then. Let's go. Come on.
{6281}{6380}Listen, you do whatever you have to do.|I'm not even here.
{6382}{6423}Are you hungry?
{6425}{6462}No. No, no, no.
{6464}{6493}You know,|because I can heat up some pasta.
{6495}{6547}No. No, no, no, no.
{6549}{6608}- Are you sure everything is all right?|- Yeah, sure, fine.
{6610}{6657}I just--I'm a little confused|as to why Mom is not here.
{6659}{6706}Oh, I just wanted to show you something.
{6707}{6733}What?
{6735}{6770}There's a little something|I want to show you.
{6771}{6823}- OK, show me what?|- I'll show you later.
{6825}{6892}- Show me now.|- Daddy, will you brush my hair?
{6894}{6927}Yeah, yeah, just a second.
{6929}{6993}Go, go. Brush their hair. We'll talk after.
{6995}{7100}- Daddy.|- Yeah, OK, OK.
{7102}{7137}You don't want anything? A drink?
{7139}{7179}No. No, no, no.
{7181}{7233}- Juice?|- No, no, no.
{7235}{7282}- Coffee?|- No, no.

{7716}{7793}- Thanks for being my baby girl.|- Thanks for being my daddy.
{7794}{7823}What's your story?

{8932}{8956}What's the matter?
{9004}{9074}It's from your mom.
{9076}{9146}I found it on the refrigerator.
{9290}{9331}I don't understand.|What is it? What does that mean?
{9333}{9357}''I'm leaving.''
{9358}{9440}Like it says, she's leaving.
{9442}{9513}- I don't understand.|- Welcome to the club.
{9515}{9547}Did you guys have a fight or something?
{9549}{9616}No fight. Everything fine.
{9618}{9671}Really? So, why...
{9673}{9779}She'd just had enough.
{9781}{9835}What?|So, where--where is she going to go?
{9837}{9893}- Read.|- ''I don't know where I'm going to go.''
{9894}{9925}Even she don't know.
{9927}{9969}''All these years have flown by...
{9971}{10024}''and I don't know|where they've gone, either.
{10026}{10079}''I know I was a young woman|when we met...
{10081}{10149}''but for the life of me,|I don't know what happened to her.
{10150}{10256}''I need to be somewhere else now,|and I need to be there alone.
{10258}{10320}I hope you'll understand.|Love, Muriel.''
{10381}{10424}Jesus.
{10451}{10483}Jesus.
{10508}{10560}Tell us what we can do.
{10562}{10648}I don't know.|I figured I'd give it a day or two.
{10650}{10692}Wait a second.|When did you find this?
{10694}{10725}Monday.
{10726}{10787}And you're just telling us about it now?
{10789}{10850}- I didn't want to worry anybody.|- Oh, for God's sake.
{10852}{10889}Who are you calling? The police?
{10890}{10920}Yeah, yeah.
{10922}{10962}''Hey, there's a woman out there|in her seventies...
{10963}{11026}5'4'' and very angry.|Take a look around.''
{11028}{11063}- Linda, hey.|- Linda?

{11306}{11339}What letter?
{11341}{11418}She I--She left a note. She--
{11420}{11468}Mom left Dad, basically.
{11470}{11517}Really? Good for her.

{11566}{11622}- She says she can't believe it.|- Well, believe it.
{11624}{11679}Hey, ready for this? Mom left Dad.
{11681}{11719}What? What do you mean?
{11721}{11777}- She left him a letter.|- Who are you talking to?
{11778}{11810}- It's Hillary.|- What's she doing there?
{11812}{11849}She came by to borrow|the land cruiser.
{11850}{11874}- Who?|- Hillary.
{11876}{11899}- Hillary?|- Hillary.
{11901}{11951}- What is she doing there?|- She came over to borrow her car.
{11953}{11982}What does she need the car for?
{11984}{12064}Really? That's what|you want to talk about now?
{12066}{12133}She actually, like, took clothes|in a suitcase and went somewhere?
{12135}{12172}Apparently, yeah.
{12174}{12211}- Holy shit.|- Yeah.
{12213}{12261}- "Holy" shit.|- Holy shit.
{12262}{12324}- What?|- They're--They're shocked.

{12667}{12694}Please. Give her a call.
{12696}{12753}She's going to hate that we know|something before she does.
{12755}{12781}Just--Linda, please.
{12783}{12841}OK. Hold on. Watch.
{12842}{12898}''What do you mean?|Why did no one tell me?
{12900}{12925}You know how much I worry.''
{12927}{12979}- Hello?|- Hey, it's me.
{12981}{13053}Well, hi. What a nice surprise.|How are you?
{13054}{13130}I'm all right. Listen, there's a bit|of a thing, though, with Mom and Dad.
{13132}{13161}Oh, my God.|I knew it. I had a dream last night.
{13163}{13238}- No, no. Everyone is fine.|- OK, what happened? Just tell me.
{13278}{13330}- So?|- She's calling Bonnie.
{13332}{13396}Yeah. He's over there now.|Ben called me, and I'm calling you.
{13398}{13423}Great.

{13488}{13519}- Bonnie--|- Oldest child...
{13521}{13547}last one to hear about everything.
{13549}{13608}- OK, whatever.|- So, you don't know anything about this.
{13610}{13649}No! Jesus, what do you think? I--
{13650}{13733}OK, OK. I got to call you back.
{13735}{13765}She doesn't know a thing.
{13767}{13815}- Oy.|- So, now what?
{13817}{13867}Uh, I--Now, I don't know.
{13869}{13905}Is he going to stay there|with you tonight?
{13906}{13946}Yes, of course he's going|to stay with us tonight.
{13948}{13999}- No, no. No, no, no, no.|- Yes.
{14001}{14058}You cannot drive home at this hour.|You're going to sleep here with us.
{14059}{14113}- I am not going to sleep with you.|- Yes, you are.
{14114}{14174}- I'm not discussing this.|- No, no, no, no.
{14176}{14228}- I have no pajamas.|- Pajamas. You hearing this?
{14230}{14266}Ben has pajamas.
{14268}{14330}Well, how is he? He must be so lost.
{14332}{14378}- No, he's fine.|- I'm fine.
{14380}{14410}- He's fine.|- Of course I'm fine.
{14412}{14455}- Yeah.|- It's just a screwy mix-up.
{14457}{14486}There you go.
{14487}{14534}A little screwy mix-up?|Is that what he thinks this is?
{14536}{14561}He doesn't get it.
{14563}{14603}Would you get her feet|off of there, please?
{14605}{14645}Jeez.
{14646}{14703}OK, what is your tomorrow?
{14705}{14778}Well, now I don't know. I was--|I was thinking of driving upstate.
{14780}{14808}I was gonna go look at a house.
{14810}{14866}- Perfect. Take Daddy.|- Take him with me?
{14867}{14904}Yeah, keep him moving, distracted.
{14906}{14959}I'll get on the phone here,|get to the bottom of this.
{14961}{14986}I'm not that worried.
{14988}{15020}- What?|- No, she's saying--
{15022}{15053}She's saying everything|is gonna be all right.
{15054}{15094}Of course|everything's gonna be all right.
{15095}{15139}- I'm not even worried.|- Liar.
{15141}{15178}Good-bye.
{16558}{16628}And you would really go live on a farm?
{16630}{16672}It's not a farm. It's a farmhouse.
{16674}{16764}Farmhouse--it's a house with land.
{16766}{16791}It's just a--you know...
{16793}{16863}it's something we've been talking about|for a while, and--and--
{16865}{16925}'Cause I don't know if we want the girls|to grow up in this city.
{16926}{16987}- I mean, is that--|- Well, the suburbs I could understand.
{16989}{17064}Yeah, but I just like|the idea of the country.
{17066}{17102}You know? It appeals to me.
{17104}{17159}You know, it's--it's safe, it's quiet.
{17161}{17197}I could do my writing there.
{17199}{17286}What does that mean, a farm?|You'd have like, what, chickens?
{17287}{17324}No, no, no. Not chickens.
{17326}{17355}It's not a farm. It's just--
{17357}{17390}Yeah, I mean,|you could grow stuff if you want.
{17391}{17444}You could grow tomatoes or corn|or something, I'm sure.
{17446}{17480}In upstate New York?
{17482}{17517}Yeah, you could--Why not?
{17519}{17584}Well, New Jersey has the fantastic corn.
{17586}{17638}All right, well, you know what?|The point isn't to grow corn--
{17640}{17686}New York is, I think,|maybe too cold for corn.
{17687}{17761}Forget I said corn. Drop the corn.|The point is the house.
{17762}{17800}You go, and it's a house|in the country, so--
{17802}{17858}- It sounds like a nice thing.|- Yeah, I understand.
{17860}{17892}Just a quiet place in the country.
{17894}{17953}Yeah, yeah. That's all.|A house in the country.
{17954}{18055}Well, you're not gonna buy it|without looking at it first, though, right?
{18057}{18141}What are we doing? We're going--|We're driving to go look at it, right?
{18143}{18202}'Cause, you know, you never know.
{18204}{18277}No, I know. I know.
{18357}{18391}So, what do you know?
{18393}{18449}I had a thought,|but no one wanted to hear it.
{18450}{18477}What?
{18478}{18523}Well, if she's that fed up|with your father...
{18525}{18631}wouldn't she maybe want to look up|an old boyfriend or something?
{18633}{18672}No.|That's my mother we're talking about.
{18674}{18718}I'm not saying|she had a lover or anything.
{18719}{18809}Please. Please. Whoever she's gonna|call is already married or dead.
{18810}{18857}I should just turn around and|come home right now, shouldn't I?
{18858}{18907}No, no. Let us look for her.
{18909}{18971}You're doing the best thing|for your dad right now.
{18973}{19032}- How's he doing?|- He's, you know...
{19034}{19106}I hit the sink thing!|It sprayed all over me!
{19108}{19139}What? What's happening?
{19141}{19170}- Uh...oy.|- How is he?
{19172}{19221}Damn sink sprayed me, but good.
{19223}{19250}Hon?
{19252}{19307}I don't know. He--
{19309}{19362}- He looks older.|- He is.
{19364}{19395}Who's that? Rachel?
{19397}{19426}- Yeah.|- Anything?
{19428}{19456}Nothing yet.
{19458}{19546}Hey, you know what?|Try and have fun with him today.
{19547}{19630}You always say|you never had time together, right?
{19632}{19693}So, maybe this is...the good thing.
{19694}{19748}All right. Here he comes. Gotta go.
{19750}{19787}OK, take it easy. I love you.
{19789}{19825}- Love you, too.|- All right.
{19974}{20043}So, it's OK?|You can take a day off like this?
{20045}{20110}Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just had|a magazine piece that was due.
{20112}{20171}I just turned that in yesterday,|so I'm good.
{20173}{20240}And your book? It's still, uh...
{20242}{20282}The book? No, no.|No, working on the book.
{20283}{20323}Still writing, yeah. But it's--
{20325}{20362}You know, listen,|three and a half years in...
{20364}{20436}and taking one afternoon off|is not gonna kill me.
{20438}{20496}You know, I went into the bookstore|in the mall.
{20498}{20525}- Oh, yeah, yeah?|- Yeah.
{20526}{20576}I thought I'd see|if they had your other book.
{20578}{20635}- Ha ha. OK. And?|- They don't.
{20637}{20695}They don't. Oh, well.|No, they don't carry everything.
{20697}{20754}The big stores--You know,|in the mall, they're not gonna--
{20756}{20819}You know who they have a lot of?|John Grisham.
{20821}{20896}My God. This guy--|one book after another, this guy!
{20898}{20954}He's fast. He's fast.
{21094}{21159}How'd you know it was me?
{21278}{21324}I think this is it.
{21326}{21387}- Wow.|- Plenty of room here.
{21389}{21449}Look at this!
{21450}{21499}Do you believe|this is all the same place?
{21501}{21561}Lot of mowing and pruning.
{21562}{21643}You're gonna have to get|one of those mowers with a chair on it.
{21645}{21707}Ha ha ha! Oh, wow.
{21709}{21750}So, this would be the driveway.
{21752}{21832}You hear that? Listen to that.|The pebbles against the tires.
{21834}{21876}- Gravel is good.|- Oh, yeah.
{21924}{21997}Oh, I like this. I like this.
{22044}{22082}Mr. Harrison?
{22084}{22146}That I am. Mr. Kleinman?
{22148}{22187}- Yes, sir!|- That's me.
{22189}{22234}Hi. Ben Kleinman.
{22235}{22260}Well, hello.
{22262}{22294}Hi. This is my father.
{22295}{22348}- Sam Kleinman. How are you?|- Pleasure.
{22350}{22390}You've got a spectacular place here.
{22392}{22438}- Thank you.|- Yes, sir.
{22480}{22548}Uh...oh, uh, I'll tell you...
{22550}{22628}why don't you two fellas talk,|and I'll just mosey around?
{22630}{22674}Terrific. Great. Thank you.
{22675}{22716}Well, shall I show you around?
{22718}{22774}Please. That would be just terrific.
{22775}{22822}How was your trip up? All right?
{22824}{22882}My great-grandmother's family...
{22883}{22933}gave her this land|on her eighteenth birthday.
{22935}{22964}Is that right? Huh.
{22966}{23036}And my great-grandfather|built the house with his own hands.
{23038}{23092}- Really?|- Right after the Civil War.
{23094}{23179}Wow. It's just--|It's a magical place.
{23181}{23224}It's important that you feel that way.
{23226}{23292}Oh, I do. I do. Heh.
{23628}{23696}My father and I|shot moose and wild boar...
{23698}{23742}just inside those woods over there.
{23744}{23777}Wow. Heh.
{23778}{23848}The moose are gone now, by and large.
{23850}{23916}Time marches on,|with or without our consent.
{23918}{23942}Hmm.
{23944}{23995}I will tell you this, though--
{23997}{24057}whoever lives here next...
{24058}{24157}will have the finest golden corner|of God's green earth.
{24158}{24218}Boy, you got some place here!
{24219}{24253}That lake? Ooh!
{24254}{24285}We've been very blessed.
{24286}{24349}Let me ask you something.|The septic tank--
{24350}{24394}what kind of system|did they put in here?
{24396}{24421}Do you know?
{24422}{24463}I beg your pardon?
{24465}{24525}I mean, it doesn't drain|right into the lake, does it?
{24526}{24592}Because I see the other houses|up on the hill there...
{24594}{24717}and I got to figure, if all that's draining|into your water--oh, boy.
{24718}{24866}Come the hot weather,|this place is gonna stink to high hell.
{25060}{25099}Let me tell you something.
{25101}{25202}If a guy is selling you a house,|and he don't want you to ask questions...
{25203}{25245}you don't want the house.
{25246}{25283}- Right.|- Am I wrong?
{25285}{25317}No. I'm saying--you're right.
{25318}{25375}Your old man is not as dumb|as you think, you know.
{25377}{25423}Your mother and I,|we looked at a house once.
{25425}{25457}I know. Lakewood.
{25458}{25503}Lakewood, New Jersey. That's right.
{25505}{25568}We got the money into escrow,|we run an inspection...
{25570}{25602}what do we find?
{25603}{25629}Rats.
{25630}{25693}You'd better believe it.|Floor to ceiling.
{25694}{25732}The place was infested.
{25734}{25814}So believe me,|there is always a reason.
{25816}{25887}- Always.|- You're darn tootin'.
{25889}{25948}- There's always a reason.|- Right.
{25950}{26014}- And there's never not a reason.|- What?
{26016}{26106}Right? So, what you're saying is,|there really--there is no house...
{26107}{26171}that anyone could buy anywhere, ever.
{26173}{26199}- What?|- Right?
{26201}{26270}I mean, all over the world.|All over the world, no matter where...
{26271}{26316}no matter when,|there just is no house...
{26318}{26353}that anybody should buy,|you're saying...
{26354}{26392}because it--it's always a trick.
{26394}{26430}There's always some kind of scam.
{26432}{26498}- What are you talking about?|- So, therefore--therefore, what?
{26500}{26531}Don't even try?
{26533}{26578}Try what? I don't know|what you're saying now.
{26580}{26638}That's your big plan,|is don't have a dream...
{26640}{26702}'cause if you have a dream,|it'll only turn to shit.
{26704}{26741}Yeah, just leave things how they are.
{26742}{26813}We'll leave things how they are--nice--|and then wait till it's too late.
{26814}{26843}Till what's too late?
{26845}{26890}Yeah, just wait|till everybody's dead, right?
{26892}{26946}What are you gettin' so upset about?
{26947}{27002}- OK, that's why Mom left.|- Why?
{27004}{27038}You want to know why? Because of this.
{27040}{27115}- Because of what?|- Because of this. Because of you.
{27117}{27174}You got a reason not to do everything.
{27176}{27243}Whatever it is, there's a reason--|''No, you can't do that.''
{27245}{27282}She wanted a house in the country...
{27284}{27353}but you said, ''No, the kids are too little.''|Right? And then, all of a sudden...
{27354}{27422}''No, the kids are grown up.|We don't need a house in the country.''
{27423}{27491}She wanted to travel, but no--|''This place is too far.
{27493}{27538}That place, it's not far enough.''
{27539}{27634}Right? ''The winter-- it's too cold.|The summer--it's so crowded there.
{27635}{27663}The spring--it's rainy.''
{27665}{27740}Whatever it is. But you know what?|Somebody goes to these places!
{27742}{27786}Somebody's buying|these houses in the country!
{27787}{27873}So I gotta think|it can't be that fucking horrible!
{27874}{27916}You know, you're talkin' out of your ass--
{27918}{27963}Oh, am I? Yeah, OK.
{27965}{28020}When you're married forty years,|come talk to me.
{28022}{28098}Please. It's not the forty years.|It was always like this. You know that.
{28100}{28127}- Oh, really?|- Yes, yes.
{28129}{28178}It was like this before I was born.
{28180}{28261}How do you know what the hell|things were like before you were born?
{28262}{28322}I--I--Just trust me, I know. I know.
{28323}{28357}- You know?|- Yes, I know.
{28358}{28425}Well, I'm telling you you don't know|what you're talking about.
{28426}{28460}Oh, OK.|I don't know what I'm talking about?
{28462}{28486}- Do me a favor.|- Really?
{28488}{28551}Why don't you close your mouth|and drive me back to the city?
{28553}{28577}I don't know what I'm talking about?
{28578}{28613}Good. Now, let me|show you something.
{28614}{28677}Let's take a look.|Let's see how much I don't know.
{28679}{28725}Keep your eye on the road!|Watch where you're driving!
{28726}{28752}I want you to see something.
{28754}{28818}- Hey. Hey! Jesus!|- Shit!
{29013}{29078}Whew. You all right?
{29080}{29105}Yeah.
{29107}{29174}Yeah. You OK?
{29176}{29218}I'm fine.
{29644}{29678}Jesus.
{29706}{29734}Oh, boy.
{29821}{29849}That's good.
{29850}{29892}Hey.
{29894}{29963}A new car you can always get.
{30011}{30046}I'm sorry.
{30118}{30198}So, what were you gonna show me?
{30199}{30230}Nothing.
{30232}{30331}Now you got my attention. Heh.
{30469}{30506}OK.
{30942}{30968}What's this?
{30970}{31005}It's for you.
{31006}{31036}From you?
{31038}{31079}It's from Mom.
{31081}{31135}What, she's leaving me again now?
{31137}{31185}It was so much fun the first time?
{31230}{31337}She wrote this--She wrote this|the year I was born.
{31338}{31410}She wrote it,|but she never gave it to you.
{31412}{31445}So, how did you get it?
{31446}{31510}When I was fourteen, I was digging|around in her nightstand drawer.
{31512}{31540}I was gonna steal a cigarette.
{31542}{31575}Your mother doesn't smoke.
{31577}{31646}Not smoke smoke,|but she used to--once in a while.
{31648}{31727}She had the same pack of Newport Lights|in there for seven years.
{31729}{31801}I never knew your mother smoked.
{31802}{31844}Well, there you go.
{31846}{31881}So, you took this?
{31882}{31969}Yeah. I still don't know|if she ever noticed it was gone.
{31970}{32024}And you keep this in the car?
{32055}{32107}No. I don't keep it in the c--
{32109}{32185}I dug it up to show it to you,|because I thought--
{32186}{32272}'Cause I--I don't know why.|Because I figured it was time.
{32340}{32382}''March 18--''
{32412}{32514}But that's two weeks|before you were born.
{32628}{32666}Why...
{32693}{32735}Just read.
{32890}{32928}Sam...
{32930}{32995}this is the letter that should|be pinned to a pillow...
{32997}{33127}explaining why the wife has run off|and left her husband.
{33129}{33189}But I have nobody to run off with...
{33190}{33221}nor can I run off.
{33222}{33341}Apparently, my life isn't even|my own to do away with.
{33377}{33461}In my heart,|I must take leave of you now...
{33462}{33566}because unless I disentangle myself|from you emotionally...
{33568}{33639}I'll never be a fit mother for our children.
{33673}{33765}I don't think you could measure|all the tears I've shed.
{33766}{33805}When I've needed you most...
{33807}{33917}you have found it more pressing|to be anywhere else but with me.
{33948}{33997}But I know it wasn't always so.
{33999}{34073}I know the world|was once vibrant with promise.
{34074}{34186}After all, wasn't I the girl,|fresh out of college...
{34188}{34250}who got the job at the very first|interview she ever had?
{34306}{34414}So what if I cancelled my plans|to go see the World's Fair in Queens?
{34416}{34478}I was working in Manhattan...
{34480}{34555}and making $1 3 a week to boot.
{34557}{34657}And how thrilling that you,|a handsome young boss...
{34658}{34706}were interested in me.
{34798}{34831}When you went in the army...
{34833}{34910}I did everything I could|to keep that office running...
{34911}{34974}because I was sure|this was the way to your heart.
{35008}{35088}How all the more humiliating|it was for me, then...
{35090}{35145}to watch you spend|your weekend furloughs...
{35146}{35200}catching up on business...
{35202}{35268}while I got the final fifteen minutes|at Penn Station...
{35270}{35314}before you shipped out again.
{35370}{35457}I must have loved you an awful lot|to have been so hurt.
{35486}{35547}In fact, sometimes I almost wish...
{35549}{35595}you would have yourself|a love affair...
{35597}{35668}so that you would know|how the heart can be affected.
{35698}{35787}Oh, I guess you loved me|in your way...
{35789}{35844}as part of the whole picture--
{35846}{35926}a comfortable life taken for granted.
{35997}{36086}But believe me, it's not enough.
{36088}{36165}Maybe it's all I'm meant to get...
{36166}{36305}but, please, don't let anybody|ever treat our girls this way.
{36364}{36447}From here on,|I'll stop hoping you'll change.
{36490}{36570}I won't expect evenings|to be different from each other...
{36571}{36634}nor weekends different from workdays.
{36636}{36685}I won't expect anything anymore.
{36686}{36781}But you have destroyed a marriage.
{36870}{37013}P.S.: Congratulations.|You finally have your son.
{37014}{37066}I hope he brings you much pleasure.
{37068}{37138}As for me, I'm glad he's here...
{37140}{37196}but I still miss your tenderness...
{37198}{37286}your thoughtfulness,|even your politeness.
{37288}{37391}I don't know if you have it in you,|but I yearn for it.
{37393}{37516}Maybe someday, when|you have nothing else on your mind.
{38048}{38086}Bullshit.
{38114}{38146}What?
{38147}{38192}Bullshit.
{38220}{38255}What do you mean, bullshit?
{38257}{38383}I'm saying that this is a crock of b-u-l-l--|bullshit!
{38385}{38457}That is not the way it was.
{38458}{38517}- How what was?|- All of it!
{38544}{38595}- Well--|- Bullshit!
{38597}{38635}You think it was like that?
{38637}{38716}I don't know what it was like,|but that's--that's what she wrote.
{38718}{38764}I mean, that's--that's what she felt.
{38766}{38817}That I'm a prick?
{38818}{38887}Your father is such a callous...
{38889}{38958}uncaring son of a bitch...
{38959}{39006}that he ruined the marriage...
{39008}{39078}that he made your mother|that miserable?
{39110}{39181}Let me tell you something,|sonny boy.
{39182}{39283}I busted my ass|building that business.
{39285}{39316}You're damn right.
{39318}{39415}You know what Crown Carpet was|when we started?
{39417}{39470}Two guys, a desk, and a clipboard.
{39472}{39498}That was it!
{39500}{39557}Did I have to stay at the office|late a lot?
{39558}{39598}You bet I did.
{39600}{39657}Did I have to travel|all over the goddamn place...
{39658}{39699}here and there,|drummin' up business?
{39701}{39733}You bet I did.
{39734}{39794}Because that's what had to be done!
{39838}{39886}So, did I miss out on a lot of nice things?
{39888}{39973}Yes, I missed out on a lot of nice things.
{39974}{40049}Does that make me uncaring?
{40051}{40103}A rotten husband?
{40105}{40159}A rotten father?
{40216}{40270}Crown Carpets fed you kids...
{40272}{40358}sent you to the best schools,|the best summer camps.
{40360}{40444}Who of your friends ever went away|to such nice places, huh?
{40446}{40532}Mexico, Puerto Rico that time...
{40534}{40601}Hershey, Pennsylvania.
{40602}{40670}Who was that for? For me?
{40671}{40772}I need to take a vacation|to see another factory?
{40774}{40825}To see how they make chocolate?
{40827}{40970}I don't give a shit how they make it,|but I went for you and for the family.
{40972}{41080}Don't you dare tell me|I wasn't there for you kids.
{41113}{41168}She never got to go to the World's Fair.
{41170}{41214}That's my fault.
{41216}{41246}Fifty years later.
{41247}{41330}You want to go to the World's Fair?|Go! Who's stopping you?
{41332}{41393}That I had an affair. Bullshit!
{41394}{41464}- No, she didn't say that you had an--|- Never!
{41466}{41494}- She said that--|- Never!
{41496}{41544}What she said was|she almost wishes you had.
{41546}{41613}She wishes I had.|What kind of craziness is that?
{41614}{41686}She wishes you had, so then|you would've known what--what it--
{41688}{41760}That is pure crazy shit.
{41762}{41860}Never so much as a dalliance.
{41862}{41918}Never.
{41994}{42057}The other fellas, yes.
{42059}{42133}I'm not saying|it's unheard of in the office.
{42135}{42175}I'm not an innocent.|Bernie Kaye--
{42177}{42231}you remember Bernie Kaye,|the sales rep?
{42233}{42332}Shtupped everything that moved|between Baltimore and Syracuse.
{42334}{42381}Legendary cocksman.
{42383}{42417}Boasted about it.
{42418}{42519}And his wife, by the way, adores him.
{42521}{42584}Thinks he's the greatest thing|since Ovaltine.
{42586}{42737}But me--me, who never once so much|as laid a finger on another woman...
{42738}{42848}me, your mother had to run away|from after 47 years...
{42850}{42956}because I'm such|an unconscionable prick.
{43072}{43111}Well, maybe|I shouldn't have shown you--
{43113}{43195}You're damn right|you shouldn't have shown me!
{43197}{43266}And look at your car!|You gonna call somebody to fix it?
{43268}{43341}- I'm gonna call--|- Or is it gonna fix by itself sitting there?
{43342}{43436}- I'm gonna call someone.|- Good, because I'm goddamn hungry now.
{43438}{43525}And aggravated. And I have to pee.
{43526}{43572}And you know what?
{43574}{43631}I'm gonna pee right here.
{43633}{43667}Go ahead.
{43669}{43712}You're damn right I'm goin' ahead!
{43714}{43819}And I don't need permission from you.
{43846}{43900}You hear that, everybody?!
{43902}{43978}Sam Kleinman, Fair Lawn, New Jersey...
{43980}{44068}and I'm gonna pee|wherever I goddamn please!
{44322}{44423}That really burns my ass.
{44425}{44482}I'm not polite?
{44484}{44543}Who's more polite than me?
{44575}{44619}Come on, tell me.
{44658}{44750}That really burns my ass.
{44982}{45026}You're lucky I heard the phone|when I did.
{45027}{45068}I was nearly halfway to my car.
{45070}{45115}We're closed for the night.
{45117}{45211}What do you mean, closed? But you're--|you're gonna fix this first, right?
{45213}{45309}My wife is making chicken paprikash,|and that is one dish I do not want to miss.
{45310}{45374}OK. All right, but can you just--|You know what?
{45376}{45428}If you can just get it|so I can drive it out of here--
{45430}{45481}Oh, there's no way|we can do anything tonight.
{45482}{45563}You come back in the morning.|I'll be here at the crack of 7:00.
{45565}{45625}Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.|I can't stay.
{45626}{45686}Come on.|You'll stay the night in a nice motel...
{45688}{45724}and you come back here|in the morning.
{45726}{45773}What do you say? Come on.
{45814}{45862}The official said North Korea|has massed--
{45863}{45944}No, we're fine, we're fine.|Just the car's not so fine.
{45946}{46014}Jeez, Benny. Don't hit trees with cars.
{46016}{46067}- I know.|- Trees always win.
{46069}{46124}Yeah, I know, I know.|How are my girls. They miss me?
{46126}{46156}You mean since breakfast?
{46158}{46213}Is that all I'm gone?|Jeez, it feels like a year.
{46214}{46351}I wonder if Tom Brokaw's wife is upset|because he's working late.
{46353}{46405}You see his phone ringing off the hook?
{46406}{46467}''Just wanted you to know|your dinner's cold...
{46469}{46525}and the children all agree|you're a shitheel.''
{46526}{46569}- You hearing this?|- Yeah.
{46570}{46618}Us that work and give and give and give!
{46620}{46705}- This--This is who I've created.|- A man has to say, ''That's it!
{46707}{46747}I'm not givin' any more!''
{46749}{46781}When "Nightly News" continues...
{46782}{46854}You go, Tom.|You do whatever you have to do.
{46856}{46932}- I'll wait right here for you.|- Wait, that's the other line. Hang on.
{46934}{47002}I'm not the kind of person who runs off|because he's bored...
{47004}{47054}because he needs to find himself.
{47056}{47158}You know where to find me, my friend--|exactly where I said I'd be.
{47159}{47271}That's right.|Right here, baby! Right here!
{47273}{47310}You want a grapefruit juice?
{47312}{47361}OK, your sisters|are like little detectives now.
{47362}{47389}Hang on.
{47390}{47420}- Are you there?|- I'm here.
{47422}{47476}- Hey, look at that.|- All right, where is Mom gonna go?
{47478}{47519}Where has she always wanted to go?
{47521}{47554}My first thought was France...
{47556}{47592}because, you know,|Dad never wanted to go there.
{47594}{47660}But then I thought, maybe California.
{47662}{47686}Why?
{47688}{47750}Well, you know those friends of hers--|the husband's a periodontist?
{47752}{47810}- The Schechners?|- Oh, the Schechners. That's it.
{47812}{47844}I could not think of their names.
{47846}{47881}She's gonna leave her husband|of 47 years...
{47883}{47916}to be with|Marty and Charlotte Schechner?
{47918}{47965}Well, it's possible, no?
{47966}{48008}Yeah, but she's always|talking about them.
{48010}{48063}Hold on a second. Hold on.|I got a call here.
{48092}{48179}So...how's the motel?
{48181}{48226}It's dark and smells like toast.
{48228}{48260}It's Hillary.|Should I try to put her on?
{48262}{48344}- How are you gonna put her on?|- Let me--Let me see. Did I lose you?
{48346}{48383}- I'm here.|- Are you guys still there?
{48385}{48433}- Still here.|- That's very impressive.
{48434}{48472}- Look at that.|- So, what do you got?
{48474}{48534}OK, listen to this.|I'm in Mom and Dad's house...
{48536}{48563}I'm in the kitchen.
{48565}{48686}I open up Mom's desk drawer--|big color travel brochure for Africa.
{48688}{48738}- Africa?|- Stop it.
{48740}{48813}I saw the brochure.|''Come, visit majestic Africa.''
{48814}{48866}And she's got, like,|safari prices circled.
{48868}{48910}Mom is not going to Africa.
{48912}{48961}You see,|I think I have to agree with that one.
{48962}{49007}Well, I talked to Bonnie,|and she doesn't believe...
{49009}{49054}Mom would actually leave the country.
{49056}{49110}Thinks she probably went|to a spa or something.
{49112}{49137}Like, maybe Florida.
{49138}{49178}OK, good. So, Paris, Kenya...
{49180}{49231}and Boca Raton|we got it narrowed down to.
{49233}{49313}Nobody's going to Boca Raton|this time of the year.
{49314}{49355}It's 1 30 degrees there.
{49401}{49430}What?
{49478}{49533}OK, somebody just shoot me,|would you?
{50145}{50219}Oh ho ho! That tree jumped out|and bit you pretty good! Ha ha ha!
{50221}{50303}Listen, is there a--is there a car rental|place anywhere nearby?
{50305}{50335}- Uh...|- Huh?
{50337}{50365}- Rental car.|- Rental car?
{50367}{50395}- Hmm.|- Car rental?
{50397}{50470}- Hmm.|- A place where I can rent a car.
{50472}{50523}I know what it is.|I was just thinking.
{50525}{50549}I'm sorry.
{50550}{50594}Hmm. Mm-mm-mm.
{50595}{50685}Down in Emerson,|there's a car rental place.
{50686}{50714}Benny!
{50716}{50771}Uh, I think they're closed.
{50773}{50861}You can drive in the other direction,|you go down to Pachaqua.
{50863}{50923}I don't think they have|a car rental there.
{50925}{50993}- Let me think. I'm just thinking.|- Benny, come here!
{50994}{51024}I want to show you something!
{51026}{51080}- I--I--|- Jesus.
{51082}{51117}It'll come to me.
{51119}{51181}This is not a thriving metropolis,|I'll tell you that.
{51182}{51233}- There's a chicken place.|- you know what this is?
{51258}{51358}This is a 1936 Ford.|Deluxe, it was called.
{51360}{51408}Did you ever hear of Pachaqua?
{51410}{51493}No. You know when the last time|I saw one of these?
{51495}{51528}I was in college.
{51530}{51592}I'm talkin' fifty-something years ago.
{51594}{51658}I actually put down money|on a used one once--
{51660}{51731}$300, which was a fortune back then.
{51733}{51805}But my father,|he made me give it back.
{51833}{51869}How come?
{51870}{51928}You know, too flashy,|too much distraction.
{51930}{51966}Who knows?
{51968}{52059}What, you think you're the first one|who didn't understand his father?
{52092}{52141}But, boy, is this beautiful.
{52143}{52199}Look at that grill.
{52201}{52267}Is that gorgeous or what?
{52269}{52329}- You've got a good eye, sir!|- That's not a '36.
{52331}{52362}This is a '40! Am I right?!
{52363}{52417}That's right! A connoisseur, huh?
{52418}{52499}I restored it myself! Rides like a dream!
{52501}{52530}You don't say?
{52532}{52610}If you're interested, make me an offer.
{52745}{52804}I'm gonna do just that!
{52806}{52859}You're gonna do what?
{52861}{52929}I'm gonna buy me a Ford Deluxe.
{52930}{52970}You're gonna--You're gonna buy it?
{52972}{53076}Why not? Your car's all banged to shit.|We're in the middle of nowhere.
{53078}{53133}Excuse me! Do you take Visa?
{53134}{53181}Why--No, you can't just buy it!
{53182}{53234}You don't know anything about this car.
{53236}{53280}You don't--You don't know|how fast it goes.
{53282}{53363}What's the hurry? I got no place to be.|You got some place to be?
{53365}{53437}Don't you think we should get home|and see what's going on?
{53438}{53527}See what? Your sisters are there.|They can make phone calls without you.
{53578}{53608}I have work.
{53610}{53686}Hey, you're the one|that wants to go write in the country.
{53688}{53729}How much more country do you need?
{53757}{53824}Your mother,|she ran off to God knows where.
{53826}{53869}Your father's inconsolable.
{53870}{53930}So console me. Am I asking a lot?
{53931}{53993}- No, it's not that. It's just--|- So call home.
{53994}{54082}You'll tell 'em you'll be back|as soon as your old man finds himself.
{54084}{54133}If you want, we could find you, too.
{54134}{54193}We could look for|the whole goddamn family.
{54194}{54291}It makes no difference to me.|I got a car.
{54293}{54346}So, what do you--what do you suggest?
{54348}{54421}We make a trip. You and me.
{54477}{54553}You want to check with your wife?
{54554}{54622}I don't have to check with my wife.
{54624}{54655}So?
{54657}{54707}So?
{54804}{54845}OK, buy the car.
{55130}{55196}Oh, yeah. This car rides like a dream.
{55198}{55235}Mmm.
{55237}{55280}You smell that leather?
{55282}{55309}I do.
{55311}{55364}You see, it still has the old smell.
{55366}{55396}Why that is, I don't know.
{55398}{55509}You would think, fifty years,|it would lose the smell, but there it is--
{55511}{55608}that good Ford smell.
{55610}{55676}You know,|he was a big anti-Semite, Ford.
{55678}{55711}You've mentioned this, yes.
{55713}{55772}Yeah, but he made some beautiful cars.
{55774}{55806}Yes, he did.
{55888}{55925}You know,|your mother hates the way I drive.
{55927}{55957}I know, I know.
{55958}{56030}''You're driving too fast,''|''There's a curb there.''
{56032}{56081}- I understand. Hey, listen.|- ''That was a stop sign.''
{56083}{56121}OK, hey, believe me,|I've driven with you two.
{56123}{56146}It's not a picnic, by the way.
{56148}{56202}Now let me ask you. You're sitting there.
{56203}{56274}- What?|- Am I such a terrible driver?
{56276}{56315}No, you're not. Look at the road.
{56317}{56347}Thank you.
{56378}{56436}Oh, I love this car.
{56438}{56539}The first one of these I saw,|this kid at school had one.
{56541}{56676}Went out with this gorgeous girl,|Marion Savara.
{56678}{56737}Her name I remember.
{56738}{56810}- My God, what a knockout.|- Yeah?
{56812}{56906}He would pull up in this big shiny car,|open her door...
{56908}{56974}and out would come these legs.
{56976}{57038}- Marion Savara.|- Marion Savara.
{57066}{57117}I danced with her once.
{57119}{57159}That was about it.
{57161}{57209}You know why?|You didn't have this car then.
{57210}{57293}You're exactly right.|You see, everybody's got something.
{57295}{57351}Your mother never got|to the World's Fair.
{57353}{57425}I never got a shot at Marion Savara.
{57426}{57458}What are you going to do?
{57460}{57495}What are you going to do?
{57651}{57691}Look at us.
{57693}{57781}Wherever we want,|whenever we want, huh?
{57782}{57806}Ha ha ha.
{57909}{57950}Did you ever do this with your dad?
{57951}{57994}My dad? Never.
{57995}{58042}- No?|- No, no, no, no.
{58044}{58141}My dad worked.|That's all he knew--work.
{58142}{58208}- And did you resent that?|- Oh, here we go.
{58210}{58259}No, no, no. No, no, no.|I wasn't saying anything.
{58261}{58292}Resent him?|What do you mean, resent?
{58294}{58353}No, I didn't resent him.|That's the way it was.
{58354}{58403}- He was my father.|- Yeah, I know.
{58405}{58441}Why? Do you resent me?
{58443}{58478}No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
{58480}{58553}Because, you know,|we never did this before today, either.
{58554}{58602}No, I know. Of course. I just...
{58604}{58697}It's just something I think about|all the time now with my kids.
{58698}{58742}They're growing up,|and I'm always thinking...
{58743}{58820}you know,|what are they going to remember?
{58822}{58854}Are we going to take them places--
{58855}{58928}Are we going to do things|that they wished we didn't do...
{58930}{58983}or are there going to be things|we didn't do...
{58985}{59067}that they're going to grow up and say,|''Hey, how come we never did that?''
{59069}{59132}You know?
{59134}{59205}Is this what you do in therapy?
{59206}{59260}No, no, no, no. It's--None of it--
{59262}{59298}What is it that we didn't do?
{59300}{59344}- Who?|- Me...with you and the girls.
{59346}{59392}- No, you--|- What did we forget to do?
{59394}{59462}- No, nothing. We didn't forget.|- No, I'm curious.
{59464}{59529}I don't know. We...|We never went camping.
{59530}{59574}Camping?|Who the hell goes camping?
{59576}{59630}Sleep outside and crap in a bush?
{59632}{59684}All right, well, then|we'll forget about that.
{59686}{59725}Oh, sorry. I thought--No.
{59727}{59778}No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just--
{59780}{59822}- I wasn't making a joke.|- It's not important.
{59824}{59867}You always picture|fathers and sons, right?
{59869}{59917}That's the thing you're supposed to do.
{59918}{60015}You go camping together|and fishing at the fishing hole.
{60017}{60081}OK. Come on.
{60082}{60114}What are--What are you doing?
{60116}{60150}What are you doing?
{60151}{60223}I don't want you to resent|we never fished.
{60426}{60496}- Here.|- No, that's part of the feather.
{60498}{60535}- What?|- That's decoration.
{60537}{60590}Mmm, I think you're wrong.
{60592}{60623}- Oh.|- See? It dangles down.
{60625}{60702}Oh, my God. You know,|there's a lot of pockets here.
{60704}{60751}- Here.|- OK, now look.
{60753}{60778}You see? It goes right there.
{60780}{60805}- There?|- Yeah.
{60806}{60854}- Right--Right there?|- Yes.
{60855}{60914}- That's not the hole.|- What do you mean, it's not the hole?
{60915}{60940}- There's got to be a thing where you...|- Yes, it is.
{60942}{60969}- Of course.|- Wait a minute.
{60971}{61000}Where does the worm go?
{61002}{61052}There's no worms.|This is instead of worms.
{61054}{61082}They forgot the worms?
{61084}{61126}They didn't forget.|This is better than worms.
{61128}{61181}Worms is the old--|This is what they do now.
{61182}{61211}Oh, no worms.
{61213}{61274}Yeah. Remember the guy told us?|You almost never use worms.
{61276}{61337}- How about this here? That's big.|- Oh?
{61338}{61388}The bigger the thing,|the bigger the fish, no?
{61390}{61444}Hmm?|What if a little fish swallows it?
{61446}{61508}- It could choke. See? I--|- Wait. Does a fish smell?
{61510}{61597}They don't smell it, they see it.|How could they smell under the water?
{61599}{61642}I don't know.
{61643}{61698}The--Under the water don't smell?
{61700}{61750}What? Here, hold this.
{61752}{61791}Uh-huh.
{61793}{61833}All right.
{61835}{61873}- See, I just got--|- Oh, boy.
{61875}{61909}No, no, no. I just got to put--Ow.
{61910}{61973}- Oh, boy.|- All right, hold on.
{61975}{62003}- Oh, boy.|- OK.
{62937}{62981}Anything?
{62982}{63030}- Nothing.|- All right.
{63032}{63093}So, this is what it is.
{63126}{63166}- I guess.|- Yeah.
{63279}{63332}- Oh, my God.|- What?
{63334}{63403}I think you just shot the first three bars|of "Moonlight in Vermont" there.
{63405}{63438}There's nobody here.
{63440}{63484}Who am I bothering?
{63624}{63658}How are your toes?
{63659}{63707}Not bad.
{63790}{63847}Oh, I think I actually|got something here.
{63849}{63875}Hold him up. Hold still.
{63877}{63906}- Huh?|- Hold still.
{63908}{63953}What--What are you doing?
{63954}{64008}- He's still alive.|- Of course he's still alive.
{64010}{64034}I just pulled him out of--|What are you hitting him for?
{64036}{64062}I'm not hitting him.
{64064}{64102}Yeah, you just smacked--|Why would you hit a fish?
{64104}{64138}Poor thing can't breathe.
{64140}{64166}Oh, what, and you think hitting him's|going to help him?
{64168}{64228}- Give me the thing. Give me the thing.|- Don't--Don't hit him.
{64230}{64289}- Don't--Don't hurt it.|- I'll let him catch his breath a little.
{64290}{64318}- What?|- Not his breath...
{64320}{64368}but you know what I mean.
{64370}{64429}Yeah, little fishy. You want to go, huh?
{64430}{64478}You want to go? Go ahead.
{64480}{64517}We were just kidding.
{64693}{64749}- You had enough fishing?|- I could be done.
{65821}{65883}Huh? Yeah, he's--he's all right, actually.
{65885}{65915}I'm better than all right.
{65917}{65969}This is the best I've been|since I don't know when.
{65970}{66015}Your mother|should leave me more often.
{66017}{66044}Mom should leave him|more often, he said.
{66046}{66109}Why do you keep saying|what I'm saying? Let me talk.
{66111}{66180}All right, he wants to talk to you.|I don't know.
{66182}{66215}Hello, sweetheart.
{66217}{66313}Listen, if your husband doesn't|check in every 45 minutes...
{66314}{66397}you won't be beside yourself|with worry.
{66398}{66456}I agree with you 100%.
{66458}{66534}Ha ha ha. All right. Bye-bye.
{66536}{66567}And what?
{66569}{66614}She's a very sweet girl, your wife.
{66616}{66665}Agree what?|What'd she just say to you?
{66666}{66722}She said you can be|quite a pain in the ass...
{66723}{66783}and I shouldn't take it personal.
{66785}{66817}So sweet.
{67182}{67230}Wait a minute, wait a minute.|Listen to you.
{67231}{67291}Now, the point is,|if a person is determined...
{67293}{67345}to be unhappy|and angry their whole life...
{67347}{67402}then you know what?|That's their problem.
{67404}{67461}- Jeez, Pop.|- What?
{67462}{67538}So, if Mom was unhappy,|you didn't care?
{67540}{67586}I never said I didn't care.
{67588}{67637}You just said, if she's unhappy,|that's her problem.
{67639}{67713}- That's her problem, that's right.|- OK.
{67714}{67780}- What? So I'm the schmuck?|- No, but--
{67782}{67849}No, it's my fault.|She's unhappy because of me, right?
{67850}{67895}- No, I didn't say that.|- Well, that's what you think.
{67897}{67937}- No. No, I'm not saying that.|- Yes, it is.
{67938}{67978}- Come on, that's what you think.|- No, but I--
{67980}{68053}Well, I'm going to tell you something now|that I never said before.
{68054}{68141}I think she was unhappy already|when I met her.
{68142}{68181}That's right.
{68182}{68245}And all the time before that,|growing up.
{68246}{68310}I think she was an unhappy girl.
{68312}{68369}Remember her father?
{68370}{68426}- No. He--He was--He died.|- Oh, yeah, of course.
{68428}{68525}Yeah. Well, he was|a real sourpuss of a guy.
{68526}{68579}Nice enough, but a sourpuss.
{68581}{68628}And your grandmother, well...
{68630}{68699}she wasn't the cheeriest person|in the world, either.
{68701}{68757}I'm not saying|they didn't have problems...
{68758}{68873}but it was not a happy house.
{68874}{68946}And your mother, by the time|she set out into the world...
{68948}{69037}she already had this, I don't know...
{69039}{69158}I just never got the impression|she was ever happy.
{69287}{69339}Well, maybe that explains...
{69341}{69395}why she wanted so much|to be happy with you.
{69397}{69461}- OK. OK.|- Huh?
{69462}{69498}But, listen.
{69499}{69542}I was in the same marriage...
{69543}{69601}and I was happy.
{69602}{69652}Yes, you were happy,|but that's the point.
{69654}{69685}Well, the point is, see...
{69686}{69727}if you had made just, like,|a little more of an effort--
{69729}{69781}Oh, peaches.
{69873}{69938}Oh, my God. That's a peach.
{69940}{69983}You're really not going to try one?
{69985}{70026}Can't. Allergic.
{70028}{70064}Still?
{70066}{70138}So juicy and sweet.
{70140}{70166}What do they do to them?
{70168}{70213}Nothing.|They just picked it, so it's fresh.
{70214}{70239}Is that what it is?
{70241}{70285}Excuse me!
{70286}{70374}- This peach came off that tree?|- Uh-huh.
{70376}{70408}How do you like that?
{70410}{70477}They picked it there,|they put it in a bushel.
{70478}{70534}Bang! We're eating peaches.
{70535}{70633}No middleman, no messing around.|Fantastic.
{70635}{70707}- How can you still be allergic?|- How? I don't know.
{70709}{70755}- Try it!|- I wish I could. It makes my ears itch.
{70757}{70797}When's the last time you tried it?
{70798}{70854}- 1972.|- Oh, for God's sake.
{70855}{70913}People outgrow allergies, you know.|Try it.
{70914}{70938}- Nah.|- One bite!
{70940}{70998}- I'm afraid I'll get that--|- You don't know what you're missing.
{71000}{71029}- Try it.|- I--
{71030}{71088}Here, here. Take a bite.
{71090}{71137}Go ahead.
{71138}{71185}- Oh, my God.|- You see what I'm saying?
{71186}{71261}Live a little.|It's fresh. They just picked it.
{71262}{71310}Boy, that's good.
{71312}{71348}You see, if your mother were here,|she'd say...
{71350}{71412}''Sam, you've had enough.|Two peaches are plenty.''
{71414}{71450}But you know what?
{71452}{71493}I'm having another one.
{71494}{71534}What do you think of that?
{71600}{71666}Really, I wouldn't have believed it.
{71668}{71719}How can you have allergies?
{71721}{71809}Nobody has allergies|when I'm the father.
{71810}{71875}I don't have 'em.|Your sisters don't have 'em.
{71962}{72013}All right, all right.
{72014}{72098}No need to get snippy.
{72100}{72165}Here we go.|''For relief of watery eyes...
{72166}{72220}scratchy throat,|and other hay fever symptoms.''
{72222}{72256}But your eyes,|they aren't watery, are they?
{72258}{72295}It's all right. I'll be fine.
{72297}{72323}I wouldn't have believed it.
{72325}{72415}Have you ever heard of a grown man|allergic to a peach?
{72417}{72480}- You folks from around here?|- Nah, just passing through.
{72482}{72541}- Business?|- Uh, business? No. Pleasure.
{72543}{72593}You know, a little fishing.
{72594}{72641}Hey, you folks want free tickets|to the big game?
{72642}{72669}What game?
{72890}{72970}It's a beautiful day,|so what do you say?
{72972}{73018}Let's play some ball.
{73019}{73082}These are the best seats|I've ever had for anything.
{73084}{73154}Batting next for the Saw Bellies...
{73156}{73266}number 22,|Ramon Espencela.
{73268}{73321}Ramon Espencela.
{73323}{73402}- Yeah, now, there's a name for you.|- Ramon!
{73404}{73446}What?
{73486}{73556}Sorry. No.|I wasn't talking to you, I was just...
{73558}{73634}Go--Go ahead. Sorry.
{73636}{73682}This is a very small stadium.
{73762}{73846}- And don't forget, folks...|- Oop. Oop. OK.
{73848}{73888}- Go, Saw Bellies!|- Yes.
{73928}{74016}Go, Saw Bellies.
{74018}{74085}- Explain that to me.|- What?
{74086}{74150}- The holes in those jeans.|- Uh-huh.
{74152}{74203}- They're on purpose?|- That's right.
{74205}{74265}- It's not because she's poor...|- Mm-mmm.
{74266}{74298}and can only afford ripped clothing.
{74300}{74346}That's correct, sir.
{74348}{74451}And she doesn't mind that we can|see her ass peeking out like that?
{74453}{74494}No, she does not. In fact...
{74496}{74552}I think she would be insulted|if you didn't look.
{74554}{74649}The last thing I want to do is insult.
{74730}{74817}Top of the fifteenth inning,|still scoreless.
{74892}{74942}- Short pop fly...|- Run it out!
{74944}{74985}Come on, run it out!
{74986}{75034}Oh, come on!|A little hustle on the bases!
{75035}{75105}I say always run it out.|You never know.
{75106}{75163}You are right. Do you boys|want a coke or something?
{75165}{75220}- No, no. We're good, thanks.|- No, thanks.
{75222}{75279}- You sure?|- Yeah, but thank you very much.
{75281}{75312}Yes, that's all right, too.
{75358}{75391}Boy.
{75393}{75484}Boy, she almost took an eye out|with those things.
{75486}{75564}Ha ha. How old is a girl like that?
{75566}{75622}I don't know--23, 24.
{75623}{75651}What, are you interested?
{75653}{75686}No, I just can't tell anymore.
{75688}{75792}You reach a certain age,|you can't tell how old young people are.
{75794}{75847}If you said she was twelve,|I'd have believed you.
{75849}{75893}She's not twelve.
{75894}{75921}I can't tell.
{75922}{75966}Yeah.|All right, but you're still looking.
{75967}{76010}That's good.|I'm glad to see you're still looking.
{76012}{76091}You can always look.|Listen, you could be a diabetic.
{76093}{76205}You see a cake, you can still go,|''That's a nice cake.
{76207}{76264}Look how nice,|the frosting around the edge.''
{76266}{76333}The frosting on the bottom.|You like that.
{76334}{76378}There's a hot grounder.
{76380}{76414}Yeah.
{76416}{76470}Beautiful! Yeah!
{76472}{76506}Go! Whoo!
{76507}{76542}There he goes!
{76544}{76581}Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
{76582}{76651}Yay! 47!
{76653}{76681}- Yeah!|- Beautiful.
{76682}{76716}- Who's 47?|- 47.
{76718}{76765}47 is Albanis.
{76766}{76814}Albanis! Beautiful, baby!
{76816}{76845}All right, Albanis!
{76846}{76870}And just a reminder...
{76871}{76946}this Friday night is kiddies' night|at Baby's Steak and Claw.
{76948}{77013}I have to ask.|Are you two father and son?
{77014}{77059}Well, how do you know|we're not brothers?
{77061}{77115}Well, I just think|you two are so sweet.
{77117}{77190}- Ah, you're nice.|- Well, good luck to you.
{77192}{77221}Ooh.
{77274}{77346}OK, she's not twelve.
{77384}{77455}You play the Fender,|and I'll play the toms...
{77459}{77524}OK, so you're young,|you're attracted to each other...
{77526}{77567}but, like, when did it get romantic...
{77569}{77641}Romantic? Who, with Ma?
{77642}{77702}No, the girl with the tits.|Yes, with Ma.
{77704}{77774}When did you start, like, going out?
{77776}{77825}I don't know if we did.
{77827}{77873}Somebody did something.
{77874}{77954}All right, let me think. Uh...
{77956}{78019}Gee, I don't remember.
{78021}{78146}I used to drive her home sometimes,|because she lived not too far from me.
{78148}{78191}She told me the first time|you ever kissed...
{78193}{78218}was in the car dropping her off.
{78220}{78303}Oh, she did?|Well, then she must be right.
{78305}{78416}Yeah, but she--So, OK.|So, what happens after that?
{78418}{78467}So, you--|What, you're dropping her off...
{78469}{78507}and you're making out in the car,|whatever.
{78509}{78536}Yeah.
{78538}{78585}So, did you guys sleep together|before you were married?
{78586}{78636}- Hey!|- What? That's too far. I went too far.
{78638}{78665}- I'm your father.|- All right.
{78666}{78768}- Hey, you don't ask things like that.|- But, hey, you weren't my father then.
{78770}{78811}See, at that point,|you're just a young guy...
{78813}{78856}so I'm asking you as a guy.
{78858}{78924}- As a guy?|- That's all. As a guy.
{78926}{78974}Well, let me think about that.
{78976}{79041}Um...hmm.
{79069}{79149}The first time that|I ever slept with your mother...
{79150}{79277}was in a hotel|on Lexington Avenue after work.
{79278}{79317}A hotel?
{79319}{79403}The Thorgeson--55th and Lex.
{79405}{79445}Gone now.
{79446}{79492}Really?
{79494}{79545}So--So--So...
{79547}{79609}After work, and you just get a room,|and then, like that?
{79610}{79712}Well, you--you got to start somewhere.
{79714}{79758}Jeez.
{79760}{79794}What's the matter?
{79796}{79832}No, that's just...
{79834}{79892}Nothing.|It's just not how I ever pictured it.
{79894}{79940}Not that I ever pictured it.
{79942}{80065}Oh, yeah.|It was a nice hotel--all quiet.
{80066}{80134}And we had a little wine...
{80136}{80217}and we had a little music on the radio.
{80218}{80298}And your mother, she had a little...
{80299}{80339}Well, it was like a nightie--
{80341}{80419}pink, silky...
{80421}{80465}little strings up here.
{80466}{80574}Short, but, you know, not too short--
{80576}{80675}like, uh, mid-thigh.
{80777}{80839}See, I can't tell|if you're bullshitting me or not.
{80841}{80918}Of course you can't.|That's the whole purpose of bullshit.
{80997}{81058}Baby, whoa, baby
{81060}{81119}Let's boogaloo|down Broad, Broadway
{81121}{81169}Yeah, funky Broadway
{81170}{81229}Baby, oh, baby
{81230}{81299}Let's boogaloo|down Broad, Broadway
{81301}{81327}Yeah, funky Broadway
{81329}{81400}- Ah, that feels better.|- Yeah.
{81402}{81453}Oh, God.
{81454}{81516}We're gonna boogaloo
{81518}{81571}- Ohh.|- What's the matter?
{81573}{81636}I think they got this carpeting from us.
{81638}{81696}- What?|- How do you like that?
{81698}{81780}Fiesta cranberry, it's called.|Couldn't keep it in stock.
{81782}{81833}That's how popular it was.
{81835}{81917}OK, don't--don't do that.
{81918}{81942}Baby
{81943}{81981}What? You don't listen to me.
{81982}{82045}Hey, you guys are up.
{82046}{82102}Oh, no, we weren't waiting.|I was just watching.
{82104}{82150}- Let's play.|- What?
{82152}{82211}- Let's play a little.|- What, are you kidding?
{82213}{82247}I've never seen you play pool|in my whole life.
{82249}{82319}No, but before you,|I could play pretty good.
{82321}{82393}You want to rack them up?
{82394}{82444}Yeah.
{82533}{82602}And that's not playing|in forty-whatever years.
{82603}{82690}Well, now, court is in session, baby
{82692}{82767}And my heart is the one on trial
{82769}{82875}Ah, court is in session, baby
{82877}{82909}Hey, good.
{82910}{82934}And my heart is the one on trial
{82935}{82995}There we go.|There you go, Sparky.
{82997}{83056}- Me? No. I don't drink beer.|- Try one.
{83058}{83091}- No. The bubbles.|- Hey.
{83093}{83119}They go up.
{83121}{83176}Hey, I ate the frickin' peach.
{83209}{83238}Huh?
{83240}{83296}Can you deliver me|a verdict?
{83298}{83338}Not so terrible.
{83340}{83398}Oh, for God's sake.
{83400}{83429}I got no more other time
{83431}{83471}Anyone feel like|playing for money?
{83473}{83550}No, no, no. We're not here|to play for monetary gain.
{83552}{83609}Nothing fancy. 10 bucks a game.
{83610}{83695}Kind offer, indeed, but I'm afraid|our evening has come to a close.
{83697}{83730}25 bucks a game?
{83731}{83802}Humble travelers are we|who've come from afar...
{83804}{83827}50 bucks.
{83829}{83884}to but pass through|your gracious village.
{83886}{83953}- 100 bucks a game.|- 100 bucks it is.
{83994}{84040}What are you doing? What are you doing?|You're playing for money now?
{84042}{84088}Not my money, his money.
{84221}{84297}Well, I just got back|to the city
{84298}{84380}I left|my country man behind
{84382}{84405}Don't give me|too many chances.
{84407}{84466}I'm ready, willing, and able
{84467}{84550}To give the city boys|all of my time
{84551}{84603}I got a whole lot|of brand new tricks
{84605}{84642}I'll give you that one.|I'm giving it to you.
{84644}{84703}Had a ball|back from the sticks
{84705}{84787}I wanna show you|what I learned
{84789}{84875}From the old-time|country hicks
{84877}{84946}I learned|a new kind of mambo
{84948}{85010}Oh!
{85012}{85047}Can I trouble you|for a cigarette?
{85049}{85165}I left mine in a poplin|zip-up jacket in 1961.
{85166}{85236}I learned|a new kind of mambo
{85263}{85334}And it just can't miss
{85336}{85413}They really did|that mambo right
{85414}{85467}'Cause they held me|good and tight
{85469}{85498}Oh, yeah.
{85500}{85526}I could do|that mambo now
{85528}{85562}That's better.
{85564}{85627}- What the hell are you doing?|- Just one cigarette.
{85629}{85662}You should not be|having a cig--
{85664}{85688}What--No, don't--
{85690}{85737}And if Dr. Schneiderman|hears about this...
{85738}{85795}I'm going to rip you a new one.
{85830}{85916}Aw, that's a shame.|You hate to see that.
{85918}{85956}And it just can't miss
{85958}{85992}It's a heartbreak.
{85994}{86066}Hmm, mambo
{86068}{86098}And it just can't miss
{86100}{86143}It's all coming back to me.
{86145}{86195}Oh, yeah.
{86308}{86332}Oh, yeah.
{86504}{86552}Rack 'em up.|Don't just stand there.
{86648}{86702}- Oy!|- Whoo!
{86777}{86825}This guy's the real deal.
{87050}{87094}Ha ha ha ha!
{87096}{87179}Now, every woman|wants a man
{87181}{87230}A man who keeps his cool
{87232}{87270}7 ball...
{87272}{87330}down the hall.
{87331}{87355}Oh!
{87357}{87392}Number 3...
{87394}{87422}out to sea.
{87424}{87470}Silly actin' fool
{87472}{87523}Number 9...
{87525}{87565}down the line.
{87567}{87611}So move it, move it slow
{87613}{87656}But when it comes to lovin'...
{87658}{87719}Number 8! Yeah!
{87721}{87748}Let's turn the heat up, baby
{87750}{87784}Number 8...
{87786}{87835}shut the gate.
{87837}{87860}Wow.
{87889}{87921}Way to go, man.
{87950}{87979}Whoo!
{87981}{88012}Well, thank you|very much there.
{88014}{88110}That was quite exhilarating,|but I believe that, uh...
{88112}{88170}my work in this town...
{88172}{88198}is done.
{88200}{88229}Ha ha. Way to go, man.
{88231}{88278}What did we decide on,|$100 a game?
{88279}{88325}I believe it was,|yes--100 bucks.
{88326}{88393}I don't remember that.
{88394}{88438}No?
{88439}{88521}I believe my attorney|here is correct.
{88522}{88608}I think you might be mistaken.
{88652}{88685}But, hey...
{88686}{88745}you played really great, pops.
{88746}{88770}OK, hey.
{88772}{88841}Hey! Come on!|Come on, fellas.
{88842}{88961}Now, you see, that's exactly|the reason I gave up pool.
{88962}{89003}- What?|- The fights.
{89005}{89034}There's no fight.
{89036}{89077}Sure there is. Look.
{89078}{89111}Uhh!
{89154}{89183}- Whoa!|- Uhh!
{89185}{89209}Whoa!

{89494}{89545}It's all right.|Nothing to see here, folks.
{89546}{89625}Everything's under control.
{89626}{89702}Just a little misunderstanding,|that's all.
{89704}{89727}- Ooh!|- Oh! Oh!
{89729}{89769}You know,|you make a deal...
{89771}{89822}you should honor it|like a gentleman.
{89824}{89892}Don't you think? Now, personally,|I don't care about the money.
{89894}{89956}In fact, I'd like you|to give it to the proprietor...
{89958}{90001}to make up for this ugly display.
{90002}{90050}All I want from you...
{90052}{90119}is an honest|and sincere apology.
{90121}{90172}Eat shit and die.
{90174}{90225}Oh, my God.
{90226}{90289}You know, you say|something like that...
{90290}{90352}and that makes me say this.
{90354}{90379}- Oh!|- Ahh!
{90381}{90429}Oh!
{90458}{90513}What did I do?|I got you both?
{90514}{90571}Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.
{90574}{90682}I--I thought for sure|I would've cleared you.
{90722}{90770}- Ahh.|- Boy...
{90772}{90810}Yeah. I'm OK. I'm OK.
{90812}{90882}Boy, that's some shot|I gave him.
{90883}{90914}Yes.
{90916}{90971}I must've been all pent up.
{90973}{91081}Well, to be perfectly frank,|I must've been pent up from before.
{91083}{91169}You know,|your mother and everything.
{91170}{91242}What? What are you|laughing at?
{91243}{91291}That's what you do in therapy.
{91293}{91362}Well, I got to say,|I'm feeling a little better.
{91363}{91426}Yeah, well,|I'm very happy for you.
{91428}{91466}Hey.
{91468}{91542}Well, look who's here.
{91544}{91577}Nice to see you again.
{91578}{91658}I heard there were two city boys|tearing up our town.
{91660}{91709}That's us.
{91710}{91744}These are the guys|I was telling you about.
{91746}{91782}This is my mother.
{91784}{91822}Well, hello.
{91824}{91896}- Hi. It's nice to meet you.|- Yeah. Sam Kleinman.
{91898}{91960}We were hoping that we could|buy you two a cocktail...
{91962}{92013}make up for the behavior|of our few rotten apples.
{92014}{92050}No, no. No, no, no, no.
{92052}{92130}No, that's--that would be sweet of you,|but not necessary at all.
{92132}{92170}You are not allowed to refuse.
{92172}{92218}It's the law.
{92220}{92250}Huh? It's the law.
{92252}{92310}The law is the law. Go.
{92341}{92378}Whoo!
{92427}{92543}Spent $48 last night|at the county fair
{92617}{92667}I throwed out my shoulder
{92669}{92738}But I won her that teddy bear
{92794}{92890}She's got me sayin' sugar pie,|honey, darlin', and dear
{92892}{93000}I ain't seen the Braves|play a game all year
{93002}{93082}Gonna get fired|if I don't get some sleep
{93083}{93163}My long lost buddies say|I'm gettin' in too deep
{93165}{93215}But I like it, I love it
{93217}{93267}I want some more of it
{93269}{93317}I try so hard
{93318}{93363}I can't rise above it
{93365}{93399}Don't know what it is
{93401}{93447}'Bout that little gal's lovin'
{93449}{93497}But I like it, I love it
{93499}{93554}I want some more of it
{93969}{94019}See, my husband was the same--|travel, work, work, travel...
{94021}{94061}and then one day I realized...
{94062}{94134}you know, OK, I'm just going to have|to make my own amusement.
{94136}{94207}So, that's when I started|my correspondence courses...
{94209}{94245}and I started my gardening.
{94247}{94330}See, that's healthy to me.|I mean, that I understand.
{94332}{94368}Yeah, you should see|her tomatoes and zucchinis.
{94370}{94424}They're, like, freaky big.
{94426}{94484}My mom--I remember once,|I was over the house--
{94486}{94518}Everything all right here,|gentlemen?
{94520}{94544}We're good.
{94546}{94570}And she was, like,|''Where is your father?
{94572}{94613}''I've had dinner on|the table since 6:00.''
{94614}{94677}I said, ''Ma,|he's never been home at 6:00...
{94679}{94740}''and he never will, you know,|so why don't you just accept it...
{94742}{94786}''and spare yourself|all the heartache?
{94788}{94828}''I mean, just make your life|a little easier.''
{94830}{94880}- You know what she says?|- What?
{94882}{94940}''Because I like to think|there's always hope.''
{94942}{95045}Yeah. OK. So now you see|what I was dealing with.
{95046}{95082}''There's always hope.''
{95084}{95155}Right. So let me ask you.|Who's crazy?
{95157}{95193}- Nobody's crazy.|- No?
{95194}{95226}- No.|- After all those years...
{95228}{95286}she's still waiting for me|to be different?
{95288}{95351}I mean, I've been exactly the same|the whole time.
{95353}{95434}I'm not pulling any surprises,|but still she's surprised.
{95436}{95506}I know, and that's|what breaks my heart.
{95508}{95558}- What?|- Because she's hope--
{95560}{95641}I mean, all--I don't know.|Aren't we supposed to have hope?
{95642}{95710}Isn't that what sustains us?
{95712}{95782}Isn't that what keeps mankind|going forward?
{95784}{95836}This is a perfect medium-rare.
{95838}{95862}Pop, I'm asking--
{95864}{95919}What? Mankind, you said.
{95921}{96012}OK. All right. People hope|for world peace, right?
{96014}{96069}Now, do they really think|it's gonna work out?
{96070}{96148}No, probably not, but they still--|they keep praying, right?
{96150}{96178}They keep hoping.
{96180}{96228}Yeah, but I'm not world peace,|I'm her husband.
{96230}{96274}And one person|could never be...
{96276}{96337}exactly what another person|expects them to be.
{96338}{96413}Because it's not reasonable.|Am I right or wrong?
{96414}{96486}- Yes, but still--|- This is fantastic.
{96488}{96528}Here, taste this.|Come on, you got--
{96530}{96586}- I have the same thing.|- Never mind. Taste mine.
{96588}{96648}- I have the exact--|- This is out of this world!
{96650}{96687}Huh?
{96689}{96737}It's exactly the same that I have.
{96738}{96789}If you'll excuse me,|I'm gonna go...
{96790}{96837}Oh. Sure. Yeah, yeah.
{96838}{96873}Oh, yeah.
{96874}{96957}So, let me ask you--you married|another woman, let's say...
{96958}{97025}Mom married another guy, right?|So everything was different.
{97026}{97062}What is it with you?
{97064}{97136}- I'm just gonna go with her.|- Yeah, yeah, sure.
{97138}{97177}What did we do?|We scared 'em away?
{97178}{97209}What do you mean,|what is it with me?
{97210}{97253}What?|Finish your question. What?
{97254}{97297}What is it that|you're so concerned...
{97298}{97349}what happened between|your mother and me?
{97350}{97389}What do you mean,|why am I so concerned?
{97390}{97449}- That's the whole freakin' thing.|- What's the difference?
{97450}{97525}That's the whole thing of my life.|That's the--that's the--
{97526}{97579}that's the big white elephant|in our house.
{97581}{97605}What was?
{97606}{97652}The shit. All the shit|between you and Ma.
{97654}{97711}- There was no shit.|- There was no shit?
{97713}{97737}Where was there shit?
{97738}{97769}Everywhere you looked|there was shit.
{97770}{97814}- Bullshit.|- Oh, come on.
{97816}{97877}All right, we didn't talk about it,|but you don't think we saw it?
{97879}{97953}You don't think we all saw the--|the finger-pointing...
{97954}{97987}and the rolling of the eyes?
{97989}{98037}- Hey, I loved your mother.|- I know.
{98038}{98084}- I still love your mother.|- I know.
{98086}{98135}- And she loves me.|- Absolutely, yes.
{98137}{98163}So, what are you saying?
{98165}{98243}I'm saying,|look how much love was wasted.
{98245}{98323}I mean, an abundance of love...
{98325}{98385}quashed by a quagmire of shit.
{98412}{98457}I'm opening my pants.
{98458}{98483}Go ahead.
{98485}{98528}Oy.
{98572}{98596}OK, so--
{98598}{98651}OK, so let me|ask you something.
{98653}{98689}You're such an expert.
{98691}{98755}- You and your wife...|- Yeah?
{98757}{98800}You don't have any shit?
{98802}{98834}- Of course we do.|- Right.
{98836}{98887}And you handle|all your shit perfect?
{98889}{98959}No, not perfect, but I--
{98961}{98995}What? You what?
{98997}{99055}All right. Like this house|in the country?
{99057}{99097}Do I need that? No.
{99099}{99163}But it's important to her.
{99165}{99235}So I'm, I--|I listen to her.
{99237}{99331}So, really...|she should thank me, your wife.
{99333}{99357}Hmm?
{99358}{99406}If I didn't set|such a bad example...
{99408}{99459}you wouldn't be knocking|yourself out for her.
{99461}{99529}Well, I--you know, you're joking.|I don't know, maybe.
{99530}{99563}I mean, a lot of times--
{99565}{99593}Any more sourdough bread|for you gentlemen?
{99595}{99621}We're good.
{99623}{99666}7-grain cheese rolls,|sesame onion bread sticks?
{99668}{99711}Nothing. No.|We're really fine.
{99713}{99779}A lot of times it's just little stuff.
{99781}{99837}I try to do little things.|You know...
{99838}{99889}surprises or little presents...
{99891}{99952}or I write her little cards.
{99954}{100010}Which, you know--|See, you...
{100011}{100058}you were never a big card guy.
{100059}{100089}So shoot me.
{100091}{100175}Hey, you asked me, ''Like what?''|So I'm telling you.
{100177}{100237}Believe me, little cards,|little papers--
{100239}{100288}whatever the hell|you're talking about--
{100290}{100411}believe me, that would not miraculously|have made your mother happy.
{100413}{100450}- Really?|- That's right.
{100452}{100553}Whatever it is that she needed,|I didn't have it to give to her.
{100555}{100629}OK. And when|she didn't get it from you...
{100631}{100708}who do you think|she turned to next, huh?
{100710}{100754}Who do you think|she turned to next?
{100755}{100792}Who?
{100794}{100838}- Me.|- You?
{100839}{100874}Yeah. Well, all of us.
{100875}{100929}Really with me more|than the girls, even.
{100930}{100957}Why? Because you're a boy?
{100959}{101013}Yeah. Because--yeah.|I mean, some--
{101015}{101050}What the hell|happened to them?
{101052}{101101}Somebody had to make|her happy, right?
{101102}{101179}Guess what? I tried.|Believe me, I tried.
{101181}{101269}That cloud, that--|that veil of disappointment...
{101271}{101321}I could never make it go away.
{101323}{101385}I could never crack|that sadness there.
{101387}{101437}So you know|what I'm talking about.
{101438}{101474}Yes, I do.
{101475}{101504}And I also know that...
{101506}{101577}she wouldn't have needed anything|from me if she got it--
{101579}{101636}- We also have a lovely--|- Walk away!
{101638}{101672}Just walk away.
{101674}{101733}She wouldn't have needed|anything from me...
{101735}{101772}if she got it from you.
{101774}{101810}- Is that right?|- Yes, that's right.
{101812}{101870}And I'm tired of feeling|like the fuckin' failure here...
{101871}{101914}'cause I'm not the one|who failed her, you are.
{101916}{101968}You are. You never cared.
{101970}{102012}You just went about|your business...
{102014}{102061}and, ''Oh, everything will|work out fine in the end.''
{102063}{102141}But you know what? It doesn't.|It doesn't work like that.
{102143}{102202}You have to--|you have to care.
{102203}{102277}You have to try|and give a shit. Huh?
{102279}{102321}Look at that letter.
{102323}{102431}I mean, she was screaming for you,|and you didn't hear it.
{102433}{102468}And now you're surprised?
{102470}{102512}Forty years later, your wife is--
{102514}{102565}God knows where she is--|trying to figure out...
{102566}{102628}why her life didn't work out|like she planned...
{102630}{102712}and you think that's got|nothing to do with you, huh?
{102714}{102777}It's got everything|to do with you.
{102778}{102843}You didn't do your job.|That's right.
{102845}{102901}You didn't do your job.
{103406}{103492}Ohh!
{103494}{103536}Uhh!
{103698}{103723}Hey.
{103858}{103962}What a waste of a good steak.
{103964}{104006}I'm an asshole.
{104008}{104061}- No.|- Yeah, yeah.
{104062}{104098}Listen, I...
{104100}{104150}I had no right saying all that.
{104152}{104184}- No.|- No, no, I didn't.
{104186}{104246}No, you're entitled.
{104248}{104338}And I'm gonna tell you|something else.
{104340}{104426}Maybe you're right.
{104428}{104530}Maybe I could've done better,|maybe I should've...
{104532}{104581}but I didn't.
{104582}{104631}So you know what?
{104740}{104787}I'm sorry.
{105112}{105151}OK.
{105894}{105965}You think the girls|are worried about us?
{105966}{106021}I think they'll be all right.
{106022}{106081}Unh. Do you know...
{106082}{106173}that was the first time|since Roosevelt died...
{106174}{106273}that I danced with someone|besides your mother?
{106274}{106309}And?
{106310}{106385}I didn't like it. It felt wrong--
{106386}{106441}wrong skin, wrong smell.
{106442}{106505}The height, her hands.
{106506}{106561}Didn't feel right.
{106646}{106743}Oh, what's she doing, Benny?
{106793}{106867}She's gonna live by herself?
{106869}{106968}She's gonna find someone else|she likes better?
{107001}{107032}Now?
{107085}{107192}You know, we're not kids anymore,|your mother and me.
{107194}{107293}You want to change your life,|do it when you're young.
{107294}{107351}Ugh! I don't know.
{107353}{107451}I don't know what she wants.|I don't know what I did.
{107453}{107491}I don't know anything.
{107493}{107615}Ahh, unh!
{107617}{107715}Are your stars moving around|all cock-eyed?
{107717}{107751}Yep.
{107753}{107803}Me, too.
{107805}{107875}Oh, you're a bad influence,|sonny boy.
{107877}{107927}You made your old man drunk.
{107929}{108007}Well...sorry.
{108009}{108060}What's that?
{108097}{108136}The Big Dipper?
{108138}{108193}Where are you looking?|What, here?
{108194}{108221}Over here.
{108223}{108250}- This one?|- Yeah.
{108302}{108350}Uh...
{108351}{108386}I don't know.
{108387}{108448}All right.
{108450}{108485}Unh!
{108487}{108570}This is what I want.
{108571}{108654}Everyone's worried|about your mother...
{108655}{108690}and what she wants.
{108691}{108757}But for me...
{108759}{108818}this is enough.
{108819}{108933}Sitting down.
{108935}{108988}- Well, sounds crazy, doesn't it?|- No, no, no.
{108990}{109067}But I swear, I think that's it.
{109069}{109126}All my life working...
{109127}{109193}saving, building.
{109195}{109314}For what? All I ever wanted|really was to...
{109315}{109362}sit down...
{109363}{109413}not worry about anything.
{109415}{109481}Oh, boy, I get it.
{109483}{109544}Believe me, I get it.
{109614}{109676}You know what?
{109678}{109761}I think that's all|Mom wanted, too.
{109806}{109909}Only she wanted to sit next to you.
{110042}{110096}You're a nice guy,|you know that?
{110098}{110172}Ah, that's the tequila talking.
{110174}{110280}No. No, you're a nice fella.
{110282}{110324}Ahh.
{110326}{110438}Thanks for being my baby boy.
{110482}{110540}I heard you with your girl.
{110542}{110601}I think you got it right.
{110602}{110696}I mean, a baby|comes into the world.
{110698}{110792}Where's it gonna go?|It could go anywhere, right?
{110794}{110876}You could've gone|to some parents in China...
{110878}{110944}or Timbuktu,|but you didn't.
{110946}{110996}You came to us.
{110998}{111066}Why? Who the hell knows?
{111068}{111153}But it worked out good.
{111248}{111338}Well, thanks for being my daddy.
{111340}{111379}My pleasure.
{111496}{111561}Well, I'll tell you...
{111563}{111642}all I ever really wanted...
{111644}{111679}really...
{111820}{111871}pretty much this.
{113226}{113262}Benny?
{113426}{113457}Benny?
{113773}{113833}Well, if that's camping...
{113834}{113900}I can do without it.
{114005}{114057}What?
{114089}{114155}Her doctors discovered it|two weeks ago.
{114157}{114212}Told her it was inoperable.
{114214}{114301}They said,|''Figure six months.''
{114302}{114395}I don't understand.|I mean, how can that be?
{114397}{114451}She didn't tell anyone.|She didn't--she didn't--
{114453}{114521}she didn't even tell the girls|till she was at the hospital already.
{114522}{114555}She went out to the island...
{114557}{114599}and she found some nice|little place on the water...
{114601}{114627}and she was--
{114629}{114675}she was by herself|for a couple of days.
{114677}{114723}She was feeling fine.
{114725}{114820}And then she started--|she started blacking out.
{114909}{114959}Oh, my God.
{114961}{115027}Oh, my God.
{115029}{115147}So, when she wrote that note|on the refrigerator...
{115149}{115181}she made that all up?
{115182}{115243}No, she didn't make it up.
{115245}{115283}She did want to be alone.
{115285}{115355}Just for reasons...
{115357}{115410}nobody knew about.
{115457}{115512}How could this be?
{117638}{117718}Hello, my busy playboys.
{117766}{117846}Heh! Hello.
{117975}{118022}All right. All right.
{118023}{118065}Look at you.
{118067}{118126}You don't need|to be so dramatic.
{118127}{118173}I'm not going anywhere yet.
{118174}{118212}And come here.
{118313}{118344}How are you?
{118346}{118391}Better than you.
{118393}{118448}What did the doctor say?
{118450}{118500}Oh, the doctor.
{118502}{118548}He said I'm an old lady...
{118550}{118621}and this is what happens|to old ladies.
{118662}{118718}Why wouldn't you tell me?
{118720}{118771}You think I tell you everything?
{118810}{118872}You know, you think|you're gonna live forever...
{118874}{118908}but you don't.
{118910}{118998}Just live till one day,|and then suddenly...
{119000}{119048}you're done.
{119050}{119121}That's their big forever.
{119122}{119176}Oh, you got more visitors.

{119844}{119891}Oh, wow, you guys drove fast.
{119893}{119920}- Ohh!|- Ohh!

{120023}{120070}Hey, look who's here.
{120072}{120099}Hey. Hi. How are you?
{120101}{120172}Hello, gorgeous girl.|How are you, honey?
{120174}{120197}Good to see you.
{120199}{120222}- Hi.|- Hi.
{120224}{120274}- Hey.|- Hi, sweetheart. How are you?
{120276}{120318}Sit down, darling.
{120320}{120370}So, how was the farm?
{120372}{120398}What farm?
{120400}{120461}They went to look at a house,|a farmhouse on a lake.
{120462}{120501}Nobody tells me anything.
{120502}{120538}So was it nice?
{120540}{120568}I don't want to talk about it.
{120570}{120658}Hey, this place didn't work out,|but let me say this.
{120660}{120738}This guy is gonna find you a farm.
{120740}{120774}I promise you that.
{120776}{120839}- I don't want a farm.|- What does that mean?
{120841}{120885}- We need to live in the country?|- Yeah.
{120886}{120936}Oh, you know that|I've never wanted that.
{120938}{120976}Don't you?
{120978}{121027}Your mother wanted that.
{121029}{121069}Not--not me.
{121070}{121161}No, I know. I know she--
{121162}{121201}What are you saying?
{121202}{121243}So...you "don't" want it?
{121245}{121292}Sorry.
{121294}{121343}Wrong wife.
{121345}{121401}So when--when we're|looking every Sunday...
{121402}{121445}in the magazine section|and you're pointing...
{121446}{121481}and you're pointing it out,|what is that?
{121482}{121567}Well, it seemed|so important to you.
{121569}{121636}How come you never|mentioned this before?
{121638}{121674}Oh, I have.
{121676}{121741}You just haven't listened.
{121766}{121797}Ahem.
{122072}{122138}You know,|Benny showed me that letter.
{122140}{122205}What letter?
{122206}{122239}This letter.
{122346}{122409}- Where did you get this?|- Benny.
{122410}{122455}What happened?|What did I do now?
{122457}{122525}I always wondered|where this went to.
{122526}{122581}This one took it.
{122582}{122667}I thought maybe I threw it|in the garbage or something.
{122669}{122733}Wait a minute.|Wait a minute.
{122734}{122767}Wait a minute.
{122769}{122855}You said a lot of things|in this letter.
{122857}{122962}And I want you to know that...
{122964}{123044}I didn't know.
{123076}{123134}And now that you know?
{123136}{123215}Oh, now that I know?
{123217}{123283}Now that I know, I feel...
{123285}{123391}I feel bad.|What do you think?
{123393}{123451}I feel shitty.
{123453}{123537}Listen, don't believe|everything you read.
{123538}{123583}What? What are you do--
{123585}{123630}What--what--what--|what are you saying?
{123661}{123684}What?
{123686}{123774}What, you didn't mean|what you wrote in the letter?
{123776}{123815}Well...
{123817}{123847}Hmm?
{123849}{123943}Maybe...then.
{123945}{123989}- Then.|- Then.
{123991}{124033}Yeah. How about now?
{124035}{124118}How about all the years|between then and now?
{124119}{124157}- Benny. What are you doing?|- Wait.
{124159}{124191}Wait a second.|Wait a second.
{124193}{124245}People change.
{124247}{124284}You know.
{124286}{124337}No, that's not true.
{124339}{124374}No, people don't change.
{124375}{124439}They change their expectations.
{124441}{124482}They adjust.
{124484}{124549}What?
{124550}{124609}Have I felt disappointed? Yes.
{124610}{124654}All right?
{124656}{124717}Do I wish some things|had gone better?
{124719}{124793}Of course, yes, I wish|some things had gone better.
{124795}{124856}So, who gets|everything they want?
{124914}{124967}OK. All right.
{124969}{125009}What do you want me to say?
{125010}{125042}Say what you want to say.
{125085}{125142}What are you saving it for?
{125143}{125204}Come on, he's a big boy.
{125264}{125320}Hmm?
{125322}{125373}Why did you leave him?
{125375}{125401}Truth.
{125718}{125780}I left...
{125782}{125869}because I wanted to see|if I could.
{126066}{126108}I wanted to--
{126110}{126187}to be not taken for granted.
{126518}{126558}Plus...
{126560}{126636}you know why else?
{126638}{126706}I know that when I'm gone--
{126708}{126748}heh--
{126750}{126824}you're not gonna know|what to do.
{126826}{126910}I don't think|you're so good by yourself.
{126912}{126970}This way, you could practice...
{126972}{127076}see what it's like, you know?
{127078}{127166}Heh. And if you|hated me for it...
{127168}{127218}that's not so terrible.
{127220}{127294}You'd all get to talk|about it together.
{127600}{127692}See, this is the thing|about my mother.
{127694}{127770}She was made of love.
{127772}{127809}In the middle of all this...
{127810}{127887}she was taking care|of everyone else.
{127944}{127999}Under all that anger...
{128001}{128062}after all that disappointment...
{128064}{128110}the flame still flickered...
{128112}{128163}the love kept ticking.
{128290}{128365}And she still held on to hope.
{128366}{128425}Despite everything she knew...
{128426}{128477}and even everything she said...
{128478}{128559}she chose to believe|that things really might change.
{128632}{128681}And my father--
{128682}{128726}God bless him--
{128728}{128810}to his credit|and to everyone's amazement...
{128812}{128861}he did manage to change.
{128862}{128958}He still had within him|the ability to surprise.
{129006}{129078}OK, you can look.
{129246}{129314}I heard you never got to go.
{129418}{129484}It's been closed for,|like, sixty years...
{129486}{129517}so, you know...
{129518}{129621}a lot of the best exhibits|aren't up anymore.
{129622}{129686}On the other hand...
{129688}{129782}on the other hand,|there's no lines.
{129902}{129985}Oh, almost forgot.
{129986}{130069}I got a little something for you.
{130070}{130169}What are you trying to do, kill me?
{130569}{130658}So it took me|fifty years to understand.
{130660}{130701}So?
{130702}{130785}I'm not the swiftest guy in town.
{130786}{130889}But now I'm all caught up,|what do you say we try again?
{130890}{130945}Round two.
{130946}{131013}We'll say round one|was everything up till now...
{131014}{131075}and round two|is from today on.
{131077}{131117}What do you think?
{131118}{131191}Sound like a plan to you?
{131193}{131244}Your loving husband, Sam.
{131425}{131456}OK.
{132887}{132949}My mother made it|through the summer.
{132951}{133006}That's how long forever|turned out to be.
{133008}{133063}But for that whole forever...
{133065}{133138}it was the happiest|I ever saw them together.
{133195}{133257}My father moved in with us|after that.
{133259}{133309}We had our grapefruit juice|every morning...
{133311}{133382}and watched the news|together every night.
{133383}{133442}It was a special, magical time.
{133491}{133557}But proving once again|that you never know...
{133559}{133645}we woke up one morning,|and my father didn't.
{133647}{133694}He had been feeling perfectly fine.
{133695}{133770}I think he just really missed his gal.
{133772}{133849}It was a year full of surprises.
{133851}{133910}A few months later,|we had another baby--
{133911}{133965}a boy.
{133967}{134065}We named him Martin Samuel,|after both of them.
{134126}{134188}The little guy never got to know|my mother and father...
{134190}{134270}but, as no love|shall heretofore be wasted...
{134272}{134365}I promise you,|he's gonna hear all about 'em.
