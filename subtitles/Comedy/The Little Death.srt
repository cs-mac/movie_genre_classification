- Want me to stop?

4
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,417
Yeah, can you just come up
here and fuck me, please?

5
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,751
OK.

6
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,584
No, no, no.
Not right after. Come on.

7
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,417
- Oh, I'm sorry, I won't.

- Hm?

12
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,209
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Of course, honey. What?

13
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:58,626
I want to tell you something
but I'm embarrassed.

14
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,292
Say it.

15
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:05,834
Well, I need you...
I need you not to judge me. OK?

16
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,626
It's important
that you don't judge me.

17
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:12,751
- Promise me you won't.
- Hey, sweetheart, what?

18
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,001
I want you to rape me.

19
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,626

- Yes.

20

embarrassed about?

21
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,167
Yes.

22
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,626
- OK.
- Really?

23
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,709
Of course.

24
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,001
You're a ten, babe.

25
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:41,209
You're a fucking
ten out of ten.

26
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,626
You're 20 out of ten. To me.
You're five stars.

27
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,001
Yeah?
Come here.

28
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,334

29

Uh... No. Paul.

Honey, not...

31

- You to rape me.

- It's a fantasy of mine.

37

What, getting raped?

38
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,209
Yeah, it's like
your foot thing.

39
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:51,459
Um, it's a bit different,
I think, hon.

40
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,084
- How?
- How?

41
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,792
How is sucking your toes
different from me raping you?

42
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,459
Oh, come on,
you know what I mean.

43
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,584
It's something
I've always wanted to try.

44
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,459
I just thought it might be
a nice thing

45

for us to talk about.

46
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,417

- Yeah.

49
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,667
- Not now, not now.
- No? When?

50

- That it's you.

58
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,792
Right.

59
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,001
Yeah, I don't know
how to take that, babe.

60
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,834
Honey, it's a
really common fantasy.

61
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,001
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure
it is, hon.

62
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,376
It is actually and you said
you wouldn't judge me.

63
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,126
No, I didn't.
I absolutely did not.

64
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,917
How did you expect I'd react,
Maeve?

65
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,542
You just told me
you had a fantasy

66
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,834
that doesn't involve me!

67
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,459
No, what?
Yes, it does!

68
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,501
You said you want to be raped
but not by me.

69
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:58,626
No! Oh, no, no, no, darling,
that's not what I meant.

70
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,542
Oh, my God,
you are so fucking beautiful.

71
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,626
No, I want to be raped by you.

72
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:05,042
No, you don't.

73
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,626
Yes, you are the only man in
the world I want to rape me.

74
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,251
I love you
but because I love you

75
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:11,667
and because you're the only
man I want to be with,

76
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,292
I want you to have sex
with me.

77
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,001
Oh, Pauly, I adore you.

78
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:19,417
I just want for one little
second, like, to fear

79
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,001
what might be like
if it was somebody else.

80
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:28,001
- Does that make sense?
- Not really.

81
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,834
OK, go to sleep, we'll talk
about it another time.

82
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,334
Blowjobs.

- It's Dan.

There is no wrong way.

00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,417
- Her blowjobs...
- Say it... to Evie.

89
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,251
Your blowjobs...

90

aren't... very...

They're not...
They're not that bad.

93

They are.

94
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,751
Well, you remember the last
time you went down on me, Dan?

95
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,626
- 'Cause I don't.
- OK. OK.

96
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,542
- Regularity's not the issue.
- Let's just... take a breath.

97
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,209
When was the last time
you had sex?

98

100
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,417
It was last month
before your fun run.

101

Was it?

102
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:22,626
OK. What seems to be missing
here is communication.

103
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,626
But you're both struggling
with that.

104
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:28,959
So as an experiment tonight...

105
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,417
don't be Evie and Dan.

106
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,209
Instead,
be two different people

107

who aren't afraid to say
what they want.

Yeah, baking

310

I think they stopped
making them

311

in Bangkok?

Right?

I almost choked on them
at a school camp when...

So I'll just...
I'll put them in some tea.

No, no, it's not.
Particularly not hepatitis C.

00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:56,417
So, I'm going to prescribe you
a course of interferon

446
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,292

- Jesus!

- Shh.

603

can you turn the TV back on?

- What is it?

- I love you.
- How is that important?

606

- Give me the remote.
- No, no, wait. Listen to me.

I'm in this.
You and me, all the way.

Wait, wait, wait,
let me enter into it.

No, Dan, I'm not
doing this anymore, OK?

618
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,459
You're giving me really mixed

I just want to tell you
something.

Well, tell me, tell me!

your wife is asking you
to not answer the door.

- Good point.

My name's Steve. I've just
moved in down the street.

OK.

637

Just wanted

Run away?!

W-What do you mean?
How is that even possible?

672
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:18,084
Well, I think maybe she went
out the side gate

673
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:19,709
'cause the latch is broken.

674
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,792
- Why is the latch broken?
- It's a long story.

675
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,084
I'm so sorry, Ro.
I-I didn't...

676
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:27,667
OK, you can never tell Richard
about this. I mean it.

677
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:28,876
What?

678
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,959
You can never tell him
that Roxy was here.

679
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:32,667
He will never forgive me.
Or you.

680
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:34,292
- Ro...
- You gotta promise me.

681
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:35,917
- Ro!
- No, promise me!

682

But we will. We will.

Hmm, the posters should help,
don't you think?

687
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:59,126
Definitely. Someone
will see those posters

and they'll call.

689

Yeah. So you put
all the posters up or...?

690
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:04,501
- Of course.
- Of course.

691

- Yeah.
- Hmm, that's weird.

What?

earlier today

and the bottom of the bag
split open.

695

- Oh.
- And I found these.

696
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:19,167
What the fuck, Ro?

697
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,417
- I must have accidentally...
- Oh, must you?

698
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,417
That's bullshit
because you just told me

that you put up
all the posters.

700
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,667
Yeah, but what I meant was...

701
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,292
- Where's Roxy?
- I don't know.

702

Don't you?
Why are you lying to me?

703

Why would you hurt me
like that?

I mean, do you not
want to find Roxy?

705
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:36,001
I did not hurt Roxy!

about you hurting Roxy?

- I didn't mean...
- What did you do to her?

If it was an accident,
just tell me. I'll understand!

709

and I should have but I...

'could be'?

00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:36,917
Can you spare a dollar, mate?

923
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:38,959
No, sorry, mate,
we don't have any.

924
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:40,917
That's right,
you remember it.

925
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:48,126
Come on, man, just a dollar.

926
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:50,709
Mate, we honestly don't
have anything. I'm sorry.

927
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,917
Not one single dollar?

928
00:57:57,084 --> 00:57:59,167
OK, you should just give them
what you've got.

929
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,084
- Alright.
- He doesn't have anything.

930
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:03,084
- For fuck's sake.
- That's what he said.

931
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,709
Alright, mate.

932
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:16,584
- Alright, that's fine.
- OK.

933
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:21,001
What?

934
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,084
Alright, you want phones?
They're yours.

935
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:27,792
There you go.

936
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,917
Oh, come on, mate.
That's enough.

937
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,709
You got what you wanted.

938
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:42,792
I wouldn't say that.

939
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:48,126
Aren't you
a pretty little thing?

940
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:50,167
- Alright, fuck off.
- What are you doing?

Hey.

Hey, sweetheart.

953
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:59,709
- Where are we?
- We're in the hospital.

954

- Am I OK?

Yeah, I'm OK. You're not OK.

You fractured your skull,
honey.

But you're going to be fine.

958

Oh, my God. How?

959
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:14,959
You fell and hit your head.

960
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:19,167
Really?
I don't remember.

961
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:22,126
Yeah, the doctor said
you might not.

962
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:25,042
- It's OK, just rest.
- What happened?

963
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,709
Somebody hit you.

964
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:31,417
The car park.

965
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,209
Yeah. In the car park.

966
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,084
Did I rape you?

967
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:44,751
Shh.

968
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:46,959
That's what I was trying
to do, sweetheart.

969
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:48,667
- Shh.
- Those men, I paid them.

970
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,292
- I know.
- They were actors.

971
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:52,626
They were meant to hit me
with a fake bottle.

972
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,667
- Yeah.
- Did they use a real bottle?

973
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:57,334
- I-I don't...
- It should have been fake.

974
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:59,501
Honey, just try and rest.
Just try and relax.

975
01:01:59,626 --> 01:02:01,251
- It was for your birthday.
- I know.

976
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:02,876
- As a surprise.
- I know.

977
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:04,709
Did I do it?

978
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:09,751
Maeve, tell me.

979
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:13,417
Did I rape you?

980
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:20,292

I really tried to think
of everything this time.

987
01:02:37,709 --> 01:02:40,334
You know, I really put
some thought into it.

988
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:42,126
- I know.
- Yeah.

989
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:43,751
I practised.

990
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:46,001
But, you know, it was
my first rape and I...

991
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:50,501
I don't know if I'm, like,
meant to be a raper.

992
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:52,126
- Shh...
- 'Cause it was...

993
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:53,917
No, baby, it was perfect.

994
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:56,792
It was perfect.

995
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:04,292
Wait, so when
did I hit my head?

996
01:03:07,126 --> 01:03:10,126
- Right after.
- Shit.

997
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:11,751
- There was more.
- No.

998
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:13,417
- There was more...
- No more, no.

999
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,042
I was meant to do
one more thing.

1000
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,501
Pauly, no more, please.
Honey, no, that's enough.

1001
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,834

Where are my clothes?

01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:21,459
Please, just get my clothes.

1003

My jeans.

1004
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:25,001

and he told me

1024
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,376
you've been taking
theatre lessons.

1025
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,542
Theatre... Screen acting
classes. So what?

1026
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,167
So what the fuck? Since when
did you want to be an actor?

1027
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,292
You're the one who said
I should get into it.

1028
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:45,917
- What? When?
- Oh, God!

1029
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:48,292
When we first started
this whole role play thing.

1030
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,751
You said I could be
a famous actor. Your words.

1031
01:04:50,876 --> 01:04:53,876
That does not sound like
something I would say.

1032
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,501
And that is not the point.

1033
01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:57,459
The point is you lied
about it.

1034
01:04:57,584 --> 01:04:59,084
I was embarrassed.

1035
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:03,501
I mean, Jesus, Evie!
Me? An actor?

1036
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:05,626
- It's crazy.
- It's ridiculous.

1037
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,251
It's not ridiculous.

1038
01:05:07,376 --> 01:05:10,501
Dan. It's ridiculous.

1039
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,834
Don't go. Evie.

1040
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:27,126
Don't go.

1041

If you walk out that door,

1042
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:33,501
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

1043
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:39,709
I used to be scared
of the idea of growing old.

1044
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:43,209
Now I'm just scared
of the idea...

1045
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:46,834
of growing old without you.

1046
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:07,334
- Ow. Fuck!
- What?

1047
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:09,501
Oh, I got it in my eye.
Christ!

1048
01:06:09,626 --> 01:06:11,292
- Got what in your eye?
- Tiger Balm.

1049
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:14,251
I got fucking Tiger Balm in my
eye. God, that really stings.

1050
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:16,292
How did you get Tiger Balm
in your eye?

1051
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:18,251
You're supposed to put it
near your eye.

1052
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:20,626
Like, the bridge of your nose
and it makes you cry.

1053
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:23,126
They showed us how to do it
in acting class this week.

1054
01:06:26,001 --> 01:06:27,501
You were acting?

1055
01:06:27,626 --> 01:06:29,584
Yeah, you couldn't tell,
though, right?

1056
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:33,626
You are a psychopath.

1057
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:39,709
You're not... you're not
even ready to be a husband,

1058
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,334

Evie.

Let alone a what?

1062
01:06:57,459 --> 01:06:58,959
An actor?

1063
01:06:59,084 --> 01:07:01,584
You're not a fucking actor.

1064
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:04,709
Wow.

Why do you keep going
on about Dan?

1069
