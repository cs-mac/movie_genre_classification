we all want.

All this is good.

195
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,103
The problem is that

196
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,456
brain scanner
was negative.

197
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:32,457
And that makes my diagnosis.

198

... because, as you know, normally
passive men like you

Without taking into account that your
dream is a bad sign.

214
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:44,423
Dreams are dangerous because
instability and pain

215
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,577
and so do not talk about them.

216
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:49,330
But remember that
most important, is

217
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:55,884
that in this world, our world,
dreams are never real.

00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:48,242
They did the test
primary productivity, Cindy.

334
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,095
He proved to be infallible.

335
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,249
I think you are eating a
Burger embryo.

336
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:54,903
Problem boss?

337
00:23:54,908 --> 00:23:55,556
No. None.

338
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,510
At what level is that
for us to eat?

339
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,464
Level Two.

340
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:02,417
In the test colococaram me
the second level

341
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:03,671
before going to jail.

342
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:07,325
I returned last week
I made a new test

343
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,479
and wrote me to tunt!

344
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:11,932
Prison!

345
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:14,786
Said a tunt
is sociable;

346
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,740
but introspective.

347
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:20,493
They want a team environment.

348
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:22,847
... BOOM ...

349
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,701
Tunt.

350
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,554
Here we eat?

351
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,708
I see no problem
that.

352
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:43,862
"Faltam 3 055 minutos

"Hi George.
Charisma level four. "

356
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,476
Hello Hello

357
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:01,330
"How was your weekend?
Tives you chance to relax? "

358
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,784
Yes

359
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:05,785
"George. Fifth level called

361
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,787
We have just the contract.

362
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:14,288
"The level George, five
I also called

363

to see if everything went
well with the doctor. "

364
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,290
Well, I think it is
everything works fine.

365
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:23,891
"I just wanted to confirm."

366

"It's called dihidrodicloro

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
Hello! love.

Come and join us, brother.

376
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,802
What we are discussing how
Satan works today.

377
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,803
Hear voices?

378
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:17,404
Voices of the path.

379
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,205
Society is
before us.

380
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:24,106
Well that may be
Satan say

381
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:27,107
to explode the brother.

382
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,108
Is the number 700.

383
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:31,909
"Stay away."

384
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,110
You are reading books
wolves, Howard?

385
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:38,311
Howard. I can not tolerate
this chaos in my house.

386
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,812
Howard!

387
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,813
Julian!

388
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:01,814
Brother!

389
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:06,815
... escaped.

390
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,816
I got home, my brother.

391
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:09,917
You receive up to my call?

392
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,818
No, I ...

393
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,119
George. I was at level five.

394
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,620
I was a king.

395
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,921
A king among men.

396
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,922
And one day, I was in my
office and fell asleep.

397
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:25,923
And I was walking.

398
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:29,424
He was sleeping, but I
Walked down the road

399
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:32,425
and people laughed at me.

400
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:33,926
and when I looked down

401
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:38,927
I saw that I was missing the penis.

402
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:40,728
And in its place was
logo of Jeffers.

403
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:45,129
I do not care to try
remove it, it

404
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,730
he fall to wash it.

405
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,531
Then I realized that
had to flee

406
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:57,932
before the explosion
caught it all.

407
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:03,933
- I was in South America,
I lived in Ecuador.

408
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,934
Then one night

409
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:12,935
after drinking too much beer
maize and guinea pig

410
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:16,936
I found myself free.

411
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,937
Like when I was young.

412
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:22,638
Only louder.

413
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,939
And I knew that when he came to
house was capable of doing something.

414
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,940
George, I came home
to live with our family.

415
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,241
Came home
recover our heritage.

416
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,242
Came home

417
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,743
to live

418
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:45,744
in the pool house.

419
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,145
To find the force.

420
00:28:48,146 --> 00:28:50,446
And with the hope
to find it.

421
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:59,447
I know, my brother, I know.

422
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:22,027
"Keep phones
playing. I like this sound.

423
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,028
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

424
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,629
People know, as I appreciate it!

425
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,930
When I said I would do a marathon
to increase awareness

426
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:36,231
all these explosions
that has been happening

427
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,932
everything about this great nation,

428
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:42,733
Televisions
saw me live

429
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:49,734
and said, Berne, You're crazy.
You're a fool.

430
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:54,335
No one will want
see a show like this.

431
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,836
But I think

432
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,637
Estmos to prove that
they were wrong!

433
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:05,838
We checked
wrong.

434
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,839
Now, Joe is with us.

435
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,940
Yes, Joe!

436
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:15,841
Joe wanted to walk again.

437
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:16,842
His psychiatrist

438
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:21,843
said he would live only
two weeks before it exploded.

439
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:25,044
But thanks to hard work

440
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:27,745
to understand
beauty of this position

441
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:31,746
you can see,
Joe is still with us.

442
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,647
How are you, Joe?

443
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:37,048
Ble bl bl bl Bln BLR.

We love Thee, Joe!

445
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,050
Let's give an applause to Joe!

446
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:43,451
You know, ladies and gentlemen

447
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:45,752
there are people like Joe

448
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,953
supporting pain
wherever

449
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:51,154
and learn to accept that the beauty

450
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:54,155
Distributor is us. "

451
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,199

"Hello George.

Speech Cindy. "

455
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,203
Hi Cindy
Where are you?

456
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,204
"I'm at level four, George.

457
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:53,905
I knew last night that
we had a new job.

458
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:57,906
I am now a goop
instead of Charisma.

459
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,907
You're a good tunt, George.

460
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:02,508
While you've been
a tunt long.

461
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:05,009
It must be hard to accept
that you have been exceeded

462
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,410
an employee
younger and capable.

463
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:09,611
I hope not take it badly
for being a woman.

464
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,412
Are you gonna bother with that, George? "

465
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:13,413
No.

466
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:16,214
He has a good
relationship with Charisma.

467
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:18,215
Relations which I hope to develop.

468
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,016
The new tunt should work with
harder now.

469
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:23,217
And I do not want
problem between us.

470
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:25,218
Understood?

471
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:29,219
Shipping rules and would like to
get back after lunch. "

472
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,820
Jeffers Morning!, Level two,
three and four. A sad announcement:

473
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:37,621
After showing a low
gradual productivity

474
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,022
Charisma, a goop level four
Jeffers left the corporation.

475
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:45,023
The good news is that
Cindy, a level three tunt

476
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,024
was promoted
is now a goop.

Congratulations Cindy!

Hello Rodger.

492

I was with this
girl the other night.

493
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:36,253
She was to contact you.

494
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:41,454
In my package.
Right? Right?

495
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:46,955
Really ...
Tensions are high.

496
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,956
Let's see what we can work.

497

Two more times!

00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,658
Just calm down.
Relax.

499
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,159
This is a friend.

500
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,160
That's it.

501
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,161
It feels like work?
We are well, tiger?

502
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,162
The doctor still thinks
will you explode?

503
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:25,663
Well Well This means that
treatment is working.

504
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:30,664
Remove the cream in dermatological
softening and exfoliating.

505
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,665
Sleep well?

506
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,666
Can not say. My choice is ...

507
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,667
What about sex?

508
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,668
Can not say. My choice is ...

509
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,169
Want to be happy, George?

510
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,470
Are you sure you did not return
want to resign?

511
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,471
Because I'm feeling

512
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:02,672
'm not feeling

513
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:06,673

514
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:11,074
You know what I'm
feel in this room?

515
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,275
M.E.R.D.A. George.

516
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:16,676
Know what
M.E.R.D.A. means?

517
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,677
M.E.R.D.A. means

518
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,578
someone
not feel lucky

519
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,179
live in
great country

520
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,180
and that makes all the
difference for us.

521
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,381
Who do not have any luck
work for Jeffers coorporação.

522
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,382
Sort of having a woman

523
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,583
is able and willing.

524
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:38,584
The luck of having a home.

525
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,485
Driving a car,
boat.

526
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:43,486
Golf.

527
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:47,787
A lucky to have wonderful conversations
with people like me.

528
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:52,788
You know why I feel that there M.E.R.D.A. George?

529
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:57,989
Because someone is not struggling enough!

530
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,990
When I came assured
that wouldn 't explode.

531
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:10,791
And is your life, friend,
your career

532
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,492
and this is my job.

533
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,993
You will need a
little faith?

534
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:19,994
An effort?

535
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:22,995
No?

536
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:23,996

539
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,099
Faith

540
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,000
Good! Let me, to end,
give you a little advice

541
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,701
to close this session.

542
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:50,902
It is quite natural desire
sex, George.

543
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:53,503
The man who does not want sex

544
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:55,504
is a man who does not believe
the world you live.

545
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,505
He does not believe in the future.

546
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:02,506
A man who does not want sex
is a man without hope.

547
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,507
Without faith.

548
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:10,508
A man without sex is ...

549
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:16,509
He is not a man Complect.
He is not a man Complect, George.

550
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,510
Is.

551
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,011
Well

552
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:28,012
Rodger, the crazy, wasted
the patient still, is it?

553
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:30,813
I want you to do something for me.

554
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:32,714
Promise me you'll try.

555
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:39,515
Today à night when you go out, I
I want you to go to the fourth

556
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:41,616
want to grab your wife

557
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,617
and I want you ...

558
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:51,618
I want to do that.

559
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:39,219
Sara!

560
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,720
I promise to do it!

561
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:47,721
 

562
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,022
That's what I like to hear.

563
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:58,023

"Uder Norman"
"Instructions"

565
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:15,025
Outer space is empty
all thoughts and desires.

566
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:18,026
As your life is
empty and meaningless.

567
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:20,127
You can enjoy it only

568
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,028
special connection with the universe.

569

Using the hat 12 hours a day.

570
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,330
See DVD manual washing.

571
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,131
"Welcome à corporation Jeffers."

572
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:15,532
"The biggest, most friendly and more
profitable enterprise of mankind. "

573
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:37,533
Jeffers Morning!

574
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,534
I have this bad boy all night.

575
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,535
It is assumed that reduces the
stres and the bad energy

576
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:46,536
by 15 percent.

00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,537
Comes with white arms.

578
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:57,338
George Washington Winsterhammerman
Visionary speech level three.

581
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,441
Standards settlement Charisma "

582
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:16,442
Jeffers Morning!

583
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,443
"Jeffers Morning, levels two and three.

584
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,744
Are trying to find

585

00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,949
Mr.. Jeffers is excited

598
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:18,158
How old are you?

599
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,159
Grapes and blackberries.

600
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,160
Today, it is a beautiful day?

601
00:46:16,768 --> 00:46:18,768
General!
General!

602
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:19,717
We have problems, sir.

603
00:46:19,718 --> 00:46:23,318
- Can you tell me ...?
- Yes, sir!

604
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:24,319
.

605
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,020
There are two possible
breaks in the position here

606
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,032
in the field.
The Big Boss was maintained.

607
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:31,939
General Putnam were appointed
but those damn Tuntas.

608
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
Convicted Tuntas!

609
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:36,241
Are facing the enemy
on the battlefield, Lord.

00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:39,442
I want Hamilton.

611
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:41,543
I want the Hamilton and Jefferson.

- Come on! Come!
- Yes, sir.

614
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:50,446
General! We have a problem
with men, sir.

615
00:46:50,447 --> 00:46:52,047
The men are stopped, sir.

616
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:53,048
He was working

617
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,649
with a unit which could not
move out of Boston, sir.

618
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,950
Not pass! No!

619
00:46:56,951 --> 00:47:00,951
Let's sing and dance
Queen forever, sir.

620
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,952
Tell the men who have faith!

621
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,953
Not too aware that victory ...
... conscience, Mr.

622
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:08,654
Tell the men
General has a plan.

623
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:10,955
to defeat the English
before sunrise

624
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:12,356
tomorrow.

625
00:47:12,357 --> 00:47:12,957
Flat!

626
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,958
Go.!

627
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:30,659
The future is good. No way out.

628
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
Defeated and crying.

629
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:36,661
Now, I write
this wonder.

630
00:47:39,062 --> 00:47:41,662

631
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:52,063
Listen George. Look.

632
00:47:56,064 --> 00:48:02,664
Hey George!
You'll be okay?

633
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:19,165
By Berne.

634
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:23,666
A race to happiness
did not return to health.

635
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:29,667
Hello!

636

Of course. I confirm that more
300 people died.

famous coach.

642
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:53,374
They told me that reached us

00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:56,375
video of the last moments of Berne.

644
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:58,676

Hang, turn off the phone now.

647
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,679

648
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,980

00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:12,681
Turn off the TV! Now.

651

Get off me!

652
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:20,484
You know how I spent the money?
I had sent.

653
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:22,485
Want to know?

654
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:27,786
Spent with prostitutes.
In pills

655
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:30,287
In gaming machines.

656

I do not know how they got here.

663
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:13,995
I think

664
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:19,996
somewhere
within you

665
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:25,597
part of you

666
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:28,998
asks to hear.

667
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:50,999
I've done this before ...
a dream.

668
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
George.
Hear George. Look.

669
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,501
Mary. How are you?
- Okay!

670
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:27,002
Are you sad?
- Nao. No.

671
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,003
You are in pain?

672
00:51:33,004 --> 00:51:35,504
Cut what you were hurt?

673
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:42,305
Standards of extermination of Charisma

674
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:44,506
It is enough, enough.
Good girl!

675
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:46,507
Are seeing the inhibitor
recently developed.

676
00:51:46,508 --> 00:51:48,908
Remove all the pain,
thought and emotion

677
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:53,309
and will gain instant happiness.

678
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,710
Feel they can
be in danger of exploding,

679
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,711
please, please
contact with your supervisor.

680
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:00,712
Maria was not happy
before loading.

681
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:04,014
But now:

682
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:06,015
Inhibitors Jeffers REM
comes in three great colors:

683
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,816
"Charisma. 213 River Street,
Lot 37 "

684
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:13,017
Orange, blue and red.

685
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:21,018
"AM 1440
music of the past. "

686
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:26,519
"To push
your soul and help you to see. "

687
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
Lot 37. "

688
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,620
"Hi George. Hello
Charisma, level four. "

689
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:20,621
"I tried to talk to you before.
I noticed that you arrive early. "

690
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:23,622
"Ah. Yes, I ..."

691
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:29,623
I have a new job.

692
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:35,024
Goodbye George.

693
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:09,625
Hello! What do you want?

694
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:15,607
Here it is.
- Sorry.

695
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:25,883
Well Anything else?

696
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,326
Good! Return later.

697
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:03,785
Excuse me.
Sorry.

698
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:06,786
George?

699
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:10,787
George Washington Winsterhamerman?

700
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,788
 ... I did not want to bother you.

701
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:20,789
We --
Wait, wait a second.

702
00:56:26,227 --> 00:56:30,264
This is the business of my father.

703
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:46,209
You are as I imagined.

704
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:49,712
and I?

705
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:56,149
Probably not think
would be in a place like this.

706
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,818
Perhaps a more sophisticated site.

707
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:02,019
Something suitable for a
goop level 4.

708
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,020
What I'm saying?

709
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:11,621
I did not want to bother you?

710
00:57:11,622 --> 00:57:13,622
Were spying on me. Right?

711
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:16,823
Sitting there.
Trying to decide to go or not.

712
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,424
Should be angry with you?

713
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,941
How you doing, George?

714
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:48,942
Todd exploded.

715
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:53,943
Cindy was promoted.

716
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:01,944
and

717
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,600
I dreamed you.

718
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:00,581
In my dream

719
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,556
levavas me to a place.

720
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,169
Sorry. I should not say that.

721
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:18,424
I must be crazy.
I do not know.

722
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:21,785
It has a ring on his finger and ...

723

Task number 9 000
place an order by phone.

724

"There will be a hysteria
total country, in this city.

725
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:14,758
Exactly where you live.
This is the answer: no ... "

726
01:00:21,273 --> 01:00:24,097
Jeffers Morning.

727
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,070
Employees Jeffers Morning.
I am here to make an announcement,

728
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:37,603
in relation to speech
presidential à last night.

729
01:00:38,423 --> 01:00:41,064
After assessing the tragic
Goodman death Bern

730
01:00:41,164 --> 01:00:45,019
and the resulting chaos, our
President declared that the explosions

731
01:00:45,135 --> 01:00:47,172
a threat
to our way of life

732
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:50,106
and approved the implementation
 inhibitor.

733
01:00:50,206 --> 01:00:53,062
In the following areas chaotic.

734
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:55,290
"Area 37"

735
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,538
We here at Corporation
Jeffers, we

736
01:00:57,638 --> 01:00:59,607
fully measure.

737
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,609
Using
inhibitors mark Jeffers

738
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:03,087
in underdeveloped areas

739
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:06,960
will dramatically improve
the dangerous passions.

740
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,528
And more importantly,
show us the vision

741
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:14,841
of a happy future that awaits us.

742
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:17,098
And in accordance with
the president's agenda,

743
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:19,102
advert to my own initiative.

744
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:22,709
An official of the corporation
Jeffers demonstrating behaviors

745
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:27,212
explosives or potentially problematic --
ticos will be expelled immediately. "

746
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:32,501
"The right to information
the underdeveloped areas. "

747
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:39,539
I can not wait to see
the vision of our leader

748
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,286
on an explosive life and freedom. "

749
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,546
"Happiness is being happy.

750
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:24,297
"Happiness is to be happy?"

751
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,775
"What the hell, how
I do this? "

752
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:30,813
This is nonsense.

753
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,419
"I, Agena. So much butter."

754
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:37,411
...

755
01:02:37,511 --> 01:02:41,036
"Happiness is to be happy?"

756
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,551
"That crazy as this?"

757
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,701
"What the devil ..."

758
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:33,491
Task number 800 with butter.

759
01:03:57,016 --> 01:04:00,550
Care.
Care.

760
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:28,531
Want to sit?

761
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:37,710
The FBI is in the forest.

762
01:04:38,076 --> 01:04:40,112
I think it will make a
incursion here.

763
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:50,141
They have been coming.

764
01:04:50,203 --> 01:04:53,684
Since the president made
a notice of the inhibitors

765
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:56,599
someone spread the word
there was a party

766
01:04:58,156 --> 01:05:00,709
or revolution taking place here.

767
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:04,139
It is the policy.

768
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,609
At least I have
the right to name it.

769
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:14,428
Even without know are
to do the same as the others.

770
01:05:14,863 --> 01:05:16,948
Only with a different name.

771
01:05:18,676 --> 01:05:20,961
Entertain.

772
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:26,566
Losing lying.

773
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:36,542
Nobody cares
the defect, or dreams.

774
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:57,702
He used them as models.

775
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,674
You know, the toy soldiers.

776
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:06,683
I did a re -
When Washington crossed the Delaware.

777
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:13,610
The night of the passage, Washington
had a vision.

778
01:06:16,218 --> 01:06:18,459
The other night I had this dream.

779
01:06:19,638 --> 01:06:23,240
I was in your store à
night, before I cross

780
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,704
appeared a woman,
whom he worked.

781
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:36,558
And try to show me something.

782
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:40,135
And the next day I went to see it.

783
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:43,682
There was a time
the restaurant

784
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:48,999
hands
were near the mine.

785
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,506
And I thought

786
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,680
would play into the hands

787
01:06:57,227 --> 01:06:59,301
How to get a

788
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:02,886
pool of deep water.

789
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,799
She is the woman with whom I worked.

790
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,204
At four goop.

791
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:15,139
But when she said she felt.

792
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:20,384
Well, I know.

793
01:07:22,343 --> 01:07:24,980
I'm not sure if
she has not touched his hand.

794
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:29,201
And if there was some promise
in the dream, I did not.

795
01:07:29,582 --> 01:07:31,999
I saw it, but saw nothing more.

796
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:02,054
"See, with the
recently developed inhibitor

797

Oh, George! How could
thought I could beat us?

801
01:08:10,245 --> 01:08:11,610
I bleed!

802
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,762
Did not I tell?
Dreams are not real.

803
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,021
I never wanted

804
01:08:17,249 --> 01:08:19,828

The use of new inhibitors.

Sorry
I should not say that.

809
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,292
It does not matter.

810
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:41,727
I thought if I came here,
show me.

811
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:47,321
Well, what you see?

812

01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:51,078
Hey!

828
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:57,498
Need 1 776 minutes of productivity

829
01:10:57,598 --> 01:10:59,967
for the weekend.

830
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:05,860
"News 1440 AM, bad news
my soul mate

831
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,689
from tomorrow AM 1440

832
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:11,724
will stop playing music.

833
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:14,454
The producers asked me
to read as follows:

834
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:17,498
The president raised
the risk of explosion

835
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:19,362
from dark brown to magenta.

836
01:11:19,495 --> 01:11:25,632
We do not want someone explode
in underdeveloped areas

837
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:30,254
where there are castles
Breaded old

838
01:11:30,843 --> 01:11:33,560
and women in bikinis.

839
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:42,935
Howard!

840
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:05,758
Of course we want our
women die as rats

841
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:13,246
in the basement and our
men like wolves in the mountains.

842
01:13:13,004 --> 01:13:14,678
She's dead.

843
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:30,128
He put the gun in his mouth,
apologized, pressed the trigger

844
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:32,652
opened the brain.

845
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:42,730
So I put the gun in my mouth,
I apologized and pressed the trigger.

846
01:13:44,137 --> 01:13:46,045
As in the book.

847
01:13:46,137 --> 01:13:48,474
Love ...
Shut up!

848
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,487
I've been sitting all
the afternoon trying to explode.

849
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:58,575
But I can not. I can not
Do it because there is nothing in me.

850
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,813
Nothing more.

851
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:02,368
And I realized.
Nobody says

852
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:05,201
people who are
explode are not sick

853
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:07,566
are not cursed
or dangerous.

854
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:08,837
They are better than us, because

855
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:12,177
I still feel something,
still dream of something.

856
01:14:12,497 --> 01:14:15,377
Something that does not go out
a haircut,

857
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,491
with coffee
milk, with this kind of ...

858
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,101
and then back
grow

859
01:14:19,348 --> 01:14:22,575
and a husband who did not return
can get an erection.

860
01:14:23,694 --> 01:14:29,336
See? Nothing.
There is nothing left.

861
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:49,622
Damn. I lost it!

862
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:51,946
Want to hear the worst?

863
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:55,160
The last time I felt
alive was the day we met.

864
01:14:55,426 --> 01:14:57,589
At this meeting, the meeting of 30.

865
01:14:57,872 --> 01:14:58,915
I was drunk.

866
01:14:58,917 --> 01:15:01,867
I walked around drunk every day
this month.

867
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:04,263
You know?

868
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:07,646
And it asks you to
your degree

869
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,091
and finger
mean on your shirt

870
01:15:10,115 --> 01:15:13,308
and talking about
George Washington Winsterhammerman.

871
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,609
And I thought, because
did not return venture.

872
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:19,708
So desperate sat
my room

873
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,543
with a gun in his hand
I wanted to kill me!

874
01:16:22,373 --> 01:16:24,564
I've been there long enough.

875
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:57,389
George Washington Winsterhammerman?

876
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:01,748
Level Three?

877
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:09,660
It's amazing.

878
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,986
I'm proud of the
My concentration

879
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:18,452
the ability
focus my mind

880
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:22,804
and my body
in any subject

881
01:17:22,836 --> 01:17:26,780
without touching anything
without seeing or

882
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,140
that is outside
my vision.

883
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:31,603
Make sense?

884
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:34,693
Now
I am looking for man

885
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:37,430
Mr. Jeffers
saw a tunt.

886
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:43,907
And I ...
I do not.

887
01:17:46,006 --> 01:17:47,335
And I worry, because

888
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:50,871
there is a shit
war approaching, tunt.

889
01:17:51,008 --> 01:17:55,650
A war that will decide whether
Company Profile - Look at me!

890
01:17:55,896 --> 01:18:01,473
- Continue to follow the course
given by Mr. Jeffers

891
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:06,361
or otherwise maneirao gives
resulted in a huge mess.

892
01:18:10,411 --> 01:18:12,500
So far we have
good looking men

893
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,359
to help us in this process.

894
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,521
We have not thought much about you.

895
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,805
We did not even
existed, but

896
01:18:23,647 --> 01:18:25,089
but then

897
01:18:27,642 --> 01:18:33,982
Gave us that.

898
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:50,921
"Please draw a
image of his vision of the future. "

899
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:55,427
Mr. Jeffers
very much enjoyed this design.

900
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:06,480
She is out there waiting Distributor.

901
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:27,691
Pretty, is not it?

902
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:35,174
Do not be afraid.

903
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,378
My muscles are big.

904
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,542
But only exercise I sweat.

905
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,516
Want something?

906
01:19:49,029 --> 01:19:53,271
Soda? Alcohol?

907
01:19:56,994 --> 01:20:01,663
Normally I do not
I show my staff.

908
01:20:01,702 --> 01:20:07,216
In the past, had effects
negative impact on productivity.

909
01:20:07,311 --> 01:20:08,910
But times are changing.

910
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:11,571
Now show me
my staff.

911
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,063
Like now.

912
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:15,502
Employees who I can trust.

913
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:19,545
As you approach a fight
to save our way of life.

914
01:20:20,205 --> 01:20:23,152
As much as I believe
of inhibitors

915
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:27,958
and some laws,
that would stop the chaos

916
01:20:28,696 --> 01:20:34,882
all studies show
the war has begun.

917
01:20:35,426 --> 01:20:39,901
Many confused
and many stupid people,

918
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,948
out there, and began to question

919
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,082
began to think!

920
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:55,262
Thank you.

921
01:20:55,660 --> 01:21:01,156
In analyzing the learned
and what others know

922
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:02,555
and that is a
fundamental truth

923
01:21:02,772 --> 01:21:07,483
that there is a union in the world,
where men have evolved

924
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:10,873
beyond the emotions,
become enthusiastic

925
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:14,294
opponents of our system,
where there

926
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,621
dreams or explosions,

927
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,966
because there are no actions or
independent thinking.

928
01:21:22,013 --> 01:21:29,390
Of course, the real
peace can exist.

929
01:21:42,335 --> 01:21:46,287
What you thought
when designing this to you?

930
01:21:49,924 --> 01:21:51,553
Dreams of death.

931
01:21:54,006 --> 01:21:56,587
Suffers pain?

932
01:21:56,975 --> 01:21:58,080
Yes

933
01:21:58,098 --> 01:21:59,934
Part of you is angry.

934
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:10,185
I like you, tuntia.

935
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:17,742
I'll show you how
can have the peace you want,

936
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:22,628
and live in the world
know is coming.

937
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:30,015
Do this and your pain will stop.

938
01:22:30,844 --> 01:22:34,186
It will not have another dream
for the rest of your life.

939
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:57,999
"Shoot what you love."

940
01:23:16,717 --> 01:23:18,346
"Month of TunT"

941
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:07,032
Hello! Welcome to Isadora.

942
01:24:07,095 --> 01:24:08,861
I would like to eat something?

943
01:24:09,184 --> 01:24:13,653
Please. Here
no place to sit.

944
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,488
Thank you. Not a good night?
Be right back.

945
01:24:18,698 --> 01:24:20,661
Wait. Do not you remember?

946
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,545
It was a weird before?

947
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:25,919
Yes
- Great!

948
01:24:26,527 --> 01:24:28,207
I wonder if I
to take a walk.

949
01:24:28,233 --> 01:24:30,445
I like walks.
What kind of ride?

950
01:24:30,506 --> 01:24:33,145
A boat trip.

951
01:24:37,226 --> 01:24:39,368
Want something to drink?

952
01:25:00,997 --> 01:25:05,180
Do not know if I'll understand.

953
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:14,481
But, of all places in the world
I'd rather be here in the boat. Water.

954
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:25,775
I met her in
restaurant of his father.

955
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,184
Was sitting in
table like this.

956
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:35,531
With our hand
next, as now.

957
01:25:40,411 --> 01:25:45,196
I'll take it. Now, let's see.

958
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:55,129
I'll put it again
to stop the pain of both.

959
01:26:13,754 --> 01:26:15,314
Charisma.

960
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:19,269
Want something to drink?

961
01:26:37,135 --> 01:26:42,678
"AM 1440 music of the past. Well,

962

my friends, I'm saying goodbye. "

963
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:51,698
Nothing. Nothing more.

"Tomorrow I have come to be the Lord
Happiness, at the hour of comedy Slap.

965

We will miss the wonderful ...
