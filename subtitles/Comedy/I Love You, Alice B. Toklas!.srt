1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,602
<i>Flower in the crannied wall</i>
<i>I pluck you out of the crannies</i>

2
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:25,238
<i>I hold you here, root and all, in my hand</i>
<i>Little flower...</i>

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,642
<i>But if I could understand</i>

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:34,281
<i>What you are, root and all, and all in all</i>

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:38,485
<i>I should know what God and man is.</i>

6
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:44,100
- Beautiful. Is that Ginsberg?
- No, Tennyson.

7
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,362
<i>But if I could understand</i>

8
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:51,497
<i>What you are, root and all, and all in all</i>

9
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:56,477
<i>I should know what God and man is.</i>

10
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:01,017
So to know God, to know man...

11
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:04,313
...you first have to know
what a flower is.

12
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,548
A flower.

13
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,753
But how can you know
what a flower is...

14
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,395
...unless you know who you are?

15
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,532
Who are you?
Do you know who you are?

16
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,141
We must find a way...

17
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:49,252
...to send our love messages
to them...

18
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,847
...before it's too late.

19
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,386
We must turn them on to love.

20
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,753
Send them love flowers.

21
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,261
Turn them into love junkies.

22
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,323
<i>We must hug and kiss them</i>
<i>in the streets...</i>

23
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:08,768
<i>... in their houses, in their offices,</i>
<i>in their minds.</i>

24
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,873
Harold.

25
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,707
Do you know
what happened this time?

26
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,376
- What?
- The earth moved for me.

27
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,715
Like in Hemingway.

28
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,651
Did the earth move for you?

29
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,361
No, I don't think so.

30
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,124
I didn't satisfy you?

31
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,029
Of course you satisfied me.

32
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:42,901
It was just that the earth
didn't move this time, that's all.

33
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,201
But it has moved in the past?

34
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,312
Oh, Joyce, you know,
many times, many times.

35
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,278
- When?
- Well...

36
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:55,811
You know, a couple
of weeks ago, it moved.

37
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:01,621
We must psychedelicize
their impoverished dreams.

38
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,726
Teach them how to live again.

39
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:07,422
Make them stop playing
the ego game.

40
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:12,900
Teach them how to die
so that they can be born again.

41
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,801
<i>So that they can become</i>
<i>a flower again.</i>

42
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,537
Harold?

43
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,368
Is your asthma bothering you?

44
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:26,711
I have a little tickle right now, yeah.

45
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,712
Harold?

46
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,422
- Do you wanna get married or not?
- Sure.

47
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,455
Well, then let's name a date.

48
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,183
I gave you an area.

49
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:41,354
An area is certainly not a date.

50
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:44,023
I know what an area is,
and I know what a date is...

51
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,397
...and an area is not a date.

52
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,300
- All right.
- I'll tell you something.

53
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:51,100
You've given me
enough areas in my life...

54
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,869
...but I have yet
to get a date from you.

55
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,946
I know from areas,
but what I want is a date.

56
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:59,912
Okay, when do you wanna
get married?

57
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:02,109
How about Thanksgiving?

58
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:04,220
Hey, look at that.

59
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,787
- What is that?
- Somebody...

60
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:09,415
Whose car is that?
I'm pinned in here. I can't get out.

61
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,461
Oh, my goodness.
Who would do a dumb thing like that?

62
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,928
- Well, that's stupid.
- Terrible.

63
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,932
You could maybe try to get out,
do you think, Harold?

64
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:19,501
- Harold?
- Help me back up.

65
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,172
- Sure, I will, darling.
- Because I'll never make it.

66
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,434
You know, Harold, my parents
were married on Thanksgiving.

67
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,771
I thought maybe
it would make them happy...

68
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:30,470
...if we had the same anniversary.

69
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,583
Go right, Harold. Try to go right.

70
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:36,811
- Yeah, okay.
- Turn to the right.

71
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,650
- Gee, I don't think you're gonna make it.
- I'll try.

72
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,816
- Well, try. Yes.
- Well, I can get right up close to it.

73
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,792
All right, keep going to the right.

74
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:49,322
- What?
- Harold, come on, now.

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,727
You're gonna hit that car.

76
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,698
Where is that son of a bitch?

77
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,605
Look at that. I'm pinned in.

78
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:03,336
Harold, what about Thanksgiving?

79
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:06,107
- For what?
- For what? For our wedding.

80
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,951
Can you imagine somebody...

81
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,611
...leaving a car like that
in a situation like this?

82
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,222
Boy, that is really smart.

83
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,121
Boy, that is really a clever way
to change the subject.

84
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:19,195
Don't be paranoid, Joyce.
I didn't make this situation.

85
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,661
Are you crazy or something?

86
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,194
Take me home.

87
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,336
- Oh, that's great. That's great.
- What?

88
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:28,131
I'm pinned in. I can't move.

89
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:31,833
Take her home. Where are you?

90
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:35,245
Harold, you could move
if you wanted to move...

91
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,211
...because man is the master
of his own existence.

92
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:41,811
You're afraid.
You are afraid to move, Harold.

93
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:43,886
Now, look, Harold.

94
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,649
Harold, I have made
my commitment to you.

95
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,554
I have given you my mind...

96
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:52,689
...and my body.

97
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,558
Joyce.

98
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:58,257
I am 33 years old. Now, that's not
an easy thing for me to say.

99
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,366
Will you please stop talking
for just one minute?

100
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:05,633
- Help me push this car out of the way.
- I just wanna know one thing, Harold.

101
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,675
- One thing, is all I wanna know.
- What?

102
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:11,974
Am I going to be your wife, or am I
going to continue to be your concubine?

103
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:15,183
- Don't give me that concubine stuff.
- It's all right.

104
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:18,412
- What is it going to be?
- You think I'm an Arab or something?

105
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:22,319
That's funny. Just to be funny now.
I'm asking you to answer my question.

106
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,992
Harold, you give me
an answer now or it's over.

107
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,493
Will you just help me?

108
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,495
Otherwise, we're gonna be
stuck here.

109
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,032
Self. You always think of yourself.

110
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,532
- I'm helping you now.
- You're not helping me.

111
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,172
- Put your hand behind...
- I had my hand here.

112
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,934
- What do you want me to do?
- When I tell you, push.

113
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,504
- Now, push when I say push.
- I'm doing that.

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,705
Now, I'm releasing the hand brake.

115
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,849
Now, push.

116
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,626
How about Labor Day?

117
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:59,387
For what?

118
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:00,928
For getting married.

119
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,131
Harold!

120
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,790
Oh, Harold!

121
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,493
Oh, Harold!

122
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:12,300
We're getting married. Labor Day?

123
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,739
You happy?

124
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,949
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, yeah.

125
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,275
I can let you use this
until we fix you up.

126
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,422
- You sure this is all you have?
- Yep. Belongs to my kid.

127
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,921
He was supposed
to take the night shift.

128
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,856
Big shot ran off to San Francisco
with a colored girl.

129
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,620
My wife's going crazy.

130
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:36,858
But, I mean,
I can't drive around in this.

131
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,798
I have to go to my office.
I have to go to court tomorrow.

132
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,131
I'm sorry,
that's all I've got, Mr. Fine.

133
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,740
And then suddenly,
tonight it all fell into place.

134
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,537
And he was...

135
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,873
He was like a man, Mama.
You know what I mean?

136
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,676
He was a man
who knew what he wanted.

137
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,718
Look, relax, she'll run fine.

138
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:02,157
- She'll run fine, don't worry about it.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,987
And jiggle the key when you get in.

140
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:07,494
- Harold, my mother is hysterical.
- Yeah?

141
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,030
What kind of a car is this?

142
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,757
It's all they have.

143
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,597
What? Are you telling me
that this is all that you have?

144
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:18,173
- I'm sorry. That's all we've got.
- Harold, come on, this is ridiculous.

145
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:21,004
It's only for two days, Joyce.

146
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:24,545
Well, you live long enough,
you see everything.

147
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:28,515
- Listen, Harold...
- Make sure you have my car soon.

148
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:31,519
- Leave that to me.
- Maybe we can get her to cater a dinner.

149
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,021
She may smoke a little,
but don't worry about it.

150
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,887
I was thinking
maybe a wedding breakfast.

151
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,086
You know, like Marilyn Bachrach had.

152
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,149
Good morning, Mr. Fine.

153
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,520
- Hiya, Harold.
- Good morning, Murray.

154
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:10,854
Hey, I finally beat Jerry Ritzlin, 7-5.

155
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,825
My serve is starting to work for me.

156
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:18,023
And my elbow doesn't hurt anymore,
which means I am now hitting it right.

157
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:21,171
You know I was serving
with a bent elbow?

158
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,604
That's what screwed me up.

159
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:27,005
But now... coming straight over.

160
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,371
You okay, kid?

161
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,482
I'm fine.

162
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,884
- No, I'm okay.
- You've got that look.

163
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,494
What look?

164
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:49,165
You know, when you get fakakta.

165
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,336
Joyce and I
are getting married Labor Day.

166
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,408
That's great. That is just great.

167
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,209
I think it's the right move.

168
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,870
The right move?
You should've done it two years ago.

169
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,176
Labor Day, huh? No harm.

170
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,979
You are getting
a wonderful woman in Joycie.

171
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,588
Good morning, Mr. Burns.
Good morning, Mr. Fine.

172
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,855
Good morning.
Come here, you beautiful creature.

173
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,088
Oh, Murray.

174
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,233
I'm gonna attack you
before the wedding.

175
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,867
Oh, he told you. He told you.

176
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,004
- Half a cup of black, Joycie.
- Alrighty.

177
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,402
- Are the Rodriguezes here?
- They're in the other office.

178
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,669
- All right.
- Could I see you for a minute?

179
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,242
Would you prepare the Rodriguez file,
please, Joyce.

180
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:40,212
I've already done that.

181
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,581
Would you just read this
for a moment, Mr. Fine?

182
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,449
There you are.

183
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:50,683
"Mr. And Mrs. Bernard Miller request
the honor of your presence"...

184
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,886
They've got them already, huh?

185
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,156
But read on, read on.

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,269
"...at the marriage of their daughter
Joyce to Mr. Harold Fine..."

187
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,372
At the Twin Cantors.

188
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,808
- They really twins?
- Oh, yes.

189
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,569
Harold, they're very expensive...

190
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,772
...but they perform
the most beautiful ceremony.

191
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:14,174
Are they fraternal or identical?

192
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:18,488
Well, they're not identical.

193
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:21,419
No, I don't think that they are.

194
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,551
I'm just doing it for my father.

195
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,491
You see, I felt that
that's the least that we could do.

196
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,561
I feel that you really
don't want them.

197
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,927
If you don't want them,
I want you to tell me...

198
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,001
The very thought
of cantors in stereo...

199
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:36,730
...instead of a mono cantor
appeals to me.

200
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,075
Oh, Harold.

201
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,800
Oh, I love you.

202
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,806
- Hey, Joyce, where's my coffee?
- I love you.

203
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:49,942
- Please, no sex in the office.
- Oh, Murray. Honestly.

204
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,519
Would you send in
the Rodriguez twins... Family, please?

205
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,286
Yes, sir, Mr. Fine.

206
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,560
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

207
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,365
Mr. Fine will see you now.
This way.

208
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,378
Thank you.

209
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,139
You're welcome.

210
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,548
Hello, Mr. Rodriguez.

211
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,518
Well, I'm sorry
about the shortage of chairs...

212
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,790
...but this won't take too long.
Perhaps you'd be...

213
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,497
- able to sit over here.

214
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:49,544
Good, good.

215
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,577
Right, right. Now, then...

216
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:58,983
Mr. Rodriguez, I'm going down
to court in a few minutes.

217
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:05,693
I am going down to court
in a few minutes...

218
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:09,229
...and before I go,
I would like you all to know...

219
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,390
...to <i>comprendo...</i>

220
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:15,902
...the insurance company
want to settle out of court.

221
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,801
How much money, Senor Fine?

222
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,704
Well...

223
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,302
I would think it's safe
to assume that we'll get...

224
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,880
...about $500 per person.

225
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:30,652
Now, there were 11 of you in the car,
so that would be around $5500.

226
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:33,823
I ain't going to do it.
You told me $ 100,000.

227
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,322
I told you we would sue for 100,000.

228
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,983
We're lucky to get that amount.

229
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:41,062
Remember, there were
11 of you in that car.

230
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:44,062
If that ever came out in court,
we might lose the case.

231
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:47,566
- But he hit us from behind.
- Yeah, but you had no rearview vision.

232
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,238
You couldn't see out the back.

233
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,603
Of course I couldn't.
The chickens were in the back seat.

234
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,243
That is also illegal.

235
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:57,902
It is not permitted in this country
to carry poultry in a passenger car.

236
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,854
No <i>gallinas</i> are allowed in this country
in a passenger car.

237
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,955
- You've gotta have them in...
- Harold.

238
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,356
Ma?

239
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,731
Ma?

240
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,065
- What's the matter?
- Yesterday, a living, breathing man...

241
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,762
...the picture of health.

242
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:27,436
Oh, Ma, no.

243
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,604
No, no, no.

244
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:40,383
- Mama...
- Sixty-one years old and they took him.

245
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:45,324
My father!
My poor, sweet old father.

246
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,656
What father? No.

247
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,801
Mr. Foley. Ed Foley, the butcher.
He had a coronary.

248
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,527
What are you trying to do to me?

249
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:56,865
You tell me a 61 -year-old man
has just died.

250
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,472
I thought it was Papa.

251
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,004
I don't understand
what he's talking about.

252
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,843
My father says he mourns
the death of your father.

253
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,985
- It's a mistake, Mr. Rodriguez.
- I see you want me to leave.

254
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,644
I didn't say that.
You can stay as long as you like.

255
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,847
No, I haven't time.

256
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:16,720
I have to help Mrs. Foley
with the funeral arrangements.

257
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:19,828
- Who?
- Bite your tongue.

258
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,795
He doesn't remember Ed Foley.
You hear, Joycie?

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,231
He doesn't remember
how Ed Foley saved his life.

260
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,530
When you were 2 years old, we had
a candy store in Boyle Heights.

261
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,197
You fell off the stool.
You turned blue in the face.

262
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,571
We took you for dead,
you don't remember?

263
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:38,838
And then Ed Foley came and...
God bless his soul. God rest him.

264
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:43,544
- And he took you in his hands,
and he breathed life into your mouth.

265
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,711
He saved your life
and you don't remember.

266
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,187
Yeah, I remember now.
I remember Ed Foley now.

267
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,384
- Oh, you see, now he remembers.
- Leave it there, will you, Mama?

268
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,892
All right, I'm going.

269
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:58,057
- You'll come to the funeral tomorrow.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

270
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:02,194
The wedding
is September the 5th at 2:00.

271
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,766
Wedding?

272
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:09,612
What wedding?

273
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,270
We're getting married, Ma.

274
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,945
I have a daughter.
Now I have a daughter.

275
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,249
My father congratulates you
on your wedding.

276
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,788
Very kind of you.

277
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,120
See, I didn't understand that.

278
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:32,196
My grandfather says it is too bad your
father couldn't have lived to see it.

279
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,199
The whole thing
is a misunderstanding.

280
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,805
You get to invite 100,
and we get to invite 100.

281
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,737
One hundred?

282
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,471
Harold, you heard?
Harold? One hundred.

283
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,810
My people in Los Angeles alone,
I got more than 100.

284
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:49,885
And what about my <i>mishpokhe</i>
in Philadelphia?

285
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,720
Speak to your father.
Maybe I could get 20, 30 more.

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,428
You've got one extra
now that Mr. Foley can't come.

287
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,596
Mrs. Foley, I forgot she's waiting
for me downstairs.

288
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,326
- Harold, you'll come to the funeral.
- Yes, Mother.

289
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,969
And bring your brother. Bring Herbie.

290
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:11,163
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him in three months.

291
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:15,437
Herbie is with the bums in Venice.

292
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,533
Well, anyway, I'm glad
you're coming to the funeral.

293
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,931
It's gonna make Mama very happy.

294
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:43,368
Hey, I'm going to the funeral
because it's making me happy.

295
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,167
A funeral is a happy thing, Harold.

296
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:48,834
In death, there is always rebirth.

297
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,606
Yeah, well...

298
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,007
What is this, a hippie supermarket?

299
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,674
Yeah. See...

300
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:59,845
See, these things are for sale.
You can buy these things here.

301
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,718
See the clothes?

302
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:04,224
There, those clothes are free.

303
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,724
They're old.

304
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:09,798
They're new to him.

305
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:20,141
Really what you're trying to say,
it's a form of Communism.

306
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,245
No, no, no, it's like love.

307
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:30,380
- You think I should buy something?
- Only if you need something, Harold.

308
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:34,118
Yeah, well, maybe I'll buy a book.

309
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,430
Hey, Harold, this is a groovy book.

310
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,568

<i>Chairman Mao Zedong."</i>

311
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,069
Yeah.

312
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,773
- How much is that?
- That'll be a dollar, please.

313
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:55,707
- I'll take it.
- Thank you.

314
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:04,645
- It's for you.
- Oh, thank you.

315
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:14,426
Incidentally, I almost forgot
to tell you...

316
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:16,793
...that I'm...

317
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
I'm getting married.

318
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:28,474
Oh, that's groovy.
That's so groovy.

319
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:31,239
- To Joyce.
- Oh, Harold, that's great.

320
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,314
That's great.

321
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:42,018
He's just a kid. It's a stage.

322
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,683
When I was at NYU Law,
I lived in Greenwich Village.

323
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,522
Hippies. Used to be beatniks.

324
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,187
I saw those kids.
It's an act of rebellion.

325
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,866
I hope that's all it is.

326
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,229
He's probably got
a different girl every night.

327
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,064
I should have it so bad.

328
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:58,332
Look at that. Look at that one.

329
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,840
Unbelievable.

330
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:06,244
Oh, my darling,
a year's salary for 10 minutes.

331
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:08,110
Murray.

332
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,843
- Murray.
- What?

333
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,682
- What is your definition of love?
- What?

334
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,790
In relationship to marriage.

335
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,951
What love? Love is 10 minutes.
Love is before. Marriage is after.

336
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,829
You meet a girl one night, don't know
if you'll make it, that's love.

337
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,524
When you wake up in the morning,
that's marriage.

338
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,170
- Now you're talking about sex.
- Oh, no, Harold.

339
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:32,808
Marriage offers a man
the most beautiful moments in life.

340
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:36,011
You don't know
what a family is like.

341
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:39,611
Nobody can describe to you
the feeling when you see your first kid.

342
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,684
It's like... It's like nobody
ever had one before.

343
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:46,151
It's... Oh, my God.

344
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:48,447
Oh, I'd like to lily your lollies.

345
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,060
Oh, where do they come from?
What do they want from me?

346
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:54,162
Can't you stop for a second, Murray?

347
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,162
When they stop, I'll stop.

348
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:59,802
They know you're looking at them,
driving you crazy, and they love it.

349
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,734
How can you tell me
how beautiful marriage is...

350
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,397
...when you mentally rape
every woman who passes by?

351
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,873
What has my looking
have to do with my marriage?

352
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:11,377
- It's dishonest, Murray.
- No, it's not, Harold. No, it is not.

353
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:14,415
I love my wife and I love my kids.

354
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,909
And I love you.

355
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,116
You're an animal, Murray.
You're an animal.

356
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,496
Herbie will be right out.

357
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,367
Hi.

358
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:44,113
I'm Nancy.

359
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:45,878
How do you do?

360
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,277
Groovy car.

361
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:52,444
- Glad somebody likes it.
- What a beautiful day for a funeral.

362
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:55,022
Mars and Neptune
are at the 10th angle.

363
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,022
You're lucky.
And Mr. Foley's lucky...

364
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,991
...because by tomorrow
Saturn starts ingressing into Aries.

365
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,966
Pardon me, did you just say
that you knew Mr. Foley?

366
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,799
No. Herbie told me.

367
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,498
And he sounds like a beautiful man.

368
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,939
He picked Herbie up in his arms
and he breathed life into him.

369
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,371
- It's a beautiful thing to do.
- What are you talking about?

370
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,882
When Herbie fell off the stool
when you had a store in Boyle Heights.

371
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:24,577
He saved Herbie's life.

372
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,847
- He saved my life.
- You too?

373
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:31,086
- That man was a saint.
- Where did you get all this from?

374
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,161
You don't know how much
this funeral means to him.

375
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:38,065
Herbie is the most sensitive man
I've ever known.

376
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,295
- But then, all Scorpios are sensitive.
- Hiya, Harold.

377
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,345
What...? What...?

378
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:54,881
What are you trying to do to me,
kill your mother?

379
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:58,043
I'm wearing the traditional
burial outfit of the Hopi Indians.

380
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,280
It's beautiful.

381
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:02,725
Foley was a Catholic, not an Indian.

382
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,353
It's all the same.
It's all man and God. It's love.

383
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,133
Herbie.

384
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,172
Herbie.

385
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,811
Let me buy you a nice new suit.

386
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,807
Just for the funeral.

387
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,812
This is what I'm wearing, Harold.

388
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:38,524
Herbie, look...

389
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:42,889
...I realize that I'm a square.

390
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,034
- I know that, I know that.
- Yeah.

391
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:49,638
But you gotta understand
that there could be two sides to this.

392
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,203
I mean, you think?

393
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,538
How is Mrs. Foley gonna feel...?

394
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:59,312
I mean, how is she gonna feel
when she sees...

395
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,909
...Tonto at the cemetery?

396
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,646
Hey, Harold, I am not
wearing this to bug anybody.

397
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:08,882
I'm wearing it because
it's the right thing to wear.

398
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:11,458
Well, take that fakakta feather
out of your hair...

399
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:14,119
...and wash that stupid paint
off your face!

400
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,624
- Really uptight.
- I am!

401
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:21,237
Uptight, or whatever that is.

402
00:26:21,438 --> 00:26:23,497
Okay, okay. I'll tell you what.

403
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,868
I'll let you have
the feather or the paint.

404
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,566
You'll let me have the feather
or the paint?

405
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:38,643
Right.

406
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:44,155
Take the feather out of your hair.

407
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:54,903
Okay, put the feather back and
cover up the paint with your hands.

408
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:02,942
What do you think? I'm asking her.

409
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,942
Okay, get rid of the paint.

410
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:08,174
Wash it off. Hurry.

411
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:11,479
- I'm doing this because I love you.
- Yeah, fine. Great.

412
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,390
Where are you going?

413
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:27,835
- To the funeral.
- But you've never met Mr. Foley.

414
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:30,738
But I've never been to a funeral.

415
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:33,969
We are not going to the Ice Capades.

416
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:39,479
A man... A man, a human being,
is being buried under the ground.

417
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:41,981
But death can be
a beautiful experience.

418
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:45,552
And I want to experience
everything that's beautiful.

419
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:51,558
You're going crazy.

420
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:11,974
Mrs. Foley, we'll have transportation
within the hour.

421
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,312
- Oh, I hope so.
- They're in arbitration right now.

422
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:21,449
They wouldn't let him live in peace,
now they won't let him die in peace.

423
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:24,422
God help me,
I don't know what to do.

424
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:28,621
Forty years I've taken care of people
in their hour of need.

425
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,132
If you ask me, the unions are getting
as bad as management.

426
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:37,205
In the beginning, we needed unions.
Roosevelt understood that.

427
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,840
Some man, that Roosevelt.

428
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:43,172
Would you take care of Mrs. Foley
for a minute, please?

429
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,870
Excuse me, dear.

430
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:51,547
I can still see him
standing behind the counter.

431
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,211
God bless him.

432
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:57,291
- He loved his work so much.
- Oh, yes, yes.

433
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,861
I'm sorry to have to burden you
with these details.

434
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:04,465
Oh, where is the deceased now?

435
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:07,662
That's in the Valley, isn't it?

436
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:13,203
North on the San Diego Freeway.

437
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,874
Unfortunately, Mrs. Vincent...

438
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,344
...we are having
a slight transportation problem.

439
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,813
The drivers are out on strike.

440
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:27,985
Think of him. I'll never forget.
God rest his soul.

441
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,186
He'd never let me
buy anything a day old.

442
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,764
Oh, my Ed...

443
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,674
Hello, Papa.

444
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:50,012
I loved him like a brother.

445
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,774
- I know. I loved him like a husband.
- I know.

446
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:56,852
Dear Mrs. Foley...

447
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,689
...I am truly very sorry indeed.

448
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,418
I would like you to accept
my sincere condolences.

449
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:09,195
You remember my son Harold?

450
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,433
- Yes.
- And this is my...

451
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:19,873
What kind of
<i>meshuggenah</i> outfit is this?

452
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:22,874
I'm wearing the traditional
burial outfit of the Hopi Indians.

453
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,944
- What LSD clothes he's wearing.

454
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:27,275
Now LSD clothes
he's wearing to a funeral.

455
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,917
To a funeral, he wears his Indian suit.

456
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,020
You hate me that much?

457
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,882
I love you, Mom. I love you.

458
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,025
- Don't contradict your mother.
- I'm not contradicting her.

459
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:40,094
I could die right here.
He wants me in a box like that.

460
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:42,197
You'd be happy
if I'm in a box like that.

461
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:48,031
Would you have any way of getting
the deceased over here to our premises?

462
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:50,297
A Volkswagen?

463
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,903
I see.

464
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:56,239
Well, we'll do
the best we can, Mrs. Vincent.

465
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,380
Thank you.

466
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,975
- You hate me, that's why.
- Mama!

467
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,621
Mama! Mama, not in front
of Mrs. Foley!

468
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,603
- Everything is gonna be just fine now.
- Oh, yes, you'll see, Edna.

469
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:32,112
We'll be there in a few minutes.
My Harold will take care of everything.

470
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,853
- Let's get in the car.
- Don't worry, Edna.

471
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,421
You rotten scab!

472
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:01,370
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You hippie scab!

473
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:39,876
I was doing 35, officer.

474
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,780
What happened, a hippie die?

475
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:48,653
We're part of a funeral procession.
This is all perfectly legal.

476
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,088
- I'm a lawyer.
- Do you have a smog device?

477
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,590
I don't think so. This is a loaner.

478
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:57,254
- You have seven days to get one.
- Right.

479
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,561
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

480
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:05,400
- I love you, sir.
- He's only doing his job, Herbie.

481
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:06,667
I'm only doing mine.

482
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,834
Well...

483
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:13,744
...we lost the procession.

484
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,911
We're gonna have to hurry.

485
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:22,547
- What...? What cemetery is it at?
- I don't know.

486
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:25,751
Maybe there's an address
on the casket.

487
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,837
Is this the Foley funeral?

488
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,034
No, sir.

489
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,042
You can get out that way.

490
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:54,314
Oh, now, there's a cemetery
on Centinela.

491
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,788
Tell me when we get there.

492
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:02,227
- Oh, I think that's Centinela.
- No, no, that's Florence.

493
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,231
- Well, it looks like Centinela.
- Let's give them a lift.

494
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,665
No, we have no room.

495
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,395
But they could sit in the back.

496
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:14,872
Yeah, that's all I have to do,
give hippies and weirdoes lifts.

497
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,955
Don't you worry, we'll find it.

498
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:52,005
Don't you worry, we'll find it.

499
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,853
Don't you worry, we'll find it.

500
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,055
Oh, sh...

501
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,796
If this isn't it,
I have to get some gas.

502
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,876
- This is it.
- See, I told you he'd make it.

503
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,446
My goodness.

504
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:27,466
Herbie, this was not
the happiest of circumstances...

505
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,133
...but I'm glad that I saw you.

506
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:30,903
And I'll see you at the wedding.

507
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,344
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll be there.
- Oh, good.

508
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:35,517
And be sure to bring
your friend with you.

509
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,845
- Joyce, would you come on?
- Good night, now.

510
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:40,147
- Good night.
- I'm coming, I'm coming, Harold.

511
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,119
- Good night.
- Good night.

512
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:09,015
Oh, darling, I hope your headache
is better in the morning.

513
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,982
I love you.

514
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:21,092
Going to Laurel Canyon?

515
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,361
Oh, aren't they lovely.

516
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,175
Hello. Are you going down
to Laurel Canyon?

517
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:44,511
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you, but I see a friend.

518
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:47,417
- Bye-bye.
- You guys going down to La Brea?

519
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:50,352
Yes, but we only have
room for one.

520
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,685
All right. Thanks.

521
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,325
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:03,997
- Where's Herbie?
- Herbie met Love Lady.

523
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,437
What, and he just left you
alone like that?

524
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:11,244
Don't you know it's dangerous
to hitch by yourself out here at night?

525
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:14,382
There are sex maniacs driving in cars.

526
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,484
Perverts. I see them in court
every day, believe me.

527
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,978
You'll sleep in here
and I'll sleep on the couch.

528
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,420
Plenty of room. Total privacy.

529
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,583
Just like a private room in a hotel.

530
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,753
The bathroom is off the bedroom,
so there can be total privacy.

531
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,991
This is going to be nice.
And it's right near the Pleasure Dome.

532
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:34,135
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a dress shop.

533
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,567
I work there on Saturdays.

534
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,598
I didn't know you worked.

535
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,744
- Is this interesting?
- What's that?

536
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,777
<i>"Sexual Aberrations</i>
<i>in the Human Male."</i>

537
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,717
Well...

538
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,749
Interesting?

539
00:38:51,086 --> 00:38:54,419
My first year out of law school,
I did research for a firm...

540
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:00,495
...that was defending a homosexual.

541
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,329
- A very prominent man.
- Did he get off?

542
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,930
Fortunately, yes.

543
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,273
- What's a shoe fetishist?
- A shoe fetishist?

544
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:20,943
Well, generally speaking,
a shoe fetishist...

545
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:26,379
...is a person who has
a sexual problem in relation to shoes.

546
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:28,489
Boots and shoes, you know.

547
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:32,127
- That's illegal?
- In public it is, yes. It's a perversion.

548
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:35,958
Next step, they'll be taking
teddy bears away from babies.

549
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,964
Oh, well, I don't know about that.

550
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,699
Listen, would you
like to have a drink?

551
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,360
I don't drink.

552
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:48,340
Well, I do. It's been a long day for me,
and I have a very busy day tomorrow.

553
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,836
And my bed is made up.

554
00:40:01,924 --> 00:40:05,917
I'd rather sleep in here, Harold,
because I'd like to watch TV.

555
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,222
- Are you sure?
- This is cool, right here.

556
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:09,421
Right. Right.

557
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,268
You know, you can turn
the sound right up.

558
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:16,336
- It won't bother me.
- Oh, no. I just watch the pictures.

559
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:18,097
I don't dig the sound.

560
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:22,876
You have a picture fetish, huh?

561
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:25,706
I guess.

562
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:31,943
Well...

563
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,849
...good night.
- Good night.

564
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,736
Now, look...

565
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:57,411
...you have my personal guarantee
that this...

566
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,574
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.

567
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:05,886
Just want you to know that
you have my personal guarantee...

568
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:08,984
...that door will not open tonight.

569
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:11,317
I mean, you know,
you have no need to worry.

570
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:15,930
You're in here and I'm in there,
and you have no cause for concern.

571
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,390
Why are you afraid of me?

572
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:22,230
Who's afraid? I'm not afraid.

573
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:24,932
I won't come in.

574
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,075
- Well, I'll say good night.
- Good night.

575
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,532
Hi.

576
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:24,546
I wanted to make you
some breakfast.

577
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:28,820
Fine.

578
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:33,291
But I have some things
to clear up at the office.

579
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,993
And I don't need any breakfast.

580
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:39,463
Thanks very...
You better go. You better go.

581
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,263
Well, I don't have to be
at work until 7.

582
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:44,598
Can I hang around
and listen to some music?

583
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,831
Yes. Yes, okay.

584
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:49,773
But if the phone rings...

585
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,539
...don't answer it.
Don't answer the phone if it rings.

586
00:44:52,714 --> 00:44:55,274
All right. Bye.

587
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,927
Yeah, very nice, very nice.

588
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,865
Yeah.

589
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:31,669
Thanks.

590
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,173
Better get a smog device.
I got a warning.

591
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,375
- Here.
- That all the cops got to do?

592
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:39,878
Why don't they find my kid?

593
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:42,710
Ran off to San Francisco
with a colored girl.

594
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:44,545
My wife's going crazy.

595
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:46,651
- Yeah, I know.
- I don't know what to do.

596
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,517
I don't know where to look.

597
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,893
Here he is.

598
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,061
- What's the matter?
- Hi.

599
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:57,663
Nothing's the matter, darling.
We came to see you.

600
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,494
We have to finalize the seating.

601
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,034
We called you on the phone,
but you didn't answer.

602
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,501
I went to pick up my car.

603
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,334
- Yeah, what'd they charge you?
- Eighty-nine bucks.

604
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,033
- For a fender?
- He can afford it.

605
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:13,045
Yeah, when Roosevelt was alive,
you could buy a whole car for $89.

606
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:15,683
Come on, come on.
Let's go in already.

607
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:17,852
- I don't get it.
- All right.

608
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,284
- I know.
- I know, I know.

609
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,891
Oh, Harold, they had a sale today
on instant at the Safeway.

610
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,392
- Here, I bought you a jar.
- Thanks.

611
00:48:27,562 --> 00:48:30,895
<i>Oy,</i> my feet are killing me.

612
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,426
Here, help me with my coat,
will you, Ben?

613
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:38,503
- Place looks nice.
- Really nice.

614
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:43,077
Harold?

615
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:48,682
I didn't see you all day.

616
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,344
Well, I was very tired
after the funeral, you know.

617
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:59,919
- My mother's in there.
- Oh, let's live dangerously, huh?

618
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,563
Plenty of time for that
after the wedding.

619
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,427
- I told you so.
- Her ears.

620
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:27,546
You got some ice water, Harold?

621
00:49:27,722 --> 00:49:30,816
- Sure, Pop. I'll get some for you.
- Thank you.

622
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:32,892
I love this sofa.

623
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:36,586
Let me know when
you don't want it anymore, Harold.

624
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:41,629
Joycie, have you given any thought
to redecorating, you know?

625
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:46,297
Well, why? We'll probably
be buying a house right away, anyway.

626
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:49,409
Where exactly
are you thinking of looking?

627
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:53,275
Oh, Beverly Hills.
They have the best school system.

628
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,245
Absolutely.

629
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,408
In Beverly Hills you pay
through the nose.

630
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:03,824
But your taxes are very low.

631
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,020
I've decided I'm putting
Aunt Tanya next to Murray.

632
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:10,323
She doesn't talk
to the rest of the family...

633
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:12,432
...so maybe she'll get along
with Murray.

634
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:16,161
- Let me just see the list for a minute.
- Here, Pop.

635
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:18,966
If they charged for ice water,
I'd be a pauper.

636
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:24,301
- Remember the candy store...?
- Better get down to work.

637
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:29,212
Now, we're inviting
the Twin Cantors to the dinner.

638
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:33,478
So our side of the family gives up
a seat for one cantor...

639
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:37,215
...and Joycie's side gives up a seat
for the other cantor.

640
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,350
- Great.
- Oh, it is.

641
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:42,291
It'll be a great honor
to you and Joycie.

642
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:45,956
Now, where should we seat them,
do you think?

643
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:50,161
Mama, are you planning to go through
the entire list now?

644
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,704
Well, I'm not leaving
the seating to the caterers.

645
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:55,240
I've got enough troubles
without that.

646
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,845
- We had 40 people at our wedding.
- Yeah?

647
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:02,973
I don't even know half the people
that are coming to this one.

648
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:10,086
- Look. Look, I found some brownies.
- They look fresh baked.

649
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:13,250
- Do you have saccharine, Harold?
- Oh, I have some in my purse.

650
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:16,021
Oh, you're a darling. Thank you.

651
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:27,769
Well, looks like a nice brownie, Harold.

652
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:30,069
From Rubins?

653
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,744
I don't remember.

654
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:35,841
A small bakery on Fairfax.

655
00:51:42,624 --> 00:51:44,216
Better than Rubins.

656
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:47,691
Better than Rubins? That's a brownie.

657
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:51,562
This is delicious.

658
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:54,767
They're very good.

659
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,567
They're...

660
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,005
They're groovy.

661
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,908
I wish Herbie was here with us now.
He loves sweets.

662
00:52:04,212 --> 00:52:08,046
Herbie is a very sweet boy.
Do you know what I think?

663
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:12,653
I think that this is just a stage
that he's going through, that's all.

664
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:16,522
To a funeral he wears his Indian suit.

665
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:23,628
Oh, these are really good.

666
00:52:27,402 --> 00:52:29,131
Thank you.

667
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,547
- One more.
- Ben.

668
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:44,611
- My last one.
- All right.

669
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:38,200
Ben.

670
00:53:39,474 --> 00:53:41,533
Benjie.

671
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:45,704
What was his name?

672
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:50,650
What was his name,
your cousin from Milwaukee?

673
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:01,194
You know what he did?

674
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,494
What did he do?

675
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,692
He came out of the bathroom.

676
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:12,697
What did he do when he came out
of the bathroom?

677
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:16,070
Don't say bathroom and I won't laugh.

678
00:54:16,244 --> 00:54:18,405
I said it!

679
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,748
Take me.

680
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,757
Take me.

681
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,867
Remember? Remember?

682
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,202
Oh, Harold, take me.

683
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:57,713
Harold.

684
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,327
I wanna play miniature golf.

685
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:42,487
Where's Harold?

686
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,138
You know, I just can't.
I've tried. I can't take the pills.

687
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,779
I blow up like a house.

688
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:02,713
It's really such a drag.
These pills are so groovy.

689
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:05,648
But a diaphragm, forget it.
It's just the worse.

690
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,651
- Listen, thanks for coming in.
- Harold!

691
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,290
Hey. Hi.

692
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:13,493
Harold, this is Anita.

693
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:17,358
Oh, my God, you look just like
a guy I used to go with.

694
00:56:17,532 --> 00:56:19,966
- Yeah?
- You're a little better-looking.

695
00:56:20,134 --> 00:56:23,194
- Oh, thanks.
- Nice.

696
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,202
What?

697
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:34,140
I came to thank you for the brownies.

698
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:36,974
You're welcome.

699
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:39,819
I came to see you.

700
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:45,291
- Groovy.
- Yeah. Groovy.

701
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,422
- You're very pretty.
- And so are you.

702
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,492
Yeah?

703
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,936
You should've told me
what was in those brownies.

704
00:56:58,106 --> 00:57:00,666
Thank Alice B. Toklas. It's her recipe.

705
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:02,810
- Yeah?
- She wrote a freaky cookbook.

706
00:57:03,544 --> 00:57:06,069
And she turned my parents
into junkies.

707
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:08,214
- She did?
- Oh, yeah.

708
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,113
- They were...
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.

709
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,123
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.

710
00:57:17,325 --> 00:57:20,453
I'd like to see something in
a minidress. Something lightweight.

711
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:22,789
These just came in.
What size does she wear?

712
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:24,090
It's for me.

713
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:32,030
Well, I don't know
if we happen to have your size.

714
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:33,696
I'm a perfect 12.

715
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:35,970
These are 12s.

716
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:38,272
Thank you.

717
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:43,948
Don't look at me.

718
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:47,377
I think he wants it to go
to a Halloween party.

719
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:49,079
I hope so.

720
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:52,485
Miss.

721
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,990
- Did you find something you like?
- Yes.

722
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:01,932
Yes, I like this one.
Is there anyplace I can try it on?

723
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,806
- Right over there.
- Oh, thank you.

724
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:13,945
I can't help it. I can't.

725
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,015
Have a cookie.

726
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:19,745
- Alice Toklas?
- Chocolate chip.

727
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:24,758
- Miss?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

728
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,626
Do you do alterations here
in the shop?

729
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,423
Yes, we do. Anita!

730
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:34,967
What I'd like to get would be to
get this just about two inches shorter.

731
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,127
About like that.

732
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,940
Well, Anita does the alterations.

733
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:44,477
- Anita, can we shorten this about...?
- No, that's it. Right there.

734
00:58:44,645 --> 00:58:47,113
- Two inches?
- No, no, no.

735
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,442
That's not your color.

736
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,290
I have a butterfly.

737
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,999
I know.

738
00:59:09,437 --> 00:59:11,064
I know.

739
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:14,197
It's a monarch, isn't it?

740
00:59:15,443 --> 00:59:17,138
Yeah.

741
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:26,977
Yeah.

742
00:59:28,322 --> 00:59:32,452
I never got that close to a butterfly.

743
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:19,098
Wait a second.

744
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:28,799
<i>Hello, Harold?</i>

745
01:01:29,844 --> 01:01:33,371
- Yes, Ma.
- You sound like your asthma is worse.

746
01:01:33,881 --> 01:01:38,818
No, Mama, the earth just moved.

747
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:44,014
So where did you disappear to?

748
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:45,823
Stop it.

749
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:47,560
<i>Oh, listen, I changed my mind.</i>

750
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:50,458
<i>I'm not putting Aunt Tanya</i>
<i>next to Uncle Murray.</i>

751
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:52,724
<i>She's got that bladder trouble,</i>
<i>poor thing...</i>

752
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,891
<i>... so I'm gonna put her closer</i>
<i>to the door.</i>

753
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:59,469
Listen, Harold,
I picked up some of those...

754
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,034
Go to sleep.

755
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:04,803
I picked up some of those brownies.
You know, it must be a different bakery.

756
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:08,513
<i>Oh, they're terrible.</i>
<i>Rubins is better than those.</i>

757
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,986
<i>So anyway, I ordered the Jell-O mold.</i>

758
01:02:13,154 --> 01:02:17,420
<i>It's gonna be a green Jell-O</i>
<i>with cherries.</i>

759
01:03:38,939 --> 01:03:43,933
"Blessed be you, Harold and Joyce,
who come in the name of the Lord.

760
01:03:44,145 --> 01:03:46,841
We bless you
with the blessings of God.

761
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:51,643
We pray that these blessings may rest
gently and lovingly upon you both.

762
01:03:51,852 --> 01:03:55,948
Praised be thou, O Lord, who has
blessed these children of Israel...

763
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:58,216
...through the covenant
of holy wedlock...

764
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,087
...and beneath this
<i>chuppah</i> canopy"...

765
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:01,853
You look very pretty, Joyce.

766
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,462
You do. You look very pretty.

767
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:13,804
- This means a lot to you, doesn't it?
- Harold!

768
01:04:14,008 --> 01:04:16,602
Wait a second, Mama.
I'm talking to Joyce.

769
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:21,170
I'm sorry, Joyce.

770
01:04:21,782 --> 01:04:23,113
This is wrong.

771
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:28,749
I know I shouldn't do this,
but I have to do it.

772
01:04:29,023 --> 01:04:30,354
It's better.

773
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:33,118
- It is better.
- Better?

774
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:36,296
You don't really know me.

775
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,961
I don't know me.

776
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,196
I know I should've thought of
all of this before, but I didn't.

777
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:44,564
Stop it, Harold.
You'll never forgive yourself.

778
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:48,674
I'd never forgive myself
if I ruined her life.

779
01:04:57,318 --> 01:04:59,013
Dear Joyce.

780
01:05:27,615 --> 01:05:29,549
It's not in there.

781
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,342
There's nothing to find in there.

782
01:05:31,919 --> 01:05:34,854
<i>There are no people there,</i>
<i>only machines.</i>

783
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:39,082
<i>Garbage-disposing machines,</i>
<i>dishwashing machines...</i>

784
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:43,196
<i>... television machines being watched</i>
<i>by people machines.</i>

785
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:45,599
<i>We have left the machine.</i>

786
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:49,530
<i>And by so doing,</i>
<i>we are opting for survival.</i>

787
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:48,494
<i>Flower in the crannied wall</i>
<i>I pluck you out of the crannies</i>

788
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:55,633
<i>I hold you here, root and all, in my hand</i>
<i>Little flower...</i>

789
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,302
But how can you know
what a flower is, Harold...

790
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,030
...if you don't know who you are?

791
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:03,643
Who are you?
Do you know who you are?

792
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:09,044
I'm trying.
Guru, I'm really trying.

793
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:14,711
When you stop trying,
then you'll know who you are.

794
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:17,450
Well, I...

795
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:21,923
I'm trying to stop trying.

796
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:23,790
Good.

797
01:07:24,565 --> 01:07:28,433
I'm reminded of the story
of a holy man in India.

798
01:07:28,636 --> 01:07:31,230
One afternoon, Siddhartha...

799
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:36,708
...returned from a nearby village,
and he had gained an insight...

800
01:07:36,877 --> 01:07:42,213
...how the excretory force
had to be reversed, actually...

801
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:46,717
...so that the relationship of the apana,
the excretory energy...

802
01:07:46,954 --> 01:07:53,416
...to this basic contraction
of the hatha yoga.

803
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:56,824
One must never overlook
the importance...

804
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:01,559
...of the control
of the excretory energy.

805
01:08:02,202 --> 01:08:05,262
The Mula Bandha,
which had puzzled him for years...

806
01:08:05,506 --> 01:08:08,600
...the root contraction,
famous heart of the hatha yoga...

807
01:08:08,842 --> 01:08:11,902
...had opened as a new wave.

808
01:08:16,283 --> 01:08:18,547
This is beautiful.

809
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,284
Kiss me.

810
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,997
- First time in my life I feel free.
- Not hung up on possessions.

811
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,825
We just need natural things.

812
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,640
Oh, get that out, we don't need that.

813
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:44,538
We don't need all this.

814
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:50,642
- Am I being real?
- You're being real.

815
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:54,447
- Am I being a real person?
- So real.

816
01:08:54,621 --> 01:08:56,680
Now I know it. Got it.

817
01:08:57,992 --> 01:09:00,426
- Harold?
- Oh, my God, I gotta be real.

818
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,192
Kiss me.

819
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,626
Kiss my eyes.

820
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:08,699
Kiss my neck.

821
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,700
Kiss my ankh.

822
01:09:12,139 --> 01:09:15,199
- You sure?
- Yes. Kiss it.

823
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:19,469
Kiss my ankh. Kiss it now.

824
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:09,393
What's going on here?

825
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:15,425
Oh, just two people
enjoying each other's company.

826
01:10:15,636 --> 01:10:18,070
- Just being, that's all.
- Girl looks pretty young.

827
01:10:18,272 --> 01:10:22,299
- Will you step outside, please?
- Certainly, certainly. Be a pleasure to.

828
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:28,106
Excuse me. Lovely evening.

829
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,617
Check the car out, Harry.

830
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,082
- And how old are you, miss?
- Twenty.

831
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:39,781
- And how old are you, kid?
- I'm 35 years of age, sir.

832
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:42,325
Thirty-five years old,
that is my age.

833
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,058
Car's almost brand-new.
Registered in the name of Harold Fine.

834
01:10:46,266 --> 01:10:48,200
Yes, that is me.
My name is Harold Fine.

835
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:50,836
Allow me to show you
my driver's license.

836
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:53,472
I have it here. It's my car.

837
01:10:53,674 --> 01:10:56,040
All this fur is... There.

838
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,735
There's a photograph of me
to prove what I'm saying.

839
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:01,846
It's not stolen. It's my own car.

840
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:06,384
I bought it with money I earned
when I was leading a terrible life.

841
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:07,952
This doesn't look like you.

842
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:11,182
No, that is because, if you'll
permit me, my hair is longer now.

843
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:13,951
Before, it was short,
as in the photograph.

844
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:17,221
- So there's little resemblance.
- Take off the headband, please.

845
01:11:17,464 --> 01:11:19,455
It'd be a pleasure
to take it off for you.

846
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:23,535
- There. There, it's off.
- Pull the hair back so it looks shorter.

847
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:28,106
Yes. I'm doing this
because I love you, sir.

848
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,976
It's him, all right. And he is 35.

849
01:11:31,145 --> 01:11:33,340
Yeah, I am. I'm 35, Harold Fine.

850
01:11:33,547 --> 01:11:36,710
Thank you very much indeed.
It's lovely to see you.

851
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:41,047
- Let's go, Harry.
- No, wait, please. Wait, please.

852
01:11:41,822 --> 01:11:44,154
You don't have to do
what you're doing, you know?

853
01:11:44,324 --> 01:11:46,815
Thank you very much.
It's very kind of you, officer.

854
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:48,825
You don't have to do
what you're doing.

855
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:50,987
You know, you don't have
to wear a gun.

856
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:54,190
I used to wear a gun,
in my heart, not on my hip.

857
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:57,393
I had hatred and violence in me.
Didn't I, sweetheart?

858
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:59,766
You know that.
I had hatred and violence in me.

859
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,874
Now, listen...

860
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,506
Don't go. Do you know
where you're going?

861
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:06,906
Do you know who you are,
where you are?

862
01:12:07,147 --> 01:12:10,742
<i>Flower in the crannied walls,</i>
<i>I pluck you out of the crannies...</i>

863
01:12:10,918 --> 01:12:12,545
Oh, pluck yourself, Jack.

864
01:12:12,753 --> 01:12:15,187
Why don't you get a haircut
and an apartment.

865
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:16,788
But I have an apartment.

866
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,721
I mean, I choose to live here.
I don't have to live here.

867
01:12:19,893 --> 01:12:22,726
Well, you'd better not be here
when we come back.

868
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,199
Well, listen,
you've been through a lot.

869
01:12:27,367 --> 01:12:30,427
- You have been through hell, Joyce.
- Yeah.

870
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:32,702
You know, Murray, I've been thinking.

871
01:12:32,906 --> 01:12:36,069
This may sound silly to you,
but maybe what I should do...

872
01:12:36,276 --> 01:12:38,904
...is go to one of those
computer mating places.

873
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:41,547
Where you just fill out a form,
then they handle...

874
01:12:41,715 --> 01:12:43,239
...the whole thing impersonally.

875
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,476
- Now, what do you think?
- Totally wrong.

876
01:12:45,686 --> 01:12:46,983
Totally wrong?

877
01:12:47,187 --> 01:12:50,554
In my opinion, you have just gotten over
a long-term engagement.

878
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:55,557
What you need now
is a nice, hot affair.

879
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:59,688
Forget the intellect. Enjoy yourself.

880
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:02,197
Have some sex.

881
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,607
I'm gonna keep my eyes open.

882
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:11,534
- That's a healthy attitude.
- You know something?

883
01:13:11,778 --> 01:13:16,215
At my age, I finally know
what I don't want.

884
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,345
This is growth, isn't it?

885
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:20,543
I know what I don't want.

886
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:23,847
I don't want another Harold Fine.

887
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,288
That's what I don't need,
another Harold Fine.

888
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,825
<i>- Free Press?</i>
- Just ignore her.

889
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:29,929
Turn your stomach.

890
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:31,860
Looks like a gypsy,
for heaven's sake.

891
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:34,590
Some kind of perverse need
to cause attention.

892
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:36,429
Would you like to buy a <i>Free Press?</i>

893
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:37,627
- Hey, Murray.
- Harold.

894
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:41,467
- Hey, Joyce. Joyce, you look groovy.
- Harold! Oh, Harold!

895
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:43,870
I forgive you everything.
Come back to me.

896
01:13:44,111 --> 01:13:46,875
You're a sweet person.
You have love in your heart.

897
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,675
- I love you, Harold. I love you.
- Joyce...

898
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,943
- Beat it, you hippy freak!
- I love you, sir!

899
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:54,178
- We have to go.
- Harold, come back to me.

900
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,549
- Come back to me. I love you!
- Joyce. Joyce!

901
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,782
You love Harold Fine. He no longer exists.
Let go of my beads.

902
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,485
He exists. You're standing right here.
I love you.

903
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:05,632
- Come back to me.
- Joyce, let go of my beads.

904
01:14:05,799 --> 01:14:07,892
- You're hurting my neck.
- Harold, I love you.

905
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,195
- Joyce...
- Oh, please, Harold. I love you.

906
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,565
- Let go of my beads.
- Let's start from the beginning.

907
01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:17,039
Let's start all over again, Harold!
I love you, Harold! Harold!

908
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:32,982
- This... Nancy.
- Yes, darling?

909
01:14:34,828 --> 01:14:37,296
There's nothing about Warhol in here.

910
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:40,330
You know, Herbie said
it's the best picture he's ever made.

911
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,369
- Who's in it?
- Nobody. Just teeth.

912
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:46,071
Just teeth?

913
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,434
- Whose teeth?
- You know, teeth.

914
01:14:48,675 --> 01:14:51,303
Animal teeth, insect teeth,
false teeth.

915
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:56,071
- Just shots of teeth.
- Oh, what a fantastic idea.

916
01:14:56,316 --> 01:14:59,080
What an incredible conception.

917
01:14:59,519 --> 01:15:03,751
Teeth, teeth and yet more teeth.

918
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:13,525
Teeth.

919
01:15:16,336 --> 01:15:20,238
Is it in black and white
or color or what?

920
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,374
That's what's so groovy
about it, Harold.

921
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:25,204
I think it's whatever
you want to see in it.

922
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:29,781
- I think he's a genius, Harold.
- Yes, yes.

923
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,314
Yes, he's a genius.

924
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,453
Herbie said that
there's one sequence...

925
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:38,454
...in which they split the screen
about 32 times.

926
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:41,889
One for each tooth.

927
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:45,262
- Let's go tonight, Harold.
- Listen, I'd sooner take a bath.

928
01:15:45,432 --> 01:15:46,956
- I'd like you...
- You know what...

929
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:49,068
- I wanna take a bath.
- No.

930
01:15:49,236 --> 01:15:53,605
Yeah, I really
wanna take a bath, Nancy.

931
01:15:57,811 --> 01:15:59,745
Hey, come here, baby.

932
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:02,245
I wanna have a bath with you.

933
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:05,674
Yes, could you tell me what time
<i>Mondo Teeth</i> starts?

934
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:07,978
- Time?
- Groovy.

935
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:11,521
- Are you sure you don't wanna go?
- I want you to take a bath with me.

936
01:16:11,758 --> 01:16:14,488
- Rub my neck in the bath.
- Hey, Harold. Harold.

937
01:16:14,728 --> 01:16:16,855
I want to see <i>Mondo Teeth.</i>

938
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,964
- How long is the movie?
- Six hours.

939
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:21,464
- Six hours?
- I'll see you after the movie.

940
01:16:21,668 --> 01:16:25,536
- I'll rub you after the movie.
- I can't stay in a bath for six...

941
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:27,570
How are you gonna get there,
anyway?

942
01:16:27,808 --> 01:16:29,639
- Hitch.
- Hitch?

943
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,106
Nancy, you know
I don't like you to hitch.

944
01:16:32,345 --> 01:16:33,903
Don't get uptight, Harold.

945
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:38,414
I'm not getting uptight.
I just don't like you to hitch, that's all.

946
01:16:38,718 --> 01:16:42,711
Anyway, if you get a hitch,
get a hitch from a lady.

947
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:44,684
Make sure she's not a dyke.

948
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,760
<i>Mondo Teeth...</i>

949
01:16:55,335 --> 01:16:58,133
Oh, I could give her a mondo.

950
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:11,180
Hey, honey.

951
01:17:11,384 --> 01:17:13,318
Oh, I'm so glad
you changed your mind.

952
01:17:13,487 --> 01:17:16,479
It's so groovy in here.
It's totally groovy.

953
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:18,487
Oh, it's much better
than <i>Mondo Teeth.</i>

954
01:17:18,692 --> 01:17:20,091
I'm totally immersed.

955
01:17:20,327 --> 01:17:23,194
Totally immersed in liquid.
It's fantastic.

956
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:26,559
- Oh, honey, you're gonna love this.
- Hey, you're beautiful.

957
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:29,326
I just wanna shake your hand.

958
01:17:30,837 --> 01:17:34,830
- I'm Big Bear.
- I don't think I know you.

959
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:37,203
I know you.
What a beautiful thing you've done.

960
01:17:37,377 --> 01:17:41,677
- Oh, that's very nice of you.
- Hey, this is Love Lady and El Greco.

961
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,781
You're beautiful, Harold Fine.

962
01:17:46,186 --> 01:17:51,590
Actually... It's very nice of you.
I'm trying to take a bath.

963
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,281
- Can I join you, man?
- No.

964
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,088
- I didn't know it was a bath.
- Yeah, that's what it is.

965
01:17:56,263 --> 01:18:00,199
- Harold Fine, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, you're very sweet.

966
01:18:00,367 --> 01:18:02,062
Would somebody get that?

967
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:04,567
- What is it?
- It's a telephone.

968
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:07,569
Oh, I'm sorry, man,
I've taken a vow against machinery.

969
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:13,005
Maybe...? Could somebody could...?
I'll get it. I'll get it.

970
01:18:13,179 --> 01:18:15,306
Just a second.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

971
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,882
What, is this a water trip?

972
01:18:18,685 --> 01:18:20,585
Excuse me.

973
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:27,954
Hello?

974
01:18:28,128 --> 01:18:31,325
Hello. Yes. Oh, hi, Murray. Hi, hi.

975
01:18:31,531 --> 01:18:34,159
The Rodriguezes?
Listen, Murray, listen.

976
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,393
- I am truly sorry about that.
- Here he is.

977
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,561
I'd appreciate
if you'd handle that for me.

978
01:18:38,738 --> 01:18:40,603
That's the man
I was telling you about.

979
01:18:40,774 --> 01:18:43,265
- Hello.
- There you are.

980
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:45,068
Okay, Murray, whatever you want.

981
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:49,272
- That's man in the water.
- He's a water tripper.

982
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:52,145
- How are you?
- How are you? Yeah.

983
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:55,311
- You that guy, man?
- Thanks very much.

984
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:58,089
I considered his manhood at all times.
I really did.

985
01:18:58,258 --> 01:19:00,123
- That was always in my mind.
- I know.

986
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,419
- Well, you know that.
- You're a gem. Listen.

987
01:19:02,662 --> 01:19:03,993
It's over. I know that.

988
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:07,361
What? You think Harold
is the first man who ever did this?

989
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:10,503
Believe me, it happens every day.

990
01:19:11,171 --> 01:19:16,268
I never told you this, Joycella,
but my Ben had his fling too.

991
01:19:17,177 --> 01:19:20,340
- Really?
- We were only two months married.

992
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,013
What happened?

993
01:19:22,349 --> 01:19:24,715
Well, this fancy governess...

994
01:19:24,884 --> 01:19:28,183
Oh, what am I...? "Governess."
What? She was a maid, you know.

995
01:19:28,355 --> 01:19:31,620
Well, she used to wheel
this baby around in the park.

996
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,258
And while she was wheeling...

997
01:19:33,426 --> 01:19:36,657
...she was wiggling her behind
at my Ben.

998
01:19:37,364 --> 01:19:41,232
Oh, Ben was a handsome man
in those days.

999
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:45,462
- He ran off with a governess?
- Maid. Maid.

1000
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:49,809
- But he came back.
- Well...

1001
01:19:49,976 --> 01:19:52,308
They all come back.

1002
01:19:52,912 --> 01:19:55,938
Oh, you must have been
so terribly hurt.

1003
01:19:57,384 --> 01:20:01,081
Joycella, women are built for hurt.

1004
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:06,490
Don't worry.

1005
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:10,726
The hood's okay, Mrs. Fine.
That'll be 3.20.

1006
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:15,960
Thank you, George.
So how's the family?

1007
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:19,304
Well, to tell you the truth,
Mrs. Fine...

1008
01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:22,100
...l've been having a little trouble
with my daughter.

1009
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,038
Why? What's the matter?

1010
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:28,943
Well, about a month ago she ran off
to San Francisco with a white boy.

1011
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:33,652
- My wife's going crazy.
- Yeah.

1012
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:48,425
Good morning, darling.

1013
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,201
Good morning.

1014
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:12,786
- Good morning, Harold.
- Oh, hi. Hi.

1015
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:14,290
Good morning.

1016
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:25,694
"That which is called
ego-death is coming to you.

1017
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:30,566
Remember, this is now
the hour of death and rebirth.

1018
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:34,909
Take advantage
of this temporary opportunity...

1019
01:21:35,081 --> 01:21:40,144
...to obtain the perfect state,
enlightenment.

1020
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,585
Concentrate on the unity
of all living beings.

1021
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,224
Hold onto the clear light.

1022
01:21:46,392 --> 01:21:49,520
Use it to attain understanding
and love.

1023
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:52,859
If you cannot maintain
the bliss of illumination...

1024
01:21:53,032 --> 01:21:57,833
...and if you are slipping back into
contact with the external world"...

1025
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,043
Oh, hi, Harold. Wanna get in?

1026
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,881
Oh, no, thanks. No.

1027
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:18,216
Groovy, groovy.

1028
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:39,405
Hey, look what you've done
to the rug.

1029
01:22:40,113 --> 01:22:41,910
I'm sorry.

1030
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:43,746
Why are you painting him?

1031
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:48,580
- Because I like him.
- Yeah? What about me?

1032
01:22:49,055 --> 01:22:51,216
I like you too.

1033
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:55,425
Is there anybody you don't like?

1034
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:17,310
- Hey, Harold.
- Hey, Herbie.

1035
01:23:19,118 --> 01:23:22,952
- When did you get here?
- Last Thursday.

1036
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:29,519
- Very, very, very groovy scene.
- Yeah, groovy.

1037
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,988
Yeah.

1038
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:36,535
Yeah, very groovy, yeah.
Yeah, this is really groovy.

1039
01:23:52,785 --> 01:23:54,446
Groovy. This is groovy.

1040
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:56,384
- This is really...
- Harold.

1041
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:58,524
Very groovy.

1042
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:02,058
I'm really dragged.
That was a bad scene in there.

1043
01:24:02,228 --> 01:24:03,559
What?

1044
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,891
- I can paint anybody I want to.
- Yeah?

1045
01:24:06,065 --> 01:24:08,795
You're really uptight about me.

1046
01:24:08,968 --> 01:24:11,732
- I dig you.
- You're making a marriage scene.

1047
01:24:11,938 --> 01:24:13,838
I thought you wanted
to be free, Harold.

1048
01:24:14,474 --> 01:24:18,740
You bet I wanna be free.
But I wanna be free with you alone.

1049
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:23,913
But you're so possessive
you're making me uptight about us.

1050
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:26,074
Your attitude is very unhip.

1051
01:24:27,453 --> 01:24:29,648
My attitude is unhip?

1052
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:32,086
Don't give me that.

1053
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:36,728
Don't... Listen, I'm probably
the hippest guy around here.

1054
01:24:36,896 --> 01:24:39,592
I got a house full of strangers.

1055
01:24:39,766 --> 01:24:43,258
I got cats, I got dogs,
I got pot, I got acid...

1056
01:24:43,469 --> 01:24:45,733
...I got LSD cubes.

1057
01:24:45,905 --> 01:24:51,366
I've got this thing here.
Don't tell me about hip.

1058
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:56,106
I am so hip it hurts.
That's how hip I am.

1059
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:59,581
It's very unhip
to say you're hip, Harold.

1060
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:04,923
And it's very unhip of you
to tell me that I am unhip.

1061
01:25:05,358 --> 01:25:08,293
All right, come on in, everybody!
Come in.

1062
01:25:08,494 --> 01:25:11,895
Come in! It's open house.
Come in! Come... Ma?

1063
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,595
- Ma. Ma.
- Where's the telephone?

1064
01:25:16,035 --> 01:25:17,525
- Ma.
- Where's the telephone?

1065
01:25:17,704 --> 01:25:20,901
There used to be a phone over here.
Did you see it?

1066
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:24,635
- Where?
- Ma, don't do that. That's bad scene.

1067
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:26,938
- Ma, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

1068
01:25:27,113 --> 01:25:30,776
I'm calling the Veteran's Administration.
They'll know what to do about you.

1069
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,975
It happened in Korea,
who am I kidding?

1070
01:25:33,152 --> 01:25:36,485
Information, give me the V.A.
I'm calling Section Eight.

1071
01:25:36,656 --> 01:25:39,147
- Don't do it, Ma, please!
- "Don't do it. Ma, please"?

1072
01:25:39,325 --> 01:25:41,759
Look at this place.
I never saw such a mess.

1073
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:44,897
- It's a pigsty.
- No, Ma, listen...

1074
01:25:45,832 --> 01:25:49,063
That'll teach you
to run around barefoot.

1075
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,593
What is this? Who is this?
What is this?

1076
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:54,604
Is this one of your new friends?
Shame on you. Go on a diet.

1077
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:56,901
All I eat is grass and acid.

1078
01:25:57,076 --> 01:25:58,805
- He eats grass and acid.
- Hi, Mom.

1079
01:25:58,978 --> 01:26:01,105
Oh, dear, Ma, that's very bad.

1080
01:26:02,648 --> 01:26:05,242
- Why did you hit Herbie like...?
- Don't argue with me!

1081
01:26:05,418 --> 01:26:06,749
Take these. I'm cleaning up.

1082
01:26:06,919 --> 01:26:09,479
- Great for you to visit...
- Cats, he's got in here.

1083
01:26:09,655 --> 01:26:12,180
Don't give me orders
in my own home.

1084
01:26:12,358 --> 01:26:17,455
- This is a stove, not a bed.
- This is a hip home, Ma. I don't like...

1085
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:22,496
- Bad trip. Bad trip.
- Ma.

1086
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:25,664
- Don't give me orders here.
- Oh, brownies!

1087
01:26:25,838 --> 01:26:29,865
Hey, don't eat those, Ma.
They're Alice B. Toklas brownies.

1088
01:26:30,076 --> 01:26:33,273
I love you, Alice B. Toklas.
Who is Alice B. Toklas?

1089
01:26:33,446 --> 01:26:36,973
- Gertrude Stein's friend.
- Oh, yeah, Gertrude Stein.

1090
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,777
She used to live on Oakwood.

1091
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,886
- Oh, hi, Mr. Rodriguez.
- Good morning, Senor Fine.

1092
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:47,458
- We hate to bother you in your house...
- Come in, man. Come in.

1093
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:24,027
Hello, hi, how are you?

1094
01:27:46,285 --> 01:27:48,185
Herbie, baby.

1095
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:50,185
Come on.

1096
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:05,933
- Have some brownies.
- That's okay.

1097
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:35,270
"Blessed be you, Harold and Joyce,
who come in the name of the Lord.

1098
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,507
We bless you
with the blessings of God.

1099
01:31:37,683 --> 01:31:42,017
We pray that these blessings may rest
gently and lovingly upon you both.

1100
01:31:42,188 --> 01:31:45,487
Praised be thou, O Lord, who has
blessed these children of Israel...

1101
01:31:45,658 --> 01:31:48,092
...through the covenant
of holy wedlock...

1102
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,694
...and beneath this
<i>chuppah</i> canopy of marriage.

1103
01:31:50,896 --> 01:31:54,024
As by the wedding ring you symbolize
your marriage bond"...

1104
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,134
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1105
01:31:58,003 --> 01:32:00,028
Excuse me.

1106
01:32:03,676 --> 01:32:06,144
- Ben!
- I knew it.

1107
01:32:09,515 --> 01:32:11,005
I knew it.

1108
01:32:11,217 --> 01:32:12,844
I knew it.

1109
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:32,070
Hey, where are you going, man?

1110
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:34,138
I don't know.

1111
01:32:34,673 --> 01:32:36,834
I don't know!

1112
01:32:37,243 --> 01:32:40,440
I don't know and I don't care!

1113
01:32:40,646 --> 01:32:42,580
I don't care!

1114
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:46,215
But there's gotta be something
beautiful out there!

1115
01:32:46,385 --> 01:32:48,580
There's got to be.

1116
01:32:48,988 --> 01:32:50,819
I know it!

1117
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:53,982
Hey! Hey, I know it!

1118
01:33:30,296 --> 01:33:32,287
