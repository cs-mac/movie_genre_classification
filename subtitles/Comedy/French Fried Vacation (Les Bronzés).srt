1
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:23,407
"It's that time
Christmas time is here

2
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,847
"Everybody knows
There's not a better time of year

3
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,724
"Hear that sleigh."

4
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:55,985
"Gonna make this holiday
As perfect as can be

5
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,053
"Just wait and see
This Christmas vacation.

6
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:06,866
"This old house
Sure is looking good

7
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:12,048
"Got ourselves the finest snowman
In the neighborhood.

8
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,872
"Ain't it fun?

9
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:19,663
"Always on the run
That's how it's done

10
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:22,134
"On Christmas vacation.

11
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,652
"Let's all deck the halls

12
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:27,670
"And light the lights

13
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:30,931
"Get a toasty fire

14
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,110
"Burning bright.

15
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:36,405
"Give Saint Nick

16
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:39,416
"The warmest welcome
That he's ever had

17
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,416
"We're so glad it's Christmas vacation.

18
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:47,508
"And when the nights

19
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,328
"Are peaceful and serene

20
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,373
"We can cuddle up
And do our Christmas dreamin'.

21
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:00,919
"Peace and joy and love

22
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,744
"Are everywhere

23
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,191
"You can feel the magic in the air.

24
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:14,040
"Let the spirit of the season
Carry us away

25
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:18,294
"Hip, hip, hooray
For Christmas vacation."

26
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,149
That was beautiful, honey.

27
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,255
Take it, Russ.

28
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,727
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

29
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:32,382
We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

30
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:35,772
...by heading out to the country
in the front-wheel drive sleigh...

31
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,775
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

32
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:41,822
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

33
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,465
We're not driving way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

34
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,676
...with the Santa Clauses on it,
are we, Dad?

35
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,792
No, I have one of those at home.

36
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:53,819
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

37
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:06,170
- What's the matter?
- Some jackass is riding my tail.

38
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,170
Slow down and let him pass.

39
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,592
Don't provoke them.

40
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,060
Hey, kids. Look, a deer!

41
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:49,506
Clark! Slow down!

42
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,570
You want to ride behind
somebody like that?

43
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:56,383
I'm going to pull around them...
burn some dust, here.

44
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,211
Eat my rubber.

45
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:02,627
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber" and "Eat my dust."

46
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:03,900
Whatever, Russ.

47
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,263
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

48
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,572
That's enough of that.

49
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:24,579
Speaking of Christmas trees,
can one of you tell me...

50
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:27,549
...what the first kind of tree
displayed at the White House was?

51
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:28,572
They're back.

52
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,549
Stop it! I don't want to spend
the holidays dead.

53
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,805
Honey, please. I'll do the driving, okay?

54
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:41,854
Will you just take it easy?

55
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,907
I'm in complete control.

56
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,108
I'll get around this egg timer.

57
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,638
Uh... Dad?!

58
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,936
We're all right! Thank God!

59
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,201
Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

60
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,190
Do you honestly think I don't know that?!

61
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:11,014
Come on, you guys. Don't fight.

62
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,382
For Christ's sake,
I didn't do this on purpose.

63
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:18,658
Our Father, who art in heaven...

64
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:22,249
...hallowed be Thy name.
And forgive my husband.

65
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,188
- He knows not what he does.
- Amen!

66
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,229
We made pretty good time.

67
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,674
Dad, didn't they invent
Christmas tree lots...

68
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:57,733
...so people don't have to drive way out
to nowhere and waste a Saturday?

69
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,017
They invented 'em...

70
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,380
...because people forgot how to have
a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas.

71
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:06,405
They're satisfied with scrawny, dead,
overpriced trees with no special meaning.

72
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,370
My toes are numb.

73
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,379
This is what our forefathers did.

74
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:11,370
I can't feel my leg.

75
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,867
They walked out into the woods,
picked out that special tree...

76
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,307
...and they cut it down
with their bare hands.

77
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,195
Mom, I can't feel my hips.

78
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,723
- Clark?
- Yes, honey?

79
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,195
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

80
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,302
That's all part of the experience, honey.

81
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,250
There it is.

82
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,724
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

83
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,414
Isn't it a little big?

84
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:57,292
It's not big, it's just full.

85
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:59,944
That thing wouldn't fit in our yard.

86
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,262
It's not going in our yard, Russ.
It's going in our living room.

87
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,592
- Look at it.
- It really is beautiful, Clark.

88
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,637
- It's something else, huh, Russ?
- Yeah, Dad.

89
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,009
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?

90
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,573
She'll see it later, honey.

91
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,145
Her eyes are frozen.

92
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:22,894
The most enduring traditions
of the season are best enjoyed in...

93
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,547
...the warm embrace of kith and kin.

94
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:30,344
This tree is a symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

95
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,182
Did you bring a saw?

96
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:21,039
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his ceiling.

97
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:33,324
Hey, Griswold!

98
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,955
Where will you put a tree that big?

99
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,375
Bend over and I'll show you.

100
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,801
You got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

101
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,526
I wasn't talking to you.

102
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,316
Do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

103
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:07,600
Sure, honey. I have a little more trimming
to do, but that won't be a problem.

104
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:08,658
Ready?

105
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:12,085
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

106
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:21,846
There's a lot of sap in here.

107
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:26,454
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

108
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,163
Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?

109
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:54,163
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas, too.

110
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,686
It's not too late to change our plans...

111
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,288
No, no, that's great.

112
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,512
I think you're forgetting
how difficult it's gonna be...

113
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,919
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

114
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,634
They're family,
not strangers off the street.

115
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,458
All they do is argue.

116
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,537
Christmas is about resolving differences...

117
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,252
...and seeing through
the petty problems of family life.

118
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:19,151
And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

119
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:23,632
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip, and...

120
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,387
...then they don't speak to...
- Your mother waxes her upper lip?

121
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,052
She has for years.

122
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:29,815
It doesn't show.

123
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,681
I don't know, Sparky,
I just have this feeling it's not...

124
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,960
I want to have Christmas here,
in our house.

125
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,750
It means a lot to me.

126
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,140
All my life I've wanted to have
a big family Christmas.

127
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,951
It's just that you build things up
in your mind, Sparky.

128
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:53,045
You set standards no family event
can ever live up to.

129
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,729
When have I ever done that?

130
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,242
Parties.

131
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:02,355
Weddings.

132
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,017
- Good night, honey.
- Anniversaries.

133
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:06,677
Funerals.

134
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,075
Holidays.

135
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:10,650
Vacations.

136
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:12,249
Graduations.

137
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:37,338
Guess you'll be lookin' at
a nice fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

138
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,163
Word is you're an excellent choice
to be named...

139
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:40,954
...Food Additive Designer of the Year.

140
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:43,127
- Nah...
- I'm not kidding.

141
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,820
What's that new thing you got
over there at Food 'N' Dry?

142
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:49,465
The crunch enhancer?
That's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

143
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,062
It's semi-permeable. It's not osmotic.

144
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,793
What it does is,
it coats and seals the flake.

145
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,205
It prevents the milk from penetrating it.

146
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,443
Yeah, it's a beautiful product.

147
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,337
I like it.

148
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,806
What are you gonna do
with that big bonus check?

149
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,180
You're gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.

150
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,491
Me? Heck, no.

151
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:04,918
Take a look at this.

152
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,771
I just hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

153
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,393
Oh, my God. You're putting in a pool.

154
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:27,005
I went ahead and I put
a $7,500 deposit down on it.

155
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,175
You're the last true family man.

156
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:31,611
Mark.

157
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,631
Clark.

158
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,406
That's Bill, sir.

159
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:39,868
Are you the one who's working
on that non-nutritive cereal varnish?

160
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:40,766
Yes, sir.

161
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,029
I've got to give a speech to a trade group.
I'd like to mention it.

162
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,131
Write up a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

163
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,184
My pleasure.

164
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:52,413
Layman's terms. None of that inside,
bullshit jargon that nobody understands.

165
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,012
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,681
Oh, Mr. Shirley...

167
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,897
We got your Christmas card
the other day, and...

168
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:04,095
...my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

169
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,756
Corporate cards.

170
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,642
Don't forget that report, Bill.

171
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,177
Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.

172
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,748
Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass.
Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.

173
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,286
Happy Hanukkah.

174
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,007
Can I show you something?

175
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,415
I was just smelling... smiling.

176
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,099
I was blouse... browsing.

177
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,235
For your wife or girlfriend?

178
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,857
What? What happened?

179
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,053
I guess it wouldn't be any...

180
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:16,924
It wouldn't be
the Christmas shopping season...

181
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:20,447
...if the stores were any less hooter
than they... Hotter than they are.

182
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:22,560
It is warm in here.

183
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:24,736
- When you have your coat on.
- Do I?

184
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:27,009
- How did that happen?
- Because it's cold out.

185
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,087
Yes. Yes.

186
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,877
It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean, nippy out.

187
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,082
What am I saying? Nipple?

188
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,960
There is a nip in the air, though.

189
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,071
Can I take something out for you?

190
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,475
I was just, uh...

191
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,647
I was looking at something for my wife.

192
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:54,247
God rest her soul.

193
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,967
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

194
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:59,302
Oh, no, no, she's not dead, yet.
We're just divorced.

195
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,285
She's history.

196
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:03,078
Obviously, she doesn't wear underwear...

197
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:07,336
...there are plenty of shopping days
left until adultery... adulthood.

198
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,762
Which is to say, Christmas,
as in Yule. Yule log.

199
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:13,951
Not a log. I don't have a log, but I mean,
you know...

200
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:17,190
...if I had a log. Not in the sense
you think I said I did.

201
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:20,003
Good golly.

202
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,663
'Tis the season to be merry.

203
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,068
Well, that's my name.

204
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,252
No shit.

205
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,757
These are cut really high on the hip.

206
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:46,243
Look, I'm wearing something similar.
See? You can't see the line.

207
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:49,315
- You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
- No.

208
00:16:56,364 --> 00:17:00,358
Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...

209
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:02,661
...an angel gets his wings.

210
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,137
Folks!

211
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,864
Merry Christmas.

212
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,452
Look how big you've gotten.

213
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,465
Merry Christmas.

214
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,068
Mom.

215
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,980
Knock on the door.

216
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,655
Doesn't Nora look old?

217
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,221
You promised, you promised...

218
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,336
They took a pint of fluid
out of my lower back.

219
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,605
You see this mole? This mole on my neck?
You think it's changing color?

220
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:09,007
No. You keep touching it.
It's getting redder.

221
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:10,381
I got hemorrhoids.

222
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:11,406
Could you believe that?

223
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,196
- Oh, Mother.
- Isn't that terrible?

224
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,814
- You're not getting the space...
- After what you did to my car?

225
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,962
I'm doing the parking.
Come and help me with the...

226
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:21,033
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy...

227
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:24,367
Sweetheart, your grandma Nora's got
a real painful burr on her heel.

228
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,735
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a quarter.

229
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,551
- A quarter.
- And I'll give Audrey a quarter, too.

230
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:32,138
I'm going to put my car in the garage!

231
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,032
I'll park the cars.

232
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,647
This is what Christmas is all about.

233
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:42,247
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage, and...

234
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:44,910
I'll be outside for the season.

235
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,856
We'll have the best-looking house in town.

236
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,687
I've always wanted to do this.

237
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:54,413
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

238
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,297
I'm sure it's a lot of work,
but if I'm out in the cold...

239
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,501
...and I'm committed
to decorating the house...

240
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,289
...l'm gonna do it right
and I'm gonna do it big.

241
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,742
You want something
you can be proud of, don't you?

242
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,153
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,068
Sure you do.

244
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,794
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?

245
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,088
Russ, when was the last time
I overdid anything?

246
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:20,010
Come on, unravel these.

247
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:23,025
You have to check every bulb.

248
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,645
A little knot here. You work on that.

249
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,418
I'll get the other box.

250
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,660
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.

251
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:48,175
I'm sure he'll fall. But I don't think we're
lucky enough to have him break his neck.

252
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:51,794
Let's go.

253
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,677
These gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with the giant nutcracker float.

254
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:26,700
At this point, I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.

255
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:31,187
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

256
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,645
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.

257
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:51,193
Would it be indecent
to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

258
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:55,064
Can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

259
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,783
Alexander called this morning
and Grandpa Clark told him...

260
00:21:57,852 --> 00:22:00,952
...I couldn't come to the phone
'cause I was going to the bathroom.

261
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:03,094
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

262
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,283
Everybody?

263
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,212
Do you sleep with your brother? Do you
know how sick and twisted that is?

264
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:12,279
I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

265
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:17,020
I have nightmares about what he does in
bed alone when I'm not lying next to him.

266
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:20,443
I don't know what to say
except it's Christmas...

267
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:22,618
...and we're all in misery.

268
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,941
Ellen, are you smoking again?

269
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,188
No!

270
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,342
Dad, where do you want these reindeer?

271
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,736
Just put them on the lawn, Russ.

272
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:47,710
I can't find the Santa Claus.

273
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:51,710
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

274
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,648
Clark? Dinner's ready.

275
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,749
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

276
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:13,282
Obviously something broke the window.
Something hit the stereo.

277
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,181
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?

278
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:27,586
I don't know, Margo.

279
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,207
You wanna hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

280
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:42,401
Two hundred and fifty strands of lights,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

281
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:46,238
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

282
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,663
Twenty-five thousand.

283
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,903
I hope nobody I know drives by...

284
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,550
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at my house in my pajamas.

285
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:58,623
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

286
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:00,124
Fire it up!

287
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,345
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

288
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,732
Drum roll, please.

289
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,246
Drum roll.

290
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:30,946
"Joy to the world."

291
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,088
Beautiful, Clark.

292
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,090
Talk about pissing your money away.

293
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:54,120
I hope you kids see what a silly waste
of resources this was.

294
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:56,287
He worked really hard, Grandma.

295
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,213
So do washing machines.

296
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:04,777
Let's get in where it's warm.

297
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:09,891
Clark, baby, I can picture it
in my mind and it's breathtaking.

298
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:14,339
Thanks, Mom.

299
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,841
It's probably a bad bulb. You know, if
one goes out, the whole thing won't work.

300
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:23,109
If I were you,
I'd personally check each one.

301
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:24,615
I did that, Dad.

302
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:28,553
If you need any help, give me a holler.
I'll be upstairs asleep.

303
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,697
I'm sorry, Daddy. It looks good,
even if they're not lit.

304
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:37,763
Thank you, sweetheart.

305
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,534
Well, Dad, it was a good try.

306
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,138
Thanks, Russ.

307
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,970
We checked every bulb, didn't we?

308
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:56,709
I'm sure of it.

309
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,603
Maybe we ought to go up there and just...

310
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:03,335
Geez! Look at the time.

311
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,634
I have to go to bed.

312
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,947
Brush my teeth, feed the hog.

313
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:12,105
I still got some homework to do,
do the laundry, wash the car...

314
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,813
Don't stay up too late.

315
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,733
Get off me, you little fungus.

316
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:41,356
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

317
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:06,317
- I need just a few more...
- Pay by check, if you can.

318
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,677
- Not a card?
- No, it's a hassle if you have to return.

319
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:17,204
Help!

320
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,444
Daddy. Is Clark coming?

321
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:20,722
How the hell would I know?

322
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:21,720
Is he in the house?

323
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:24,566
If he's not farting around
with the lights, he must be.

324
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:27,383
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

325
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:32,151
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pill.

326
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:27,105
I want to take off these clothes,
sit with a glass of wine...

327
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:29,029
...and kiss every inch of your body.

328
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,811
- After you shower, of course.
- Of course.

329
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,829
- Sparky?
- Yes, honey.

330
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:01,820
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

331
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,869
I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

332
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,591
Meantime, I can light the Santa...

333
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:10,788
...and the eight tiny reindeer
and the "Merry Christmas" sign.

334
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,245
That should look good. Ready?

335
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:15,105
Want me to do the drum roll thing?

336
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:17,184
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

337
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:26,178
I don't understand it.

338
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:30,916
The house lights don't work,
the floodlights don't work.

339
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,526
Is it plugged in?

340
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:37,575
Do you think I would check
thousands of tiny lights...

341
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:40,576
...if I wasn't sure
the extension cord was plugged in?

342
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:44,767
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

343
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:50,728
Maybe the kids have been fooling around
with it. I'll check in the back.

344
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:11,723
Clark!

345
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:15,877
- Todd!
- Sorry!

346
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:21,673
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

347
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:37,734
I can't see!

348
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:57,004
This ought to do it.

349
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:11,140
I fixed it!

350
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:17,260
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

351
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,823
- Get a towel.
- Okay!

352
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,099
Wait a minute! I don't believe this.

353
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,372
What's all that yelling about?

354
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:38,631
What's going on here?!

355
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:42,380
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

356
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,574
What's he doing?

357
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,369
I haven't the foggiest.

358
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:51,016
What the hell?!

359
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,704
What is wrong with this?!

360
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:56,839
Damn it!

361
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,671
You goddamn thing!

362
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:35,722
Dad, it's beautiful!

363
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,851
Oh, my carpet!

364
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,987
Clark, it's so lovely.

365
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:09,906
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

366
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,338
It's a beaut, Clark. A beaut.

367
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,300
You taught me everything I know
about exterior illumination.

368
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:22,065
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,596
Russ. Audrey.

370
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,027
Dear... Francis.

371
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,468
I hope this adds
to your enjoyment of the holidays.

372
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,700
It's just wonderful.

373
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:42,063
Arthur.

374
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:43,980
Art.

375
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,703
Dad.

376
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:48,685
Thanks for being here.

377
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,286
The little lights are not twinkling.

378
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:53,905
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

379
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,621
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

380
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:01,972
Thanks, Eddie.

381
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:06,386
I hope it enhances your holiday spirit.
Dear Catherine.

382
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:08,273
Eddie?

383
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:11,885
The house is gorgeous, Clark.

384
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,065
Eddie?

385
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:17,422
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

386
00:40:17,753 --> 00:40:21,201
Kids, come on out here and see
what Uncle Clark's done to the house.

387
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:22,288
Eddie?

388
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:30,361
Eddie?

389
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,984
If you don't remember, this here is Rocky.

390
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:40,473
- Have you got a kiss for me?
- Take a rain check on that, Art.

391
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,255
He's got a lip fungus
that ain't identified yet.

392
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,760
You remember Ruby Sue?

393
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,831
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:55,318
Her eyes are not crossed anymore.

395
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,794
That somethin', ain't it?

396
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,866
She falls in a well, her eyes go cross.

397
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:02,235
A mule kicks her, they go back to normal.
I don't know.

398
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,829
And this here is our pride and joy.

399
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,274
Snots.

400
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,252
Pretty name.

401
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:14,291
We named him that
'cause he's got this sinus condition.

402
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:18,232
Snots, you roll over
and let Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

403
00:41:20,317 --> 00:41:23,514
You never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

404
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,877
That's okay, Eddie.

405
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,789
That's somethin', ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

406
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,965
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

407
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:33,524
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

408
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:38,550
We were going to call,
but Eddie wanted to make it a surprise.

409
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,058
You surprised?

410
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:41,300
Surprised, Eddie?

411
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,801
If I woke up tomorrow
with my head sewn to the carpet...

412
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:46,299
...I wouldn't be more surprised
than I am right now.

413
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:50,388
We have plenty of room.

414
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:55,893
Plenty of towels. Plenty of everything.

415
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:01,268
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight but...

416
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,284
...we didn't come to impose.

417
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,115
There's plenty of room.

418
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:07,510
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

419
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:13,338
Catherine and I are pretty comfy in there,
but maybe you folks wouldn't mind...

420
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,033
...the youngsters shacking up with you.

421
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,859
After that long drive...

422
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,513
...we could use
a little private time together.

423
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,371
Honey, why don't you get the kids' things.
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

424
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,196
I'll show you the home.

425
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,656
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.

426
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:07,675
Is it real?

427
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:10,333
I dug it out of the ground myself.

428
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:11,679
Is that a fact?

429
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:13,788
Get out of there, Snots!

430
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:14,806
Don't worry about it.

431
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:17,304
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

432
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:20,258
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

433
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:23,040
He lifted his leg the next mornin'...

434
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:28,065
If he drinks the water out of there,
the tree's gonna dry up.

435
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:29,757
Come on out of there.

436
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:35,353
Get out of there. Go in the kitchen
and get something to eat.

437
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:37,694
He's cute, ain't he?

438
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:41,506
Only problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

439
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:45,822
If the mood catches him right,
he'll grab your leg and just go to town.

440
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:50,722
You don't want him around
if you're wearing short pants.

441
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:53,274
A word of warning, though.

442
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:56,447
If he does lay into you,
it's best to just let him finish.

443
00:43:59,044 --> 00:44:02,492
I can't believe you're actually
standing here in my living room, Eddie.

444
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:04,165
Never thought the day would come.

445
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,986
I'm excited about it, too.

446
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:09,763
It's a cryin' shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

447
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:15,684
I'll get that.
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

448
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:23,840
I got the daughter in the clinic
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

449
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:28,387
The older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

450
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,460
- College?
- Carnival.

451
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:32,737
You gotta be proud.

452
00:44:34,248 --> 00:44:38,274
Last season, he was a pixie dust spreader
on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

453
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,601
He thinks that maybe next year,
he'll be guessing people's weight...

454
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:43,646
...or barking for the Yak Woman.

455
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:46,982
- You ever see her?
- No.

456
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:50,244
She got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

457
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:52,860
She's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.

458
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:54,081
And a hell of a good cook.

459
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,738
Can I refill your eggnog for you?
Get you something to eat?

460
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:59,197
Drive you out to the middle of nowhere
and leave you for dead?

461
00:44:59,272 --> 00:45:01,344
No, I'm doing just fine.

462
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,206
Just glad to be here.

463
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,362
When did you get
the tenement on wheels?

464
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:10,885
Oh, that? That's an RV.

465
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,922
I borrowed it off a buddy of mine.

466
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:16,710
He took my house, I took the RV.

467
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,519
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

468
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,025
It looks so nice parked in the driveway.

469
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:25,286
It sure does.
Don't you go falling in love with it.

470
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:28,960
We're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

471
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:41,128
Get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures!

472
00:45:41,674 --> 00:45:43,747
Retooling. That's a great excuse.

473
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,008
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

474
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:52,801
Mr. Shirley, Merry Christmas.

475
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:54,405
Who's that?

476
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,900
It's me, Clark Griswold.

477
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,473
What do you want?

478
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:03,689
My wife and I just came up with
a little something special. It's a gift.

479
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:07,204
Put it over there
with the others, Greaseball.

480
00:46:17,453 --> 00:46:21,730
By the way, I hope my report helped out
at the trade show.

481
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:28,322
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

482
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:32,234
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of an important call.

483
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:34,443
Get me somebody.

484
00:46:34,573 --> 00:46:35,751
Anybody.

485
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:38,982
And get me somebody while I'm waiting.

486
00:46:51,438 --> 00:46:55,431
This is a new non-caloric,
silicon-based kitchen lubricant...

487
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:56,810
...my company's been working on.

488
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:00,424
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than cooking oil.

489
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:02,829
We'll fly down the hill with this stuff.

490
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,190
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?

491
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:06,670
Not that I know of.

492
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:12,004
Don't go puttin' none of that stuff
on my sled, Clark.

493
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:15,532
- You know the metal plate in my head?
- How could I forget it.

494
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:19,373
I had it replaced. Every time
Catherine raved up the microwave...

495
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,221
...l'd piss in my pants
and forget who I was.

496
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:25,358
Over at the V.A., they had it replaced
with a plastic one.

497
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:27,525
That ain't as strong, so...

498
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:30,089
I shouldn't go sailing down a hill...

499
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,332
...with nothing between
the ground and my brain...

500
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:34,540
...but a piece of government plastic.

501
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:37,707
You really think it matters, Eddie?

502
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:40,493
The plate runs right underneath my part.

503
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,654
Over here is nothing, but...

504
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:49,615
...if this gets dented,
then my hair just ain't going to look right.

505
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:53,584
I know the feeling.

506
00:47:54,898 --> 00:47:57,265
I better try this first. See how it works.

507
00:47:57,329 --> 00:47:59,085
Be careful there, Clark.

508
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,009
Nothing to worry about, Eddie.

509
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:05,361
Going for a new, amateur-recreational-
saucer-sled land-speed record...

510
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:08,167
Clark W. Griswold, Junior!

511
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:12,015
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

512
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,336
Later, dudes.

513
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:19,529
Let her rip. Hang ten.

514
00:48:36,532 --> 00:48:37,907
It's great! I'm dead!

515
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:23,375
Bingo.

516
00:49:35,863 --> 00:49:37,718
- You're staying late?
- Hi, Bill.

517
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:39,059
Yeah. Just...

518
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:43,052
...finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

519
00:49:43,703 --> 00:49:46,421
Have a really Merry Christmas.

520
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:48,719
You, too.

521
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:52,208
You okay?

522
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,188
Yeah.

523
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:58,253
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

524
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:00,407
Just talked to my son.

525
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:03,478
Company messenger just brought
something to my house.

526
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:06,231
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute, huh?

527
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:08,596
You get yours?

528
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:13,170
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it must be on its way.

529
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,919
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

530
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,996
Don't sweat it. It'll come.

531
00:50:19,065 --> 00:50:20,276
Merry Christmas.

532
00:50:20,346 --> 00:50:21,523
Same to you.

533
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:44,505
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is the thing to say

534
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:47,057
"On a bright Hawaiian

535
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,885
"Christmas day.

536
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,020
"That's the island greeting

537
00:50:52,187 --> 00:50:55,122
"That we send to you
From the land

538
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:58,104
"Where palm trees sway.

539
00:50:59,036 --> 00:51:00,945
"Here we know that Christmas

540
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,838
"Will be green and bright

541
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,463
"The sun to shine by day

542
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:07,538
"And all the stars at night.

543
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:11,925
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is Hawaii's way

544
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:15,287
"To say 'Merry Christmas' to you."

545
00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:28,733
Santy Claus?

546
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,029
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

547
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:33,118
What?

548
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,262
What? You scared me.

549
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,112
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

550
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:46,652
I wish I was.

551
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,873
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

552
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:54,107
Rocky bit my thumb.

553
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,471
Him's nervous
because Christmas is almost here.

554
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,001
Nervous or excited?

555
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,791
Shittin' bricks.

556
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:04,504
You shouldn't use that word.

557
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:06,968
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

558
00:53:09,635 --> 00:53:12,952
Him's nervous because he don't know
if he's gettin' nothin'.

559
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:18,910
I don't think he should be nervous,
and you shouldn't be, either.

560
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,697
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

561
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,768
If you believe in him and in your mom...

562
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:26,461
...and you believe in...

563
00:53:26,756 --> 00:53:28,033
...your dad...

564
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:33,531
...and you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus will bring you something.

565
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:37,149
Sometimes I think
all that Santa crap is just bull.

566
00:53:37,637 --> 00:53:40,833
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

567
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,357
We didn't do nothin' wrong
and we still got the shaft.

568
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:48,346
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

569
00:53:49,061 --> 00:53:51,068
And in the next couple of days...

570
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:53,793
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

571
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:58,012
Every year, he comes to our house.
I've seen him.

572
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,253
It's true?

573
00:54:00,518 --> 00:54:01,795
Cross my heart.

574
00:54:05,381 --> 00:54:07,487
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

575
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:11,551
I love it here. You don't gotta put on
your coat to go to the bathroom.

576
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:14,436
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

577
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,035
I think you better go back to bed, now.

578
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,759
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

579
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,472
I was looking for something.

580
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,894
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

581
00:54:37,544 --> 00:54:39,300
Nope. How come?

582
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,152
Just wondering.

583
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:48,673
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

584
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,892
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

585
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:00,064
I'm sure.

586
00:55:05,193 --> 00:55:07,081
I can't even afford to be an elf.

587
00:55:17,802 --> 00:55:21,795
I had two containers of K-rations...
two containers...

588
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:25,417
...and I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears!

589
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:37,991
Aren't you having any breakfast?

590
00:55:38,058 --> 00:55:39,651
No. Not in the mood.

591
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:42,789
What are you looking at?

592
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:48,197
The silent majesty of a winter's morn.
The clean...

593
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:50,370
...cool chill of the holiday air.

594
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:54,052
An asshole, in a bathrobe,
emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

595
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,610
The shitter was full.

596
00:56:01,485 --> 00:56:03,339
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

597
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:05,794
Clark, please.
He doesn't know any better.

598
00:56:06,124 --> 00:56:08,230
He ought to know it's illegal.
It's a storm sewer.

599
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,524
If it fills with gas, I pity the person
who lights a match within ten yards of it.

600
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:35,719
Merry Christmas.

601
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,604
The shitter was full.

602
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:56,078
I have this suspicion that Catherine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

603
00:56:56,144 --> 00:57:00,617
Rocky said Eddie told him
Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

604
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:07,342
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night.
How can they have nothing for their kids?

605
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:09,415
He's been out of work
for almost seven years.

606
00:57:09,488 --> 00:57:11,660
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

607
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:15,406
Catherine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

608
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:20,939
So, how's the live bait business?

609
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:23,725
I can't complain. How you doing?

610
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:25,962
Not that good, actually.

611
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:29,739
Your company kill off all them people
in India not long ago?

612
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,141
No, we missed out on that one.

613
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,014
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

614
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,646
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

615
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:40,458
The truth is, things ain't goin'
too good at all.

616
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:43,826
You know I told you I borrowed
the RV from a neighbor?

617
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:45,382
It's mine.

618
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,083
We live in it.

619
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,761
I had to sell off the house,
the barn, the ten acres...

620
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:56,041
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

621
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,804
If I only had back the money
me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

622
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:04,176
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

623
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:06,608
What about the kids?

624
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:09,000
His kids can fend for themselves.

625
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:10,544
Your kids.

626
00:58:11,796 --> 00:58:14,414
That's the bitch of it.
I don't know what to do.

627
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:18,761
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Guerney.

628
00:58:22,835 --> 00:58:25,902
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

629
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:28,045
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

630
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:29,579
We insist.

631
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,147
No, I'm not one for charity.

632
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:35,668
I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

633
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,668
I don't know about that.

634
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:43,723
Now, come on, if you don't tell me
what they want, I'll get it on my own.

635
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:50,450
This is a surprise, Clark.

636
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:53,166
This is a real nice surprise.

637
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:56,525
Just a real nice surprise.

638
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:02,540
Here's a list.

639
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:05,003
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

640
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:09,171
If it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

641
00:59:09,303 --> 00:59:11,692
Something really nice.

642
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:30,387
Is your house on fire, Clark?

643
00:59:30,616 --> 00:59:32,558
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

644
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:34,355
Don't throw me down, Clark.

645
00:59:34,456 --> 00:59:35,732
I'll try not to.

646
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:38,132
Is this the airport?

647
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:39,570
We're here!

648
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:43,088
Me and Bethany figured out
the perfect gift for you.

649
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:45,910
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to
buy me anything.

650
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:48,213
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

651
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:50,383
That was fun.

652
00:59:50,777 --> 00:59:53,013
I love riding in cars.

653
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:56,214
When did you move to Florida?

654
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:01,462
Are you still dating Clark?

655
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:07,025
You know you shouldn't have done that.

656
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:09,487
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

657
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:14,000
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?
Hell, no.

658
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:17,106
She means presents.
You shouldn't have bought presents.

659
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:20,953
It isn't every day somebody moves
into a new house.

660
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:23,186
They didn't move into a new house.

661
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:26,581
In the living room.

662
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:30,776
This house is bigger than your old one.

663
01:00:32,443 --> 01:00:34,515
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

664
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:39,896
Why don't you go into the living room
and say hello to everybody?

665
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:43,187
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

666
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,633
- Mom?
- What?

667
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,776
This box is meowing.

668
01:00:57,308 --> 01:00:58,869
She wrapped up her damn cat.

669
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:01,916
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up.
- And have a cat running around?

670
01:01:01,981 --> 01:01:03,355
We can't leave it in the box.

671
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,809
Why would somebody wrap up
a cat in a box?

672
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,028
She gets confused. She's old.

673
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:11,093
They don't have much money,
so she takes things from the house...

674
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:13,238
...wraps them up,
gives them away as presents.

675
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:14,803
Can't wait to see what I got!

676
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:16,470
This one here...

677
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:17,911
...is leaking.

678
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:24,505
Lime.

679
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,365
It's her Jell-O mold.

680
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,456
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into
the living room and enjoy yourself.

681
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:35,256
Let's go find your sister.

682
01:01:55,616 --> 01:01:56,728
Before we begin...

683
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,896
...since this is Aunt Bethany's
80th Christmas...

684
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:03,231
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

685
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,281
What, dear?

686
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:11,068
Grace!

687
01:02:12,544 --> 01:02:15,806
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

688
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:18,939
They want you to say grace.

689
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:23,738
The blessing.

690
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,280
"I pledge allegiance...

691
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:45,019
"...to the flag of
the United States of America...

692
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:47,035
"...and to the republic...

693
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:51,357
"...for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible...

694
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:55,103
"...with liberty and justice for all."

695
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:57,886
Amen.

696
01:03:03,907 --> 01:03:07,683
Catherine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

697
01:03:07,908 --> 01:03:10,396
...I think we're all
in for a very big treat.

698
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:16,160
Save the neck for me, Clark.

699
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,117
I'm sorry.

700
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:35,131
Why are you crying?

701
01:03:35,204 --> 01:03:37,594
I told you we put it in too early.

702
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,385
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

703
01:03:43,014 --> 01:03:44,028
Here's the heart.

704
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:43,781
Aunt Bethany...

705
01:04:45,353 --> 01:04:47,393
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

706
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:51,432
I don't know about the cat...

707
01:04:51,817 --> 01:04:53,127
...but I'm enjoying it.

708
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:06,727
Kids...

709
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:08,642
...I heard on the news...

710
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:13,155
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled
on its way in from New York.

711
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:19,972
You serious, Clark?

712
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,240
Load me up with a little more there.
It's good.

713
01:05:36,652 --> 01:05:38,310
What's wrong with the dog?

714
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:46,407
He's just yackin' on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

715
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:50,596
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him
from the table...

716
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:53,670
No.

717
01:05:54,477 --> 01:05:57,346
He's probably just nosing
through the trash.

718
01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:09,354
If you're not doing anything constructive...

719
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:11,942
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

720
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:16,172
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

721
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:18,858
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

722
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:22,633
He keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

723
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:56,235
That should be it.

724
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:14,440
I told you, you had
too many plugs in one outlet.

725
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:17,807
What is it?

726
01:07:19,986 --> 01:07:22,801
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

727
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:28,392
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

728
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:37,032
If you don't mind,
I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

729
01:07:37,715 --> 01:07:39,438
It's a good quality item.

730
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:45,353
If you don't mind me askin',
how much it set you back?

731
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,881
Do you smell something?

732
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,441
Fried pussycat.

733
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:57,547
It's not the chair, it's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

734
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:46,737
My tree!

735
01:08:48,854 --> 01:08:50,797
So, what's the matter with you?

736
01:08:51,766 --> 01:08:53,773
Look what you've done to my tree!

737
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:10,422
It was an ugly tree anyway.

738
01:09:11,223 --> 01:09:13,198
At least it's out of its misery.

739
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:15,789
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

740
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:18,230
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

741
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:22,998
What the hell do you want?

742
01:09:23,064 --> 01:09:25,748
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

743
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,051
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

744
01:09:28,184 --> 01:09:32,341
...but it fell between the seats
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

745
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:40,501
Merry Christmas.

746
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:42,965
Merry Christmas.

747
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:48,436
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

748
01:09:49,082 --> 01:09:51,799
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nuthouse?

749
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:53,555
It's from my company.

750
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,093
Your bonus.

751
01:09:55,802 --> 01:09:56,663
My bonus.

752
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:03,926
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

753
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:06,643
I hope it's a fortune.

754
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,501
I bet you do.

755
01:10:13,178 --> 01:10:14,160
I was afraid...

756
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:18,103
Are you going to bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

757
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:23,961
I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to tell you all this, but what the heck?

758
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:28,024
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

759
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:34,327
That's it. That's the big one!

760
01:10:36,668 --> 01:10:37,683
Open it!

761
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:43,611
I'm sorry if I've been
a little short with everyone lately.

762
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:45,879
I've been waiting for this bonus.

763
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,181
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

764
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:50,162
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

765
01:10:50,237 --> 01:10:54,231
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough
to cover the check.

766
01:10:54,557 --> 01:10:56,662
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

767
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,129
Drum roll.

768
01:11:07,678 --> 01:11:11,606
If there's enough left,
I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

769
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,044
I can't swim, Clark.

770
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:19,610
I know that, Eddie.

771
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:35,129
What's wrong?

772
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,572
It's bigger than you expected?

773
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,054
Smaller?

774
01:11:47,776 --> 01:11:48,889
What is it?

775
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:54,269
A one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

776
01:11:55,392 --> 01:11:59,221
That's the gift that keeps on giving
the whole year.

777
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,304
That it is, Edward.

778
01:12:03,233 --> 01:12:04,345
That it is, indeed.

779
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:06,330
I'm sorry.

780
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:13,054
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

781
01:12:14,049 --> 01:12:14,812
Son.

782
01:12:27,714 --> 01:12:29,307
It's good.

783
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:41,338
If any of you are looking
for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

784
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:42,655
...I have one.

785
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:46,012
I'd like Frank Shirley,
my boss, right here, tonight.

786
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:51,136
Brought from his happy holiday slumber
on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

787
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,209
I want him brought right here...

788
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,696
...with a big ribbon on his head and
I want to look him straight in the eye...

789
01:12:57,955 --> 01:13:01,304
...and I want to tell him
what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

790
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:04,446
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

791
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,923
...ignorant, bloodsucking,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

792
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,893
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

793
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,929
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

794
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,538
Hallelujah!

795
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:20,258
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

796
01:13:33,318 --> 01:13:35,172
He has that crazy look in his eye.

797
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:37,474
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

798
01:13:37,798 --> 01:13:40,253
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

799
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:42,590
I'll talk to him, Mom.

800
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,332
You know, Dad...

801
01:13:47,462 --> 01:13:48,989
...l've been thinking.

802
01:13:50,502 --> 01:13:51,877
Good talk.

803
01:13:57,478 --> 01:14:00,326
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry
we didn't get a Christmas tree?

804
01:14:00,423 --> 01:14:03,457
Even though they're dirty and messy
and corny and clichd?

805
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:06,977
Where are you going to find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

806
01:14:25,512 --> 01:14:26,373
What's the matter?

807
01:14:28,585 --> 01:14:29,795
Was that really necessary?

808
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,411
We needed a tree.

809
01:14:33,481 --> 01:14:35,074
May I remind you that...

810
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:38,275
That this was all my idea?
No, no. I'm well aware of that.

811
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:42,182
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

812
01:14:42,505 --> 01:14:45,538
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

813
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:49,216
We needed a coffin.

814
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:53,954
A tree. There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

815
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:58,121
Louis burned down my tree
so I replaced it as best I could. Voil...

816
01:14:58,666 --> 01:14:59,843
Are you okay?

817
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:01,474
I'm fine, honey.

818
01:15:25,068 --> 01:15:26,661
I fixed the newel post.

819
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:50,122
What's that sound?

820
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,427
Do you hear it?

821
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,725
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

822
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:20,741
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

823
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:23,434
I hear it, too.

824
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:33,061
I don't hear it anymore.

825
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:39,468
Squirrel!

826
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:48,751
What was it? Oh, my God!

827
01:16:54,832 --> 01:16:56,109
Quiet! Shut up!

828
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:10,509
Mom, don't move.

829
01:17:12,913 --> 01:17:14,954
We can't let it out of the living room.

830
01:17:16,082 --> 01:17:18,832
Where's Eddie?
He usually eats these goddamn things.

831
01:17:19,154 --> 01:17:22,602
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels
were high in cholesterol.

832
01:17:23,794 --> 01:17:25,004
Thank you, Catherine.

833
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:27,627
I'll try and trap it.

834
01:17:27,794 --> 01:17:28,809
Russ!

835
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:30,025
We're here, Dad.

836
01:17:30,642 --> 01:17:31,624
There you are.

837
01:17:32,755 --> 01:17:34,097
Go get the hammer.

838
01:17:34,355 --> 01:17:36,210
What do you need a hammer for?

839
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:40,047
I'll catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

840
01:17:47,156 --> 01:17:48,683
I'm going in with him.

841
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:53,388
Nora?

842
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:57,800
Is it gone?

843
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:00,266
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

844
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:02,670
Squirrel!

845
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:43,792
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

846
01:18:43,959 --> 01:18:45,421
I can't just attack someone.

847
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:49,553
All right, then. If you're not man enough
to put an end to this shit, then I am.

848
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:11,121
Gone.

849
01:19:16,441 --> 01:19:17,968
Oh, my God.

850
01:19:21,016 --> 01:19:22,445
What happened to you?

851
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:37,395
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

852
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:40,471
Nobody walks out
on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

853
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:42,839
No, we're all in this together.

854
01:19:43,162 --> 01:19:46,032
This is a full-blown,
four-alarm holiday emergency.

855
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:49,495
We're going to press on
and have the happiest Christmas...

856
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:52,375
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny fucking Kaye.

857
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:55,344
And when Santa squeezes
his fat, white ass down the chimney...

858
01:19:55,418 --> 01:19:59,248
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

859
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,628
You're goofy.

860
01:20:00,923 --> 01:20:02,516
Don't piss me off, Art.

861
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:06,611
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

862
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:07,893
Stay out of this, Dad.

863
01:20:07,963 --> 01:20:10,930
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

864
01:20:11,259 --> 01:20:12,787
Before things get worse.

865
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,729
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

866
01:20:15,964 --> 01:20:19,793
Look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell!

867
01:20:37,085 --> 01:20:38,033
Son.

868
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:42,041
I love you. We all love you.

869
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:45,714
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

870
01:20:46,461 --> 01:20:49,178
But losing your temper
only makes things worse.

871
01:20:49,405 --> 01:20:51,958
You're too good a father to act like this.

872
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:58,359
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us...

873
01:20:58,622 --> 01:21:01,556
...and how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

874
01:21:02,142 --> 01:21:03,669
You just cocked it up.

875
01:21:06,526 --> 01:21:08,763
It's okay. It happens.

876
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,020
All our holidays were always such a mess.

877
01:21:15,007 --> 01:21:16,730
How did you get through it?

878
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:19,477
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

879
01:21:28,768 --> 01:21:30,044
I love you.

880
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,536
Will you recite
"The Night Before Christmas"?

881
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:38,844
No. It's your house.

882
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,598
It's your Christmas.

883
01:21:41,727 --> 01:21:43,255
I'm retiring.

884
01:21:44,577 --> 01:21:47,326
"The children were nestled
All snug in their beds

885
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:50,518
"While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

886
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,534
"And Mama in her kerchief

887
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:56,438
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains
For a long winter's nap

888
01:21:56,705 --> 01:22:00,054
"When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter

889
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:02,300
"I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

890
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,409
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

891
01:22:04,577 --> 01:22:06,814
"Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash

892
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:08,919
"The moon on the breast of
the new-fallen snow

893
01:22:08,994 --> 01:22:11,415
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

894
01:22:11,585 --> 01:22:13,822
"When what to my wondering eyes
should appear

895
01:22:13,922 --> 01:22:15,548
"But a miniature sleigh..."

896
01:22:17,218 --> 01:22:18,047
...and Eddie.

897
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:20,923
And a man in his pajamas
with a dog chain...

898
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:23,424
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the...?

899
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:26,844
Stay here.

900
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:34,906
Merry Christmas, Clark.

901
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:38,848
You about ready to do some kissin'?

902
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:43,102
Officer, it seems
my husband has been abducted.

903
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:46,845
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

904
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:53,027
...and the plates were from Kansas.
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

905
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,584
I have never been treated
like this in my life.

906
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:58,049
I'm sorry.
This is our family's first kidnapping.

907
01:22:59,044 --> 01:23:00,222
You're fired.

908
01:23:00,612 --> 01:23:02,368
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

909
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,346
Just hold your wad there, fella.

910
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:08,289
Clark had nothin' to do with this.
This here was my idea.

911
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:11,965
All right. He's still fired
and you are going to jail.

912
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:15,261
It was my fault.

913
01:23:16,294 --> 01:23:20,287
I lost my temper when I got my bonus
and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

914
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:24,927
Bonus? How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

915
01:23:26,055 --> 01:23:27,516
Thanks for telling us.

916
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:30,786
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

917
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:35,163
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten
a bonus every year, but this one.

918
01:23:35,494 --> 01:23:37,349
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

919
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,779
When people count on them
as part of their salary...

920
01:23:40,007 --> 01:23:41,666
What you did just plain...

921
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:42,814
Sucks.

922
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:45,891
Thank you, Russ.

923
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:52,132
My cousin-in-law,
whose heart is bigger than his brain...

924
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:53,885
I appreciate that.

925
01:23:55,175 --> 01:23:58,143
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this...

926
01:23:58,536 --> 01:24:02,365
...on behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

927
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:26,376
Sometimes things look good
on paper, but...

928
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:30,376
...lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

929
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:33,727
A healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much if...

930
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,769
...to get it, you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

931
01:24:38,858 --> 01:24:43,168
It's people that make the difference.
Little people, like you.

932
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:47,584
So, Carl...

933
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:51,200
...whatever you got last year...

934
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:54,054
...add 20 percent.

935
01:25:44,942 --> 01:25:46,851
Go away, Todd.

936
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:52,292
If you want to come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

937
01:26:03,022 --> 01:26:06,056
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

938
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:18,216
Freeze!

939
01:26:20,303 --> 01:26:22,059
Not you! Them!

940
01:26:31,504 --> 01:26:32,781
This way, please.

941
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:37,518
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

942
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,270
I told you to freeze, mister.

943
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:40,682
May we blink?

944
01:26:47,185 --> 01:26:50,054
- Thank God you're all right.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

945
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:52,294
There was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

946
01:26:52,817 --> 01:26:57,073
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley
like to step outside so we can finish here?

947
01:26:58,066 --> 01:27:00,553
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

948
01:27:01,585 --> 01:27:02,829
It was a mistake.

949
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:05,515
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

950
01:27:05,842 --> 01:27:07,816
I did something I shouldn't have...

951
01:27:07,986 --> 01:27:12,395
...and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his family.

952
01:27:12,787 --> 01:27:14,216
Welcome to our home.

953
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:16,848
What's left of it.

954
01:27:16,946 --> 01:27:18,255
Release B Squad.

955
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:19,921
What's going on here?

956
01:27:20,146 --> 01:27:24,304
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

957
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:26,224
You didn't.

958
01:27:26,483 --> 01:27:29,679
Of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

959
01:27:29,907 --> 01:27:31,282
That's pretty low, mister.

960
01:27:31,827 --> 01:27:33,354
If I had a rubber hose...

961
01:27:33,427 --> 01:27:35,664
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

962
01:27:41,044 --> 01:27:42,637
Look!

963
01:27:44,948 --> 01:27:46,060
Look!

964
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:54,062
It's Santy Claus.

965
01:27:57,749 --> 01:27:59,822
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

966
01:28:01,269 --> 01:28:02,894
It's the Christmas star.

967
01:28:03,349 --> 01:28:05,105
And that's all that matters tonight.

968
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:10,386
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

969
01:28:10,966 --> 01:28:12,242
See, kids...

970
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:15,508
It means something different
to everybody.

971
01:28:17,685 --> 01:28:19,409
Now I know what it means to me.

972
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:23,507
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

973
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:26,704
It's the light
on the sewage treatment plant.

974
01:28:26,966 --> 01:28:28,242
Sewer gas.

975
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:31,475
Don't drop that!

976
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:43,501
"And the rocket's red glare

977
01:28:44,471 --> 01:28:47,505
"The bombs bursting in air

978
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:50,386
"Gave proof through the night

979
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:54,797
"That our flag was still there

980
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:57,904
"Oh, say does that

981
01:28:57,976 --> 01:29:02,384
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

982
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:07,501
"O'er the land of the free

983
01:29:10,073 --> 01:29:13,902
"And the home of the brave?"

984
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:19,760
Play ball!

985
01:29:27,513 --> 01:29:29,423
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

986
01:29:30,393 --> 01:29:31,954
Merry Christmas, honey.

987
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:00,947
I did it.
