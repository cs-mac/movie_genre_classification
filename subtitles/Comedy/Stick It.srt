00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:29,288
Respect? [laughing]
Is this how you respect people?

163
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:33,069
You throw 'em over a shoulder
and violate their personal space?

164
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,556
Oh, goody.

165
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,021
I heard you were like this.
I'm so glad it's true.

166
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,397
What is it that you've
done to earn my respect?

167
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:43,246
We have rules.
We have rules for training.

168
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:44,261
Oh.

169
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,540
And the reason
that we have rules...

170
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,925
...and coaches is because
this is gymnastics.

171
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,691
Hey!

172
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,831
That was rude. [sighs]

173
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:58,279
While danger and risk is the reality
of what we do, it's calculated.

174
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:01,484
Can't be calculated
if you don't respect the laws.

175
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:03,375
[Sighing]

176
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:05,743
Uh-huh.

177
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:08,297
[Shouting]

178
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,093
The laws of gravity,
for instance.

179
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,913
OK, what's your point?

180
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:16,361
Look, I want you
to be back here tomorrow

181
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,190
at 10am, ready to train.

182
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:22,087
Or we can call the judge,
and you can go to jail.

183
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,006
Hey, you decide.

184
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,035
[Haley] Don't expect me to train.

185
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,693
- And lose the hat tomorrow.
- [Haley] Lose the gum.

186
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:34,928
Good morning, ladies.

187
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,676
How's your neck?
Feeling better?

188
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,439
- It feels much better.
- Good, good.

189
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,297
Now, remember, stretch. Yeah?

190
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,762
'Morning, Haley.

191
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:45,770
- Hey.
- Be with you in a minute.

192
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,226
Now... Well, you know
about your daughter.

193
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,627
Your daughter is
the best one, I've gotta say.

194
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,059
I've never seen
anything quite like her.

195
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,743
We'd like to fast-track her
towards becoming an elite.

196
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,847
- That's 20 hours a week.
- Well, she's a star.

197
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,892
- [Woman] She's six.
- Oh...

198
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,413
I've got two other kids.
That is a big commitment.

199
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:10,098
We'd have her nationally ranked
by the time she's ten.

200
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,948
Olympic track by age 13.
That's the gold.

201
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:17,040
- You mean the goal.
- Did I say gold? [laughs]

202
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,620
Well, you see?

203
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:23,924
I guess Madison and gold
are becoming synonymous for me.

204
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:29,841
- [Woman] I'll have the check Tuesday.
- Wonderful.

205
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,820
[Haley] Uh, yeah.

206
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,164
You got a lot of people
going to the Olympics.

207
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:37,517
Just wondering, um, what country
are they gonna represent?

208
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,663
State of Delusion?

209
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:59,416
- [Woman] Good, job, girls.
- I'm so hot. It's so hot outside.

210
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,190
Vick! When can we scrap
the old long-sleeve leotards?

211
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:05,329
We need new ones
for championships.

212
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:07,735
Every college will be scouting me.

213
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,230
[Scoffing]

214
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,056
Not that you have
to worry about any of that.

215
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,311
New leotard might distract,
you know, the judges and scouts

216
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:19,062
from your lack of talent.
It's a solid strategy.

217
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:22,872
Gee, Pariah Carey, I wonder
why no one's scouting you.

218
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:26,898
Oh, I forgot, you don't matter.

219
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,050
That she can even say
the word "college"

220
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,220
is an indictment
against the institution.

221
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,291
Hey, Filibuster, no one cares.

222
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,047
Wei Wei. Those moves are
throwing off your routines.

223
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:42,904
Sorry.

224
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,786
Chalk.
Storage closet. Now.

225
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,891
[Sighs]

226
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:50,779
[Woman with accent]
Pretty feet, pretty feet.

227
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:54,260
Point them hard
and win the meet.

228
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:55,510
Very good. Yes.

229
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,556
[Girl] Dorrie, did you
see the last one?

230
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,899
- [Clapping]
- Wow.

231
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:05,657
Deja-jealous, Haley?
Bring back memories?

232
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,962
We trained together
at Defrank's for how long?

233
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,299
That would be, uh... too long.

234
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:14,260
And he'd give you so much
attention because you sucked.

235
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,444
Right.

236
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,747
Yeah, I sucked my way to Worlds.

237
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:22,611
Glad to see you haven't lost
your love of accuracy, Joanne.

238
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:26,614
Well, at least I didn't make it
all the way to Worlds and...

239
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,075
...um, choke.

240
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,965
[Chuckling] Here, let me show you how,

241
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:33,820
- you little...
- [screaming]

242
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,992
[Woman] Hey!
Stop right now! Stop it!

243
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:40,635
I said, pointy feet,
not pointy words.

244
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,485
Pointy words
are mouth turds. God!

245
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,367
- [Woman muttering]
- I'm OK. She's crazy.

246
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,702
I'm so jealous of Joanne
that I've actually

247
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,102
already memorized
her preschool beam routine.

248
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:53,918
Hey, easy.
I choreographed that routine.

249
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,919
[Mimicking accent]
Your secret is safe with me.

250
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,573
[Humming]

251
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,739
We got some finger-flickin'
good choreography.

252
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,111
And the classic butt shelf.

253
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,861
[Pretends to fart]
Joanne, how embarrassing.

254
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,481
Then we have some
useless bits of fluff

255
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,401
to get us from
point A to point B.

256
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,881
And induces the urge to vacuum.

257
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,475
[Whirring]

258
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,283
- Mina, right?
- Yeah, Mina.

259
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,110
Mina, put down the phone.

260
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,440
[Haley] Can you tell Joanne I'm gonna
take over and do a real dismount?

261
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,638
Joanne, Haley's on the phone.
She's gonna do a real dismount.

262
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,529
I heard her, thank you.

263
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,984
How 'bout a double back?

264
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,841
You will not throw a double back
without training it first.

265
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,209
- [Haley] Close your eyes.
- Over my dead body.

266
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,828
- Little CPR might do you good.
- [Vick] Haley!

267
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:51,585
- [Gasping]
- [Chuckling]

268
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:52,928
[Haley] Ahh...

269
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:56,673
Shall we share our philosophy
with Haley, ladies?

270
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,385
Speak my mind.
What are we about?

271
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,065
[All] Clean, safe routines,
guaranteed to stick.

272
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,206
[Retching]

273
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,538
Is he keeping
your brains in jars?

274
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,809
Or should I be concerned
about the water?

275
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,594
[Vick] Shall we show Haley
what discipline is all about?

276
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,352
Please join us, Haley.

277
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:20,448
Ehh. No, thanks.
I'm kinda tired.

278
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,862
Oh, all right. Fine.
Ladies, outside, now!

279
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,447
Point your toes, ladies.

280
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:34,363
You're gonna keep going
until Haley participates.

281
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:37,155
This is, like, globally unfair.

282
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:41,479
- We're gonna be here all night.
- Lift your knees... Joanne.

283
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:44,642
[Joanne] This is totally
violating the penile code.

284
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,661
[Rattling]

285
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,568
Hey!

286
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,867
Hey! You guys.

287
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,205
What, do you want me
to pick the lock, or what?

288
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,444
Can you come let me in?

289
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:04,131
Oh, right. Thank you.

290
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,535
- [Girl] Get lost!
- [Sighing]

291
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,655
[Car approaching]

292
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,073
Haley, let's go for a drive.

293
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,368
...deserve to be.
- A what?

294
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,376
Thank you, Lorelei,
that was delicious.

295
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,971
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna finish this off...

296
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:33,536
- No, no.
...if that's OK.

297
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,399
- Thank you.
- Are you serious?

298
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,092
I heard you were
strict about diet,

299
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:38,853
but this is just rude.

300
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,411
Hey, you piss where I eat,
you don't eat.

301
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:42,825
Oh, but you do?

302
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,745
Does this mean
you're eating my piss?

303
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:46,720
Well, that's disgusting.

304
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,729
[Sighing]

305
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:52,138
What a charming
young lady you are.

306
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,862
Yeah, that's what they say.

307
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:55,786
[Exhaling deeply]

308
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,700
Listen, I don't suppose,
uh, college gymnastics

309
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,291
is on your to-do list, right?

310
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,365
Correct. College gymnastics
is one big fat to-don't.

311
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,324
Great. Then in
addition to sparing

312
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:08,072
innocent collegiate
gymnastics coaches everywhere,

313
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,044
you can keep any purse money
that you might win, free and clear.

314
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,801
I'm not competing
or training again. Ever.

315
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,579
Oh, you're gonna piss off
the judge and kiss 18 goodbye?

316
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,620
I guess.

317
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:24,293
- Hey.
- What the?

318
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,788
The IG Classic is
comin' up in a month.

319
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,455
Now, you apply yourself,

320
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,468
you could win
some restitution money.

321
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,681
It could get ya outta here.
What do you think?

322
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:34,923
I think if you showed up
at the Classic with me

323
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,681
an angry mob would cut your brakes.

324
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,653
- I got insurance.
- Oh, really? Well, no, thank you.

325
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:41,866
This sport is a total joke.

326
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,107
You know this.

327
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:47,371
Sorry to dis your
life's work and all. No offense.

328
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,000
Hey, none taken.

329
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,691
There's nothin' fair about
a girl landing a double pike

330
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,148
and losing a tenth 'cause
her toes weren't pointed.

331
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:57,007
Nothin' fair about judges
who don't have instant replay,

332
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:58,828
and they're lookin'
for perfection.

333
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,263
Can you imagine football
without instant replay?

334
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,184
- What about the rules?
- It'd be mayhem.

335
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:04,426
The Code of Point? Hey...

336
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,213
Yeah. It makes conventionality
good and innovation bad.

337
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,100
What's the point?

338
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,308
How 'bout the fact
that you were one

339
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:14,411
of the greatest natural talents
the sport's ever seen? Hmm?

340
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,456
C'mon, you coulda been great.

341
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,701
[Chuckling] You're not actually pushing

342
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,460
the "you coulda been great" speech.

343
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,050
You are a total cliche.
You realize that, right?

Oh, OK, come on, uh,
Original Recipe, let's hear it.

You give me the speech.

346
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,742
Fine. Uh...

347
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,857
Talent out of the ass.

348
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,166
Natural ability that
half the world's gymnasts

349
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,307
would kill for,
and you're flushing it away.

Don't flush your life away, kid.

351

Step away from the bowl.

353
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,958
Well, you got
the words right anyway.

354
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:51,119
I wasn't great. I was obedient.

355
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:57,038
I'm sick and tired of being judged.
I don't need it.

00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,996
- Fascinating.
- What?

357
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:07,825
For someone who
hates being judged,

358
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,479
you're one of the most
judgmental people I've ever met.

five miles to the gym.

Hang a right at the gas station.

...you choose to compete in the
IG Classic, you can come back.

How's that?

00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,026
Hike'll give you a chance
to think things over.

- Oh, fantastic, thank you.
- Yeah?

Listen, are you
being serious with me?

385
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,425
Because I've had enough
of lunatic adults for a while.

- I'll do what I said I'd do.
- For real.

I'll train you for the Classic.
Help you win the purse.

388
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,436
Great. So then here's the deal:

389
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,818
Uh, I'm not struggling
in front of those robots.

390
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:31,065
All right. I'll let you train

till you're ready to face the music.

to be in there alone,
and if anything happens,

394

You're in training, kid.

00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,015
Stop being so nasty, Joanne.

788
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:44,280
It's not called "gym-nice-tics."

789
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:53,560
Don't you see?
She wants you to do

790
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:56,312
your hardest tricks because
she knows you'll mess up.

791
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,796
She's been practicing that stuff
in the old gym for weeks now.

792
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,757
She's trying to
get you guys to mess up

793
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,596
so she can win
the prize money. Duh.

794
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:27,230
[Audience clapping, cheering]

795
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:35,487
Can you believe Chris Defrank
is here with Gloria? Pipsqueak.

796
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:39,294
[Joanne] We trained together at
Defrank's for what, five years?

797
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,880
[Haley] Ugh, I can't stand him.

798
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:44,799
She should get at least two-tenths
deducted for that hair.

799
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,309
Or not.

800
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:54,462
Haley! Haley!
Over here.

801
00:49:54,528 --> 00:49:56,503
Hi, honey.
I miss you, sweetheart.

802
00:49:56,577 --> 00:50:00,025
I missed you so much.
Hey, you're doin' a great job.

803
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,366
I need to talk about
comin' back with Chris.

804
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:05,248
Doesn't look good, having you
trainin' with somebody else.

805
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:08,000
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

806
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:09,658
You owe Chris some respect.

807
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:12,031
I don't respect people
who don't respect me.

808
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:14,335
And you think
Burt Vickerman respects you.

809
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:16,344
Yeah. Actually, I do.

810
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:19,168
The only thing Burt Vickerman
respects is money.

811
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:21,088
He cares about
cash and cashing in.

812
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,976
And if your daddy
hadn't paid him off,

813
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,410
you'd be sittin' at Texas
Military Academy now.

814
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:28,093
What do you mean, "paid him off"?
Everybody there pays.

815
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,881
Your daddy called
every elite gym in the country.

816
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,184
Nobody wanted you.

817
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:36,034
Honey, your dad's
payin' four times

818
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,205
what every other
girl there is payin'.

819
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,145
[Chuckling] You thought
he was on your side?

820
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:48,161
Haley.

821
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:51,938
He only has one side. His.

822
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,656
- I gotta go warm up beam.
- Haley.

823
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,634
- You need some lipstick.
- No. Mom.

824
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,774
- Let me, let me, let me...
- Don't!

825
00:51:02,245 --> 00:51:04,220
Keep it up, hon.
You're doin' great.

826
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:07,043
Stand up straight.
Eyes and teeth, sugar.

827
00:51:09,606 --> 00:51:12,191
Arms. Arms. Spot.
That's it.

828
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:14,945
- [Vick] Nice.
- [Haley] What?

829
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:18,596
You wanna win the purse,
we get it.

830
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:22,274
Yeah. I hope we ate mat
hard enough for you.

831
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,605
[Vick] Flat hips.

832
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,776
Today's not just
about you, ya know.

833
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,746
Expected more out of you.

834
00:51:36,647 --> 00:51:38,502
[Sighing]

835
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:40,836
[Vick] OK, tight knees now.

836
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:55,903
- [Audience clapping]
- Whoo!

837
00:51:58,153 --> 00:52:00,936
[Poot] Oww!

838
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,918
- Oh!
- [Audience claps]

839
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:19,522
[Audience groans]

840
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,898
- It's all right. Let's go!
- Come on, Haley!

841
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,255
[Sparse applause]

842
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,406
Shake it off, Haley.
Come on.

843
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:38,506
You got another event.
Let's finish big.

844
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:40,844
Warm up, Mina.

845
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,766
Let's go. 'Scuse me.

846
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:46,604
Haley.

847
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:48,363
Don't do this again.

848
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:51,366
Let's go back in there
and finish this meet. Come on.

849
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,856
Don't bail again. Finish the meet.
Finish it for yourself!

850
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:58,158
Me? Yeah, you said something
about the fact that this was about me.

851
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:00,778
You know, helping me.
My freedom.

852
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,849
You forgot to tell me about the
part you were cashing in on it.

853
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,305
Haley. I meant everything I said.

854
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:08,522
I never lied to you.

855
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:12,205
Everything you said was insurance
to get those fat checks from my father.

856
00:54:12,273 --> 00:54:14,542
Haley, you're not leaving like this.

857
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:17,709
You're gonna go back in there.
Finish this meet.

858
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:20,015
Don't make this another Worlds.

859
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,359
- No.
- Don't bail.

860
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,598
You don't know
the first thing about Worlds.

861
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,870
Fine, I give up.
You know, we gave it a shot.

862
00:54:25,938 --> 00:54:28,972
I'll talk to your father.
Maybe you should go back to Defrank's.

863
00:54:29,043 --> 00:54:31,214
- Chris Defrank's?
- Hey...

864
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:35,625
- You want me to go back to Defrank's?
- Well, you don't listen to me.

865
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:38,088
Clearly you listened
to him long enough to...

866
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:41,032
Yeah, long enough to
hook up with my mom.

867
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:47,468
- [Whimpers]
- Hmm?

868
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,979
Long enough for him to...

869
00:54:53,044 --> 00:54:56,144
...rip my family apart.

870
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,392
Oh, hey. When d?

871
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:04,144
When did ya find this out?

872
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:08,405
Before floor...

873
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:10,378
...at Worlds.

874
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:15,533
Aw, Haley, I...

875
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:18,027
I had no idea.

876
00:55:19,575 --> 00:55:21,614
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?

877
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,933
You didn't owe it to me
to be a decent coach.

878
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,917
You owed it to me to be
a decent human being.

879
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:37,740
[Sighing]

880
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,517
[Exhaling deeply]

881
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,501
[Revving engine]

882
00:56:04,057 --> 00:56:06,926
You tanked like a rock star.
That was insane.

883
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,911
Yeah, right.

884
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:12,920
Hey, Haley, can I
ask you something?

885
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:16,118
And I'm being
completely serious.

886
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:19,000
Why do girls wear so much
glitter and clippage in their hair?

887
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:21,488
I mean, that is some
uptight friggin' hair. Right?

888
00:56:21,562 --> 00:56:23,449
How do leotards not
ride up their butts?

889
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,172
- Yeah, good one.
- Tuf-Skin.

890
00:56:25,242 --> 00:56:27,315
Aww.
They have ass calluses?

891
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,241
[Laughing] No. Uh...

892
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:31,641
It's just this sticky stuff
you spray on your butt

893
00:56:31,707 --> 00:56:33,168
so the leotard doesn't ride up.

894
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:35,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I get that job? I wanna be Tuf-Skin.

895
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:37,271
- Shut up.
- Hey.

896
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:38,649
What would happen if you put

897
00:56:38,715 --> 00:56:40,951
some of that Tuf-Skin
stuff on tough skin?

898
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:42,842
Your head would stick to your butt.

899
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:44,762
Why would my head stick to my butt?

900
00:56:44,827 --> 00:56:47,642
'Cause your head's
already up there! Ah!

901
00:56:47,707 --> 00:56:50,490
Don't worry, Frank...

902
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,760
...my head's up my butt too.

903
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,901
Far.

904
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:05,528
Oh. Have a seat, Haley.

905
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:10,039
I'd like you to read something
for me, please, out loud.

906
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:11,800
Second paragraph.

907
00:57:13,757 --> 00:57:16,408
Uh..."The gymnastics world,
like the real world,

908
00:57:16,477 --> 00:57:18,420
can be a very unforgiving place.

909
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:22,007
As I know all too well, there might be
too much chalk on the blackboard

910
00:57:22,078 --> 00:57:25,373
for her to get a clean slate,
competing with me or anyone else.

911
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:28,952
And Haley has earned
the right to a clean slate.

912
00:57:29,023 --> 00:57:31,575
She's quite capable of
deciding what's best for her.

913
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:34,102
And I encourage the court
to include her perspective

914
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:37,142
in its decision.
Sincerely, Burt Vickerman."

[Laughs]

916
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,159
That's all, Haley.
You're free to go.

917
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:46,362
What about the restitution?

918
00:57:46,431 --> 00:57:48,635
Oh, that's been taken care of.

919
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:50,613
Be good.

920
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,412
Sounds like you're built for it.

921
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,965
Thank you.

922
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:01,980
You know, Haley,

923
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:05,048
there are a lot
of great people

924
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,990
who had jerks for parents.

925
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:11,904
We gotta stick together.

926
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:15,036
[Rock music]

927
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:20,055
- [Haley] The tights?
- [Poot] What are they? In Special Ed?

928
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,308
- You'd know, huh?
- Nice.

- Whatever.

Hey, guys, I have a gut feelin'
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

- What?
- What do you mean, dude?

Whoo!

- Oh!
- [Frank] What? I can't hold it.

936
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:42,076
Stay tight in the air.

You got through an entire letter
without using the word "gold."

940
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,034
- It was tough.
- [Laughing]

941
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,107
And the restitution.
I mean, was that?

that you agreed to honor.

1098
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,389
You are not going to the prom.
End of discussion.

1099
01:06:07,456 --> 01:06:08,766
- OK.
- [Vick] May I?

1100
01:06:10,048 --> 01:06:13,463
Phyllis, now Joanne
is a lovely gymnast.

1101
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,773
I think we oughta get real
about her chances

1102
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,182
of making the Olympic team.

1103
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,664
The only reason we're here
is because we agreed

1104
01:06:25,729 --> 01:06:29,209
that she'd be going
to the Olympics.

1105
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:32,511
I know. I know.

1106
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,138
[Vick] I, uh...

1107
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,579
I guess I lied. Hmm?

1108
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,957
Look, everyone...

1109
01:06:45,026 --> 01:06:47,928
Everyone wants to hear
that their kid is special.

1110
01:06:48,002 --> 01:06:49,858
And they are.

1111
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:53,338
And maybe they're
going to the Olympics.

1112
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,102
- "Maybe."
- Yes. Maybe they will.

1113
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:57,724
[Phyllis] We don't pay for "maybe."

1114
01:06:57,795 --> 01:07:01,091
People told me I was nuts
to bring Joanne here.

1115
01:07:01,156 --> 01:07:03,970
And they were right.

1116
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:08,159
I'm just glad that I'm
getting her out of here in one piece.

1117
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:11,392
A coach who's a has-been

1118
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,591
doesn't coach champions.

1119
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,279
He just makes more has-beens.

1120
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:19,003
Goodbye, Burt.

1121
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:22,938
You will miss me.

1122
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:26,658
Championships are three weeks away.

1123
01:07:26,725 --> 01:07:29,093
- Where we gonna go?
- I'll coach you myself.

1124
01:07:30,053 --> 01:07:31,809
I thought you
wanted her to win.

1125
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:35,421
And what would you know
about winning?

1126
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,342
Joanne. You're more
than welcome to stay.

1127
01:07:41,413 --> 01:07:42,843
[Sighing]

1128
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:44,827
Josie, let's go.

1129
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:56,260
I think I'm gonna
go to prom first.

1130
01:07:58,119 --> 01:07:59,613
[Rock music]

1131
01:08:04,423 --> 01:08:06,333
[Woman directing gymnasts]

1132
01:08:12,168 --> 01:08:14,503
Are you OK?

1133
01:08:14,568 --> 01:08:18,081
Oh, it's just... I haven't
had four girls qualify

1134
01:08:18,152 --> 01:08:20,160
for Championships
in a long time.

1135
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:22,402
Define "long."

1136
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:26,946
[Sighing] Actually, I haven't
had four girls qualify...

1137
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:28,927
...ever.

1138
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:32,195
Are you gonna cry?

1139
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:34,697
No, I'm not gonna cry.

1140
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:35,972
It's just...

1141
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:39,140
[stuttering] It's a nice thing.
It's beautiful.

1142
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:42,472
- Jesus, Hay.
- What? You can cry.

1143
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:44,545
Doesn't make you
any less of a man, Vicki.

1144
01:08:44,617 --> 01:08:46,276
Come on,
I won't tell the parents.

1145
01:08:46,346 --> 01:08:48,256
[Techno music]

1146
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:56,228
[Man] Welcome to the Neutrogena
National Gymnastics Championships.

1147
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,306
Hello, everybody.
I'm Tim Dagget,

1148
01:08:58,379 --> 01:09:00,288
joined along
with Elfi Schlegel.

1149
01:09:00,363 --> 01:09:03,680
It is two days of gymnastics
competition on tap.

1150
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:05,382
Today, the all-around finals.

1151
01:09:05,452 --> 01:09:08,321
Day two, the individual event finals.

1152
01:09:08,396 --> 01:09:10,949
Think of the difference
as a jack-of-all-trades

1153
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,638
versus an individual-event specialist.

1154
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:15,497
She should do her routine
then warm up.

1155
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:17,604
- They stretched.
- They need to warm up.

1156
01:09:17,676 --> 01:09:19,203
- No.
- They've been stretching.

1157
01:09:19,277 --> 01:09:21,666
[Sighing] Oh, crap.

1158
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,636
Hm, Vickerman. Must be
some crutches around somewhere.

1159
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,564
Tonight, the all-around competition,

1160
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:30,629
where the top six qualify
for a berth on the World Team.

1161
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,840
The longtime favorite,
Tricia Skilken,

1162
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,298
is hoping to make her
fifth and final World Team

1163
01:09:35,373 --> 01:09:37,446
before her retirement.

1164
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:40,136
While gymnastics wild child,
Haley Graham, has come out

1165
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:42,627
of retirement to try to
make it for the second time.

1166
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:45,669
Will her pyrotechnics
rise to the occasion?

1167
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:47,684
Or will she simply flame out?

1168
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,864
Few can forget
Haley Graham's walkout

1169
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,073
of the World Championships
two years ago.

1170
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:54,117
Haley was last to go
on the floor exercise

1171
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,158
when she shocked fans
and teammates by exiting the arena

1172
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,078
and walking into an
automatic disqualification.

1173
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:01,999
That stroll knocked Team USA

1174
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,359
completely out of medal position.
If ever there was a score to settle,

1175
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:07,693
it's between Tricia Skilken
and Haley Graham.

1176
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,134
Tricia.

1177
01:10:11,056 --> 01:10:12,966
I didn't mean
to wreck your Worlds.

1178
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,982
Mine was disintegrating and...

1179
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:17,675
I wrote you a note, apologizing.

1180
01:10:17,744 --> 01:10:20,329
I don't know
if you got it or not.

1181
01:10:22,512 --> 01:10:25,861
[Tim] We have a tremendous amount
of talented athletes out on the floor.

1182
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:29,930
One of them, Haley Graham, brings
a lot of potential to this US team.

1183
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:33,350
She could medal internationally
on virtually all of the apparatus.

1184
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:35,793
Super power, huge difficulty,

1185
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:38,246
but she is not known
for her consistency.

1186
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:41,224
And, Elfi, when you get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

1187
01:10:41,298 --> 01:10:44,014
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

1188
01:10:44,082 --> 01:10:46,635
[Elfi] And, Tim, we have
to remember that for Haley,

1189
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:49,259
it's her record
and her reputation that will

1190
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,567
really be the only thing
stopping them

1191
01:10:51,635 --> 01:10:54,537
from handing her that valuable
one-way ticket to Rome

1192
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:57,164
and the World Championships,
later on this year.

1193
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,698
[Haley] It's the
same old Championships,

1194
01:11:02,771 --> 01:11:04,843
but I am a totally
different person.

1195
01:11:07,444 --> 01:11:09,932
And even though I'm pretty
sure that I'll be judged

1196
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:11,891
for who I was
and not who I am,

1197
01:11:11,956 --> 01:11:13,265
I know I have to face this.

1198
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,172
Four events and
fourjudges per event.

1199
01:11:21,237 --> 01:11:24,586
That's 16 judges ready to
tell us just how badly we suck.

1200
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,522
Sixteen people ready to tell us
just how perfect we're not.

1201
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:32,110
But here we are...
chasing perfection.

1202
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:36,657
The problem is,
perfection doesn't exist.

1203
01:11:38,517 --> 01:11:40,557
But just try telling that
to the judges.

1204
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,183
[Audience claps and cheers]

1205
01:11:48,406 --> 01:11:49,747
Where'd ya find deductions?

1206
01:11:49,813 --> 01:11:51,886
- The floor? Trash?
- 'Scuse me? Can you move?

1207
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:55,755
Very clever. No, we decided her start
value is a nine-point-eight, not a ten.

1208
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:59,508
You know the strength required for that?
You realize what you're doin' to her?

1209
01:11:59,575 --> 01:12:01,647
- I'm quite aware.
- This about her routine?

1210
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:03,508
We don't want to encourage the girls

1211
01:12:03,575 --> 01:12:06,031
to attempt such a
dangerous skill and risk injury.

1212
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:08,787
Surely, you know,
with your track record,

1213
01:12:08,855 --> 01:12:11,572
you could understand that.
I mean, probably, anyway.

1214
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,127
- I understand. Believe me.
- Could you move, please?

1215
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:19,413
[Haley] Doesn't matter how
hard we run or how high we flip.

1216
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,776
Leave your hands
on the vault table too long, deduction.

1217
01:12:22,841 --> 01:12:25,328
If you use one arm instead
of two, big deduction.

1218
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,830
And if your feet
clip the vault

1219
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:29,970
before they hit the floor...
you're done.

1220
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,342
So you say you want lyrics
in your floor music?

1221
01:12:32,409 --> 01:12:34,514
[Chuckling] Huge deduction.

1222
01:12:34,585 --> 01:12:36,079
Music finishes,
but you don't?

1223
01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:37,429
Two-tenths deduction.

1224
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:41,461
It doesn't matter
how well you do.

1225
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,635
It's how well
you follow their rules.

1226
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:46,575
And that just blows.

1227
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,505
[Tim] It's a little bit crazy, Elfi,

1228
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:52,215
that Nastia Liukin threw
a quad twist on floor exercise

1229
01:12:52,282 --> 01:12:54,453
and got a deduction
on a silly technicality.

1230
01:12:54,523 --> 01:12:55,733
I can't believe it.

1231
01:12:55,802 --> 01:12:58,966
It's a commentary on judging
and how it's gotta change.

1232
01:12:59,034 --> 01:13:01,969
[Elfi] Haley Graham gave the
performance of her life tonight.

1233
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,890
No way she should've ended up
seventh in the standing.

1234
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:07,344
[Tim] She might've been
shut out of the all-around,

1235
01:13:07,419 --> 01:13:10,168
but judges can't keep her
outta the event finals tomorrow.

1236
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:11,545
Tricia, congratulations.

1237
01:13:11,612 --> 01:13:14,231
How does this win compare
to other competitions for you?

1238
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,267
It felt so great. I just wanted
to go in and hit four for four

1239
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,227
and qualify for Worlds
one last time.

1240
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:21,332
And, um, winning was
just icing on the cake.

1241
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:23,030
What about
Haley Graham out there?

1242
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,969
Given your history,
how did it feel competing with her?

1243
01:13:26,044 --> 01:13:28,084
It was so great
competing with Haley again.

1244
01:13:28,156 --> 01:13:30,296
Um, I wish her
all the very best.

1245
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,404
- OK. Good luck in the future.
- Thank you.

1246
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:34,070
Your routines were amazing.

1247
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:36,149
You'll win floor at
event finals for sure.

1248
01:13:36,221 --> 01:13:39,537
- No. I didn't even qualify.
- That is so lame.

1249
01:13:39,613 --> 01:13:41,686
Boo-hoo.
Stop whining.

1250

I think you are a very good coach.

1254
01:13:53,535 --> 01:13:55,574
- Really?
- I do.

1255
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:57,654
A little action in the back section?

1256
01:13:57,727 --> 01:13:59,636
- That's not too bad.
- Not... not good.

1257
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:02,045
I wouldn't, ya know...
Oh, yikes. Those two.

1258
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,118
I worked with her last year.
Nightmare.

1259
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:05,619
- [Exhaling]
- On Elm Street.

1260

- Have you seen her face?
- [Chuckling]

1261
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,669
- Hey. Scotch. Neat, please.
- Yes, sir.

1262
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,914
Hey, Burt, how ya doin'?
Good job today.

1263
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:17,017
That Haley is a handful,
isn't she? [laughs]

1264
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:18,811
What do ya mean?

1265
01:14:18,879 --> 01:14:21,182
Oh, come on, Burt,
I built that kid.

1266
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,564
I mean, you can glom on for the ride,
but everyone knows who built her.

1267
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,818
Make no mistake, buddy.

1268
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:27,711
Yeah, that "kid"...

1269
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:31,072
That kid is here
in spite of you, Chris.

1270

You're kidding.

1271
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:34,558
[Laughs] You know,

1272
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,600
if I didn't have
four girls competing,

1273
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:39,575
I'd kick your ass for thinking
you had anything to do with her.

1274
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:41,056
She might not have medaled,

1275
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:42,910
but at least she can
still walk, right?

1276
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:47,585
Good job, Burt.

1277
01:14:54,242 --> 01:14:56,096

[Rock music]

1279
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,943
[Haley] Every girl here
wants the same thing:

1280
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:04,834
To justify this
crazy thing we do

1281
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:06,787
and stand on that podium
and be the best.

1282
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:09,753
And we want it so bad we will
fight each other for it.

1283
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:13,402
But who are we really
competing against?

1284
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,199
I mean, we all wanna win,

1285
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:17,210
but should we be
fighting each other...

1286
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:21,532
...or the officials?

1287
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:24,768
You know, maybe they judge us
so harshly because of one thing:

1288
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:28,317
They really wanna be like us.
I mean, everyone knows...

1289
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:30,330
...they're just jealous.

1290
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:36,577
Phyllis?

1291
01:15:36,644 --> 01:15:38,652
- Alice!
- How are you?

1292
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:40,100
Oh!

1293
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:41,507
Did you have
work done?

1294

You look great.
I'll see ya later.

- Thanks!
- We'll talk later?

1296
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:46,620
That's not an answer.

1297
01:15:46,694 --> 01:15:48,766
First up on vault is Mina Hoyt.

1298
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:50,082
And, Elfi, she is vaulting

1299
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,223
a handspring
double front somersault.

1300
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:54,815
Has a start value out of a 10.0.

1301
01:15:54,886 --> 01:15:57,025
Very few gymnasts
perform this vault

1302
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:59,429
because it is so
incredibly difficult.

1303
01:15:59,494 --> 01:16:02,113
I haven't seen one done
since Produnova of Russia

1304
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,517
dominated with it
nearly a decade ago.

1305
01:16:04,582 --> 01:16:07,300
Her body will flip over
three times in the air

1306
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,309
and somehow
find the floor.

1307
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:11,422
[Elfi] Tim, I just saw
her do it moments ago

1308
01:16:11,495 --> 01:16:14,311
in the warm-up.
It is unbelievable.

1309

01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:38,303
Go, Mina!

1313
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:40,766
[Tim] That was incredible.

1314
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:43,656
The height, the distance.
Bam! The stuck landing.

1315
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:46,755
If they don't give her a ten
on this, there is no justice.

1316
01:16:46,825 --> 01:16:48,352
Come on, judges,
give her a ten.

1317

What?

1320

[Tim] Elfi. Whoa,
I can't believe it.

1321
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:58,848
A nine-five?
This is an outrage.

- [Elfi] Tim, I'm shocked.
- [Whispering] Oh, crap.

1323

You're not supposed
to be up here, Burt.

1324
01:17:04,427 --> 01:17:06,848
Where is this deduction
coming from? Hmm?

1325
01:17:08,267 --> 01:17:11,399
[Scoffing] Her bra strap
was showing, Burt.

1326
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:13,093
It's an automatic deduction...

1327
01:17:13,163 --> 01:17:15,302
- Come on!
...if an undergarment's showing.

1328
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:16,484
That rule...

Doris, she's
flipping through the air.

1330
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:22,475
She's spinning, Doris.
Of course her bra popped out.

1331
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,427
That rule is ancient.

1332
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:26,980
Apparently, so is her bra.

1333
01:17:30,284 --> 01:17:31,593
[Clears throat]

1334

Don't make me
red card you, Burt.

I really don't
wanna red card you, OK?

Vick, don't. Come on.

1337
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:43,116
Even I think that's low.

1338
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:45,831
And I should be happy.
I mean, I wanna win.

1339
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:49,483
Your bra was sticking out.

1340
01:17:50,637 --> 01:17:53,572

because her bra was sticking out.

I've never even heard of that.

1343
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,884
They didn't deduct her
because of her bra.

1344
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,414
They deducted her
because I'm her coach.

1345
01:18:02,734 --> 01:18:04,589
Come on, Haley. You're up.

1346
01:18:04,654 --> 01:18:06,662
[Tim] This is where
the sport loses fans.

1347
01:18:06,735 --> 01:18:09,287
The system, the judging,
it's too confusing.

1348
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:11,781
The crowd just saw
a spectacular skill.

1349
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:15,652
They don't understand
why a gymnast is not rewarded for it.

Did she just scratch?

1357
01:19:09,395 --> 01:19:13,585
[Elfi] An intentional scratch
from Haley Graham in event finals.

This has never happened before.

1359

Way to stick it.

Next time you should
stick out your tongue too.

I would, but my coach likes it
when I control my tricks.

[Elfi] You can say
that again, Tim.

weird going on here today, Elfi.

all the attention.

1376

[Elfi] This is unprecedented.

1377
01:21:05,498 --> 01:21:06,960
My God, I'm the new vault champ.

1378
01:21:07,035 --> 01:21:08,017
- I know!
- Woo!

And I loved not going.

1380
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:13,496
I mean, if we chose
the winner on every event,

1381
01:21:13,563 --> 01:21:16,912
we could actually control
the results for a change.

Oh, my God, you're right.

are you brilliant?

I don't know.
Since now.

scratch and let Nastia...

and no one's done that,
there, an element.

1395
01:22:15,743 --> 01:22:18,012
That means that she is
going to be the uneven bar

That rocked.

1404
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:08,576
Nastia Liukin will be
the new uneven bar champion.

1405
01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:10,169
Well, the athletes have spoken.

1406
01:23:10,242 --> 01:23:14,136
And there will be no silver,
no bronze medals on bars today.

1407
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,934
Thanks.

1408

It was everybody.

1409

[Tim] After what happened to Nastia
Liukin and Wei Wei Yong yesterday

1410
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:22,978
and Mina Hoyt today,

1411
01:23:23,043 --> 01:23:26,109
it's safe to say the athletes
are sending the judges a message.

1412
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:27,641
[Elfi] This is historic, Tim.

1413
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,912
I've never seen this kind of
organized rebellion before.

1414
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:34,526
Are you going to tell me who is
going to compete and who isn't?

1415
01:23:36,419 --> 01:23:38,624
You're not going
to tell me, are you?

1416
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:42,654
Oops.

1417
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:47,484
'Cause there are alternates
who would like to compete.

1418
01:23:51,685 --> 01:23:54,980
[Whispering] They can't do anything.
He's trying to save his butt.

1419
01:23:58,725 --> 01:24:02,403
Tricia's gonna compete.
So selfish.

1420
01:24:03,302 --> 01:24:05,920
Game over.

1422
01:24:13,766 --> 01:24:17,083
I don't have to go. I can scratch,
and we can still make our point.

1423
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:19,647
No, no, no, we picked you.
We wanna see your routine.

1424
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:21,148
It's your call.

1425
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,374
OK. Cool.

1426
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:29,600
[Tim] We have seen
scratch after scratch.

1427
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:32,038
The meet director,
prior to this event,

1428
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:35,038
he decided to put in
the alternate, Tricia Skilken,

1429
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,862
because he thought for sure
he'd get a routine out of her.

1430
01:24:37,928 --> 01:24:38,975
We'll see.

1431
01:24:39,048 --> 01:24:42,016
Here comes her big
acrobatic moment right here.

1432
01:24:42,089 --> 01:24:43,365
Connected together.

1433
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:46,466
Two aerial skills,
very nicely done.

1434
01:24:46,537 --> 01:24:49,352
Is this how you feel
when you watch my routine?

1435
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,272
Uh, yeah.

1436
01:24:52,008 --> 01:24:54,692
I am so sorry.

1437
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:58,177
[Elfi] She's looking
really secure in this routine.

1438
01:24:58,249 --> 01:25:00,486
Vary exact in all her movements.

1439
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,560
Now, she does do
a very interesting skill

1440
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:03,844
that's coming up here.

1441
01:25:03,914 --> 01:25:06,848
[Tim] Two in a row. Nicely done.
Illusions, they're called.

[Snorting] What'd I miss?
Just kidding.

1443

Beat that.

Oh! I'm so shakin' things up.

1449

That's right.

- Come on, Wei Wei! Whoo!

1452
01:25:38,156 --> 01:25:40,577
[Tim] I think the judges
are trying to figure out

1453
01:25:40,652 --> 01:25:43,467
what is gonna happen.
I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

1454
01:25:43,533 --> 01:25:44,809
[Elfi] She's goin' for it.

1455
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:47,331
[Tim] Yeah, looks like
we got another routine.

1464
01:27:14,739 --> 01:27:17,291
[Tim] It's very original,
but I'm afraid the judges

1465
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,784
won't know what
to do with that routine, Elfi.

1466
01:27:19,858 --> 01:27:22,378
[Elfi] With those scores,
Tricia will get the gold,

1467
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,818
and Wei Wei will
take home a silver.

1468
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:28,967
So it is old school
versus new school.

Tricia Skilken,

raw power, huge start values,

but she is not known
for her consistency.

1473

Elfi, when ya get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

1474
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,802
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

1475

Go ahead, scratch.
You're all zeroes anyway.

1476
01:27:52,052 --> 01:27:54,573
Tricia, this is
not about winning.

I'm not here
to screw you over.

1478

Oh. Too late.

1479
01:27:59,093 --> 01:28:01,647
Fine. Then I'll scratch
if you want the moment.

1480
01:28:01,717 --> 01:28:03,124
But this?

1481

This is much bigger
than you and me.

1482
01:28:07,126 --> 01:28:10,093
[Tim] Well, like we said, they
were warming up their tumbling,

1483
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:13,427
but we've seen four athletes scratch,
so who knows what

I got some really
bad news to tell ya.

1556
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:31,816
What?

1557
01:33:31,883 --> 01:33:34,305
How much do ya hate
college gymnastics? Hmm?

1558
01:33:34,379 --> 01:33:36,931
I decided not to hate things
I've never tried.

1559
01:33:37,739 --> 01:33:39,681
All these schools want me?

01:33:39,755 --> 01:33:42,472
- Well, where should I go?
- Eh, you'll figure it out.

1561
01:33:42,539 --> 01:33:45,988
- Maybe I should tell 'em to stick it.
- Yeah, like you know how to stick it.

01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,907
- Uh, my feet were glued.
- Yeah, to a high-speed bus.

1563
01:33:48,972 --> 01:33:50,827
You're the one that
told me to floor it.

1564
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:54,023
[Chuckling] Yeah,
you floored it all right.

1565
