{1334}{1436}We look awful. Except|mum... She always looks good.
{1485}{1536}Happy birthday to you,
{1599}{1676}happy birthday to you,
{1704}{1799}happy birthday dear mother,
{1819}{1877}happy birthday to you.
{1968}{2000}One there! One there!
{2053}{2083}Well, mum,
{2084}{2154}when are you going to lie|about your age like I do?
{2173}{2265}It was hard enough getting so|far without taking away years now.
{2270}{2319}That's right. You look great.
{2337}{2386}Because I'm happy. It's love...
{2404}{2454}Found a boyfriend?
{2456}{2505}Well, not exactly that.
{2525}{2553}I'm in love.
{2559}{2606}-Really?|-You don't say!
{2613}{2692}Wait a minute.|There's something else.
{2737}{2779}This person is younger than me.
{2784}{2812}Much younger?
{2833}{2867}And also...
{2908}{2936}Now you'll see.
{3047}{3121}-I bet he's|good-looking. -Let's see.
{3276}{3304}Girls...
{3324}{3363}this is Eliska.
{3386}{3421}But, it's a...
{3440}{3485}Yes.
{3486}{3528}That's what I had to tell you.
{3537}{3603}Eliska,|these are my daughters.
{3608}{3656}Jimena, Elvira and Sol,
{3663}{3742}like the women in "El|Cid". It was my ex's idea.
{3747}{3792}He's an intellectual.
{3850}{3908}Come and give her a kiss, girls.
{3998}{4024}Hello.
{4281}{4309}My prisent.
{4310}{4337}Thank you.
{4342}{4396}"Present".|Eliska's Czech.
{4455}{4495}Schubert's "Fantasy. "
{4527}{4573}What a lovely edition!
{4590}{4617}Do you dare?
{4622}{4678}Eliska's a wonderful pianist.
{4683}{4749}This is one of our favourite pieces.
{4754}{4795}Why don't you sit down?
{4813}{4872}Let's start with|the 2nd movement.
{5799}{5858}MY MOTHER LIKES WOMEN
{6382}{6439}Right girls, look this way.
{6444}{6479}That's right. Fine.
{6638}{6664}Elvira,
{6677}{6725}a smile for daddy. Ready?
{6741}{6769}That's it, fine.
{6836}{6869}Now don't move.
{7152}{7214}I've nothing against gays and lesbians,
{7222}{7259}but at her age...
{7264}{7311}She should sort herself out.
{7316}{7357}She is our mother!
{7380}{7426}-And with a grandchild.|-Look,
{7431}{7471}she's been lonely.
{7476}{7535}Let her do what she feels like doing.
{7540}{7590}You can't always do what you want.
{7595}{7656}She's selfish. Only thinks of herself.
{7661}{7709}Sure. But why does it
{7714}{7764}bother you so much?
{7778}{7869}That's how I am. I don't|ignore things like you do.
{7983}{8045}What about you?|Do you mind?
{8061}{8142}My heart's pounding. I think|I'm going to have a fit.
{8147}{8186}Don't get hysterical.
{8191}{8239}No-one died of|having a lesbian mother.
{8244}{8324}Sol! Don't say it like|that! This is strong stuff!
{8329}{8373}Yes, very strong stuff.
{8378}{8424}And she's the same age as us.
{8429}{8479}She's seems very dull.
{8484}{8542}Even if she was perfect,
{8547}{8634}it's incredible that mum|should suddenly prefer women.
{8639}{8702}It seems completely|normal to me.
{8707}{8789}Nowadays everyone's bisexual.|Take dogs, for example.
{8794}{8887}We know you think anything|goes in bed. But not mum!
{8892}{8948}Mum always liked men.
{8953}{9045}This foreign girl must|have got round her.
{9057}{9092}I can just see it...
{9097}{9188}One day, at the piano, her|fingers wandered... like this.
{9193}{9270}Why do these things always happen to me?
{9275}{9335}And my relationship|with mum's so complex...
{9340}{9397}-Don't get hysterical.|-Yes.
{9411}{9438}Okay.
{9449}{9500}This is a terrible shock,
{9505}{9574}but we're adults and we can handle it.
{9579}{9613}Mum is mum,
{9618}{9655}we are us,
{9660}{9722}I am me,
{9730}{9802}and from now our aim must be
{9808}{9837}to accept it.
{9861}{9891}Accept it...
{9974}{10004}Accept it.
{10072}{10164}My mother's a lesbian...|My mother's a lesbian...
{10169}{10214}I haven't slept a wink all night
{10219}{10276}trying to accept it.|It makes me feel sick.
{10297}{10342}What are you so afraid of?
{10367}{10428}That I may be like her.
{10447}{10551}I do badly with men, don't I?|Not that I'm too demanding,
{10556}{10623}but perhaps men aren't really my thing.
{10634}{10684}-Perhaps I like women too.|-Well,
{10704}{10777}we've seen your sexuality's|symbiotic link with her.
{10784}{10840}A dominant, overprotective woman...
{10845}{10882}Then I'm a lesbian!
{10887}{10922}By no means.
{10934}{10974}Basically you like...
{10997}{11025}real men.
{11033}{11067}But they scare you.
{11072}{11157}Everything scares you. You|don't believe in yourself.
{11180}{11241}Look at this fish.
{11253}{11290}Which one?
{11291}{11325}This one.
{11326}{11371}It's a cycloid jewel. Look,
{11382}{11422}they all move out of the way.
{11427}{11490}Self-confidence commands respect.
{11511}{11541}I don't live in a tank.
{11546}{11586}My life's worse than that.
{11591}{11653}I've no money, no time for writing,
{11658}{11767}no self-esteem, no sexual identity.|I'd change places with your fish.
{11782}{11834}One thing at a time, Elvira.
{11855}{11946}You don't like your life,|so why not change it?
{11956}{11984}Think...
{11989}{12025}what can you do?
{12066}{12172}Have a boobs job and make them|smaller? Then I might have more self-con
{12177}{12217}That's not the point...
{12222}{12260}You want to write, right?
{12277}{12321}You hate it where you work.
{12337}{12392}Then why not leave?
{12417}{12460}I need to earn a living.
{12465}{12498}Go to your mother.
{12500}{12532}Hasn't she got money?
{12579}{12611}Ernesto,
{12631}{12693}I've tried to be|independent for years.
{12698}{12750}You want my mother to maintain me?
{12755}{12795}Make no mistakes, Elvira.
{12800}{12842}It'd be an act of personal
{12847}{12878}assertion. Like saying,
{12883}{12930}"Give me wings. I wish to create. "
{12955}{12978}And the money
{12979}{13017}would only be an advance.
{13022}{13049}Once successful,
{13054}{13090}you'd return it.
{13097}{13128}And if I'm not successful?
{13186}{13271}We'll deal with that in|the next session. Time's up.
{13829}{13862}Thank you.
{13989}{14038}THE ERASED YEARS
{14285}{14329}Hello.
{14330}{14357}You look bad.
{14358}{14392}-What's up?|-Can you see it?
{14423}{14468}Bags under my eyes, right?
{14473}{14512}Not that bad...
{14518}{14562}It's not surprising.
{14567}{14619}I haven't slept a wink.
{14633}{14681}My mum says she's a lesbian,
{14686}{14717}and it was a shock...
{14725}{14762}The boss is waiting.
{15018}{15045}We have to go.
{15050}{15090}I wanted to give you something.
{15095}{15154}Not now. We have|a business lunch.
{15182}{15218}It was important.
{15269}{15310}I've a surprise for you.
{15315}{15354}Guess who we're meeting?
{15359}{15440}-The "Hilarión" prize-winner.|-Miguel Bouzas?
{15445}{15487}He may want us to publish his work.
{15492}{15560}So try and be nice to him.
{15565}{15645}Do those things girls|do to show interest.
{15652}{15720}If he signs, we'll be out of a fix.
{15749}{15857}We've been about to get out|of a fix for the last 4 years.
{15921}{15968}Things are worse than ever.
{15973}{16038}This month I can only pay|you half your salaries.
{16043}{16070}What?
{16082}{16158}Either that or|we close down. Really.
{16200}{16302}I understand you getting|pissed off but that's how it is.
{16322}{16396}You know how much|I appreciate you.
{16403}{16459}So please see this through.
{16496}{16526}Come on.
{16545}{16574}By the way...
{16579}{16667}At the restaurant ask|for something cheap.
{16672}{16717}The budget's limited.
{16722}{16753}First course, elvers.
{16762}{16789}Second course, elvers
{16794}{16821}as well.
{16871}{16949}I'm on an elver-based diet,|alternating with seafood.
{16954}{17003}-Want to try it?|-No, thanks.
{17008}{17041}I'll have entrecote.
{17046}{17097}But you can copy it out for me.
{17117}{17143}There's
{17148}{17193}a decent Rioja here...
{17198}{17297}House wine? No. Viña Ardanza|Gran Reserva? A bottle of that.
{17310}{17336}Look, you don't need
{17337}{17388}to ask for anything special.
{17406}{17452}Take advantage|of the occasion.
{17480}{17544}Elvira's always showing me up.
{17602}{17629}Well, Miguel,
{17634}{17662}I've read your stories
{17667}{17724}and they're simply fantastic.
{17739}{17766}Thank you.
{17771}{17837}But I wrote them a long time ago.
{17842}{17879}I'd like to look through them.
{17884}{17929}I think they're fine.
{17949}{18024}He'd say anything to make you sign up.
{18074}{18100}And you, Elvira.
{18101}{18148}What did you think of them?
{18189}{18218}I haven't read them.
{18250}{18276}My fault.
{18289}{18317}I forgot
{18322}{18352}to give her them.
{18367}{18450}But she's a great admirer|of yours, aren't you?
{18455}{18497}You can speak your mind.
{18502}{18548}I won't burst into tears.
{18605}{18693}I'd like to, but I haven't|read even one of your novels.
{18770}{18816}That doesn't matter.
{18831}{18895}They aren't required reading.
{18938}{18967}Don't be modest.
{18978}{19005}It's not surprising
{19010}{19040}you should feel humiliated.
{19056}{19124}Success swells the ego, doesn't it?
{19131}{19174}Stop nudging me, Bernardo.
{19190}{19220}Why are you being like this
{19221}{19246}with me?
{19263}{19303}Got something against me?
{19328}{19372}I am a bit messed up.
{19403}{19433}But it's not...
{19456}{19484}It's...
{19485}{19537}My mother's a lesbian, and then
{19543}{19583}he says I'm on half-pay
{19590}{19619}and my psychiatrist...
{19620}{19672}I mean my psychologist...
{19690}{19725}Why am I telling you this?
{19735}{19763}I haven't slept|and I took
{19768}{19803}a pill...|Excuse me,
{19811}{19849}I'm going to the toilet.
{19949}{19998}She's not always like this.
{20078}{20144}It's pouring. Can we|drop you off somewhere?
{20149}{20208}No. I live nearby.|I can walk.
{20213}{20284}I'm glad|you're publishing with us.
{20289}{20329}-See you next week.|-Fine.
{20334}{20360}Let's go.
{20412}{20466}Look, I'll walk too.
{20657}{20719}Miguel!
{20821}{20872}I wanted to tell you...
{20879}{20941}something.
{20971}{21027}I've read all you've written.
{21049}{21096}The book of poems,
{21113}{21155}your first work too.
{21296}{21330}I liked it very much.
{21388}{21415}Did you?
{21911}{21942}Elvira.
{21962}{22012}What a surprise!
{22013}{22061}Coming in?
{22062}{22122}Yes.
{22301}{22352}Your mother's practising.
{22466}{22517}Perhaps I should come back...
{22522}{22578}No, come, please.
{22599}{22649}I cook something you'll like.
{22813}{22846}I cook Badds.
{22863}{22896}-Pardon?|-Badds.
{22901}{22998}A dish of my country...|With potato and bumpkin...
{23003}{23037}No, pumpkin...
{23047}{23088}-Courgette.|-Courgette.
{23118}{23149}So...
{23150}{23180}try it...
{23195}{23256}Try it.
{23259}{23295}Good, right?
{23314}{23382}Then I put a little in tub and
{23415}{23477}-you take away.|-No, no, really.
{23496}{23533}-Don't bother.|-Put it in.
{23538}{23628}When my girl says no, she|means yes but won't say so.
{23633}{23677}-Hello, dear.|-Hello.
{23686}{23765}-Very good practising, Sofía.|-No,
{23776}{23831}not really.
{23832}{23870}Listen later and tell me.
{23875}{23928}I'm planning a concert.
{23957}{23990}That's... That's nice...
{24001}{24064}I must go to bank before close but
{24069}{24101}you forget signing.
{24174}{24207}She's decided
{24212}{24239}to organise me.
{24244}{24296}Sadly she may even succeed.
{24387}{24440}-Off you go.|-Tea is made.
{24462}{24504}And don't put sugar.
{24526}{24580}-When I away, you watch?|-Come on,
{24585}{24631}out you go, little tyrant.
{24727}{24766}Let's have it in the lounge.
{24901}{24973}Christ, you can't find anything here!
{24978}{25052}-Is Sol here?|-Rummaging as usual.
{25124}{25153}Elvira,
{25197}{25256}I want to talk to you about...
{25267}{25345}all that's been happening just lately.
{25381}{25409}With Eliska and me.
{25438}{25490}You must be surprised.
{25504}{25553}-No, no, no...|-Yes, yes, yes.
{25558}{25601}I'm the most surprised of all.
{25606}{25673}I never imagined|anything like this.
{25701}{25736}But it happened in the most
{25741}{25786}natural way.|She was on her own,
{25791}{25824}we became friends,
{25829}{25880}she stayed over and one night...
{25885}{25928}Don't tell me the details...
{25933}{25972}Do you feel uncomfortable?
{25988}{26071}No. I feel bad,|but it's not your fault.
{26077}{26121}-What's the matter?|-Mum!
{26126}{26168}Can you help me?
{26266}{26293}I can...
{26330}{26361}Hello, Sol.
{26410}{26469}I can't find the platform boots.
{26474}{26557}I need them for tonight.|Know where they are?
{26562}{26595}I've no idea, dear.
{26600}{26669}This is Eliska's study now.|Maybe she tidied up.
{26674}{26733}I don't like my things being moved.
{26749}{26798}Well why don't you take them home?
{26851}{26902}And tidy this up. Okay?
{27034}{27107}Oh dear! Sometimes|Sol's like a little girl.
{27112}{27189}I'm sorry, dear.|What did you want to tell me?
{27246}{27307}I wanted to ask you something|but I don't know how.
{27312}{27399}But I have to do it for|my self-confidence. So,
{27404}{27442}I'm going to ask you,
{27447}{27504}without doubts, without hesitation,
{27520}{27548}without...
{27549}{27586}I'm going to be a jewel fish.
{27598}{27652}A jewel fish?
{27656}{27700}Okay,
{27701}{27730}go ahead.
{27732}{27772}Now?
{27774}{27813}Yes.
{27827}{27872}I need to borrow some money.
{27927}{28015}So I can leave work and start writing.
{28038}{28071}Three...
{28072}{28103}two million pesetas?
{28128}{28218}My darling, I'd lend|you 3, 2 or 17 million
{28250}{28269}so that you could
{28270}{28343}start writing, but I|just haven't got it.
{28377}{28412}No?
{28413}{28446}No.
{28447}{28537}I had some savings but Eliska|needed them so I gave them to her.
{28570}{28600}Eliska?
{28601}{28625}Yes. You see,
{28626}{28691}some grants have to be repaid,
{28701}{28739}or you go back home, thus
{28744}{28802}avoiding the brain drain.
{28877}{28933}And you sold|granddad's pine grove?
{28939}{28980}Yes, but I also need
{28985}{29015}that money.
{29020}{29058}The courses were expensive.
{29071}{29093}Look, mum...
{29094}{29122}I'm sorry, Elvira.
{29123}{29150}No, no...
{29151}{29222}This is important. Think,|where are those boots?
{29227}{29260}How should I know?
{29292}{29361}Perhaps Eliska threw|them out. They were old.
{29389}{29427}Anyway,
{29441}{29468}I have to go.
{29469}{29498}-Elvira?|-Yes?
{29499}{29527}Don't forget the cake
{29528}{29554}Eliska made.
{29559}{29591}She made it with love.
{30709}{30760}TO MY DAUGHTERS, WHO DRAGGED ME OUT
{30765}{30822}OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND|MADE ME FACE THE FUTURE.
{30835}{30861}Right, dear.
{30890}{30946}We can go. My glasses?
{30981}{31018}Hey, dad...
{31019}{31081}You know Sol's concert?|Well,
{31086}{31131}-mum's going...|-I thought so.
{31152}{31227}We parents make sacrifices|for our children.
{31260}{31299}Sure.
{31300}{31361}But she may not be going alone.
{31397}{31437}She may be going
{31438}{31477}with somebody. A...
{31503}{31548}woman...|A girl named Eliska.
{31567}{31598}Yes, her girlfriend.
{31640}{31701}You know?
{31704}{31731}We met the other day.
{31736}{31777}We dined at an Italian...
{31782}{31828}Very good, by the way.
{31864}{31899}And didn't it...
{31918}{31950}...nothing.
{32015}{32047}I don't know really.
{32088}{32117}What do you mean?
{32125}{32196}Aren't you shocked?|Doesn't it bother you...
{32201}{32228}or surprise you that mum...
{32233}{32281}likes... women?
{32308}{32348}Well... Surprise me...?
{32383}{32398}Lesbianism
{32399}{32452}is a well-documented practice.
{32467}{32509}Haven't you read Sappho?
{32537}{32588}Bad translations, mind you.
{32593}{32640}Sappho's love is not so much
{32675}{32711}love for women
{32729}{32785}as love for beauty as|represented by women.
{32853}{32885}Here it is.
{32955}{32998}"I love abrosyna,"
{33014}{33042}"Abrosyna".
{33043}{33078}How to translate that?
{33107}{33163}- Delicateness? Splendour?|-Grace...
{33193}{33227}Luxury...
{33246}{33300}What verses. You've|read them, haven't you?
{33324}{33357}Remember that other?
{33362}{33411}"Thy curls with crowns encircle,
{33418}{33486}and crowns of anise|with thy hands... "
{33780}{33813}Thank you.
{33847}{33881}Well,
{33882}{33949}now I'd like to sing a new song.
{33958}{34045}This is the first time before|an audience and I'd like
{34050}{34097}to dedicate it to my family.
{34129}{34163}Especially my mum,
{34168}{34241}the coolest woman in|the world. Let's hear it.
{34705}{34782}I'd like to introduce|you to mum's girlfriend,
{34795}{34833}I felt like committing suicide
{34838}{34910}when she told me she had a woman
{34915}{34966}licking her belly,
{34997}{35043}licking her belly...
{35048}{35080}My mum,
{35090}{35130}she likes women.
{35135}{35175}My mum, she likes
{35180}{35213}women.
{35218}{35298}My mum, she likes women.
{35303}{35342}We all went dancing
{35347}{35380}with mum's girlfriend.
{35392}{35456}I didn't know how to|take it when she told me
{35471}{35531}that women are the essence
{35536}{35577}of pleasure,
{35601}{35636}the essence of pleasure.
{35649}{35694}20 years younger|and she doesn't
{35699}{35762}speak Spanish...|She's got a woman...
{35767}{35795}licking her belly...
{35818}{35895}My mum, she likes women.
{35900}{35983}My mum, she likes women.
{35993}{36061}My mum, she likes women.
{36413}{36452}All human beings
{36457}{36514}do what they can...
{36515}{36570}My mum, she likes women...
{36581}{36610}Raúl.
{36611}{36684}Don't go. My family won't like it...
{36689}{36732}And I don't like this circus.
{36737}{36773}-What do you mean?|-Look,
{36778}{36825}it's bad enough|my mother-in-law
{36836}{36868}turning into a lesbian,
{36873}{36924}but shouting it|from the rooftops...
{36948}{37012}All I need is the people|at the office to find out.
{37017}{37092}But you're always saying they're jerks.
{37097}{37160}Honestly, Jimena, there are times...
{37180}{37218}Come on, Benja, we're leaving.
{37225}{37291}Have a good time|playing the modern woman.
{37296}{37324}Mummy...
{37435}{37516}My mum, she likes women,
{37521}{37602}my mum, she likes women,
{37607}{37687}my mum, she likes women...
{37799}{37855}Give me a drag?
{38563}{38599}Why didn't you like it?
{38614}{38644}No reason...
{38649}{38749}I love you telling hundreds of|people about my sexual habits.
{38779}{38832}And in such a funny way.
{38833}{38891}Did it upset her?
{38893}{38920}Is she a secret lesbian or...?
{38925}{38975}Look...
{38995}{39026}We'll talk later.
{39064}{39118}Goodbye.
{39260}{39295}I need a drink.
{39378}{39451}-Did you see mum?|-You're incredible, Sol.
{39456}{39516}After all you've done...
{39521}{39571}We all need a laugh sometimes.
{39576}{39635}Well mum wasn't laughing.
{39654}{39719}-And as for the rest of it...|-Eliska's face...
{39733}{39789}If it annoyed her, she can fuck off.
{39810}{39865}I hate mum acting crazy over her.
{39883}{39928}Well?
{39929}{39958}Something strong.
{39963}{40025}They're in love. Didn't|you say it was great?
{40030}{40088}Mum's in love. Eliska? I don't know...
{40123}{40184}-What?|-Now that she's got money out of her,
{40189}{40278}-she may leave her.|-What? What money?
{40330}{40400}The money for Eliska's grant.
{40432}{40463}A large grant
{40490}{40550}and mum's given her millions and
{40562}{40608}sold granddad's pine grove.
{40613}{40669}-Fuck!|-She told me about it.
{40688}{40723}She's broke.
{40759}{40795}I can't believe it...
{40930}{40986}She's only after mum's money?
{40991}{41015}Of course.
{41016}{41051}She's young, she's pretty,
{41056}{41098}and gets off with someone 20
{41103}{41135}years older. Why?
{41167}{41204}She's a foreigner, and a musician.
{41205}{41241}And mum has influence...
{41257}{41306}Poor mum!
{41307}{41336}Isn't it stuffy in here?
{41415}{41443}Where shall we go?
{41444}{41515}We all agree we have to act, right?
{41522}{41570}I've got an idea.
{41576}{41621}Mum's always been proud.
{41632}{41697}If Eliska cheated on her,|she'd never forgive her.
{41713}{41762}You want Eliska to cheat on her?
{41767}{41802}It's not so difficult.
{41807}{41876}She's young, pretty,|the flesh is weak...
{41896}{41947}That's awful.|We can't do that!
{41952}{42044}That would be a vicious|thing to do. We'd be real
{42054}{42107}-bitches.|-Cut the crap, Elvis.
{42117}{42162}It's for mum's good.
{42172}{42207}There's only one problem.
{42212}{42241}How can we do it?
{42249}{42325}Look for a lesbian to|seduce mum's girlfriend?
{42462}{42490}No, no, no...
{42513}{42573}Not there, Sol.
{43588}{43616}Christ!
{43638}{43666}What?
{43682}{43744}That girl, she's a client of mine.
{43757}{43842}I knew she was getting|divorced but I had no idea...
{43853}{43902}Life's full of surprises.
{43912}{43943}Well then,
{43944}{43981}shall we split up?
{44314}{44372}My husband thinks I'm|leaving him for another man.
{44377}{44460}-He won't believe it's for a girl.|-He prefers not to.
{44859}{44910}Hello.
{44911}{44960}Hello.
{44969}{45031}Fancy a drink?
{45035}{45070}Actually I'm not...
{45117}{45148}A beer.
{45149}{45214}From the bottle|or do you want a glass?
{45239}{45265}A glass.
{45456}{45509}Here's to you.
{45523}{45555}Haven't seen you here before.
{45580}{45621}I don't come very often.
{45702}{45736}Have you got a girlfriend?
{45774}{45818}No. What about you?
{45857}{45904}I haven't but|my mother has.
{45956}{45989}You're a big hit.
{46006}{46080}You enjoy yourself.|They're jealous.
{46085}{46123}That's enough, Sol.
{46170}{46210}Can you hold on a minute?
{46344}{46406}Well?
{46423}{46501}The girl at the bar with|short hair. Take a look.
{46583}{46629}-She's giving me|the come-on. -Really?
{46634}{46722}-Well, me and everybody else.|-We could bring Eliska...
{46727}{46822}-She looks like a man.|-Maybe Eliska likes that type.
{46827}{46893}If she liked men, she wouldn't like mum.
{46898}{46950}We can't be too fussy.
{46958}{47023}I said this was madness|but you wouldn't listen
{47028}{47097}and now I feel|like a real shit...
{47113}{47143}I may have a breakdown.
{47148}{47201}Hey...
{47202}{47242}From the blonde at the back.
{47252}{47279}If you want something else,
{47284}{47336}-I can change it.|-Thanks.
{47403}{47450}-I'll do it!|-You'll do what?
{47455}{47507}-Get off with her.|-What!
{47515}{47572}-That's stupid!|-I'm the ideal one.
{47577}{47637}I even look|like mum. Yes, I do.
{47648}{47703}And I'm a hit with the girls.
{47718}{47776}Come on, trust me.
{48038}{48132}-I didn't hear you get up.|-I not want to wake you.
{48303}{48335}Yes...
{48362}{48443}I'm going to make you some|delicious toast with oil.
{48845}{48887}Hi!
{48888}{48916}Hello, darling.
{48924}{48983}Sorry for just|dropping in like this...
{48988}{49059}-It's such a lovely day...|-It's a pity to stay in.
{49064}{49108}And as mum's practising...
{49113}{49161}We had a great idea.
{49166}{49215}Hello, what's going on?
{49220}{49261}-Hello, mum.|-Hello...
{49283}{49316}I can't, I can't...
{49321}{49372}-What a big boy.|-Hi, mum.
{49377}{49433}We've come to kidnap Eliska...
{49438}{49531}-To take her to my club.|-This is unusual...
{49550}{49604}Just like "Little Women".
{49643}{49700}-You going too?|-Yes, with mummy!
{49705}{49766}I envy you.|Today's Sunday...
{49792}{49833}I'll come along too.
{49848}{49953}But mum, what about the piano?|Aren't you going to practise?
{49958}{50010}It'll be there when I come back.
{50015}{50076}And this miracle may never occur again.
{50083}{50134}I'll be ready in a minute.|Coming?
{50305}{50337}I knew it.
{50358}{50389}I knew it...
{50433}{50463}Oh dear.
{50507}{50539}That does it.
{50564}{50613}Those two are inseparable.
{50618}{50690}We'll have to forget|about this mad plan.
{50695}{50754}What's up? You want to give up?
{50785}{50841}You want to get off|with her in front of mum?
{50846}{50901}She won't be around all the time.
{50926}{50993}We'll hire some bikes|and leave her behind.
{51041}{51078}What is it, girls?
{51095}{51130}Bottoms too fat?
{51609}{51651}-Hello.|-Hello.
{51677}{51717}That was quite a nap.
{51766}{51794}Elvira,
{51819}{51862}I wanted to say thank you.
{51873}{51931}What for?
{51948}{51980}For how you|all treat Eliska.
{52009}{52036}She really needs
{52037}{52088}to feel she belongs.
{52089}{52166}She only knows me and I'm|afraid she'll feel lonely.
{52216}{52274}She's very sensitive, like you.
{52316}{52354}You'll be great friends.
{52496}{52557}Where is everybody?
{52647}{52692}-Where's Sol?|-They're over there.
{52697}{52779}-Benja wanted a wee.|-They're by the boats.
{53106}{53151}-Are you okay?|-Yes.
{53196}{53240}It's very peaceful, isn't it?
{53309}{53339}Eliska...
{53340}{53378}Do you like tattoos?
{53413}{53463}-Ta what?|-Tattoos.
{53482}{53513}-I've got one.|-Yes?
{53518}{53572}Yes. Want to see it?
{53626}{53663}I'll show you.
{53693}{53745}Look.
{53821}{53847}Eliska,
{53875}{53903}look.
{53938}{53964}Hello.
{53974}{54001}All right?
{54090}{54127}Nice here, isn't it?
{54305}{54336}How...?
{54337}{54369}Go away, Elvira.
{54379}{54407}Where...?
{54408}{54437}Are you stupid?
{54463}{54518}How did you get over here, Sol?
{54529}{54567}You always mess things up.
{54604}{54652}No...
{54654}{54679}Help me!
{54680}{54707}I said no.
{54728}{54793}I said no. Get off.|Be careful!
{54921}{54994}Elvira's stupid. She spoiled everything.
{55001}{55034}I know.
{55035}{55094}And yet she|gets on well with her.
{55112}{55168}"The brain is deeper than the sea,
{55185}{55271}for hold them Blue to Blue,|the one the other will absorb... "
{55294}{55361}That's pretty.|Who wrote it?
{55385}{55423}Emily Dickinson,
{55451}{55499}a very unfortunate woman.
{55527}{55570}You a writer too, no?
{55584}{55645}Your mother say|you have much talent.
{55665}{55704}Well she's my mother...
{55735}{55795}I like much to read|a novel by you.
{55812}{55843}You lend me?
{55848}{55881}-My novel?|-Yes.
{55918}{55951}It's not worth it...
{55984}{56018}I understand.
{56033}{56096}It hard for me too to show things I do.
{56109}{56164}Somebody see me play piano,
{56169}{56204}my hands shake,
{56209}{56281}my heart bang so loud I not hear music.
{56292}{56348}Only "boom-boom"...
{56366}{56412}But you give concerts...
{56423}{56453}So you'll get over that.
{56458}{56537}No alternative.|Either you jump in pool
{56551}{56603}or always watch others swim.
{57010}{57099}Elvira! Ah, those proofs at last.
{57104}{57145}No... it's my novel.
{57152}{57201}-Your what?|-My novel.
{57221}{57313}The first version. It needs|checking. It's a bit long but
{57318}{57365}I'd like you to read it.
{57375}{57424}So you've written a novel too?|
{57441}{57478}Not for publication.
{57486}{57572}Just have a look at it|when you can. No obligation.
{57577}{57629}I won't raise your hopes...
{57637}{57724}We've all got a novel|at the bottom of a drawer.
{57737}{57776}Come on, Elvira, the proofs.
{57880}{57931}Surprise!
{57965}{57995}What are you doing here?
{58000}{58036}You look pretty!
{58055}{58099}We've something to tell you.
{58147}{58176}About the Czech girl.
{58205}{58234}What about her?
{58262}{58292}You'll have to do it.
{58317}{58354}-Do what?|-Get off with her.
{58468}{58522}You're joking.
{58563}{58633}She likes you. She was|with you for hours...
{58640}{58671}Very close...
{58709}{58743}You're sick.
{58765}{58807}-We were just talking.|-Then
{58812}{58895}she must like the intelectual type.|But she had the hots for you.
{58905}{58967}You've got more sex|appeal than you think.
{59038}{59087}Hello, Elvira.
{59092}{59124}Hello.
{59125}{59148}Hello.
{59149}{59170}Hello.
{59171}{59207}Nice to see you again.
{59234}{59273}Bernardo's in his office.
{59282}{59319}I haven't come to see him.
{59361}{59388}You see,
{59389}{59469}here's an invitation|to my book presentation
{59494}{59533}and I'd like|you to come along.
{59541}{59577}We could have a drink after...
{59590}{59624}If you fancy, of course...
{59681}{59716}I won't be able to...
{59743}{59772}I have...
{59773}{59829}a lot... a lot of work.
{59852}{59891}I see.
{59893}{59930}Well...
{59931}{60001}Well, then... bye.
{60229}{60265}Christ, Elvira!
{60270}{60316}Well...
{60317}{60394}-You're irresistible!|-With all the sexes!
{60409}{60486}Out, both of you! Out! Go away!
{60498}{60549}Promise to get off with Eliska.
{60570}{60612}-I can't.|-Yes, you can.
{60619}{60666}-Don't be a coward.|-Coward.
{60680}{60753}Coward, coward, coward.
{60763}{60829}I can't. I can't do something like that!
{60843}{60895}Get off with mum's girlfriend? It's...
{60902}{60931}disgusting.
{60936}{61015}Anyway I'm just not capable|of something like that.
{61021}{61087}Have they seen something in me?
{61092}{61133}Maybe the lesbian in me
{61142}{61210}is attracted to Eliska.|What do you think?
{61245}{61311}Every girl wants to|take her mother's place.
{61321}{61362}You think I want Eliska?
{61372}{61438}You know I don't think you're a lesbian.
{61446}{61518}Sure, but strange things|are happening to me.
{61527}{61593}A man I like a lot,|but run away from...
{61599}{61682}Last night I dreamed of|Piluca Gómez when we were 5...
{61693}{61746}I was looking at|her knickers. Piluca's!
{61751}{61838}Maybe this is the beginning|and I'll end up following girls
{61844}{61938}in the street.|Piluca, when we were 5 years old!
{61951}{62003}-Calm down.|-I can't breathe.
{62013}{62064}Come on, calm down, Elvira.
{62084}{62152}-Should I take a pill?|-No...
{62161}{62213}Come here. Hold me. Okay?
{62219}{62257}Easy, easy...
{62297}{62363}My little Elvira. Feel better now?
{62397}{62464}So sweet, so neurotic...
{62535}{62595}-What are you doing?|-What do you think?
{62615}{62649}I... I don't know.
{62654}{62690}Touching me up!
{62722}{62785}No. You've got it wrong.|It was a test
{62807}{62863}to gauge your sexual ambiguity.
{62889}{62934}Come on, relax.
{62939}{63017}Take it as... As a|therapeutic experiment.
{63022}{63062}-But...|-You're so beautiful...
{63067}{63133}No, no, no. This...|It's not like that...
{63138}{63228}Sex between therapist and|patient is pathological.
{63255}{63303}And falling for|your mother's girlfriend...
{63308}{63339}Isn't that pathological?
{63344}{63403}I'll dispel your|doubts right now.
{63419}{63502}Look, if it's to test my femininity,
{63510}{63548}and that's fine by me...
{63553}{63670}there are lots of|other men who aren't...
{63687}{63726}Who aren't my therapist.
{63731}{63785}Sure. It's up to you.
{63797}{63875}Look for someone who knows|more about your desires than me.
{63905}{63934}You know,
{63976}{64019}I don't think I'll come...
{64032}{64065}back here.
{64191}{64220}Thank you.
{64221}{64284}This is Gómez from "Universal".
{64297}{64350}-He wants an interview.|-Hello.
{64362}{64404}Excuse me a moment, please.
{64493}{64542}Great. I didn't expect you.
{64552}{64628}Sorry I'm late. I|couldn't come any earlier.
{64652}{64701}You haven't missed much anyway.
{64735}{64773}Coming for a drink?
{64790}{64839}With them?
{64854}{64885}I hate that sort of thing.
{64915}{64944}Forget about them|and we can go
{64949}{64978}wherever you like.
{64979}{65055}-What do you fancy?|-I fancy a good screw.
{65570}{65598}Hey...
{65621}{65651}Shall we go to bed?
{65737}{65760}No,
{65761}{65797}here, standing up.
{65829}{65866}Fine, fine.
{65920}{65996}I want this to be an|unforgettable screw.
{66005}{66058}Be very masculine and rough, okay?
{66122}{66171}Well, I'll do what I can.
{66177}{66211}-Okay?|-Okay.
{66369}{66408}Don't kiss me so much,
{66429}{66473}-just fuck me...|-Now?
{66478}{66518}-Fuck me!|-Yes...
{66646}{66683}Ow! Christ!
{66738}{66773}-Are you okay?|-Yes.
{66778}{66819}-Sure?|-Yes, yes.
{66956}{67014}-What's the matter?|-It's cold...
{67024}{67054}The wall.
{67082}{67107}On the bed.
{67108}{67132}Right.
{67358}{67411}-Why don't you get on top?|-What?
{67416}{67489}-Me underneath and you on top.|-Okay.
{67555}{67662}Hold me down.|You can handle me.
{67700}{67755}-And call me "whore".|-What?
{67760}{67816}Call me "whore".|Say "whore".
{67861}{67920}-Whore.-No! Put your heart into it.
{67925}{67977}"Whore! Whore!"|Say "whore".
{67982}{68030}And stick it in me, now!
{68035}{68069}That's enough! Enough.
{68088}{68128}Enough.
{68129}{68168}It's no good this way.
{68234}{68283}I'm sorry.
{68307}{68361}So sorry.|I've been so stupid...
{68415}{68465}Now that you mention it, you have.
{68546}{68576}Are you leaving?
{68577}{68606}What do you think?
{68626}{68687}-We could have coffee and talk...|-I don't want
{68692}{68749}to talk!
{68780}{68834}Look, I know you feel awful.
{68878}{68932}I like you and you like me,
{68937}{68971}and you go and|spoil it. Why?
{68976}{69025}I don't know.
{69089}{69128}But I won't play your game.
{69160}{69208}Miguel...
{69636}{69686}Elvira!
{69731}{69774}What are you doing here?
{69775}{69816}I wanted to see you.
{69966}{70017}-I envy you when you swim...|-Do you?
{70052}{70109}You're so sure of yourself.
{70136}{70220}-I wish I was like you.|-It's a question of age.
{70235}{70290}No, you were always like that.
{70371}{70447}-Can I ask you a question?|-Sounds dangerous...
{70477}{70505}Go ahead.
{70545}{70622}When you and mum separated,|did you still love her?
{70643}{70683}A complicated question.
{70695}{70743}I probably did...|In a way.
{70748}{70829}-Did you ever think of making up?|-What is this?
{70834}{70901}-Homework for your analyst?|-No...
{70933}{70969}To tell the truth,
{70975}{71029}we'd never have been happy.
{71042}{71085}We're too different.
{71100}{71183}I'm a sort of hermit, better|with books than people.
{71248}{71326}I must take after you.|I don't understand people...
{71351}{71397}Or myself either, actually.
{71408}{71477}You're more like your|mother than you think.
{71493}{71551}You're just not brave|enough to be yourself.
{71599}{71650}Is it brave to say sorry?
{71672}{71737}That's the most|difficult thing of all.
{71745}{71831}-Come on, let's swim.|-I haven't brought my swimsuit.
{71836}{71901}No excuses, girlie.|Follow me.
{72102}{72144}Swim to me.
{72416}{72442}Miguel.
{72470}{72507}What are you doing here?
{72531}{72584}Waiting for you.|I wanted to...
{72654}{72711}I've got a plant for you.
{72712}{72743}Goodness,
{72744}{72788}-it's enormous.|-I...
{72793}{72864}I'll help you to take|it up if you like.
{72892}{72964}I don't know what to say.
{73013}{73051}Mightn't n't that be dangerous?
{73084}{73155}Don't make me feel embarrassed, please.
{73310}{73355}-Have you been waiting long?|-No,
{73383}{73421}four or five hours.
{73444}{73474}Come on in.
{73527}{73578}It needs a lot of light.
{73583}{73664}-Better up there. Let me take it.|-It's ok.
{73670}{73727}Really? Are you sure? Come on.
{73764}{73816}It needs watering twice a week.
{73821}{73872}Not too much water though.
{73887}{73961}Enough to dampen the soil|or it'll lose its colour.
{73966}{74031}-Okay.|-You cut it back in the autumn,
{74050}{74115}give it some fertilizer occasionally,
{74150}{74234}and if you talk to it|it'll grow beautiful.
{74253}{74281}Very sensitive...
{74318}{74346}plants are.
{74347}{74401}I'll read love poetry to it.
{74499}{74545}Anyway,
{74546}{74572}I've written down the instructions,
{74577}{74626}and call me if|you have any questions.
{74637}{74687}I've got one now.
{74688}{74722}What?
{74723}{74756}Have you got
{74761}{74795}a favourite restaurant?
{74877}{74929}Yes.
{75001}{75058}Incredible how things|are after yesterday.
{75068}{75120}Let me make a suggestion.
{75131}{75219}Let's forget all about|yesterday and enjoy the meal.
{75227}{75255}-Okay?|-Okay.
{75312}{75355}It's so difficult.
{75356}{75406}When things start to go well,
{75411}{75439}I always end up
{75440}{75470}spoiling it.
{75485}{75529}Tell me if I do|anything stupid, ok?
{75557}{75604}I promise.
{75605}{75651}Okay.
{75714}{75747}I love it when you smile.
{75781}{75843}If you do that,|I get nervous and...
{75899}{75947}If you look at me that way...
{75964}{76020}How?
{76025}{76063}Like you are now.
{76103}{76164}I like it but|you'd better not do it.
{76180}{76217}I don't know another way.
{76285}{76312}No!
{76313}{76338}What?
{76339}{76435}I knew it! But this time I know|how it's going to get spoiled.
{76442}{76465}Hello, mum.
{76466}{76506}-How are you?|-Hi, darling...
{76516}{76551}You look lovely.
{76568}{76640}This is my mother, Sofía,|and her girlfriend, Eliska.
{76645}{76672}Hello.
{76679}{76724}See you later.
{76911}{76970}Yes, it's mum's favourite|restaurant too...
{77002}{77031}So your mother's the...
{77032}{77060}Lesbian, yes.
{77074}{77107}I was going to say pianist.
{77116}{77151}I've been to her concerts.
{77171}{77224}Don't pretend you don't mind.
{77244}{77277}What do you want me to do?
{77295}{77367}I know you're thinking|I'm weird enough without
{77372}{77407}having a dyke for a mother.
{77412}{77476}Some things are best|said at the beginning,
{77481}{77544}even though we hardly know each other.
{77577}{77619}It's you who's saying all this.
{77629}{77686}-I can read men's minds.|-You've only
{77691}{77719}got one thing right.
{77724}{77776}You hardly know me.
{77810}{77875}Oh, I don't fancy|the lasagna now.
{77885}{77912}Stop it, Elvira.
{77927}{77956}You said to tell you.
{77961}{78003}You're trying to spoil it.
{78017}{78070}So? I'll spoil what I like.
{78098}{78145}-Bring the bill.|-No, don't.
{78171}{78192}Miguel,
{78193}{78235}neither of us wants to go on.
{78253}{78310}Eat your lasagna and|keep quiet for a while.
{78315}{78373}Are you telling|me what to do?
{78388}{78434}Take it away|or I'll throw up.
{78464}{78497}You've done it now!
{78547}{78573}I like you but
{78594}{78678}I'm not a glutton for punishment|so let's forget this.
{78897}{78923}No, sorry...
{79033}{79095}Mum!
{79110}{79169}-I'm stupid!|-Are you?
{79234}{79299}What happened to|that handsome boy?
{79361}{79400}I scared him off.
{79415}{79447}Why am I like I am?
{79471}{79509}I haven't|the faintest idea, darling.
{79527}{79552}Character.
{79553}{79610}Elvira feel things very much.
{79618}{79682}I should stop crying,|shouldn't I?
{79723}{79797}I could do with a drink.|Let's have a drink.
{79820}{79880}Do what you like but|early rise tomorrow.
{79889}{79943}We're all going to the solicitor's.
{79953}{79986}Aren't you hard on her?
{80063}{80112}All right,
{80113}{80143}you go if you like.
{80203}{80233}I'll go with you.
{80326}{80376}Thanks.
{80377}{80411}Tell me, what do you see?
{80416}{80474}-People.|-Take away the women,
{80479}{80512}-and what's left?|-Men?
{80538}{80596}They're not men, they're cocks.
{80612}{80642}Lying in wait.
{80669}{80707}I'll show you.
{80716}{80743}Look.
{80802}{80854}That's Mr. Big Cock.
{80877}{80936}He's so big and so happy...
{80941}{81033}In, out, in, out, and that's it.
{81047}{81103}If you haven't|realised, you're stupid.
{81148}{81192}Oh, a romantic cock.
{81199}{81269}He wants stroking|and kissing and
{81294}{81392}an hour later, when you've had|enough, he's back to the start.
{81418}{81500}You know all this|just looking at boys?
{81512}{81546}Of course,
{81547}{81579}it's obvious.
{81719}{81752}The perfect cock,
{81772}{81802}pretty, glossy,
{81807}{81874}horny... He's... gay.
{81924}{81955}He doesn't like pussy,
{81979}{82028}and he's a species on the increase.
{82033}{82068}What can we do?
{82089}{82123}Ask for another drink.
{82145}{82188}I already am drunk.
{82193}{82260}Sure. Me too.|But that was the idea.
{82341}{82381}-Great, right?|-Yes.
{82405}{82439}I'm telling you all this
{82444}{82507}about cocks and|you're not interested...
{82546}{82581}You know something?
{82615}{82699}When it comes down|to it, penetration...
{82718}{82750}I don't...
{82790}{82822}Let's dance.
{82833}{82884}I'll end up like you, you'll see.
{82951}{82987}Ow, I fall!
{83619}{83734}Come on, door. Open.
{83766}{83849}It always does this|and not cos I'm drunk...
{83890}{83943}I never smoke, but today...
{83950}{84029}I burn throat, but I like.
{84213}{84250}What you doing?
{84284}{84350}Every part of the body|is in the foot.
{84366}{84393}Look, this
{84409}{84436}is the head.
{84437}{84511}I feel nothing at all in the head.
{84516}{84550}Concentrate.
{84579}{84612}This is the back.
{84670}{84714}You should know what this is.
{84719}{84746}I don't know.
{84770}{84814}-Aren't you ticklish?|-No.
{84819}{84844}-Not at all?|-Not at all.
{84845}{84869}Nothing at all?
{84901}{84940}You were lying!
{85016}{85101}This very fun|but I have to go.
{85130}{85167}I won't let you!
{85496}{85549}No.
{85550}{85610}Cannot be.|Not good.
{85783}{85819}I'm sorry...
{85962}{86001}-I'm a shit.|-No,
{86011}{86043}you not shit.
{86058}{86148}This happen because you|and me very good together.

{86213}{86278}You're very sweet, very pretty...
{86307}{86389}But I in love with your mother.|Never do her harm.
{86394}{86424}You know?
{86649}{86702}Are you okay?
{86717}{86748}Yes.
{86874}{86903}Eliska...
{86946}{86976}Forgive me?
{86981}{87026}Nothing to forgive.
{87207}{87258}You won't tell mum, right?
{87268}{87299}No.
{87304}{87347}Secret between the two.
{87385}{87440}Promise?
{87441}{87494}I promise.
{87495}{87525}Now sleep.
{87568}{87612}I go.
{87613}{87655}No, don't go.
{87707}{87758}Won't you stay till I'm asleep?
{87770}{87827}Please.
{88189}{88219}Yeah?
{88326}{88356}Mum!
{88436}{88502}No, I don't know where she is.
{88566}{88633}No, she didn't
{88638}{88676}say where she was going.
{88764}{88790}Okay.
{88798}{88860}Bye.
{88865}{88916}It very late. I have to go.
{88921}{88960}Know where my bag is?
{88976}{89003}In the living-room.
{89018}{89078}Eliska, you won't...
{89093}{89138}You won't tell mum, will you?
{89159}{89193}I promised, no?
{89214}{89243}Don't worry.
{89547}{89625}-Hello.|-Do you know what time it is?
{89653}{89689}I've been very worried.
{89700}{89733}I sorry...
{89792}{89858}I rang the police, the hospitals...
{89898}{89937}I didn't know what to do.
{89974}{90012}Sofía, pardon me.
{90019}{90063}It late and I|stay with Elvira.
{90116}{90173}I spoke to her.|You haven't been with her.
{90188}{90238}Yes, yes, I was...
{90248}{90274}Were you?
{90289}{90334}So my daughter's lying?
{90449}{90504}If something's the matter,
{90515}{90577}tell me now.
{90706}{90744}Why you not trust me?
{90793}{90821}Because you don't tell the truth.
{90899}{90972}Eliska, you can lead|your life, come and go
{90977}{91010}as you like.
{91039}{91089}I don't want to dictate to you.
{91114}{91166}But I don't want you to lie either.
{91241}{91285}I love you very much.
{91297}{91332}I love you too.
{91349}{91384}But the point is
{91417}{91464}things aren't going well.
{91529}{91576}You no want me with you?
{91589}{91622}No, not now.
{91695}{91732}I'm very tired.
{92227}{92263}-Hi.|-Hi.
{92326}{92393}-Mum's had a row with Eliska.|-Has she?
{92419}{92460}-I'll be right there.|-Okay.
{92608}{92654}Mum, how are you? What's up?
{92659}{92687}Nothing.
{92719}{92787}Eliska went out with Elvira for a drink,
{92816}{92862}and didn't sleep here.
{92874}{92912}She wouldn't tell me|where she'd been
{92917}{92946}or who with.
{92951}{93017}-Elvira doesn't know either,|-That's bad.
{93048}{93147}Anyway, the thing about last|night isn't so important, mum.
{93164}{93195}-You think so?|-Sure.
{93213}{93258}Anybody can slip up.
{93279}{93308}It's another thing
{93313}{93344}if there's some problem.
{93364}{93402}We get on very well.
{93408}{93469}Of course.
{93526}{93561}But it's just that
{93573}{93620}I thought there might be
{93637}{93673}things that pose problems.
{93704}{93738}I don't know...
{93739}{93807}Differences between|you, not only in age...
{93829}{93856}Eliska has no-one,
{93857}{93926}she knows on-one.|You're her world.
{93948}{93988}What if things change?
{94049}{94109}What do you mean?
{94124}{94144}Well,
{94145}{94196}it isn't an equal relationship.
{94226}{94267}She owes you too much.
{94272}{94373}Then you told her she|could do what she wanted,
{94378}{94408}and so she did.
{94413}{94458}I'm even more worried now.
{94502}{94525}I suppose
{94526}{94590}I ought to talk|things over with her...
{94681}{94699}I'll go and change
{94700}{94735}for the solicitor's.
{94740}{94782}-Where's Elvira?|-I don't know.
{95508}{95541}Dear Sofia...
{95587}{95625}When you read this,
{95642}{95677}I not here any more.
{95715}{95778}I sorry very much to leave this way,
{95783}{95840}but it best for both of us.
{95890}{95916}I think
{95950}{96020}there is not|a good future for us.
{96028}{96054}I...
{96072}{96163}love you, but there many|things that separate us.
{96207}{96252}I see clear now and
{96257}{96354}think best finish here|before everything much worse.
{96406}{96448}Please, not look for me.
{96480}{96527}I think of you in my heart.
{99686}{99718}How is she?
{99723}{99825}Well, the tranquilizer's|working and she's asleep now.
{99910}{99950}It's my fault.
{99990}{100023}It's all my fault.
{100067}{100103}Come on, Elvira,
{100124}{100162}don't talk nonsense.
{100171}{100212}You've no idea...
{100226}{100279}I tried to get off with Eliska.
{100323}{100372}You got off with Eliska!
{100383}{100475}She said no and I made her|promise not to tell mum.
{100518}{100557}And she didn't and they argued.
{100562}{100640}I said nothing and that's|why mum's like this.
{100711}{100780}My God, what a family I was born into!
{100813}{100845}Here I am.
{100889}{100915}How's your mother?
{100916}{100946}Terrible.
{101071}{101123}What are you doing?|That's for mum!
{101144}{101197}Well I need|a tranquilizer too.
{101274}{101329}This was in the letter box.|I'll go in.
{101395}{101443}We'll have to look after her.
{101513}{101541}Here, look at this.
{101630}{101665}A letter from Eliska.
{101671}{101724}-Let's take it to mum.|-What?
{101739}{101808}It might depress her even more.
{101830}{101909}-Go on, open it.|-No, no, no. It's mum's.
{101922}{101951}Give it here.
{102174}{102206}Well? What does it say?
{102224}{102255}She's back in Prague.
{102293}{102355}She's worried about mum and says
{102361}{102399}she sorting out the papers
{102404}{102453}to return the money mum lent her.
{102481}{102525}Then she's going to stay there.
{102583}{102609}Shit!
{102637}{102694}This is awful.
{102707}{102796}All we have to do|is bring her back to mum.
{102815}{102875}You mean go to|the Czech Republic?
{102888}{102929}We'll go wherever we have to.
{102938}{102966}The three of us.
{102987}{103022}Don't be ridiculous.
{103046}{103076}Anyway, I can't,
{103089}{103153}with things going|so badly with Raúl.
{103163}{103219}What else can we do for mum?
{103237}{103264}We're going and that's it!
{103329}{103380}That was good!|I was strong, assertive...
{103397}{103425}Must be that pill.
{103583}{103613}-Wait...|-What?
{103619}{103698}-I need to make a call.|-Don't go back in now. Here...
{103708}{103738}Use my mobile.
{103889}{103943}Hello, Miguel here. I'm not in.
{103948}{104005}Leave a message|and I'll call you back.
{104033}{104106}Hello, Miguel,|this is Elvira. Elvira.
{104154}{104232}I'm not surprised you|haven't picked up the phone.
{104250}{104274}It's months since I heard
{104275}{104336}from you.
{104338}{104370}I'm sure you|don't want to see me.
{104376}{104444}I do understand.|If I could, I wouldn't want
{104449}{104516}to see me either. But...|anyway,
{104537}{104578}though I did things badly,
{104607}{104670}you were one of the best things|that ever happened to me.
{104712}{104765}You'll wonder what|the worst things are...
{104770}{104797}Anyway, it doesn't matter,
{104802}{104831}Miguel.
{104849}{104893}I like you a lot and I'm sorry
{104898}{104960}I'm the way I am.
{104968}{105002}You'll wonder why I'm
{105007}{105047}telling you all this. Well...
{105056}{105115}I'm taking a plane|and as it'll crash,
{105125}{105148}I didn't want to die
{105149}{105187}-without you knowing.|-Elvira!
{105218}{105246}Elvira.
{105247}{105303}That costs money.
{105440}{105519}Right. If Benja gets sick|then call the doctor, okay?
{105524}{105576}I don't know...
{105577}{105638}That way, that way.
{105673}{105701}Shit!
{105762}{105788}Hey...
{105813}{105887}I'm so sorry. It isn't|my fault, I promise you.
{105892}{105929}-Oh...|-It's my husband's.
{105934}{105978}He won't stop calling me.
{105983}{106026}So argue with him, not me.
{106031}{106081}I won't argue with anybody.
{106087}{106118}-Really?|-No.
{106127}{106192}-It's a bad knock. Look at the wings.|-I know.
{106198}{106248}-But yours is worse.|-What?
{106315}{106366}We really appreciate this lift.
{106382}{106430}I'd gladly take you to Prague
{106435}{106484}-but I have to work.|-Of course.
{106524}{106596}-What's your firm's name?|-"Plant yourself'.
{106610}{106651}What a good idea.
{106673}{106698}Look,
{106699}{106773}you must give me your|phone number for...
{106789}{106845}-the papers and all that.|-Of course.
{108407}{108465}-What if they don't know her?|-We'll ask
{108470}{108518}-in the office.|-Will they have the files
{108523}{108575}-of the ex-students?|-Look.
{108642}{108689}She's more than an ex-student.
{108830}{108899}This is embarrassing. It can't be here.
{108904}{108931}Elvira!
{108979}{109001}Hello.
{109002}{109043}See? This is the wrong place.

{109688}{109729}Eliska, are those...?
{109736}{109771}My brothers.
{109784}{109836}That's my grandmother.
{109847}{109891}She looks after them.
{109913}{109997}My parents died in|accident not much long ago.
{110084}{110120}Go on to your room.
{110155}{110202}You've got a large family.
{110242}{110298}Sit down.

{110541}{110586}-No, thanks.|-No...
{110588}{110632}I'd like a glass of water.
{110640}{110683}My mouth's dry.
{110706}{110727}Water.
{110728}{110766}Water? Right away.
{110904}{110922}Right,
{110923}{110970}now where do we begin?
{111056}{111098}We've come over to...
{111151}{111213}-to...|-To ask you to go back to mum.
{111309}{111336}-Here we are.|-Thanks.
{111348}{111388}Don't mention it.
{111471}{111550}I'm sure you won't give|a damn that we're sorry.
{111555}{111582}-Elvira, I...|-No, let me
{111583}{111618}finish, please.
{111670}{111711}Don't think of us.
{111736}{111787}Think of mum.
{111817}{111884}The concert was a|disaster. She collapsed.
{111899}{111934}what's the matter with her? Is she i
{112005}{112038}Depression.
{112064}{112124}Eliska, she misses you very, very much.
{112150}{112201}I very sorry that Sofía sad.
{112231}{112260}I feel bad also.
{112305}{112332}And...
{112369}{112416}really I love your mother.
{112469}{112548}At first I was afraid of|changing her life so much.
{112577}{112614}But,

{112698}{112722}She say,
{112723}{112797}"If this happen to me, why not accept?"

{113193}{113223}There I am nobody.
{113236}{113351}-That's wrong. To mum you're everything.|-Go on, Eliska, please...
{113357}{113404}What can we say to convince you?
{113420}{113453}Do not insist.
{113461}{113516}I thought a lot, my decision not change.
{114143}{114174}Wait.
{114200}{114256}You've forgotten this.
{114331}{114386}That was very nice of him.
{114502}{114539}-Okay.|-Okay?
{114544}{114644}-You two aren't coming...|-No, we're going to pack.
{114649}{114695}So do we give up?

{114871}{114977}I'll try and get him to say|something to his sister. Okay?
{114995}{115033}I'll tell you later.

{115117}{115172}-I don't believe it.|-That's how it is.
{115199}{115254}And it's best to accept defeat.
{115294}{115376}We'd better go back to|Madrid and take care of mum.
{115393}{115433}Coming back to the hotel?
{115489}{115541}I think I'll go|for a walk, okay?
{115547}{115577}Okay.
{120228}{120270}Where's Sol?
{120271}{120325}Fraternizing with the Czechs.
{120626}{120685}Shall we have a drink?|We should celebrate.
{120690}{120729}-Sure.|-I'm going to use
{120734}{120780}this self-assertion high I'm on
{120785}{120841}to sort a few things out...
{120864}{120913}Can you lend me your keys?
{120943}{120982}They're all yours.
{121193}{121267}-Has your sister got a driving licence?|-No.
{121273}{121325}She never passed the test.
{121468}{121525}Well! The girl who|went missing in action!
{121530}{121571}Good to see you.
{121576}{121613}We thought a UFO had got you.
{121631}{121666}I'm sorry, Bernardo.
{121679}{121710}-Look, I just came...|-No,
{121715}{121747}you look, Elvira.
{121748}{121786}If you thought this was
{121791}{121849}a holiday club or|something, you're wrong.
{121854}{121888}Where have you been?|I hope
{121893}{121937}you've got a good excuse,
{121949}{122000}although it won't be any use.
{122048}{122087}Well I have,
{122088}{122125}but I won't tell you.
{122126}{122161}Don't annoy me...
{122162}{122213}Or what? You'll fire me?
{122240}{122291}Go ahead.
{122293}{122324}What?
{122325}{122356}The thing is, Bernardo,
{122361}{122415}I don't want to work for you.
{122429}{122462}Your type
{122463}{122513}is the worst. Exploiting people,
{122518}{122568}paying shit wages and all for
{122573}{122602}our own good, right?
{122603}{122686}I'd rather starve, but|I don't think I will,
{122701}{122767}because finding an equally|shitty job will be easy.
{122776}{122825}Elvira...
{122832}{122858}You'll be sorry.
{122881}{122915}I doubt it.
{122920}{122963}And if ever I was sorry,|I wouldn't tell you.
{123380}{123416}-Ernesto!|-Elvira!
{123445}{123486}I knew you'd be back.
{123736}{123770}My little fish!
{123800}{123857}It's all right, my babies.
{123877}{123905}You'll be all right.
{123906}{123965}You'll be all right.|Don't worry.
{124384}{124429}Hey, wait a minute, Elvira...
{124442}{124500}I don't mind you raping me but
{124509}{124558}let me finish shaving, okay?
{125027}{125091}I've got a confession to make.
{125105}{125136}What?
{125154}{125198}I've read your novel.
{125249}{125296}-What?|-Where you work...
{125339}{125385}That pig gave it to you!

{125475}{125510}I said I liked it.
{125538}{125583}-Really?|-Yes, very much.
{125592}{125627}It's very good.
{125645}{125700}And it's original and funny,
{125708}{125756}with a well-structured plot.
{125778}{125835}It grabs hold of you|from the start.
{125880}{125943}I've a very good publisher friend.
{125951}{126005}I'm sure he'll love it.
{126026}{126064}-A publisher?|-Yes.
{126085}{126159}You're interested in publishing|your novel, aren't you?
{126218}{126270}And if they didn't print it?
{126278}{126327}Even with your influence.
{126346}{126406}And if they did, how|would I know they liked it
{126411}{126464}and it wasn't just|a favour to you?
{126487}{126531}Stop, stop...
{126547}{126575}Stop, please.
{126576}{126607}You're right.
{126616}{126659}I just can't help it.
{126727}{126796}I don't know how you|can like me so much.
{126810}{126871}Because you're nice, attractive
{126881}{126909}and with those tits
{126914}{126948}and that bum...
{126969}{126992}No,
{126993}{127056}it's because|you know I've got talent.
{127200}{127255}Let me, I'm stronger than you.
{127270}{127306}Tough guy.
{127311}{127375}Now we pack some soil|around it nice and tight,
{127380}{127451}so it won't move.|Get that sack, please.
{127560}{127605}Divorce has done you good.
{127610}{127653}You look great.
{127693}{127728}At last you look your real age.
{127733}{127801}I'm taking a little|more care of myself.
{127823}{127856}What do you think of Javier?
{127861}{127901}As a gardener, marvellous.
{127906}{127954}Really, he's charming.
{127964}{127991}Who's thirsty?
{127992}{128031}Don't worry, I'll pour.
{128049}{128098}I'll be the ideal mother-in-law.
{128103}{128174}-Let's lay the table.|-Javier, want a beer?
{128179}{128249}-Yes, please.|-Benja, help me with the sack.
{128283}{128306}Well?
{128307}{128377}-Benja seems very happy with Javier.|-He is.
{128382}{128451}-The only one who isn't is Raúl.|-Logical.
{128471}{128503}Yes.
{128504}{128579}He's afraid he'll turn his|son into a radical ecologist,
{128584}{128649}and that instead|of studying law,
{128654}{128716}he'll go around curing mad cows.
{128721}{128798}How could you have stayed|with that fascist so long?
{128811}{128865}-He voted socialist.|-Exactly.
{128890}{128943}Mummy, look what I've got!
{128948}{129023}-A disgusting worm!|-Oh, that's horrible!
{129028}{129057}I'll get it.
{129058}{129113}It isn't necessary, really...
{129122}{129202}Don't be silly, I had|to do it sooner or later.
{129213}{129275}Really.
{129301}{129381}Eliska, there's a telegram|for you. Mum's got it.
{129474}{129529}You've got so much crap here.
{129577}{129635}Pepito! I thought he was dead.
{129648}{129672}What!
{129673}{129732}He's mine!
{129754}{129819}Yes, it's an expulsion order.
{129889}{129909}What's the matter?
{129910}{129983}-They're kicking Eliska out.|-The police.
{130016}{130037}Why?
{130038}{130081}I'm an illegal immigrant.
{130086}{130141}I have no job. Or grant.
{130156}{130190}What can we do?
{130191}{130243}With this in our hands, nothing.
{130286}{130321}We must think of something.
{130347}{130383}Well, well, well...
{130384}{130450}This marvellous thing|is saying "eat me. "
{130512}{130554}You haven't sat down yet.
{130561}{130621}I've got an idea.
{130622}{130666}You aren't married, are you?
{130671}{130714}No. Why?
{130733}{130775}You in a hurry?
{130793}{130823}More or less...
{130862}{130891}I do.
{130926}{130993}With the ceremony now over,|I'd like to say a few words.
{131018}{131070}For me this is|a very special moment,
{131075}{131097}this opportunity
{131098}{131155}to join together|through holy matrimony
{131167}{131219}these people of|different nationalities.
{131234}{131318}The loving couple may now kiss.
{131850}{131895}Long live the happy couple!
