I'm popular to boot

I'm bitching, great hair
The boys all love to stare

I'm wanted, I'm hot
I'm everything you're not

I'm pretty, I'm cool
I dominate this school

Who am I, just guess
Guys wanna touch my chest

6
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,961
I'm rocking, I smile
And many think I'm vile

You can look but
don't you hump, whoo

I'm major, I roar
I swear I'm not a whore

9
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:46,282
We cheer and we lead
We act like we're on speed

It's college, Tor.
I'm really stoked,
you know ?

50
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,411
It's just, you know,
I'm gonna miss you.

Really ?
Yeah.

But next year, it'll be
you and me reunited at
Cal State Dominguez Hills.

I'll be the experienced

- Good luck at school.

Oh, Aaron, come
to one last practice ?

You know you're still

I gotta run.
Please ?

Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,376
Darcy thinks she should
get captain be cause her dad
pays for everything.

74
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:47,016
He should use
some of that money
to buy her a clue.

Courtney'll get captain.
The guys love
clutching her butt.

76
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:55,736
She's got a lot to hang on to.
What's plural for "butt" ?
On one person, I mean.

77
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:58,296
She puts the "ass"
in "massive."

78
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,776
You put the "lude"
in "deluded."
Yo !

should say something.

she whipped you into shape.

Is that what that was ?

88

No one will miss Big Red, Tor.
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."

89

She puts the "whore "
in "horrifying. "

You know,
it's her last practice.
How would you feel ?

91
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,379
Big Red
has no feelings.

Oh, excellent !
Torrance has got
the fever, people.

102

What's a wolf's wall ?

103
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,301
Only the hardest pyramid
known to cheerleading
and mankind.

104
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:18,621
The words
"big" and "britches"
come to mind.

She'll kill us all.

Come on, guys !
Let's be different for once.

We can't just rest
on our laurels.

109
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,781
Why does everybody say that ?
Maybe a laurel's
a good place to rest.

five, six, seven, eight.
Kick one !

- Pinch some panties.
Someone's slacking.

Do I look like a milkmaid,
because somebody feels
like a cow !

120
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,304
- Carver, can you cradle out ?
- You bet I can.

121
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,904
Okay, ready ?
One, two, down, up !

Are you okay ?

00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,225
I'm fine, really.

126
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,824
Don't you guys
worry about me.
It's just a scratch.

127
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,745
I'll be back to practice
tomorrow,

128
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,665
so don't you guys fret,
okay ?

129
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:33,225
And I don't want you
to worry at all,
because I'm a quick healer.

for you.

I got captain.

135
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:49,866
Yeah, and you sent
a girl to the hospital
on your first day.

136
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:53,546
- Aye, aye, Captain !
- You were listening
on the phone ? Mom !

137
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:57,587
It's true. She really should
get her own private line,
you know.

138
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,067
She's growing up so fast.

139
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,787
Justin, go away.

140
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,147
At ease, Captain.

141
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:08,668
Well, this blistering
academic schedule
shouldn't get in your way.

142
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,588
You should be happy about that.

143
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,188
Why can't you
accept the fact
that I'm not a genius ?

144
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,148
It just kills you that
I'm not an honor student.

145
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,667
No. It kills me that you
barely make time to study.

146
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,908
If you studied
half as much as you cheer,
you'd be in great shape.

147
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,268
Your priorities are--
No ! Those are

00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:52,012
I put this to the entire squad.
Swear you guys didn't know.

447
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:55,012
Big Red didn't exactly
let any of us help with
the routines, Torrance.

448
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:58,653
- I cannot believe she did this.
- I feel awful. It's depraved.

449
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:01,213
I mean, those East Compton girls
wanted to grill our asses.

450
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,893
Big Red ran the show, man.
We were just flying ignorami,
for sobbing out loud.

451
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:08,374
We can't go to regionals
with a stolen routine.

452
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,934
It's too risky.
[Whitney]
Changing the routine now...

453
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:13,894
would be total
murder-suicide.
Seriously.

454
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,493
Let's not put
the "duh" in "dumb."

455
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:18,494
How are East Compton
gonna prove anything ?

456
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:22,214
You people are unbelievable.
I mean, we're talking about
cheating here.

457
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:24,934
Sorry, new girl,
but nobody hit your buzzer.

458
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:29,335
Look, I hate to be predictable,
but I don't give a shit.

459
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:33,375
We learned that routine
fair and square.
We logged the man-hours.

460
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:37,375
Don't punish the squad
for Big Red's mistake.

461
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,896
This isn't about cheating.

462
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:44,175
This is about winning.
Everyone in favor of winning ?

463
00:27:53,576 --> 00:27:56,936
I get what you're saying,
Missy, but there's no time.

464
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,216
If we don't do the routine,
we've got nothing else.

465
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:02,177
So, you in ?

become a cheerleader ?

such fine athletes.

00:47:09,322 --> 00:47:12,123
- Hey. What's the matter ?
- Hey.

748
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:14,123
You don't wanna know.

749
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:18,163
Ah. Cheer crisis.

750
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:23,044
I've just gotten
so bogged down
in all this... crap.

751
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:26,924
Well, if it's crap,
why do you do it ?

752
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:31,205
I don't know.
So quit.

753
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:33,924
Maybe I should.
Yeah, I mean, if you
don't like it anymore.

754
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:36,924
I didn't say that.
Sounds like it.

755
00:47:38,164 --> 00:47:40,004
I don't know what I want.

756
00:47:40,084 --> 00:47:42,925
I remember back
when I cheeredat
my school in Detroit.

757
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:44,885
You cheered
at your other high school ?

758
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:48,205
No, I never cheered,
but I know what
you're going through.

759
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:53,046
And regardless
of all the politics
and the doubts...

760
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,326
and the crap,

761
00:47:55,446 --> 00:47:58,006
you just have to know
that you can do it.

762
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:03,166
And if it helps,

763
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:05,486
I know you can.

764
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:07,886
You do ?

765
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:09,926
Yeah.

766
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,887
All right, all right!
I'm ready to make
a fool of myself.

767
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,607
State regionals,
here we come.

Ready ? Okay!

774
00:49:39,052 --> 00:49:40,892
Some of these uniforms
look so skanky.

775
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,611
Whatever.
They're white trash.
Where do they get them ?

00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,012
Ohh !

Cutter, I'm gonna
kick your ass,
you evil whore !

Get over it, hag !

Oww ! She did not
just hit me !
She's a little kid.

Hi. You, yes.

783
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,293
Your head was down.

784
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:16,773
Your head was down
during that move.

785
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:18,694
How are you gonna
give a proper score...

786
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:21,214
if your head is down
during a move ?

787
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:29,735
Remember, they give
extra points for alacrity
and effulgence.

788
00:50:29,855 --> 00:50:32,015
Did we bring those ?

Oh, no.
Look who's here.

making their first appearance
at the U. C.A. California regionals,

Leading the squad this year
is senior Torrance Shipman.

798
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:19,500
Torrance, one of the things
we've come to expect...

799
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,861
from the Toros over
the last few years is
a highly original routine.

800
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:24,901
Can we expect
the same this year?
Well,

801
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:27,021
I think everyone
goes out there
the same way,

802
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,341
being as prepared
as they can be and
just hoping for the best.

to be back here...

It's the curse.
What ?

815
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:33,866
The Spirit Stick curse.
Will you
lay off with that ?

816
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:36,026
There's no curse,
and you're not
going to Hades.

Go, Toros !

a very big problem.

if you can imagine...
Hey.

848
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:08,794
the incredible sense of deja vu
I experienced as I was watching
that last routine.

849
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:12,274
It tends to make me
suspicious--

Thanks.

858
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:42,076
Obviously your Toros
aren't the only squad with
this particular routine.

859
00:56:42,196 --> 00:56:46,796
Does the name
Sparky Polastri
mean anything to you ?

860
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:48,796
Sparky Polastri ?
Mm-hmm.

861
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:52,397
Apparently he's been peddling
this same routine up and down
the California coast.

862
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,477
Six squads total.

863
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:57,837
We're holding
an emergency session
of the discretionary panel.

864
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:01,038
About what ?
We've never had a situation
like this before.

865
00:57:01,158 --> 00:57:03,917
We really should
disqualify you and--
No, don't punish the squad.

866
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:06,157
It was my choice
to hire Sparky, not theirs.

867
00:57:06,277 --> 00:57:08,357
Don't penalize everyone
for my bad judgment.

868
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:10,717
But since there's
no precedent for this,

869
00:57:10,797 --> 00:57:12,678
there's nothing
in the rule books
that forbids it.

870
00:57:12,758 --> 00:57:14,718
It's simply frowned upon,

871
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:17,318
and I suppose
we can't disqualify you
on those grounds alone.

872
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:19,918
As defending champions,
you are guaranteed
a bid to Florida,

873
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:21,839
but know that we'll
be watching you.

874
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,239
And don't expect
to show up at finals
with that routine.

875
00:57:26,919 --> 00:57:28,999
[Announcer]
Taking the floor now--

876
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,678
What are you doing ?
You're wrecking
everything I built !

877
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:33,919
It's not totally her fault.
I hooked up--

878
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,879
This season should have
been gravy, okay ?

879
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,439
I handpicked the squad,
I delivered
an idiot-proof routine.

880
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,199
- Platter, nationals, hello !
- Don't you mean
a stolen routine ?

881
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:44,920
Oh. Don't be
so naive, Torrance.

882
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,640
Look, the truth is
I was a real leader, okay ?

883
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,720
I did what I had to do
to win at nationals,

884
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,841
and ever since I handed
the reins over to you, you've run
my squad into the ground !

885
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:58,320
If I made any mistake
as a squad leader,
it wasn't borrowing cheers.

886
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,800
It was announcing you
as my successor.

887
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:07,001
Uh-uh. Not cool.

888
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:11,521
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

889
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:14,682
Let me go. I just
wanna get out of here.
Hey, Big Red's a bitch.

890
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:16,842
We all know that.
Even she knows that.

891
00:58:16,962 --> 00:58:19,202
I don't know
what to do here, Aaron.

892
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:23,281
Look. I know I haven't
always been there for you
since I went to college.

893
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:26,202
It's been
a rough transition,
for both of us.

894
00:58:26,282 --> 00:58:29,802
But I still care about you
as much as I ever did.
You know that, right ?

895
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:31,522
You do ?
Of course.

896
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:34,403
Which is why I hate
to see you like this,
all stressed out.

897
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,403
It's not good for you.

898
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:39,403
You're a great cheerleader,
Tor, and you're cute as hell.

899
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:43,963
It's just that maybe--
[Sighs]

900
00:58:47,084 --> 00:58:49,043
Maybe...

901
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:51,083
you're just not
captain material,

902
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:53,323
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

903
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:56,804
Maybe you should consider
letting Courtney and Whitney
take over the squad.

904
00:58:56,924 --> 00:59:00,404
They're just like Big Red.
You want me
to give up captain ?

905
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:02,604
Hey, let them deal
with the politics.

906
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:06,125
You just do
what you do best, Tor.
You cheer.

907
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:09,565
Cheer, Tor. Okay ?

908
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:12,965
I just wanna see you happy.

909
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:28,926
Bye.
Mm.

910
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,846
Mmm.

911
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:37,767
Sleep tight, sweetie.

912
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:54,567
[Sighs]

913
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:00,368
Friend of yours ?

914
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:02,448
He's my boyfriend.

915
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:06,527
Look, Cliff,
I can explain.

916
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,448
No. It's cool.

917
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:16,928
Here, um,
I made you a tape too.

918
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:22,009
Cliff--

919
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:57,130
Hey, Torrance, uh,
it's me, Cliff.

920
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,170
Um, here's, uh--

921
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,731
I wrote something, uh,
for you, so here it is.
[Clears Throat]

922
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:05,371
Oh, Torrance

923
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:08,491
Can't stand
your cheerleading squad

924
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:11,852
But I love
your pom-poms

925
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:16,332
I'd feed you bonbons
all night

926
01:01:16,452 --> 01:01:19,332
One, two, three, four!
[Hard Rock]

927
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:26,052
Yeah, you got me to feel
all those butterflies inside

928
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:28,892
In your locker I would hide
The truth

929
01:01:29,012 --> 01:01:31,253
It's only you I see

930
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,373
And you're just
what I need

931
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,973
I'd bring you flowers
everyday

932
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,613
Just to roll you
in the hay

933
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:41,094
Well, I'm feeling fine
I'm right on time

934
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:44,734
I know I'll get my way

935
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:47,174
And you're just
what I need

936
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:49,493
And you're just
what I need

937
01:01:49,613 --> 01:01:52,294
Not everything
works as it seems

938
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:55,054
Is that so hard
to believe

939
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:56,974
because you're just
what I need

940
01:01:57,054 --> 01:02:00,054
And you're just
what I need

941
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,775
Not everything
works as it seems

942
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:04,735
Is that so hard
to believe

943
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:06,295
Yeah

944
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:14,895
[Sighs]
Aaron called us
last night.

945
01:02:14,975 --> 01:02:17,615
He told us
you're turning
the squad over to us.

946
01:02:17,695 --> 01:02:20,215
Just because you bit
the big one as captain,

947
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:22,656
does not mean
we're gonna be
super hard on you.

948
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,536
Oh.
We'll treat you
as if you...

949
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,456
didn't screw us
into the ground.

950
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,696
Gee, thanks.
Everyone.

951
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:31,376
Torrance is not
to be harmed.

952
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:33,697
We've already decided
on a course of action.

953
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,697
We're gonna forego
nationals this year.

954
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:38,337
- [Sighs]
- [Whitney] Everyone's
already agreed to it.

955
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:39,937
Uh, except me.
And me !

956
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:43,257
- Both of you can be replaced.
- [Torrance]
I can't believe you guys.

957
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:46,937
The only person who can
officially resign the post
of captain is the captain,

958
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,937
and I'm not
going anywhere.

959
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,137
Then we'll have
to overthrow you.
Which we will !

960
01:02:51,257 --> 01:02:52,937
Enough !

961
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:57,138
Our whole cheering career,
we've staked our reputation
on being the best,

962
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:58,978
the most inventive.

963
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:04,139
Now we finally have a chance
to truly be original,
and you're all running scared.

964
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:07,578
[Courtney]
She's crazy.
I am not crazy,

965
01:03:07,698 --> 01:03:09,538
and I'm not resigning
as captain either.

966
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:12,138
- You're gonna have
to kill me first.
- That can be arranged.

967
01:03:12,258 --> 01:03:14,098
Shut it, Whitney !
Let her talk !

968
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:18,579
Look, I know I've screwed up
royally as captain,

969
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:22,019
but I believe in this squad,
and I know we can
bounce back from this.

970
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:26,260
I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be hard work.

971
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,820
We need a new routine,
something amazing and fresh,

972
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,779
and we've got less than
three weeks till nationals,

973
01:03:32,899 --> 01:03:35,780
but if we can do it,
if we can pull this off,

974
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,700
then we can really
call ourselves original.

975
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,500
Now who's with me ?

976
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,220
All right !
Yeah.
Yeah !

977
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:44,140
Yeah !

978
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,781
How about it, girls ?
It's gonna be hard
without you two.

979
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:49,381
[Sighs]
Fine.

980
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,821
Sure.
Whatever.

981
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,341
Okay. Let's do this.

982
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:58,941
[Torrance]
We're gonna devote
every waking hour to practice--

983
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:01,541
before school,
in between classes
and after school.

984
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:04,661
Afternoon practices
will I have to be twice as long.

985
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:08,342
We've gotta do
whatever it takes to be
in perfect physical shape.

986
01:04:08,462 --> 01:04:10,262
Yeah. You can go
a little harder.

987
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:14,582
Yeah, that feels good.
Maybe we should
join the squad.

988
01:04:14,702 --> 01:04:17,103
Push.
Oh, yeah.
Fag !

989
01:04:18,823 --> 01:04:23,223
[Torrance] And since
the football team sucks
no matter how hard we cheer,

990
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:25,222
we'll use night games
to practice too.

991
01:04:25,342 --> 01:04:27,823
But that's not all.

992
01:04:27,943 --> 01:04:30,983
We're gonna study
other types of movement,
from swing dance...

993
01:04:31,103 --> 01:04:34,583
to interpretive dance,
...you grow and you
grow and you bloom !

994
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:37,544
even mime.

995
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,704
We'll draw inspiration
from martial arts,
Hah !

996
01:04:39,824 --> 01:04:42,264
musicals, everything.

997
01:04:44,144 --> 01:04:46,824
You guys know
we've got the talent.

998
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:52,584
We've just gotta work our asses
off and trust our instincts--
all of our instincts.

999
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:59,345
[Loud Rock]
[Aluminum Can
Clattering]

1000
01:05:01,145 --> 01:05:04,505
Tor ! Wha-- Wow !
What are you doing here ?

1001
01:05:04,585 --> 01:05:07,385
Just wanted to
come by and see you.
Is this a bad time ?

1002
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:09,306
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
01:05:09,426 --> 01:05:11,626
I'm super busy.
I'm working
on this project--

1004
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:13,626
Yeah, you sound super busy.

1005
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:17,225
I guess that's it.
You were too busy
to believe in me.

1006
01:05:17,345 --> 01:05:19,146
Oh. No, no, but wait.

1007
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:21,906
You weren't too busy
to sell me out to Courtney
and Whitney, were you ?

1008
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,626
Gee, now I'm confused.

1009
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:28,786
Well, I hope you're not
too busy to hear this.

1010
01:05:28,906 --> 01:05:31,627
Kiss my ass, Aaron !
It's over !

1011
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:35,547
- [Scoffs]
- [Gasps]

1012
01:05:36,787 --> 01:05:38,707
You're a great
cheerleader, Aaron.

1013
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:41,148
It's just that...

1014
01:05:41,268 --> 01:05:43,987
maybe you're not exactly
boyfriend material.

1015
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,427
Bye-bye.

1016
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:50,708
You're a cheerleader ?
[Disgusted Sigh]

1017
01:05:58,948 --> 01:06:03,309
U.C.A. just posted the nationals
list on the Internet.
East Compton isn't on it.

1018
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:05,229
They couldn't raise
the money in time.

1019
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:08,508
- They're not going.
- What do you mean,
"They're not going" ?

1020
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:10,829
Torrance,
that's good news.

1021
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:12,909
They cannot not go.
That's not good news.

1022
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:16,189
What are you talking about ?
They don't go, we win.
Once again we're the best.

1023
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:19,869
I define best as competing
against the best there is
out there and beating them.

1024
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:23,110
- They have to go.
- [Sighs]

1025
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,790
It's so unfair. The first
inner-city squad to get a bid,
and they can't afford to go ?

1026
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:31,030
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning
off into another dimension.
Justin !

1027
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,350
The company gets hit up
for money all the time, honey.
I just can't.

1028
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,990
It's not that much money,
Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

1029
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:39,070
Tell them the deal.
Maybe they'll wanna help.

1030
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,310
Yeah ? Okay,
I'll make the call,

1031
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,231
but they'll probably
say no.

1032
01:06:43,351 --> 01:06:46,431
Don't let them.
Think of how much
it'll mean to East Compton.

1033
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:48,351
They deserve to go.

1034
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,191
Do the right thing, Dad !

1035
01:06:55,032 --> 01:06:57,992
Did that
just happen ?
Yeah.

1036
01:06:58,072 --> 01:07:00,671
"Where we come from,
'cheer' is not a word
we hear very often."

1037
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:03,472
"They should call us
'inspiration leaders'
instead."

1038
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,552
Oh, that's deep.
I like that.

1039
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:07,552
I don't know why
we writing to some
talk-show host.

1040
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,752
It's like we begging
for charity.
It's not charity.

1041
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:11,672
Pauletta Patton's
from our neighborhood.

1042
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:14,633
- She'll understand
why we need the money.
- Tell her we need to buy donuts.

1043
01:07:14,753 --> 01:07:16,953
- Her big butt
will understand that.
