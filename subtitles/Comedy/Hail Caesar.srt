1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,270
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been...

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,992
Uh, 24 hours since my last confession.

3
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,675
Son, it's so late.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,598
Yeah, Father.
Work has just...

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,671
I lied to Connie.
Uh, to my wife.

6
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,434
This is
very serious.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,669
I know.

8
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,919
I promised her
I'd quit smoking.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
She thinks it's bad for me.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,315
And I'm trying, but...

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,908
I snuck a couple
of cigarettes.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,953
Maybe three.

13
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,669
Yes.

14
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,668
It's so hard.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,794
Yes.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,632
But I'm trying.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,156
It is 5:00 a.m.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,511
Still shank of night for some.

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,559
But for Eddie Mannix,
beginning of a new work day.

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,791
The movie studio for which he
works manufactures stories,

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,838
each its own day-lit drama or
moonlit dream.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,029
But the work of Eddie Mannix
cares not for day or night.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,510
And cares little for his rest.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,149
That's right, doll face.
Churn that butter for me.

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Atta girl.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,515
Oh, Jesus Christ
on a scooter!

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,635
You here?

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,510
The studio has the rights
to Gloria's likeness, Falco.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,272
Give me the negatives and
things will go easier on you.

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,759
These are for
private use, Eddie.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,035
Come on.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh, boy.

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,113
Can't a girl take a few pictures,
have a few laughs?

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,272
Jeez, Eddie!
What an old stick in the mud.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,669
Now, you listen to me.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
You were at a party,
had too much to drink.

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,870
Somebody brought you here,
you don't remember who.

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,313
You're going home now.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,356
Your name's
Mary Jo Scheinbrotte.

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,240
- Okay, Eddie.
- So, Eddie Mannix.

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,474
Saw your heap outside.

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,035
Got a call.
Loud, disorderly.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,270
Possible French
postcard situation.

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,754
Someone was
pulling your leg.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,796
Mary Jo here was just
at a costume party.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,552
It's not really
her dirndl.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,880
She wants to contribute
something to your pension fund.

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,799
Sorry to drag you
out in the rain.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,791
Well, say,
no problem at all.

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,719
Aren't you
Gloria DeLamour?

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,949
No, no,
I'm Mary Jo

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,195
something.

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,554
Scheinbrotte.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,919
Say, Brian.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,677
Can I bum a cigarette?

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,959
Ancient Rome.

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,875
Twelve years into the rule
of Tiberius, Ruler Maximus.

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,828
Rome's legions are
masters of the world.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,389
The stomp of its
sandals heard from

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,909
the Iberian
Peninsula in the west,

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,358
through the halls of the great
library of Alexandria in the east.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,512
As oppressed people everywhere
writhe under the Roman lash,

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,515
freeman and vassal are united
in one compulsory worship.

64
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,556
The emperor,
Caesar, is Godhead.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,393
Lord of every man 's
body and spirit.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,192
For those who will not submit,

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,717
the galleys, the arenas,
even crucifixion await.

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,316
But there is a new wind
blowing from the east,

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,516
from the dusty streets
of Bethlehem,

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,275
that will soon challenge
the vast house of Caesar,

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,075
that edifice wrought
of brick and blood

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,958
which now seems so secure.

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Ha!

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,998
There she is, Gracchus.

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,358
Ah, what a beauty.

76
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,830
Aye,
Autolochus. Rome.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,829
Suckled by a she-wolf and
nurturing us, her sons, in turn.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,672
Tonight I bathe in Caracalla

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,754
and wash away the dust
of 300 miles of Frankish road.

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,429
To Rome.

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,189
To Rome!

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,631
Yes, to Rome!

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,150
Glorious center
of Caesar's rule.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,316
But far away in Palestine,
another man is coming home.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,035
Saul, humble
merchant of Tarsus

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,954
is about to be
struck down by a vision.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,793
What thing is this?

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,151
Gloria DeLamour
has been checked into

89
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,430
- Our Lady of Perpetual Rest to dry out.
- Uh-huh.

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,080
You have a 10:00 a.m.
with Monsignor O'Reilly

91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,037
at the Wallace
Beery Conference Room,

92
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,789
and he's bringing
in a Lester Silkwood

93
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,518
from the Legion of
Catholic Decency.

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,076
And we've also invited Patriarch
Vlassos for the Eastern view.

95
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,673
Have they read the script?
Roger.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,910
Let's also invite a rabbi and a
Protestant padre of some sort

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,194
so we can get
everybody's two cents.

98
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Check.

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,873
How's production on Tucumcari?

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,598
Principal is
on schedule,

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,034
but second unit
has been idle

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,633
in Gallup, New Mexico
for four days.

103
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,789
Heavy rain.

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,472
Forecast?
Not good.

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Send an insert truck,

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,993
have them shoot driving
plates for Came the Rain.

107
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,195
Check.

108
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,679
Jonah's Daughter
still behind?

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,910
Yes. Uh, director says
the problem is DeeAnna,

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,439
and she's
getting worse.

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,034
I know what it is.
I'll drop in on her after my 10 o'clock.

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,439
All right,
let's call New York.

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Mr. Schenk's office, line two.

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,349
Hi, Dorothy. Eddie Mannix.
The old man in?

115
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,354
Natalie, I want
the box office

116
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,635
on The Debonaires
and on Blessed Event.

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,076
Can you also...
Yes! Good morning, Mr. Schenk.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,912
Very well.
Thank you.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,196
Proceeding.
You know, proceeding.

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,635
Yeah, Merrily We Dance
starts shooting today.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,119
Beardly Auberon
gave us a draft

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,394
that's extremely classy.

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,039
Joan Van Vechten's
playing Dierdre,

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
but we need a male lead
and we need him now.

125
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,508
No, Jack Hogarth is
drying out at Cedars.

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,239
Metro won't lend us Gable

127
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,840
unless we give them
the Comiskey twins.

128
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,470
Of course not.
I agree.

129
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,631
What?

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,756
Hobie Doyle? Do you
really think so?

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,473
After all,
he's a dust actor.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,915
The man barely
knows how to talk.

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,198
Yes, of course,
Mr. Schenk, I agree,

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,271
but I don't know
if Hobie Doyle

135
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,590
has the poise
in a dinner jacket.

136
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,599
Yes, we do need
someone pronto.

137
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,919
No, I don't,
that's very true.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,911
But let me talk to Laurence Laurentz,
the director.

139
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,593
It could work.
It could work.

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,796
Hobie Doyle is
a very promising idea.

141
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,114
Whitey!

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,393
And cut!

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,788
Great, Hobie.

144
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,713
I can do the
handstand smoother

145
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,313
if you give me
another shot at her.

146
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,313
We got four good ones, Hobie,
and Whitey's tired.

147
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,391
Okay, you're
the boss man.

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,550
If that's lunch, I'm gonna
grab me a plate of beans.

149
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,032
All right, kids,
this is Rome.

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
You're over at this
guy's house for a revel.

151
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,519
And in comes Antoninus.

152
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,636
Lots of energy.

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,476
What are you doing at
the table of viands?

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,433
Huh? You're supposed to be
reclining with the lyre.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,669
I'm sorry,
I was just...

156
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,829
Recline with the lyre.

157
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,350
Don't sit on the
pediment. Recline.

158
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,754
Relaxed, festive.

159
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,672
Extras set?
Set!

160
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,829
Roll sound!

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,955
I got my eye on you.

162
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,598
Roll camera. Fountain!

163
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,197
Hail, Caesar!
Ten-apple, take 10.

164
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,278
And action!

165
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,233
Autolochus!

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,312
I had heard rumors
of your return to Rome.

167
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,435
More than rumors, noble Sestimus.

168
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,319
I see that you are the same
worshipper of Bacchus.

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,754
What gaiety.

170
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,031
There is still
truth in the adage

171
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,633
"What pleasures
cannot be found

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,239
"in the villa of
Sestimus Amydias

173
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,549
"cannot be
found in Rome!"

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,515
But seriously,

175
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,949
there is talk the Senate will
send our legions out again,

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,953
and this time not on
a short march to Gaul.

177
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,354
What truth to these
mutterings, Sestimus?

178
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,478
The matter has been
taken up in the Senate.

179
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,276
It seems that there
is unrest in Palestine.

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Palestine?

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That backwater!

182
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,432
They'll hardly be
sending the sixth legion

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,751
to that godforsaken
patch of desert!

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,954
Palestine!

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,199
Palestine!

186
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Ah.

187
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,712
Holding for
a dissolve...

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,758
Still laughing...

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,518
Holding...

190
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
And cut!

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,119
Fine, boys.
That was just fine.

192
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,469
Was I okay?
Was I all right?

193
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
That's a cut!

194
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,948
We're gonna
move on to the brazier scene.

195
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,031
Was I all right with the "mutterings"?
It felt a little...

196
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,434
No, no, no, no,
it's fine.

197
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,158
Moving on,
brazier scene, 20 minutes.

198
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,434
Popping over
to the trailer.

199
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,669
Okay. In the
brazier scene,

200
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,035
they changed
"passion" to "ardor."

201
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,998
What? Why?
I liked "passion."

202
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,389
It's strong.
It's passion!

203
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,672
"Such is my greeting after
three months' sojourn in Gaul?

204
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,833
"Not so, Ursulina."

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,158
"My ardor...

206
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,988
"My ardor is yet as warm

207
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,355
"as the embers
of this brazier.

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,078
"Embers
of this brazier."

209
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,508
We're ready for you,
Mr. Whitlock!

210
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,670
"Not so,
Sperm-ulina."

211
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,760
Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,632
I know you have parishes,
flocks and temples

213
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,518
making enormous
demands on your time.

214
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,795
But I'm sure you
appreciate also

215
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,359
that great masses
of humanity

216
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,273
look to pictures for
information and uplift

217
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,556
and, yes, entertainment.

218
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,110
Now, here at Capitol Pictures,
as you know,

219
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,795
an army of technicians and actors
and top-notch artistic people

220
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,191
are working hard to bring to the
screen the story of the Christ.

221
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,719
It's a swell story.

222
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,472
A story told before, yes,

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,755
but we like to
flatter ourselves

224
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,875
that it's never been told

225
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,917
with this kind of
distinction and panache.

226
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,390
Perhaps, sir, you forget its
telling in the Holy Bible.

227
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,028
Quite right, Patriarch.
The Bible, of course, is terrific.

228
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,712
But for
millions of people,

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,758
pictures will be their
reference point for the story.

230
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,236
The story's embodiment,
the story's, uh...

231
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,073
Realization.

232
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,311
You "realize," of course,
that for we Jews,

233
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,234
any visual depiction of the Godhead
is most strictly prohibited.

234
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Oh.

235
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,756
But, of course, for us, the man
Jesus Nazarene is not God.

236
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
A-ha!

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,753
Who plays Christ?

238
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,638
Oh, a kid we're all
very excited about.

239
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,835
Todd Hocheiser.

240
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,469
Wonderful young actor we found in Akron,
Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt.

241
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,551
But Hocheiser is
seen only fleetingly

242
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,198
and with extreme taste.

243
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,511
Our story is told through the
eyes of a Roman tribune.

244
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,750
Autolochus Antoninus.

245
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,269
Ordinary man,
skeptical at first,

246
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,112
but who comes to
a grudging respect

247
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,952
for this swell
figure from the East.

248
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,635
And Autolochus
is played by

249
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,952
Baird Whitlock.

250
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Oh, my.

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,434
Well, he is certainly
a great talent.

252
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
Now, Hail, Caesar!
Is a prestige picture,

253
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,799
our biggest
release of the year,

254
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,235
and we're devoting huge
resources to its production

255
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,594
in order to
make it first-class

256
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,715
in every respect.

257
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,189
Gentlemen, given
its enormous expense,

258
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,311
we don't wanna send it to
market except in the certainty

259
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,914
that it will not offend
any reasonable American

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,389
regardless of faith or creed.

261
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,789
Now that's where you come in.
You've read the script.

262
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
I wanna know if the theological
elements of the story

263
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
are up to snuff.

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,310
I thought the
chariot scene was fakey.

265
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
How is he going to jump from
one chariot to the other

266
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,312
going full speed?

267
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Uh-huh.

268
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,796
Well, we can look at that.

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,913
But as for the
religious aspect,

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,594
does the depiction of Christ
Jesus cut the mustard?

271
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,151
Well, the nature of Christ
is not quite as simple

272
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,719
as your photoplay
would have it.

273
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,915
How so, Father?

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,231
It's not the case simply
that Christ is God, or God Christ.

275
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,509
You can say
that again.

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,033
The Nazarene
was not God.

277
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,349
He was not not-God.

278
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,600
He was a man.
Part God.

279
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,749
No, sir.

280
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,831
But, Rabbi, all of us have a
little bit of God in us, don't we?

281
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Well...

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,752
It's the foundation
of our belief

283
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,674
that Christ is most properly
referred to as the Son of God.

284
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,515
It's the Son of God who takes the
sins of the world upon himself

285
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,955
so that the rest of God's children,
we imperfect beings,

286
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,430
through faith, may enter
the Kingdom of heaven.

287
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,188
- So God is split?
- Yes.

288
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,029
And no.

289
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,678
There is unity in division.

290
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,113
And division
in unity.

291
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,554
I'm not sure
I follow, Padre.

292
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
Young man, you don't follow
for a very simple reason.

293
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,109
These men
are screwballs.

294
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,271
God has children?
What, and a dog?

295
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,028
A collie, maybe?

296
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,314
God doesn't
have children.

297
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,118
He's a bachelor.
And very angry.

298
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,320
No, no, he used
to be angry.

299
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
What?
He got over it?

300
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,920
You worship the God
of another age.

301
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,229
Who has no love.

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,879
Not true.
He likes Jews.

303
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,149
God loves everyone.

304
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,355
God is love!

305
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,195
God is who he is.

306
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,032
This is special?
Who isn't who is?

307
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,078
But how should God be
rendered in a motion picture?

308
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,559
God isn't in the
motion picture!

309
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,073
Then who is
Todd Hocheiser?

310
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,754
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off
more than we can chew.

311
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,150
We don't need to agree on
the nature of the deity here,

312
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,995
if we could focus on the Christ,
whatever his parentage.

313
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,391
My question is,
is our depiction fair?

314
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,794
I have seen worse.

315
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,915
Reverend?

316
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,958
There is nothing to
offend a reasonable man.

317
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,075
Father.

318
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,958
The motion picture
teleplay was respectful

319
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,873
and exhibited
tastefulness and class.

320
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,678
Who made you an expert
all of a sudden?

321
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,112
And what do
you think, Rabbi?

322
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Eh...

323
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,437
I haven't
an opinion.

324
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,393
How did we do?
I don't...

325
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,959
Fine. What's up?

326
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,031
Can't find
Baird Whitlock.

327
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,235
He left the set
over an hour ago,

328
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,958
said he was going
to his dressing room,

329
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,189
but he isn't there.

330
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,350
Out on a bender? Middle of the day?
Am I crazy?

331
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,192
You're not crazy,
but, no.

332
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,716
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's,
Rusty Scupper. No soap.

333
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,279
Home, maybe? Called his wife?
Yep.

334
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
What did Laura say?

335
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,800
"He's not home,
he's never home.

336
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,233
"He's a louse.
Try one of his chippies."

337
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,753
Called that script girl,
what's her name, Francie?

338
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,875
Uh, check.

339
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,995
Any of the gals
missing from the set?

340
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Nope.

341
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,118
All right, gone an hour?
We won't worry yet.

342
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,435
Hobie?

343
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,031
The studio says
you're finished here,

344
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,838
and you're to report
back to the lot.

345
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,995
How come?

346
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,513
They're changing
your image.

347
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,715
Okay.

348
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,275
And the studio says you're
escorting Carlotta Valdez

349
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,759
to your premiere tonight.

350
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,913
How come?
I don't know her.

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,798
The studio's arranging it.
They're changing your image.

352
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,114
Damn it!

353
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,951
You have gas
again, ma'am?

354
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,236
Ma'am? Miss.
Do I look married?

355
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,516
No, miss.
No! Yeah, "Gas again."

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,399
Ask him. He knows.

357
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,913
All right. Scram.

358
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,193
How are you,
DeeAnna?

359
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,990
How am I? Wet.

360
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,480
I don't think I'm gonna fit in
that fish-ass after this week.

361
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,596
Oh, we should have the water
ballet in the can after tomorrow.

362
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,795
In the nightclub scene,

363
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,440
wardrobe will have a gown for
you that's more forgiving.

364
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,000
Any more thoughts about
who you might marry?

365
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,957
I ain't doing that again.
I had two marriages.

366
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,315
It just cost the studio a lot
of money to bust them up.

367
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,674
Well, we had to
have those annulled.

368
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,000
One was to
a minor mob figure...

369
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,798
Vince was not minor.

370
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,949
And Buddy Flynn
was a bandleader

371
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,837
with a long history
of narcotic use.

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,797
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They were both louses.

373
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,916
Marrying a third louse
ain't gonna do me no good.

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,160
We've offered you some very
suitable, clean young men.

375
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,918
Pretty boys,
saps and swishes!

376
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,195
What, you think if there
wasn't a good, reliable man,

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,360
I wouldn't have
grabbed him?

378
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,556
What about Arne Seslum?
He is the father, isn't he?

379
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,909
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,877
The marriage doesn't
have to last forever.

381
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,837
But, DeeAnna,
having a child without a father

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
would present a public-relations
problem for the studio.

383
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,310
The aquatic pictures
do very nicely for us.

384
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,519
So you go and strap on a
fish-ass and marry Arne Seslum.

385
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,233
The pictures do well
for all of us,

386
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,799
and it's a tribute to you.

387
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,314
The public loves you because
they know how innocent you are.

388
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,113
That's true.

389
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,679
Let me see if Arne
is open to matrimony.

390
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
You're sure he's the father?

391
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,639
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely,
he's the father, yes!

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,069
Pretty sure.

393
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,678
Hey, Maxie,
bring me my ass back.

394
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,039
Hey, hey, buddy,
come here!

395
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,435
How you doing, Hobie?

396
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,794
Hello there, Scotty.

397
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,598
They got you
shooting on the lot?

398
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,154
Uh, well, Mr. Mannix
pulled me off the western.

399
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,390
Says I'm doing
a movie on a sound stage.

400
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,675
They built a drawing room.

401
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
He's here.

402
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,234
Oh, my dear boy.
Welcome.

403
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,198
Laurence Laurentz.

404
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,079
And you look wonderful, wonderful.
How do you feel?

405
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,512
Uh, well, this here
collar is a little tight.

406
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,591
No, no, no.
It's nicely fit, looks a marvel.

407
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,557
Oh.
Just takes a little getting used to.

408
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,755
Now, Hobie,
here is our set.

409
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,559
And, in fact, that's right, yes,
you enter from there,

410
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,995
having just seen
Biff's valise in the foyer,

411
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,749
in spite of Allegra's claim that
he hasn't been to the house.

412
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,916
I'm sweet on Allegra.
Indeed you are.

413
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,354
But I seen
Biff's grip.

414
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,668
Indeed you have.

415
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,110
And so here we
find you, Hobie...

416
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,555
We find you haunted
by unspoken suspicions.

417
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,273
Haunted.
By Biff's grip.

418
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,317
By his
valise, yes.

419
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,711
But here is Dierdre

420
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,791
harboring deep
feelings for you,

421
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,199
and sensing opportunity.

422
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,634
Dierdre.
Dierdre, yes.

423
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,109
So at her importuning,
you join her on the couch

424
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,350
and conversation ensues.

425
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Um...

426
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,194
So, she's gonna
importune, Mr. Laurence?

427
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,429
Laurentz.

428
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,794
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,916
She's gonna importune,
Mr. Laurentz?

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,718
Is that something
I should be concerned about?

431
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,028
No, she'll simply
ask you to join her

432
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,354
on the couch,
is all I mean to say,

433
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,429
and then conversation ensues.

434
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Okay. Okay.
I gotcha.

435
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,440
Very good, very good.
Let's try one, shall we?

436
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,953
Sure.
I'll give it a go.

437
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,712
Wonderful, splendid.

438
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,150
Now, the only thing
I would suggest is,

439
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,353
before your first line,
you respond to her line

440
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,477
with a
mirthless chuckle.

441
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,109
A mirthless chuckle.

442
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,960
Yes, I think given your
unspoken suspicions

443
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,553
about Allegra,

444
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,553
a mirthless chuckle.

445
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,756
Uh-huh. Okay, Mr. Laurence,
I'll give it a shot.

446
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,989
Laurentz.

447
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,469
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Laurentz.

448
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,675
I'll give it a shot.

449
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,040
Merrily We Dance.
27-apple, take one.

450
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,308
Action.

451
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Oh, Monty.

452
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,872
Come join me
on the divan.

453
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,553
It seems
Allegra's a no-show,

454
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,312
which is simply a bore.

455
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,391
But I'll partner
you in bridge.

456
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,993
Why the pout?

457
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Ha!

458
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,156
Would that it were so simple.

459
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,549
Uh, cut.

460
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,280
That's a cut. Back to one.

461
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,238
Very good.
Wonderful, in fact.

462
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,917
But, um, let's try it
a little differently this time.

463
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,149
Sure.
Let's try...

464
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,952
Let's see, first of all,
why don't we

465
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,758
dispense with
the mirthless chuckle?

466
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,353
No mirthless chuckle.

467
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,672
No, no need, really. It was a bad idea.
It was bad directorial.

468
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,432
My fault
overthinking the thing.

469
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,477
If you say so,
but I'm happy to do another,

470
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,754
maybe try her
one more time.

471
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,400
I mean, if you want that chuckle,
I sure wanna give her to you.

472
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,476
No, no, no. Completely unnecessary
under the circumstances.

473
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,073
I think the audience can,
to that extent,

474
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,240
they can read
your thoughts,

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,675
and they will assume
your mirthlessness.

476
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,440
Okay, you're the boss man,
Mr. Laurence.

477
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,555
Laurentz.

478
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,593
Oh, gosh.
I am so sorry, Mr. Laurentz.

479
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,518
Also, this time,
let's try actually

480
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,596
looking at Dierdre
as we speak.

481
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,637
Looking into her eyes
and speaking our line

482
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,597
with a certain
ruefulness.

483
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,279
Ruefulness, okay.

484
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,596
Yes. Because it's
not so simple, you see.

485
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,557
Not so simple
as she suggests.

486
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,869
Okay.

487
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,108
Your feelings
are not so simple.

488
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,992
No, sir. Okay.

489
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,515
Roll camera.

490
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,511
Merrily We Dance.
27-apple, take two.

491
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,391
Action.

492
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,989
Oh, Monty.

493
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,510
Come join me
on the divan.

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,392
Seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

495
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,437
But I'll partner
you in bridge.

496
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,999
Why the pout?

497
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,388
Would that
it were so simple.

498
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,469
Cut.

499
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,912
Very good,
very good.

500
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,591
Um...

501
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,709
Come, come.

502
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,628
All right.

503
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,192
All right,
let's try this.

504
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,398
Your line, just say it
as I say it.

505
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,591
Say your line exactly
as I'm about to.

506
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,034
Just as
I'm about to do.

507
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,553
Sure, okay.

508
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,118
Would that it
were so simple.

509
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Um...

510
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,678
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

511
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,193
Would that it
were so simple.

512
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,157
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

513
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,355
My dear boy,
why do you say that?

514
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,668
Why do you say "twuuuuuuh"?

515
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,071
You said, "Say it like I said it."
Yes.

516
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,196
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

517
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
Would that it
were so simple.

518
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,272
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

519
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,112
Would that it...
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple?

520
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,360
No, no, watch my mouth.
Would that it were so simple.

521
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,469
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

522
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,232
Keep your head still.
Would that it were so simple.

523
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,515
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

524
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,869
Would that it
were so simple.

525
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,792
I'm trying to
say that, Mr. Laurentz.

526
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,915
Laurence. Mmm.

527
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
I thought...

528
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,712
A minute ago
it was Laurentz.

529
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,472
No, we can use Christian names,
my good dear boy.

530
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,320
Laurence is fine,
just as I call you Hobie.

531
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,435
Okay.

532
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,158
So, would that
it were so simple.

533
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,440
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so...

534
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,750
Keep your hand down, now!
Would that it were so simple. Trippingly.

535
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Would that ih twuuuuuuh
so simple. Trippingly.

536
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,518
No, don't say "trippingly,"
say the line trippingly.

537
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,360
Would that ih twuuuuuuh...
Would that it...

538
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,429
Would that it
were so simple.

539
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,509
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

540
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,589
Would that it
were so simple.

541
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,669
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

542
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,749
Would that it
were so simple.

543
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,875
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

544
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,915
Would that it
were so simple.

545
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,951
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.
Rueful, rueful, rueful.

546
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,268
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.
Rueful.

547
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,509
Would that it
were so simple.

548
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,868
Rueful "simple."
Would that ih twuuuuuuh...

549
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,479
Soulful "simple."
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

550
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,159
Or soulful.
You could say soulful.

551
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,958
Rueful, soulful.
Would that it were so simple.

552
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,553
Would that ih
twuuuuuuh so simple.

553
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,709
What are you
doing this for?

554
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,920
Would that
ih twuuuuuuh so...

555
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,837
Your hands!
Just keep still!

556
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,438
Stall?
For how long?

557
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,475
What do I
tell the director?

558
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
That we're
looking for him.

559
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,034
But we don't want it
in the gossip columns.

560
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,599
Baird on a bender,
in a love nest,

561
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,040
or wherever we
end up finding him.

562
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,634
And as far as the set is concerned,
it's business as usual.

563
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,712
Tell the ADs Baird is out briefly
with a high ankle sprain.

564
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,400
Fine, but what do
we shoot without him?

565
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,160
We got the brazier
scene up this afternoon.

566
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,753
Could you get through it
shooting around him?

567
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,520
Maybe use his stunt double,
Chunk Mulligan?

568
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,314
Chunk can't act.

569
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,038
Get the writer to
trim his speeches.

570
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,355
Well, maybe,
but then what do we do?

571
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,919
All we got left
is the final scene.

572
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,514
Autolochus' speech
at the feet of the penitent thief.

573
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,394
It's the emotional climax
of the entire picture.

574
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,950
We gotta see Autolochus has
absorbed the message of the Christ.

575
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,189
Yeah, I can see that.

576
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,032
We need Baird's
star power, his charisma.

577
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,394
Sure, his emotional, uh...

578
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,391
This can't be faked!
It's the heart and soul of the picture.

579
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,516
I understand.
End of the film!

580
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,354
We can't just give
the speech to some...

581
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,999
Some

582
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,433
Roman schmo!

583
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
No, no. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I got it.

584
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,196
But his benders can
last a day or two.

585
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,513
What does it cost
to shut down?

586
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Plenty. You know how
big this picture is?

587
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,151
We're on Stages 5 and 14.

588
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,515
If we're carrying everybody
in the final scene

589
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,953
who's up on crucifixes

590
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,237
that's $3.40 an hour hardship pay,
eight hour minimum.

591
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,549
Yeah.
Plus we lose...

592
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,073
Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry... Not now.

593
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,634
We lose Todd Hocheiser to Fox
at the end of the week.

594
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,709
We should have
made him exclusive.

595
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Who knew?

596
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,120
I'm sorry, sir.
Not now!

597
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,879
It's Mr. Laurentz.
I can't stop him!

598
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,918
- Mannix, I won't have it!
- No! No!

599
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,309
For two decades the words
"Laurence Laurentz Presents"

600
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,469
have meant something
to the public.

601
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,676
It's all right, Natalie.
Okay, Walt, let me know.

602
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,350
What's on your
mind, Laurence?

603
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,476
Hobie Doyle cannot act!

604
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,558
Hobart Doyle is
one of the biggest

605
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,993
movie stars in the world.

606
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,229
On horseback.

607
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,992
But this is a drama,
Mannix, a real drama.

608
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,912
It's an adaptation
of a Broadway smash!

609
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,275
It requires the skills
of a trained thespian,

610
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,198
not a rodeo clown!

611
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,628
I begged you for Lunt!

612
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,677
Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry,
but you wanted me to make sure

613
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,910
you didn't miss your lunch
at the Imperial Gardens.

614
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,354
You never told me who with.

615
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,589
Nuts.

616
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,636
Look, no one
wants to see Lunt.

617
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,075
We're not recasting.
This came from Mr. Schenk himself.

618
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,196
It's Hobie Doyle.
Is the boy game?

619
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,590
No, he's game.
And gamey!

620
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,720
Well, if he needs help,
it's your job to help him.

621
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,115
I'll have a talk with Hobie and
take a look at what you've shot,

622
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,157
but right now
I've got a lunch.

623
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,992
"Truth to these
mutterings, Sestimus."

624
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,468
Quiet, Engels!

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,911
How pleasant to
see you, Mr. Mannix.

626
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,718
Your table is
right over here.

627
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,279
Thank you, Arthur.

628
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,953
How you doing, Mannix?

629
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,439
Mr. Cuddahy.

630
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,319
They mix a hell of a Mai Tai.
I like this place.

631
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,631
Sorry to keep you hanging.
It's a tough decision.

632
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,395
Nothing to apologize for. We said the
deal was on the table for a week.

633
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Oh.

634
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,629
Go ahead.

635
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,671
No, I'm
trying to quit.

636
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,674
I just wanted
to visit again

637
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,591
to see if there was some
impediment we could help with,

638
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,273
or if something in
the offer isn't clear?

639
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,396
No, the offer's very clear.
And very generous.

640
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,755
We want to make it easy
for you to say yes.

641
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,092
Look, Mannix, we need a guy with
your talents in management,

642
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,673
problem-solving.

643
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,876
And you need to
think about the future.

644
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,758
Lockheed is booming.

645
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,120
Everyone's
riding in airplanes,

646
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,111
and we're moving
into jet airplanes.

647
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,669
It's a new age, Mannix,
and we're part of it.

648
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,798
The industry you're in,
what's the future there?

649
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,116
What happens when everybody
owns a television set?

650
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,111
Will they still be going
to pictures every week?

651
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,840
Well, we like to
think that families...

652
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,154
I don't mean to denigrate.

653
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,834
I'm sure the picture business
is pretty damned interesting.

654
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,072
But it's also pretty
frivolous, isn't it?

655
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,319
Aviation is serious.
Serious business, serious people.

656
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,358
You won't be babysitting a
lot of oddballs and misfits,

657
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,280
shouldering a lot of
crackpot problems for...

658
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,038
We have some
kooks, sure, but...

659
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,839
Of course they're kooks!
It's all make-believe.

660
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,229
I told myself
I wasn't gonna

661
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,151
badmouth the competition,
and look at me.

662
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,788
Sorry, Mannix.
I'll stick with what we're about.

663
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,188
Let me show
you something.

664
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,751
Ever heard of
the Bikini Atoll?

665
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,955
No.

666
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,835
Test site.

667
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,479
Just couple of rocks in the
middle of the Pacific,

668
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,312
until a few weeks ago,

669
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,198
when we blew
the H-erino.

670
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,273
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

671
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,072
It's the real world.

672
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,508
Hydrogen bomb.

673
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,879
Fusion device.

674
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,708
Armageddon.

675
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,840
And Lockheed was there.
We had a...

676
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,199
Call for you,
Mr. Mannix.

677
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Oh, thank you.

678
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,235
Hello?

679
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,599
Yeah, he has it now?

680
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,750
No, have him stay on set,
I'll go to him.

681
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,510
Sorry, Cuddahy,
work emergency.

682
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,750
Still do work there,
for the day anyway.

683
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,309
You make a good case.
I'll let you know.

684
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Uh...

685
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,393
You one of the
Hollywood people?

686
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,119
Maybe.

687
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,868
They're in there.

688
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,553
Please, enter.
All are welcome.

689
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,914
Those things
are a nuisance.

690
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,189
Thank you.

691
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,670
We'll have sandwiches
in a minute.

692
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,636
Tea?

693
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,157
Uh, okay.

694
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,197
Yeah.
And, uh...

695
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,669
And what's going on?

696
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,875
Yeah.

697
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,712
Well, we've just
read the minutes.

698
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,871
And Alan was about to
bring up new business.

699
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,711
Well, I missed
the minutes.

700
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,394
I wouldn't
worry about it.

701
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,630
They're usually
pretty boring.

702
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,677
What kind of
a meeting is this?

703
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,319
Well,
it's not a meeting

704
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,993
so much as a...

705
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,912
It's, uh, more of
a study group.

706
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,513
And you're studying?

707
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,399
All sorts of jolly stuff.

708
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,152
History.
Economics.

709
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,753
Same thing,
isn't it?

710
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,150
History, economics.

711
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,753
Don't you agree?

712
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,198
I'm not really
a student of history.

713
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Quiet, Engels!

714
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Thank you.

715
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,757
Man is split?

716
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,433
Well, Man's functions
are split.

717
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,149
There's the little guy, the regular
Joe who works for a living.

718
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,549
He's the body,
body politic.

719
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,075
Then there's the brain,
the boss, the owner.

720
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,559
The boss is
not the brain.

721
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,233
No, no!
The boss is parasite!

722
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,116
Well, it's true that the
boss doesn't work, but he has a function.

723
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,599
He controls the means of...

724
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,598
Production. Sure,
but that's not a function, that's...

725
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,796
Parasitism!
On the... Shut up!

726
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,793
- On the body politic. Of the regular Joe!
- Shut up!

727
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,313
Man is unitary.

728
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,869
A simple economic agent.

729
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,474
Man's institutions
are split,

730
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,155
expressing contradictions
that must be worked through.

731
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,237
And they are worked through in
a causative, predictable way.

732
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,151
History is science.

733
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,632
This is the essence of the dialectic.

734
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,277
You see, if you
understand economics,

735
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,233
you can actually write down
what will happen in the future.

736
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,233
With as much confidence as you write
down the history of the past.

737
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,756
Because it's science.
It's not make believe.

738
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,831
We don't believe
in Santa Claus.

739
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,593
Another finger sandwich?

740
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,479
Thank you. Now if I follow this
correctly...

741
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Who's that guy?

742
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,114
Uh, Mr. Smitrovich takes
pictures for our newsletter.

743
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,317
Our understanding of the
true workings of history

744
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,233
gives us access to
the levers of power.

745
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,950
Your studio, for instance,
is a pure instrument of capitalism.

746
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,875
As such, it expresses the
contradictions of capitalism

747
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,717
and can be enlisted to
finance its own destruction.

748
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,428
Which is exciting.

749
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,871
It can be made to help the
little guy, the regular Joe.

750
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,553
The body politic!
Shut up!

751
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,188
Even though its purpose
is to exploit the little guy.

752
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,719
And
the body politic.

753
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,520
You're for the little guy?

754
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,318
For the little guy or against,
it doesn't matter.

755
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,913
History will be
what it will be,

756
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,035
and we already
know what it'll be.

757
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,673
But yes, we're
for the little guy.

758
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,558
Aren't you?
Shut up!

759
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,188
Are you joking?
Me, for the little guy?

760
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
Of course I'm for
the little guy.

761
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,238
What, is this guy
a comedian?

762
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,390
Listen, I better get back.
The studio's gotta be going nuts.

763
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,152
Can we cut it off now and
pick it up right here

764
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,435
at the next
study session?

765
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,070
Okay, well, see...

766
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,676
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

767
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,436
And so, Baird Whitlock found
himself in the hands of communists.

768
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,434
Meanwhile, far from
the crashing surf of Malibu,

769
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,593
Eddie Mannix, torn from his lunch
with a Lockheed man,

770
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,832
hurries back to the vastness
of Capitol Pictures,

771
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,600
whose tireless
machinery clanks on,

772
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,354
producing this year's
ration of dreams

773
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,119
for all the weary
peoples of the world.

774
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,078
Hey, numbskull. Didn't you
see the rolling light was on?

775
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,800
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix.
Can I help you find someone?

776
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,109
No.

777
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,792
- Autolochus!
- Yes?

778
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,916
Why do you present yourself in my
chambers in such humble fashion?

779
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,275
Do not look
upon me, Ursulina.

780
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,357
The fires of the
brazier of Sestimus

781
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,476
have latterly
burned my face!

782
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,920
Though the unguents
of Arkimideus

783
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,150
promise shortly
to undo the damage.

784
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,392
Autolochus, you know
that my love is for you,

785
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,549
not for your station.

786
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,157
And my ardor for you...

787
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,117
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

788
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,478
"We are the Future."

789
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,549
What does
that mean?

790
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,909
Beats me.

791
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,920
Somebody slipped
it under my door

792
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,672
sometime after we
broke this morning.

793
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,068
Mention it
to anyone?

794
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,229
Nope.

795
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,151
Okay, well, let's
keep it that way.

796
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,751
Hey, by the way,
Chunk sounded good in there.

797
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,514
Natalie, could you please get
me Stu Schwartz, Accounting?

798
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,830
Stu Schwartz on two.

799
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,638
Stu, how are ya?
I need some petty cash.

800
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,199
$100,000.

801
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,839
I'm sorry,
did I say petty?

802
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,837
Well, it's a long story,
and I'll tell it to you some time.

803
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,678
You have that much
in the office?

804
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,950
Yeah, how much space
will that take up?

805
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,235
Uh, Mr. Mannix?

806
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,514
All right,
this might do it.

807
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,032
Uh, Thora Thacker
just came in.

808
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,519
Wonders if you
have a moment.

809
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,636
Thora Thacker.

810
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,199
Tell her I'm
stuck on a call.

811
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,998
I'll leave
through the patio.

812
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,077
Call didn't take
so long then.

813
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,151
Yes. No.
Fast talkers.

814
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,554
What can I
do for you, Thora?

815
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,948
Well, I'll be
fast, too.

816
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,837
I only wanted to
notify you as a courtesy

817
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,229
that I am running my
Baird Whitlock story.

818
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,628
Yeah?
What's the story?

819
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,076
The story. I have a credible
source and I am going to run it,

820
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,798
and I think you know
what story I mean.

821
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,115
I have no idea.

822
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,111
There's nothing going on with Baird.
I would know, wouldn't I?

823
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,428
Don't play dumb, Eddie.

824
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,794
I am talking about

825
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,070
On Wings as Eagles.

826
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,109
What?

827
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,349
Running it tomorrow.

828
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,388
First of all...

829
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,597
First of all, there's
nothing to that story.

830
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,908
I've heard it,
it's been around forever,

831
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,228
and it's never
been confirmed.

832
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,753
And secondly,
you can't print that.

833
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,353
Even if you could print it,
you couldn't print it.

834
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,993
And you wouldn't want to, Thora.
It's beneath you.

835
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,513
The facts are
never beneath me.

836
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,910
People don't want the facts,
they wanna believe!

837
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,674
That's our great industry,
mine and yours, too.

838
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,954
They wanna believe
that Baird Whitlock

839
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,758
is a great star
and a good man.

840
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,989
You're admitting he isn't.

841
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,190
No, I'm saying he is,
though it's beside the point.

842
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,237
There's nothing to it,
nothing to the gossip.

843
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,516
I am not
a gossip columnist!

844
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,795
No, no, no,
of course not.

845
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,717
Don't confuse me
with my sister!

846
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,275
Hardly. But look, do you
have to run it tomorrow?

847
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,999
It's my entire column.

848
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,600
I'm happy to talk
to Baird for comment,

849
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,120
but it will have to
be this afternoon.

850
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,793
Baird's unavailable
right now. Wait one day.

851
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Ha!

852
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,473
Thora, wait one
day and I'll give you

853
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,272
a true story for
tomorrow's column.

854
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,271
A little something

855
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,799
about Hobie Doyle.

856
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,313
My readers don't
care about Hobie Doyle.

857
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,475
He wears chaps!

858
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,789
Do they care about
Carlotta Valdez?

859
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,000
They're sweet on each other.

860
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,400
You should see the two of them together.
Like peas in a pod.

861
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,036
Trade the story of my career for
a puff piece on Hobie Doyle?

862
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,553
I don't think so.

863
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,073
You're not trading anything,
you're waiting one day

864
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,599
on a story
that's years old.

865
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,432
Wait one day.
I can let you talk to Baird,

866
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,589
show you your
story's the bunk.

867
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,148
If I'm wrong, no skin off your nose.
You run the column.

868
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,760
In the meantime,
you have an exclusive.

869
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,951
No one else knows
about Hobie and Carlotta.

870
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,838
No kidding.
You're it.

871
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,233
What kind of name
is Thora, anyway?

872
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,754
It's a name that 19
million readers trust.

873
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,478
Don't play games
with them, Eddie.

874
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,557
Oh, nobody's
playing games here.

875
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,833
Is that big enough?

876
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,310
Hello, Eddie.
I'm notifying you as a courtesy

877
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,237
before I run
tomorrow's story.

878
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,510
Thessaly? Yeah,
I just saw your...

879
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,671
Ah, never mind. How you doing?
What's the story?

880
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,193
It's about
Baird Whitlock.

881
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,561
There's absolutely no truth to
that old story, believe me.

882
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,834
Old?
Old, stale, rotten and...

883
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,831
I'm talking about today.

884
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,239
What?

885
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,959
A little bird told me that he
disappeared from the set today.

886
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,598
Oh, that! No, no.

887
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,273
Yes, he did
have to take a break.

888
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,839
Minor injury.
High ankle sprain.

889
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,069
What did you
think I meant?

890
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,878
No, nothing. I saw
your sister earlier.

891
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,871
She was trying to resurrect
some old gossip about Baird.

892
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,110
Oh, I'm sure
she was, that cow!

893
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,640
She wouldn't know a news story
if it bit her on the posterior.

894
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,200
Yeah, well, she's...
High ankle sprain?

895
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,120
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

896
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,953
We all know about the womanizing
and the drinking jags

897
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,473
and those trips
to San Berdoo.

898
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,629
Baird is a
good family man.

899
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,870
He has a high ankle sprain.

900
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,314
Mr. Mannix?

901
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,549
What's up, Peanut?

902
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,710
Natalie told me
to find you PDQ.

903
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,029
I know it sounds screwy,
but she said

904
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,553
someone's calling
from the future.

905
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,629
Good Lord! Thessaly,
I have to run.

906
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,234
If you do know where Baird is,
you must let me talk to him.

907
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,311
Sure. I'll find out where
he is right away, Thessaly,

908
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,515
and I'm sure...

909
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,398
Say, what kind of
name is Thessaly, anyway?

910
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,551
It's a name that 20
million readers trust.

911
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,233
They want the truth, Eddie.

912
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,516
The truth, yes.
Mmm-hmm.

913
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,276
We're gonna
give it to them.

914
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,149
On three.
And Hobie Doyle is in there.

915
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,992
- Hey.
- Hello, Mr. Mannix.

916
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,390
Thanks for
coming, Hobie. One second.

917
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,080
Hello, Mannix...

918
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,073
Damn.

919
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,072
Hung up, Natalie.
Tell me the second they call back.

920
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,589
Yes, sir.

921
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,988
What's going
on there, Mr. Mannix?

922
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,991
Looks like you're
expecting rain.

923
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,758
No, it's nothing.

924
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,433
How's the first
day on the picture?

925
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,112
You getting comfortable?

926
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,120
Oh, I guess it's
going pretty good.

927
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,198
Uh, that Mr. Laurentz,
he's an awful good man.

928
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,679
He's helping me
get through it.

929
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,398
I give him all the
credit in the world,

930
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,516
me being the new hand
in the bunkhouse.

931
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,511
They got me talking a lot,

932
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,794
which takes a little
getting used to,

933
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,430
talking with the camera looking
at me, but, heck, I enjoy.

934
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,715
Oh, good, that's fine.

935
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,917
Usually on a picture,
I just say, "Whitey" or "Whoa, there."

936
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,275
But this one here,
it's talking.

937
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,793
And it's people listening.

938
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,552
That threw me
a little at first,

939
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,756
but I think I got
my leg up on her now.

940
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,399
That's fine.
Laurentz came by this morning

941
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,760
to tell me how
well you're doing.

942
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,950
You just continue to
do whatever he says.

943
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,598
He knows how to make
a quality picture.

944
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,754
That is true. He will not quit
on a take until it has quality.

945
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,876
That them?

946
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,313
Sorry, sir, no.

947
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,550
Do you want
Mrs. Mannix on one?

948
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,629
Hiya, hon.

949
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,118
You know, busy.

950
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Uh-huh.

951
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Uh-huh.

952
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,435
I thought he asked
to play infield.

953
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,955
I see.

954
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,997
Maybe we should make him
honor that commitment.

955
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,080
That's true.
No, of course, you're right.

956
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,470
Okay. Okay,
I'll call the coach.

957
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,834
Sure.

958
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,188
I love you, too.

959
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,395
Mr. Mannix,
you want me to run out

960
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,520
and get you a bigger grip?

961
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,477
That one looks
a little bit snug.

962
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,119
Hobie.

963
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,793
There's $100,000 in
that attaché case.

964
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,879
Ransom money.

965
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,995
Baird Whitlock
has been kidnapped.

966
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,553
This is bad.

967
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,116
Bad for movie stars
everywhere.

968
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,074
And you got no idea who's
mixed up in this thing?

969
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,477
I would look at the extras.

970
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,915
The extras? Why?

971
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,913
Well, you just never know about an extra.
They come and go.

972
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,958
Everyone else, I'm on the set,
I see the guy setting the 5K,

973
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,554
I think, "Why, there's
old Bud setting the 5K."

974
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,029
Script girl,
wrangler, same thing.

975
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,713
Extras, that's different.

976
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,831
Not making
a blanket call here.

977
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,832
I mean, there's good
extras and bad extras.

978
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,751
All I'm saying

979
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,514
you look at an extra,

980
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,909
you got no idea
what he's thinking.

981
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,438
He's back! Line two.

982
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,633
Hello.
You have the money?

983
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,273
Yes, I have it.

984
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,714
Stage 8?

985
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,354
Behind the electrical box?
Just leave it there?

986
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,511
And when do I get Baird?
When we have the money.

987
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,113
I'll do it right now.

988
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,634
Can I use your belt?

989
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,195
The Swingin' Dinghy
is closing, folks.

990
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,716
Time for me to clean up,
time for you to clear out.

991
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,314
So long, fellas.
See ya in eight months.

992
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,800
- Toodle-oo.
- See ya later, boys.

993
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,029
Eight months?

994
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,798
Yeah, we're shipping
out in the morning.

995
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,872
Golly!
Eight months without a dame.

996
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,469
Can you beat it?

997
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,153
You're gonna
have to beat it!

998
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,596
We are heading out to sea

999
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,429
And however it'll be

1000
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,111
It ain't gonna be the same

1001
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,669
'Cause no matter what we see

1002
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,037
When we're out
there on the sea

1003
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,352
We ain't gonna see a dame

1004
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,957
We'll be
searching high and low

1005
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,349
On the deck and down below

1006
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,751
But it's a crying shame

1007
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,436
We'll see a lot of fish
But we'll never clock a dish

1008
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,956
We ain't gonna see a dame

1009
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,917
No dames

1010
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,036
We might see
some octopuses

1011
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,838
No dames

1012
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,036
Or a half
a dozen clams

1013
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,872
No dames

1014
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,270
We might even
see a mermaid

1015
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,110
But mermaids
got no gams

1016
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,317
No gams

1017
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,591
Hey!
Off of there!

1018
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,954
Hey, come on.

1019
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,312
Hey! Come on.

1020
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Hey!

1021
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,029
Oh, come on!

1022
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,472
Oh, Christ!
Climb up and tappin'.

1023
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
Ah, come on!

1024
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,952
Have we
got a girl for you!

1025
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,154
Out there on the sea

1026
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,114
Here's how it will be

1027
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,673
I'm gonna
dance with you, pal

1028
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,228
You're gonna dance with me

1029
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,992
When we're out
there on the sea

1030
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,798
We'll be happy as can be

1031
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,599
Or so the captain claims

1032
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,672
But we have to disagree
'Cause the only guarantee

1033
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,798
Is I'll see a lot of you
And you'll see a lot of me

1034
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,829
And it's absolutely certain
that we'll see a lot of sea

1035
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,471
But we ain't
gonna see no dames

1036
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,755
No dames!

1037
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,080
We're gonna see
How will it be?

1038
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,712
No dames!
With no dames!

1039
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,120
We're gonna see
How will it be?

1040
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,872
No dames!
No dames!

1041
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,519
We're gonna see
And how will it be?

1042
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,148
We ain't gonna see no...

1043
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,832
This place looks open!

1044
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,235
What the...

1045
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,359
You, out!

1046
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,149
Stop it! Hey!
Hey!

1047
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,514
Quit it!
Cut that out!

1048
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
This ain't that
kind of a place!

1049
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,595
Cut!

1050
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,477
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, kids...

1051
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Okay.

1052
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,440
Come here, Burt Gurney.
We go again.

1053
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,993
Anything different,
Mr. Seslum?

1054
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no.

1055
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,278
Mostly pretty good,
but this time

1056
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,273
don't put dishrag
on bartender's head.

1057
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,277
You're a big star,
Burt Gurney.

1058
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,152
Who cares about
the bartender?

1059
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,679
You are the star.

1060
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,193
That's my whole character,
the slow burn.

1061
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,719
Gosh, Mr. Seslum,
I don't mind if he wants to...

1062
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,074
It is decided.
Hello, Burt.

1063
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,834
Hello, Mr. Mannix.

1064
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,356
Arne.
Hello.

1065
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,750
Listen, I don't wanna stick my
nose in other people's business,

1066
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,239
but, uh...

1067
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,108
Well, I understand you've been
associating with DeeAnna Moran?

1068
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Yeah, yeah,
we associated.

1069
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Yes.

1070
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,079
But no more, no more.
Don't you worry, Eddie Mannix.

1071
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,072
But, Arne, you are
aware that she's...

1072
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,152
This must not be in movie magazines,
that we are associated.

1073
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,389
No, no,
of course not.

1074
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,833
My wife cannot read this.

1075
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,109
Your... Excuse me?

1076
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,879
Ilsa Pflug.

1077
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,235
Ilsa Pflug-Seslum.

1078
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,468
In Malmö.

1079
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,754
I was not aware of that.

1080
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,678
Yeah, two children.

1081
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,880
And a third on the way, apparently.
Mmm-hmm.

1082
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,828
Do you enjoy physical culture,
Eddie Mannix? Do you ski?

1083
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,356
No. I never took it up.
Seems like a lot of fun, Arne.

1084
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,431
I no more associate
with DeeAnna Moran.

1085
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,589
I hug you.

1086
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,038
Goodbye.

1087
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,239
I spent the night.

1088
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,993
So, I feel somebody poking at me,
and I wake up and it's Clark.

1089
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,516
And he says, "Well, your keys aren't
in there, so I guess we're walking."

1090
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,751
This was back before
Gable was Gable.

1091
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,230
Yeah, we used to go up to
San Berdoo every weekend.

1092
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,276
Bob Stack would
come up sometimes.

1093
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,271
Blue Grotto
was still open.

1094
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,869
Dave Chasen
was a busboy.

1095
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,716
Quite a place.
Yours?

1096
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,309
Gracious, no. It belongs to
a member of our study group.

1097
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,392
He couldn't be
here this afternoon.

1098
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,800
He'll be sad to
have missed you.

1099
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,915
He's a fan.

1100
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,314
Uh-huh.
That's swell.

1101
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,232
So, I black out,
I wake up here...

1102
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,391
And I say to myself,

1103
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,835
"Baird, you gotta stop doing this."

1104
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,558
But you're saying, actually,
technically, I was kidnapped.

1105
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,036
Well, technically, yes.

1106
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,549
There's gonna be a ransom?

1107
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,159
I'd hardly
call it a ransom.

1108
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,913
Benedict there.
That's Benedict de Bonaventure.

1109
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,797
He wrote
The House of Ahasuaris.

1110
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,675
Enormous hit. Made the
studio millions of dollars.

1111
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,990
Did you see any of those
millions of dollars, Ben?

1112
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,149
I did not.

1113
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,555
Dutch over there.

1114
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,673
Dutch Zweistrong wrote
All The Way To Uruguay.

1115
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,910
I wrote all the
All The Way pictures.

1116
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,992
All successful. You see any of
the profits, Dutch?

1117
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,591
See, all of us
here are writers.

1118
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,432
The pictures originated with us.
They're our ideas.

1119
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,079
But they're owned
by the studio.

1120
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,872
I'm not saying only writers
are being exploited.

1121
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,200
I mean, look at
yourself, Baird.

1122
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,431
The studio takes
pretty good care of me.

1123
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,868
What are you, a child?

1124
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,189
I think what Herschel's
trying to say is,

1125
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,318
just because the studio owns
the means of production,

1126
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,157
why should it be able to
take the money, our money,

1127
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,151
the value created
by our labor,

1128
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,555
and dole out
what it pleases?

1129
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,789
That's not right.

1130
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,157
So, no. No.
I wouldn't call it ransom.

1131
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,878
- Payback.
- That's right.

1132
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,551
Now, until quite recently our
study group had a narrow focus.

1133
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,395
We concentrated on getting communist
content into motion pictures.

1134
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,676
Always in a sub
rosa way, of course.

1135
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,235
And we were
pretty darn successful.

1136
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,516
You remember in
Kerner's Corner

1137
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,755
the town hall scene
where the alderman

1138
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,114
overturned the
rotten election

1139
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,918
and made Gus the mayor?

1140
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,829
Yeah.

1141
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,515
Well, I like to think
we've changed a few minds.

1142
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,036
But then Dr. Marcuse came down from
Stanford, joined the study group

1143
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,159
and started teaching
us about direct action.

1144
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,918
Praxis.
Action.

1145
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,551
We each pursue our
own economic interest.

1146
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,317
We ourselves are not above
the laws of history.

1147
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,038
But in pursuing our
interests with vigor,

1148
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,431
we accelerate the dialectic

1149
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,036
and hasten the end of history and
the creation of the New Man.

1150
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,391
- Plus, we make a little dough.
- Shut up!

1151
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,392
We're not even
talking about money!

1152
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,198
We're talking about economics.

1153
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,472
Sure, good.

1154
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,078
Good stuff.

1155
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,832
So, now, uh, do I get
a share of the ransom?

1156
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,109
No.

1157
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,637
No, Mr. Whitlock, you can hardly
share in your own ransom.

1158
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,153
That would be unethical.

1159
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,231
I don't know. That doesn't
seem fair, fellas.

1160
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,633
I mean, the whole setup only
works if I play along, right?

1161
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,719
If I don't let on that I
know who kidnapped me.

1162
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,199
Well, yes,
that's right.

1163
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,239
What if I name names?

1164
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,071
If I just tell the truth.

1165
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Uh...

1166
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,392
I don't think you'll
do that, Mr. Whitlock.

1167
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,438
What if we told the truth
about On Wings as Eagles?

1168
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,553
Sid.

1169
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,840
We have to work something
out for DeeAnna Moran.

1170
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,429
She get married again?

1171
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,988
No, that's the problem.
Having a child, not married.

1172
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,189
Whew. Tough.

1173
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,349
Yeah, no father.

1174
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,960
Well, of course
there is one somewhere.

1175
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,554
But who knows?
Exactly.

1176
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,755
So is there any way...

1177
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,439
I'm just spitballing here.

1178
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,718
Any way she could
adopt her own child?

1179
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,597
Interesting.
As a single... Mmm-hmm.

1180
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,110
She disappears for a while, reappears.
Uh-huh.

1181
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,316
She wants to share her
blessings, adopt a child.

1182
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,313
Sure. She's always
yearned to be a mother.

1183
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,869
That's it.

1184
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,558
Well, I don't see
why not.

1185
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,629
Nothing in the
California statute

1186
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,636
prohibits adoption by one's own parent.
Mmm-hmm.

1187
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,714
This is new ground.

1188
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,392
Technically, she'd have
to give up the baby

1189
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,038
to a third party.

1190
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,314
Joe Silverman.

1191
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,034
Joe Silverman. Exactly.

1192
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,799
He's the foster father
for a few days.

1193
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,553
She hands the kid to Joe,
he hands it back.

1194
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,029
I'll do
some research.

1195
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,120
All right.

1196
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,157
Mr. Mannix, it's 5:30.

1197
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,514
This is exciting.

1198
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,592
...and asked all of the assistant
directors, and one of them said

1199
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,195
that an extra in the courtyard of
Sestimus Amydias seemed jumpy.

1200
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,633
All right. Get Walt
the name of the extra

1201
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,160
so he can bring
him in and sweat him.

1202
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,593
Walt should tell him that
we won't press charges

1203
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,635
if he tells us where
Baird's been taken.

1204
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,755
Check.

1205
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,831
And if he plays dumb,
or the AD's wrong and he is dumb,

1206
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,148
check the other extras.

1207
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,832
Check. Thessaly Thacker called,

1208
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,150
said you promised her an
interview with Baird today.

1209
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,078
Check that. It was
Thora Thacker.

1210
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,309
No, it's Thessaly.

1211
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,913
Tell her he was at the
doctor longer than expected,

1212
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,797
and she can see him on the set
bright and early tomorrow.

1213
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,996
Check. And is that
last part true?

1214
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,599
Let's hope so.
Oh, that reminds me.

1215
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,999
I need a list of
everyone who worked on

1216
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,917
On Wings as Eagles
who's still at the studio.

1217
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,031
On Wings as Eagles?
That's a while ago now.

1218
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,190
Aside from Baird and the director,
it won't be a long list.

1219
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,759
Yeah. Get it
for me. That it?

1220
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,757
Uh, no.
One more thing.

1221
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,108
A Mr. Cuddahy called,

1222
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,792
said you know him.
Yeah, yeah.

1223
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,110
He said it's urgent,
he'll see you one last time,

1224
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,430
suggested same place,
7:00 this evening.

1225
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,272
Why? Never mind.

1226
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,715
Okay, tell him
I'll be there.

1227
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,989
Back to your place?

1228
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,149
What a bore.

1229
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,275
Hello, C.C.

1230
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,160
I rather thought
we might go to Lake...

1231
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,909
Oh, hi, Eddie.

1232
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,040
Wanna lace up what you got
on Merrily We Dance?

1233
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,430
It's up now.
I'll put some music on it.

1234
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,115
Taxi!

1235
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,198
Back to your place?

1236
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,508
What a bore.

1237
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,672
I rather thought we might go to
Lake Onondaga for the weekend.

1238
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,154
Just the two of us.

1239
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,595
Don't have my valise.
I left it in your foyer.

1240
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,756
Oh, you'll get by
without a change.

1241
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,955
Suits me.

1242
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,871
If you don't mind skipping out
on your own party, Allegra.

1243
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,960
Suits me.

1244
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,433
And skipping out on Monty.

1245
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,351
That suits me as well.

1246
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,396
Oh, poor Monty.

1247
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,873
What Monty
doesn't know...

1248
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,109
Won't hurt Monty.

1249
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,875
Oh, Monty.

1250
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,152
Come join me
on the divan.

1251
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,476
It seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

1252
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,680
But I'll...

1253
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,160
Reverse.

1254
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,398
Reverse! Reverse!

1255
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Whoa!

1256
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,952
Whoa!

1257
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,872
I shouldn't wear scarves.

1258
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,876
It seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

1259
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,031
But I'll partner
you in bridge.

1260
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,953
Why the pout?

1261
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,712
It's complicated.

1262
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,836
How pleasant to see
you again, Mr. Mannix.

1263
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,833
Thanks for
coming back, Mannix.

1264
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,239
Sure.

1265
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,080
You're taking us down
to the wire, aren't ya?

1266
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,634
It's not a ploy,
it's a big decision.

1267
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,073
Absolutely. No foul.

1268
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,200
But the board
was concerned

1269
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,798
when I couldn't give them
a yes this afternoon,

1270
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,717
so they authorized me
to say this.

1271
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,230
You sign on, your term
of contract is 10 years.

1272
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,155
Yeah. You get it, right?

1273
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,674
That means your stock options
are guaranteed to vest.

1274
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,920
You'd never
have to work again

1275
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,036
if you chose to retire
after your term.

1276
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,392
Think about it.

1277
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,511
Lifetime employment.

1278
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,670
You wouldn't be a glorified
working stiff like you are now,

1279
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,560
and you'd be running a business,
not a circus.

1280
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,280
Drink?

1281
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Cigarette?

1282
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,358
No, no. I gotta run.

1283
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,272
I should talk this
over with my wife.

1284
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,280
Of course. Talk it over,
think about your family,

1285
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,953
let us know
in the morning.

1286
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,553
Oh!

1287
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,039
If you think
this is a bribe,

1288
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,519
you're absolutely right.

1289
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,829
You have two kids, right?
A boy and a girl?

1290
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,989
That's right.

1291
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,670
They love this stuff.
Used to be trains.

1292
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,395
Hello, Hobie.

1293
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,031
Oh, hello, Carlotta.

1294
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,120
Am I late?

1295
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,714
Oh, no, it ain't nothin'.

1296
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,109
Thanks an awful bunch for
coming to this picture with me.

1297
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,679
I don't know if
you like livestock,

1298
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,955
but I think it's got
moments, I really do.

1299
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,155
You look very purty.

1300
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,355
Thank you, Hobie!

1301
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,475
I'm sure I'll
like the picture.

1302
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,959
I like all of your pictures.

1303
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,040
Well, I like yours, too.

1304
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,076
They are just
the craziest things.

1305
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,720
Uh, is it hard to dance with
all them bananas on your head?

1306
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,791
Oh, no.
Anyone can do it.

1307
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,240
It's all in the hips and the lips
and the eyes and the thighs.

1308
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,272
Little Eddie wanted me to tell
you about his baseball game.

1309
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,316
They won.

1310
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,958
That is terrific.

1311
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,150
Gosh, I never
called the coach.

1312
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,309
Eddie played at shortstop?

1313
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,597
Mmm. And he did so well,
he wants to stay there now.

1314
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,438
That's great.

1315
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,994
Took care of itself.

1316
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,233
And Darlene did very well
on her Spanish test.

1317
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,993
That's good.
She was worried about that.

1318
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,678
Hey, thanks for heating
up the roast, hon.

1319
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,829
Warm glass of milk?

1320
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,433
Uh, no, thanks,
hon. Coffee.

1321
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,512
I gotta run back
to the studio.

1322
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,720
A few things
to take care of.

1323
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,159
Gee, another late night.
Hmm.

1324
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,998
You know, Lockheed
improved their offer.

1325
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,560
Darned good money,

1326
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,955
and the hours wouldn't be
crazy like this either.

1327
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,872
It's nice
to be wanted.

1328
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,949
Yeah. Sure, but...

1329
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,551
What do you think?
They wanna know tomorrow.

1330
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,277
I like the shorter hours.

1331
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,996
But what do you think, honey?
You know best.

1332
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
Hmm.

1333
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,472
How's it going with
the smoking, dear?

1334
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,593
Oh, you know...

1335
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,238
The denizens of Los Angeles
make ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

1336
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,073
But Eddie Mannix
will have neither.

1337
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,075
Even in westerly Malibu,
the sun has moved on,

1338
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,912
leaving the vast
and tireless sea

1339
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,515
to heave itself
blindly upon the shore.

1340
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,919
The communists welcome
a rare moment of leisure.

1341
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,355
Brief surcease from struggle.

1342
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,478
Baird Whitlock has
become their acolyte,

1343
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,357
a convert to their cause,

1344
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,193
his belief compelled
but not grudging.

1345
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,115
He now seeks to learn more
from Professor Marcuse

1346
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,031
and becomes
ever more committed

1347
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,588
to the quest to hasten
an end to history

1348
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,517
and bring on the New Man.

1349
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,438
Herb, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1350
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,511
That's what happened to me when
I went to Reno with Danny Kaye,

1351
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,278
and he asked me
to shave his back.

1352
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,634
The exact same thing.

1353
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,358
Because I'm thinking,
"Who benefits?"

1354
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,910
Also, I gotta tell ya, everybody
thinks that Danny is a jerk.

1355
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,479
He's not really a jerk.

1356
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,837
It's just the theory generating
its own anti-theory.

1357
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,792
Anyway, there we were,
it's me and Danny,

1358
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,279
and I'm wondering
what the hell am I doing

1359
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,554
with a razor
in my hand.

1360
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,990
And he says it's for
a Norman Taurog picture.

1361
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,429
But Judy Canova is there,
and she knows Norman.

1362
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,600
She says, "Danny's not doing
a Norman Taurog picture.

1363
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,836
"He just wants you
to shave his back!"

1364
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,639
And that's who benefits.

1365
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,837
In livelier precincts,

1366
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,832
the swells of Dreamland
gather to inspect

1367
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,957
the completed weave
of another piece of gossamer.

1368
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,837
Another movie,

1369
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,309
another portion of balm

1370
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,915
for the ache of
a toiling mankind.

1371
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,515
Where is she?

1372
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,079
Hold your horses,
I'm right here.

1373
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,513
What's on your
mind, Curly?

1374
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,670
It's not my fault
you saw me take

1375
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,194
that pie off the sill,
Ms. McGraw.

1376
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,272
Not your fault? Whose
fault was it, Curly?

1377
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,672
Why, that crazy,
lazy full moon!

1378
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,834
Two weeks ago, you'd
never seen me take it.

1379
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,398
Darn you, moon!
What good are you anyway?

1380
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,120
Don't know
about this part.

1381
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,720
They only give me
one shot at the song.

1382
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,711
I wish there
never was no moon.

1383
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,793
I wish there weren't
no bossy old women!

1384
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,033
Don't blame that moon, Curly.
She can't do nothin' but shine.

1385
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,796
Lazy ol' moon, keep shinin'

1386
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,593
Darn you.

1387
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,393
Shinin' down on me

1388
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,792
You turned Curly Strimlin in to the
authorities for the last time!

1389
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,156
Lazy ol' moon,
keep shinin'

1390
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,636
Shinin' just to be

1391
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:39,759
On that ol' plantation
where I used to roam

1392
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,595
Light my weary
way back home

1393
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,230
Darn! Where'd she go?

1394
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,954
Lazy ol' moon,
keep shinin'

1395
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,476
Shinin' down for me

1396
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,309
Another part of town,
another cast of characters,

1397
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,272
another task
for Eddie Mannix.

1398
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,632
We're just
getting started.

1399
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,790
I've been taking
DeeAnna through this.

1400
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,791
So Joe has done

1401
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,599
just a whole lot of good
work for us in the past.

1402
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,875
Whenever we've needed a witness
or a third party for...

1403
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,190
I don't know, a petition of grievance
or alienation of affection.

1404
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,834
And he's reliable?

1405
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,194
I'm bonded, miss.

1406
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,998
Joseph Silverman is the
most reliable human being

1407
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,230
on the planet
in our experience.

1408
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,271
When Chubby Cregar
was intoxicated

1409
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,157
and hit that
pedestrian on Gower,

1410
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,680
we had the vehicle title
transferred to Joe's name,

1411
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,794
and Joe did six months
in LA County lockup.

1412
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,159
But you're off
the sauce now?

1413
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,590
I never touch it.
It was a legal fiction.

1414
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,909
That's right.

1415
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,149
When the studio needs
someone who meets

1416
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,838
the legal standard of, uh...

1417
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,069
How did you put it, Sid?

1418
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,999
Personhood.

1419
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,789
Joe steps in and
acts as the person.

1420
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,873
So you're a
professional person?

1421
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,913
That's right, miss.
Initial here and here.

1422
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,310
Joe will be the foster
parent until such time as

1423
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,594
you adopt the child,

1424
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,951
which you can do as soon as
Joe takes possession of it.

1425
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,274
And he's reliable?

1426
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,628
I'm bonded, miss.

1427
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,349
The release papers
you're signing

1428
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,192
will not be a matter
of public record.

1429
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,114
All these documents will be
sealed until the year 2015.

1430
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,639
And no one's
the wiser.

1431
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,034
No one the wiser.

1432
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:57,119
No fans, no press, no court officials,
not even a notary public.

1433
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,311
Joe himself
is the notary.

1434
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,357
You must have
very strong forearms.

1435
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,076
Is it hard
squeezing it like that?

1436
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,992
It's part of the job, miss.

1437
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,397
Late night, Mr. Mannix?

1438
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,913
Late night for both of us.

1439
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,228
Will you call Projection
Seven and have them

1440
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,550
lace up yesterday's
dailies on Hail, Caesar!

1441
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,392
Sure thing.
Yesterday's?

1442
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,748
Thanks, Scotty.

1443
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,352
Romans before slaves!
Make room, you fools!

1444
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,431
Romans before slaves!

1445
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,513
Romans before slaves!

1446
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,234
Make room!

1447
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,992
- How's that? What do you think?
- Cut!

1448
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,195
27, Baker two.

1449
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,315
Action.

1450
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,958
Go ahead,
I'm listening.

1451
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,435
Walt talked to the
extra. Right guy.

1452
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,631
No info. Doesn't know
where they took Baird,

1453
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,518
but described the truck
they put him in.

1454
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,715
Cut! Good!

1455
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,679
Walt found the guy who owns the
truck and is talking to him.

1456
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,989
Baker four.

1457
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,400
- Walt's a problem-solver. He's a good man.
- Action!

1458
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,789
What else?

1459
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,553
PR just called in their report
on the Hobie Doyle premiere.

1460
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,079
Warm reception.

1461
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,680
I got something... I had spittle.
Good.

1462
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,552
- Baker six.
- Action.

1463
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,232
Okay.
He's terrific.

1464
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,349
Squint! Squint
against the grandeur.

1465
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,560
It's blinding! Blinding!

1466
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,549
Now, let's see
what we can do here.

1467
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,313
Okay.

1468
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,513
Well, I don't think it's regulation size,
but it'll have to do.

1469
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,438
You ever heard of origami,
what the Japanese do? Uh-huh.

1470
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,519
This here's
Italian origami.

1471
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,149
Yeah?

1472
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,912
See, now you just...
Whoop!

1473
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,591
Let's see how
she does now.

1474
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,273
Oh, she's peekin' back.

1475
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,833
Oh! There she goes.

1476
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,360
She's bawlin'.

1477
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,149
Clear!
Ah!

1478
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,793
This is why I never
order it with meat sauce.

1479
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,518
How'd you get into
pictures, Hobie?

1480
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,994
Got roped into it.

1481
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,869
Stop!

1482
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,429
Don't play
with your food.

1483
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,835
Food!

1484
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,395
You're the one
playing with it.

1485
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,708
Stop it!

1486
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,951
Pictures. Well,
I wrangled for a while,

1487
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,156
and then they saw I
could say a line or two,

1488
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,436
and I was Bad Clem
or Deputy Number Two

1489
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,636
or a guy's buddy
for a couple of years,

1490
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,236
and then someone heard me sing
and they made me the guy.

1491
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,674
You're awfully cute.

1492
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,638
Oh, heck, you ain't seen the half of it.
I'll show you cute.

1493
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,310
Just a second here,
a little souvenir from my rodeo days.

1494
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,077
Tell you what,
I was steer-bustin',

1495
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,388
and I went down and
the steer went up,

1496
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,040
and my teeth headed
off for east Texas.

1497
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,992
Here, it's coming
around again.

1498
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,800
Whoo!

1499
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,357
You gotta give a little

1500
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,668
Take a little

1501
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,673
And let your poor
heart break a little

1502
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,159
That's the story of...

1503
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,680
That's the glory of love

1504
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,235
You gotta laugh a little,
cry a little

1505
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,118
And let the clouds
roll by a...

1506
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,518
Well, now,
this is interesting.

1507
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,238
I didn't know you
two were friends.

1508
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,599
Oh, heck, yeah.

1509
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,917
We just caught my picture Lazy Ol' Moon,
and I guess we're...

1510
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,076
Yes, we're
friends. We're...

1511
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,920
We're fixin' to be friendly,
tell you that.

1512
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,994
That's good.

1513
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,229
"Fixin' to be friendly."

1514
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,197
That can be my
column headline.

1515
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,153
Oh, I guess
that'd be okay.

1516
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,434
Have a good evening.

1517
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,674
I mentioned
the name of my picture.

1518
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,080
I think we're
supposed to do that.

1519
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,440
Well, now,
this is interesting.

1520
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,390
I thought I was getting
an exclusive on this.

1521
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,869
I'd like to know what the
hell is going on here.

1522
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,437
Oh, well, like I said, we just
saw Lazy Ol' Moon, and...

1523
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,319
And Hobie and I are
fixin' to be friendly.

1524
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,392
- What?
- We're just...

1525
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,232
Friends, my foot!

1526
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,869
What's the matter, Hobie?

1527
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,310
I gotta skedaddle.
So sorry. Oh!

1528
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,509
Have to catch one of
your pictures next time.

1529
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,999
I'm looking
forward to it.

1530
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,229
Bye, Hobie.

1531
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,713
Hey, toss me
them keys, pard.

1532
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,949
I'm taking the car.

1533
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,553
Hobie Doyle?

1534
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,599
You're a communist, too?

1535
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,916
So, it's commies.

1536
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,309
You ever been in this place?
Pretty nice, huh?

1537
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,992
It's Burt Gurney's.

1538
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,913
He sings, he dances,
he's got taste.

1539
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,753
You here alone?

1540
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,672
Everybody else went
down to the beach.

1541
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,799
Well, all right, pard.

1542
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,910
Let's us head on
back to town.

1543
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,435
You got Mr. Mannix
worried sick.

1544
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,109
Easy.

1545
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,435
Easy.

1546
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,080
Here!

1547
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,477
Take care of him.

1548
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,758
Comrade. Comrade!

1549
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,116
We salute you.

1550
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,313
You are going to Moscow
to become Soviet Man

1551
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,959
and help forge the future.

1552
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,036
We stay behind, continuing
to serve in our disguise

1553
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,315
as capitalist handmaidens.

1554
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,914
But the money should
go to the cause,

1555
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,433
not to the servants
of the cause.

1556
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,868
Yes!
That's right.

1557
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,234
We... Well...

1558
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,635
Our modest contribution
to the Comintern.

1559
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,479
They will be pleased.

1560
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,354
No! No!

1561
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,428
Engels!

1562
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,235
No.

1563
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,560
Oh.

1564
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,234
Oh, boy! It's late.
I'm in the doghouse.

1565
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,277
Better forget
about my place.

1566
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,396
Drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1567
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,879
All righty.

1568
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,120
Huh.

1569
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,039
Who are you?

1570
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,349
Todd.

1571
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,348
Todd.

1572
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,270
You get a hot breakfast
or a box breakfast?

1573
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,874
I don't know.

1574
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,436
Are you a principal
or an extra?

1575
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,272
I think
I'm a principal.

1576
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,668
Yeah.

1577
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,193
I'm thinking,
"What the hell?"

1578
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,800
Woken up in some
strange houses before,

1579
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,793
but never without
a broad next to me.

1580
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,954
Mmm-hmm. These guys are
pretty interesting, though.

1581
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,999
They've actually figured out the
laws that dictate everything.

1582
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,675
History, sociology, politics,
morality, everything.

1583
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,877
It's all in a book
called Kapital, with a "K."

1584
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,314
That right?

1585
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,674
Yeah. And you're not
gonna believe this.

1586
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,432
These guys even figured out

1587
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,158
what's going on
here at the studio,

1588
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,515
because the studio
is nothing more

1589
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,273
than an instrument of capitalism.
Hmm.

1590
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:12,672
Yeah, so we blindly follow these
laws like any other institution,

1591
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,757
laws that these
guys figured out.

1592
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,638
The studio makes pictures
to serve the system.

1593
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,073
That is its function.

1594
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,151
That's really what
we're up to here.

1595
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,839
Is it?
Yeah.

1596
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,992
It's just confirming what
they call the "status quo."

1597
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,113
I mean, we may tell ourselves
that we're creating

1598
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,156
something of artistic value,

1599
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:35,353
or there's some sort of spiritual
dimension to the picture business.

1600
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,239
But what it really is,
is this fat cat,

1601
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,759
Nick Schenk,
out in New York,

1602
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,356
running this factory,
serving up these lollipops to the...

1603
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,720
What they used to call the
bread and circuses for the...

1604
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,669
What...

1605
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,668
Now, you listen
to me, buster.

1606
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,672
Nick Schenk and this studio
have been good to you

1607
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,359
and to everyone else
who works here.

1608
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,440
If I ever hear you bad-mouthing
Mr. Schenk again,

1609
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,913
it will be the last
thing you say

1610
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,955
before I have you
tossed in jail

1611
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,440
for colluding in
your own abduction.

1612
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,160
Eddie, I wouldn't...
I would never do that!

1613
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,235
Shut up!

1614
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,436
You're gonna go out there and
you're gonna finish Hail, Caesar!

1615
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,515
You're gonna
give that speech

1616
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,589
at the feet of the
penitent thief,

1617
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,432
and you're gonna believe
every word you say.

1618
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,115
You're gonna do it
because you're an actor

1619
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,275
and that's what you do,

1620
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,998
just like the director
does what he does,

1621
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,069
and the writer
and the script girl

1622
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,440
and the guy who
claps the slate.

1623
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,400
You're gonna do it because
the picture has worth!

1624
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,152
And you have worth if
you serve the picture,

1625
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,196
and you're never gonna
forget that again.

1626
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,479
I won't forget, Eddie.

1627
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,071
You're damn right
you won't.

1628
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,276
Not as long as
I run this dump.

1629
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,192
Baird.

1630
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,751
Go out there
and be a star.

1631
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,434
Mr. Mannix!

1632
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,475
Since you're
going to your car,

1633
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,993
I thought you might
wanna take this.

1634
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,195
What is it?

1635
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,639
From DeeAnna Moran.

1636
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,199
Thank you, and she
doesn't need to

1637
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,998
adopt her baby
after all.

1638
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,115
Huh?

1639
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,510
She asked Joe Silverman out
for dinner last night,

1640
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,033
and I guess
it went well.

1641
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,269
They drove to
Palm Springs

1642
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,510
and were married at
3:00 this morning.

1643
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,192
Huh.

1644
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,191
Will you be gone long?
Today's call list to go through.

1645
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,510
No, less than an hour.
Personal errand.

1646
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,113
It's a nice arrangement.

1647
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,838
She charged it
to the studio.

1648
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,513
Right.

1649
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,155
Just coming to see you.

1650
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,429
Good morning. Uh...

1651
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,440
Sorry about last night, Thora.
I didn't know your sister would show up.

1652
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,394
Well, that's as may be, but I
certainly learned my lesson.

1653
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,557
Whatever you say today,
Eddie Mannix,

1654
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,119
my column tomorrow
is about

1655
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,111
On Wings as Eagles.

1656
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,673
Thora, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1657
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,989
I'm sure you wouldn't.

1658
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,754
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Let's sit down.

1659
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,958
I'm telling you not to run the column,
Thora, for your own good.

1660
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,554
I can judge
my own interest.

1661
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,471
This will be
the story of the year.

1662
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,232
And it so happens
the Hearst syndicate

1663
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,311
are looking to pick up
a Hollywood column.

1664
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,515
And you think this
will cinch it for you?

1665
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,600
You know it will.

1666
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,759
Baird Whitlock,
your biggest star,

1667
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,519
got his first major part
in On Wings as Eagles

1668
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,238
by engaging in sodomy

1669
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,273
with the picture's director,
Laurence Laurentz.

1670
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,918
Oh, we've all
heard the story.

1671
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,991
But here's something
you haven't heard.

1672
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,435
Your source
is a communist.

1673
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,428
If you print it,
it'll be dismissed

1674
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,555
as a commie smear tactic,

1675
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,109
and you'll be dismissed
as a commie stooge.

1676
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,912
Burt Gurney has
left the country.

1677
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,594
The cell he was part of has
been smashed by the police.

1678
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,269
Might have thought
he was credible

1679
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,828
because he's Mr. Laurentz's
current protégé,

1680
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,032
but you don't want to be seen as
Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

1681
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,150
How did you know
Burt was my source?

1682
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,673
Late last night,
I talked to Laurence,

1683
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,557
put two and two together.

1684
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,314
Well, no reason to send this
since I ran into you.

1685
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,200
It's my way of apology for
Thessaly horning in last night.

1686
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,157
I do value
our friendship, Thora,

1687
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,151
but I'm late for
something important.

1688
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,353
Why on your knees before
this Hebrew, Autolochus?

1689
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,080
I encountered him
before, Gracchus.

1690
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,549
Beside the well
of Jehosaphat.

1691
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,557
And what manner of man.

1692
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,432
He's a priest of
the Israelites,

1693
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,511
despised even by
the other priests.

1694
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,869
No.

1695
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,351
On yesterday's march,

1696
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,075
punished by the
dust of the road,

1697
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,276
I sought to drink
first at the well,

1698
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,993
before the slaves
in my charge,

1699
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,753
whose thirst was far
greater than my own.

1700
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,070
A Roman drinks
before a slave.

1701
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,077
This man was
giving water to all.

1702
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,273
He saw no Roman,
he saw no slave.

1703
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,797
He saw only men, weak men,
and gave succor.

1704
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,276
He saw suffering,
which he sought to ease.

1705
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,715
He saw sin,
and gave love.

1706
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,117
Love, Autolochus?

1707
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,514
He saw my own sin,
Gracchus, and greed.

1708
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,112
But in his eyes, I saw
no shadow of reproach.

1709
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,077
I saw only light.

1710
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,638
The light of God.

1711
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,469
You mean,
of the gods.

1712
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,197
I do not, friend Gracchus.

1713
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,840
This Hebrew is
a son of the one God.

1714
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,468
The God of this
far-flung tribe.

1715
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,157
And why shouldn't
God's anointed appear here

1716
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,751
among these strange people,
to shoulder their sins?

1717
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,554
Here, Gracchus,
in this sun-drenched land.

1718
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,468
Why should He
not take this form,

1719
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,951
the form of
an ordinary man?

1720
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,315
A man bringing us
not the old truths,

1721
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,799
but a new one.

1722
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,993
A new truth?

1723
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,357
A truth beyond
the truth that we can see.

1724
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,314
A truth beyond this world.

1725
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,992
A truth told not in words,
but in light.

1726
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,950
A truth that we could see
if we had but...

1727
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,996
If we had but...

1728
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,194
Cut! Cut! "Faith!
Have but faith!"

1729
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,555
"Faith."

1730
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,631
"Faith. Faith!"
God damn it!

1731
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,994
Go one again.
Isn't it...

1732
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,195
They changed it.

1733
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,351
You got most of it, man.
You're all right.

1734
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,750
All right, hang on.

1735
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,990
Can I get a pat down?
I'm sweating like a pig in this thing.

1736
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,080
Ah, son of a bitch!

1737
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,076
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1738
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,519
How long since your
last confession, my son?

1739
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:47,036
It's been,
what, 27 hours.

1740
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,830
It's really
too often, my son.

1741
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,194
You're not
that bad.

1742
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,112
I don't know, Father.

1743
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,431
I snuck a cigarette.
Or two.

1744
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,555
I didn't make it home
in time for dinner.

1745
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,793
And I, uh, struck
a movie star in anger.

1746
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,073
All right.

1747
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,071
Five Hail Marys.

1748
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,273
Okay.

1749
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,593
Okay.

1750
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,919
Father?

1751
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,199
Yes, my son.

1752
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,550
May I ask you
something, Father?

1753
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,472
Of course, my son.

1754
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,428
If there's something
that's easy,

1755
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,550
is that wrong?

1756
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,395
Easy?

1757
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,755
Yeah, easy to do.

1758
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,632
Easy to...

1759
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,239
Like, an easy job.

1760
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,233
No, it's not a bad job.
It's not bad.

1761
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,229
But, then, there's this other
job that's not so easy.

1762
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,119
No, in fact, it's hard.

1763
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,633
It's so hard, Father...

1764
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,473
Sometimes I don't know
if I can keep doing it,

1765
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,471
but it seems right.

1766
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,951
I don't know
how to explain.

1767
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,633
God wants us to
do what's right.

1768
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,354
Yeah.

1769
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,638
Yeah, of course.
He does.

1770
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,718
The inner voice that
tells you what's right,

1771
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,474
it comes from God,
my son.

1772
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,795
Yeah, I got it.

1773
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,313
That's His way
of saying that...

1774
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,993
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

1775
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,673
Still raining
in Gallup, New Mexico.

1776
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,114
And the Tucumcari crew
has shot all the plates

1777
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,474
we need for
Came the Rain.

1778
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,240
Well, just shoot the showdown in
the weather and we'll retitle it.

1779
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,716
Tucumcari Tempest,
Desert Squall, Hold Back The Storm.

1780
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,235
The stories begin,
the stories end.

1781
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,674
I don't know,
bounce it off the writers.

1782
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,840
So it has been.

1783
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,915
Here's today's
call list.

1784
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,514
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy
at the Lockheed Corporation.

1785
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,033
Long call?
Short?

1786
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,077
"Thanks, but no thanks."
How long was that?

1787
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,480
But the story
of Eddie Mannix...

1788
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,748
Who do we
call first?

1789
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,193
...will never end.

1790
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,429
New York first.

1791
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,800
Time to check in
with Mr. Schenk.

1792
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,869
For his is a tale
written in light everlasting.
