1
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,795
This is Paris, on
a peaceful day in June.

2
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:02,348
Paris, tranquil, serene,
unaware that in a few short hours,

3
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:06,199
she would be a victim of a plot that will
shake the security of the free world.

4
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,051
This is 26 Ru Di Orlan,

5
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,535
where top military advisers to the North
Atlantic Alliance, are in secret session

6
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,275
discussing two guarded blueprints.

7
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:23,359
Two blueprints which contain the intricate
design of top secret " Lafayette X.V.27 "

8
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:26,725
The most deadly weapon
yet devised by man.

9
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:30,285
Such a prize, would inevitably
attempt the most sinister,

10
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,814
the most ruthless of
international spy ring.

11
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:34,859
And at 10 o'clock that evening

12
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:38,422
two of the most desperate of these
rings are simultaneously at work,

13
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:41,043
each unaware of the others operation.

14
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,409
Employed by the first of this ring
is a man known only as Brodnik.

15
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:49,551
Brodnik, skillful,
fanatic foreign agent,

16
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:53,043
whose government will stop at
nothing to achieve its sinister aim.

17
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:57,447
Theft of the plans of
deadly Lafayette X.V.27.

18
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,655
The second ring is far
more subtle in its operation.

19
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,671
This ring is headed by Godfrey Langston,
ostensibly a wealthy British philanthropist,

20
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:12,406
actually a man whose loyalty is to
any nation with the highest paycheck.

21
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,963
But when ruthless and
desperate men are at work,

22
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,803
there are always the
innocent who suffer.

23
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:24,681
The case of the
Lafayette X.V.27 is no exception.

24
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:27,594
Well at that very moment,
in a nearby nightclub,

25
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:30,642
a young American ventriloquist
just finishing his act,

26
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:33,914
quite unaware that before
midnight is to be involved

27
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:38,333
in one of the most infamous crimes,
in the history of international espionage.

28
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:24,630
Thank you!  Thank you very much!
Thank you.

29
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,468
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
our last performance in Paris.

30
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,802
And both Clarence and
I would like to tell you

31
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,430
how much we've grown to love
you and your wonderful Paris.

32
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:36,031
Speak for yourself, pal,
I can't wait to get out of here!

33
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,860
Don't mind Clarence folks,
he's just jealous, because ...

34
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,343
one of the nicest thing that can happen
to anybody in Paris happened to me.

35
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,865
- I fell in love.
- Love, ha, ha, ha.

36
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:49,285
This dame will take him
for every dime he's got!

37
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,032
This is insulting.
He should drop it from the act.

38
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,056
I wish it was an act!

39
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,129
Just jealous!
Really folks, she's a beautiful,

40
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,029
wonderful girl.
I wish you could see her.

41
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,829
Yeah, you should see her.  A blonde,
blue-eyed baby-faced purse snatcher.

42
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,254
- Clarence!
- A peroxide octopus!

43
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:08,381
- Quiet!
-15 hands and they're all in his pockets.

44
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:12,977
- Clarence, please!
- A 110 pounds of well stacked rattlesnake!

45
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,579
- Clarence!
- 62 and a half inches of ...

46
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,456
That's enough.
Well goodnight folks.

47
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,083
Bless you and goodnight.

48
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,820
Audrey, wait a minute, honey.
I'm terribly sorry.

49
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,200
I promise it won't happen again.

50
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,072
Jerry, I just can't
take it any longer.

51
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,379
It's getting worse all the time,

52
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,790
and tonight the dummy was
completely out of control.

53
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,541
Look honey, you know
I've been terribly upset.

54
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:33,774
Why don't you try
and be a little patient.

55
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,746
I did try but it just doesn't work.

56
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:38,056
We met, we fell in love
and it was wonderful.

57
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:38,835
Sure it was wonderful!

58
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,038
The minute we talk about
marriage, it all changed!

59
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,611
This thing came to life.
It turned into something evil.

60
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,550
It's a monster, it's
some sort of a witch.

61
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,842
- It takes one to know one!
- Clarence!

62
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:52,651
Jerry, the ballet is leaving for England
tonight and I'm going with them.

63
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,858
Let's just say that this whole
thing was a terrible mistake.

64
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,403
But Audrey, wait a minute,
I can explain all this.

65
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:01,204
Jerry, look.  You need help
and you ought to see a doctor.

66
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,618
- I don't need a doctor!
- You have to straighten yourself out

67
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,640
and then maybe one day we
can get together and try again.

68
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,975
<i>Don't call us, we'll call you.</i>

69
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,076
Oh! Oh.

70
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,385
- Goodbye Jerry!
- Audrey!

71
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,952
Now you, miserable, little monster!

72
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,227
You've done it again!

73
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,838
Good riddance.  You weren't
in love with her anyway.

74
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:23,127
- That's none of your business!
- She was taking you for a ride.

75
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,411
- One more word out of you, Clarence.
- Yes, I'll take the head!

76
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:26,552
I'm warning you Clarence!

77
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,930
Give a pushover to soft ...

78
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,025
Jerry!

79
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:36,467
That's fine ...
twice in one week.

80
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,655
I don't know what's wrong, Marty.
The words keep coming out.

81
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,371
I can't seem to control him anymore.

82
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,807
I'm going to level with you.
You're in trouble, Jerry.  Big trouble.

83
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,828
Now, I've done something about it
and I don't want any argument.

84
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,906
You're going to see a doctor,
first thing in the morning.

85
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:55,242
Well, maybe that the most sensible thing
to do.  I just don't know anymore, Marty.

86
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:57,194
What kind of a doctor?

87
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,166
Best in the business.
His name is Kreuger.  He's in Zurich.

88
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:01,452
Switzerland?

89
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,396
I've got hotel reservation,
tickets on a midnight ...

90
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,025
Wait a minute.

91
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,895
What is this midnight plane to
Switzerland? What kind of a doctor is he?

92
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,331
- I told you, the best.
- Yeah, I know, the best. But what kind?

93
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:16,182
Well, sort of a ... psychiatrist.
- A head shrinker?

94
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,934
A weight picker?
No, not for me, buddy.

95
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,858
- Jerry, please.
- Why don't you admit it. You think I ...

96
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:27,075
I've goofed my gums, I've blown my fuse.
What you're inferring this much ain't you?

97
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:29,065
Why do you suddenly want to
take midnight plane to Switzerland?

98
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,313
What's going to be in Switzerland?

99
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,853
Well, I'm very happy here. I've got
a little problem, that I'll work out.

100
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,874
- You think that I've gone crazy...
- Jerry, listen!

101
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,228
Nobody says you're crazy.

102
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:42,366
But, you're upset, you're disturbed.
I've seen that happen five times.

103
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,645
Now, you meet a girl, you
like her, everything's fine.

104
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,565
And when you get serious, this
thing comes to live and breaks it up.

105
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:53,061
Only it's getting worse.  That's the
second dummy you've broken this week.

106
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,261
You've got to see Dr. Kreuger.

107
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,306
Oh, Marty, that stuff
takes 3 or 4 years.

108
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:02,264
Kreuger's got a new technique.
He's cured some people in a week.

109
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,581
Now I'm a four year
job, I just know it.

110
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,315
- You open in London in 10 days.
- I'll be alright in London!

111
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,970
You will not be alright in London!

112
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,477
Jerry, listen to me!

113
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:18,760
I've been with you 10 years now.
Like a brother.  This is the end.

114
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:22,553
If you're not with me on the plane
tonight, and you know about me and planes.

115
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,217
If you don't go and see Kreuger
and straighten yourself out,

116
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,086
so help me, I'm walking out.

117
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:33,703
- Alright, I'll go.
- Good.

118
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,901
Now Kreuger will probably want
to see you work with Clarence.

119
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,048
What's the name of the guy who patches up the dummy?

120
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,675
The fella who's fixing up Terence.

121
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,431
- Papinek.
- Papinek.

122
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,167
I'll take Clarence, Jerry,
you go to the hotel and pack.

123
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:49,691
No, I'll take him over.
Poor little guy.

124
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,706
Now look, you've got to stop
thinking about being as a person,

125
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,002
it's just a hunk of wood.

126
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,185
Don't you think I know that?
Just a hunk of wood.

127
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,197
- Let me take him.
- I'll take him over.

128
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:01,721
He'd liked it better this way.

129
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,858
As Jerry Morgan leaves
for the shop of Papinek,

130
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,390
the wet-book circumstance
tightens around him.

131
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:13,158
For at that very moment,
at 26 Ru Di Orlan,

132
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,421
Brodnik, having gained
access to the secret files,

133
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,369
secures the 2 precious
blueprints of Lafayette X.V.27.

134
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:21,914
when...

135
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:35,505
as Brodnik escapes into the night,
the alarm goes out to the French police.

136
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,632
The news finally
reaching a high official,

137
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,132
who is a guest at
Godfrey Langston's party.

138
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,512
Olivia.
Excuse me, Monsieur.

139
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,449
Cash, I'd call quickly, will you?

140
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,045
Yes. Yes, I see.

141
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,186
The authorities have
sealed off the area.

142
00:09:58,387 --> 00:09:59,906
Get down there, find that man.

143
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,171
Get hold of those plans
before the police do.

144
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:17,878
Papinek!

145
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,404
Papinek!

146
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,983
The police!
- Shhh... goes the bell.

147
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:28,350
I just managed to escape.

148
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:30,711
- The plans. Have you got the plans?
- I have them now.

149
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:35,583
Their coming in the streets.
Choppa choppa. Horsepower.

150
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,953
- We must get them out of here at once.
- How?

151
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,514
You take them.  Plane, train,
they must leave Paris tonight.

152
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,677
Impossible, I'm being watched.
Paris will be sealed like a drum...

153
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:45,640
Every airports, every
railway station...

154
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:48,502
<i>Mr Papinek, are you almost
finished?  It's passed eleven.</i>

155
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,975
Just be patient, it will
be ready in a minute.

156
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,572
The ventriloquist.  He leaves
tonight for Zurich by midnight plane.

157
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,531
Midnight plane ...

158
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:05,215
- Which one is his?
- Both.  We put one in each.

159
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,625
- One in each?
- Should anything go wrong,

160
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,696
should one piece fall into the wrong
hands, it's no good without the other.

161
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:13,409
Good.
Hurry.

162
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,740
I sure hate to put you through
all this trouble, Mr Papinek,

163
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,953
but this is kind of an emergency.
We're leaving for Zurich tonight.

164
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:27,105
No, no, no.  You mustn't touch.
Wait until the glue dries.

165
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,008
I'm sure it's a good one.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,537
Cos I'd hate you to think I keep
breaking these dummies all the time.

167
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,820
But the peculiar thing is, I keep
breaking them only when I'm in love.

168
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,517
At least Marty thinks it peculiar,

169
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:41,306
that's why we are going to see
this doctor in Switzerland tonight.

170
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,463
- Remember, the glue!
- Yeah.

171
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:46,979
Mr Papinek, you are a Frenchman,

172
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
and the French is supposed
to know about these things...

173
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:51,826
I'd like to ask you something.  How
can you tell when you're really in love?

174
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,860
- Remember, you must not touch.
- Not even if you're in love?

175
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,908
Not until the glue hardens.

176
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,217
Not until the glue harden?

177
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,373
Well, thanks again.  I'll send you
some money from Switzerland.

178
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,387
Now, go to your place, call
Zurich, contact Gromek.

179
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,863
Gromek?  Why don't
we call him from here?

180
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
I'm sure my calls
are being intercepted.

181
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,775
Tell Gromek, when he gets
the plans, I'll meet him in London.

182
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,299
All right.

183
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,776
Please.
Hurry!

184
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,641
Stop!

185
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,286
I wish to contact ...

186
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,889
a Mr Laszlo Gromek.

187
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,570
No, no.  Gromek,
G - R - O - M - E - K.

188
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:10,104
Yes, yes, this is Gromek.
Go on.

189
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:15,748
The merchandise leaves tonight.

190
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:20,384
Tonight?  Go on ...
What's wrong with you?

191
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:24,977
The twelve o'clock plane for Zurich.

192
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:29,524
It is carried by the
red-headed ventriloquist ...

193
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,837
Red-headed ventriloquist?

194
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,048
Red-headed ventriloquist?

195
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:47,158
Red-headed ventriloquist?
Red-headed ventri ...

196
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,548
We have a lead, sir.

197
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:52,280
An American ventriloquist, named
Jerry Morgan, who does have red hair,

198
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,682
holds an engagement tonight
at "La Poule d'Or"

199
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,971
He's got passage for
Zurich on a midnight plane.

200
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:01,303
- See that we are on that plane.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,460
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

202
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:12,084
Oh, please keep your coat, sir.

203
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,039
Our heating system is
temporarily out of order.

204
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,369
Silliest thing I ever heard of.

205
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:21,171
Fasten your seat belt, these
midnight trips to Switzerland.

206
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,301
Will you lay off, I'm the one who should
be complaining.  You know how I get.

207
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,536
Well, stop complaining.
You're not going to be sick.

208
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,306
It's all mental.  Just don't
think about it.  You'll be alright.

209
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:33,106
- Oop, I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, that's quite alright.

210
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,755
<i>Passengers would you
please take your seats.</i>

211
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,426
- Are you sure you got hotel reservations?
- Only the best, the Zonenhof.

212
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,537
- You get two rooms?
- Two rooms.
- Good.

213
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:47,065
We had to sleep in the same room
with that deviated septum of yours ...

214
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:49,174
Stop worrying, will you?

215
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,855
- Do you feel all right?
- I feel fine, fine ...

216
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,700
- How is your stomach?
- Okay, just don't talk about it.

217
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:59,716
<i>We are taking off.  Please make sure
you have fastened your seat belt.</i>

218
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,654
Yeah, you better
fasten your seat belt.

219
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,986
Now forget your stomach.
It's all mental ...

220
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,544
Oop!

221
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,511
What are you doing?

222
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,315
Nothing ... I just fastened my belt.

223
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,734
- Then, please, unfasten it.
- Yes, ma'am.

224
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,888
- It seems to be stuck.
- Ring for the stewardess.

225
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,384
- She'll be here in a minute, so ...
- Yes, I suppose so.

226
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,562
- Lovely night, isn't it?
- Yes, very nice.

227
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,961
- Are you from Paris?
- No.

228
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,271
- London?
- Yes.

229
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,759
Enjoyed the coronation?

230
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,355
Oh, would you please
try to get us undone.

231
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:46,513
- I'm terribly sorry.
- It's quite alright.

232
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,353
Marty, you sure you're alright?

233
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,246
Please ... I'll be fine.

234
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,946
Perhaps you and your friend
would like to sit together?

235
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,768
Oh, that's very nice of you.
You sure you wouldn't mind?

236
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,175
No, not at all.

237
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,296
Watch your head.

238
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,782
Oh, you dropped ...

239
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:12,084
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- It's quite alright.

240
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:13,768
The washroom is at the rear.

241
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,642
Wasn't that awful?  I spilled
chocolate all over her coat.

242
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,304
Well, I suppose it don't mean a
thing, Marty.  It's all in your mind.

243
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,001
Dramamine clears it up right away.

244
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:32,263
You know, I just read an article.
It said in the article that ...

245
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:35,018
you'd never get airsick if you
had something in your stomach.

246
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:38,229
- Please, don't say stomach.
- What did you have for dinner?

247
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,807
I don't want to think about it.

248
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:42,723
But, you should think about it.  The
article said you should think about it.

249
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:45,032
It eases the tension,
relaxes the stomach muscles ...

250
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,485
- Please, don't say stomach.
- Marty, don't be a child.

251
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:49,813
You've got to fight this thing.

252
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,617
Now tell me, what did
you have for dinner?

253
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,911
Well, first I had a
little chicken soup.

254
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,340
Chicken soup.  Well, chicken soup is
wonderful. It's light, nourishing, warm,

255
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:04,040
- going down.  Settles the stomach.
- Please, don't say stomach.

256
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,919
- Well, what else did you have for dinner?
- Lobster.

257
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:10,292
Lobster?   Good, good.
Lobster, very good.

258
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,940
High protein content,
iodine.  Very good indeed.

259
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,469
- You have it boiled?
No, thermidor..

260
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,145
- Oh, themidor.
- With a thick cheese sauce.

261
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:23,787
That's nice.
Thick cheese sauce.

262
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:29,681
Then some chicken tetrazzini,
broccoli with hollandaise sauce

263
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:34,235
and a chopped anchovy salad
with Roquefort dressing.

264
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:38,554
- Then for dessert ...
- No names, just initials.

265
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:42,136
"Baked Alaska" with a rich,
creamy, fluffy, sugary ...

266
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:43,669
All right.

267
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,940
You know, you were right.
My stomach feels much better.

268
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,160
- Please, don't say stomach.
- Don't you feel well?

269
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,380
- I think I should like a different seat.
- Front or rear?

270
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,820
Oh, anywhere, just away
from that particular young man.

271
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,664
Thank you.

272
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,879
I beg your pardon.
Aren't you, Jerry Morgan?

273
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,217
- Yes.
- Well, I'm Godfrey Langston's secretary.

274
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,931
Mr Langston is a
great admirer of yours

275
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,849
and consider it an extreme
privilege to meet you.

276
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:27,225
- Tell him, some other time.
- Tell him Mr Morgan will be right over.

277
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,828
Thank you!

278
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,701
Why did you do that for?  I'm
in no mood to meet anybody.

279
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:35,183
That's Godfrey Langston.  One
of biggest wheels in England.

280
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,896
- Very social.  If he likes you, you're in.
- Good, maybe some other time.

281
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:42,253
You can't pass this up.  This might
be the opportunity of a lifetime.

282
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,137
Alright, okay. If I don't do it
I'll never hear the end of it.

283
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:45,860
Good.

284
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,703
And when you meet him, don't play it
too big, you know how the British are,

285
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,951
very dignified, reserved.
So throw everything away.

286
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:55,950
- You know, nice and casual.
- You know, this is pretty silly.

287
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,094
Come on, kid, do it for me.

288
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,279
Okay.

289
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:13,421
- Mr Langston?
- Yes.  How nice of you Mr Morgan.

290
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:15,810
- Won't you sit down?
- Alright.  Don't mind if I do.

291
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,968
I must apologise for
asking you over like this.

292
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,410
- But, I am quite a fan of yours.
- Oh, really?

293
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:24,715
- Turkish or Egyptian?
- Err, Egyptian I think.

294
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,937
I have seen your act at
"La Poule d'Or" a dozen times at least.

295
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,735
I want to tell you that in your
special field, I think your planning,

296
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:35,137
your technique, your execution
are not only daring but brilliant.

297
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,010
Oh, it's routine stuff, really.

298
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,345
In a way, it puts one in mind of
the daring of another performance.

299
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:44,416
A performance that took
place tonight, at 26 Ru Di Orlan.

300
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,315
Now you certainly do a lot
of night clubbing, don't you?

301
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,813
I'm afraid there's a theft of
some top secret documents

302
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:53,613
which are at this moment being
transported out of the country

303
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:56,269
- by some clever courier.
- Oh?

304
00:19:56,537 --> 00:20:01,038
That performance also requires
a certain daring and brilliance.

305
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:08,462
For all we know, he may be
on a ship from Bordeaux,

306
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:12,462
a train to Berlin or
even on this very plane.

307
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,433
The chap's have to travel
somewhere, I imagine.

308
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,026
Imagine the anxiety of such a man,

309
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,552
the tension he must be
feeling in the pit of his stomach.

310
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:25,955
I mean, if anyone knew who
he was or what he was carrying

311
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,685
his life wouldn't be worth
a moments purchase.

312
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:33,213
In certain circumstances,
you'd imagine he'd be prepared

313
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:38,019
to change his hazardous position
for one of a luxury, security,

314
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:41,015
and what's more important, safety.

315
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:44,777
- Don't you agree with me?
- Um, yes, err.

316
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:48,477
In other words, you will think that he'd
be prepared to enter into a negotiation

317
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:49,979
if the price were right?

318
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,551
Oh, he'd be a fool, not to.

319
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:54,323
I'm so glad you agreed
with me, Mr Morgan.

320
00:20:55,807 --> 00:21:00,807
Tell me, Mr Morgan, how many stars,
would you say, there were out there?

321
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,801
Well ...

322
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:09,485
- Stars ... in the sky, stars?
- Yes.

323
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,847
Well ... I don't know...

324
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:16,420
Off hand, I would say
way of in the thousands ...

325
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,836
- A 100 thousand.
- I think more than that.

326
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:25,621
-200 thousand?
- No, possibly a little bit more.

327
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,163
300 thousand.

328
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:32,865
I don't like to seem impertinent,
Mr Langston but that's the Milky Way.

329
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,685
Very well, Mr Morgan, how many
would you say there were?

330
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:42,981
Stars?  Well, I'd say about a million.

331
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,277
- A million?
- Yeah... about...

332
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:52,412
Very well Mr Morgan,
let us say a million.

333
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,988
Very well, Mr Langston, let's.
- Good.

334
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,608
Shall we say, lunch
tomorrow, at my hotel?

335
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,761
Yes, that would be very nice.

336
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,989
Noon, my suite, the Zonenhof.

337
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:08,497
- Oh, that's where I'm staying.
- Oh, what a coincidence.

338
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,170
Well, it's been fun Mr Langston,
the stars and everything

339
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:14,132
and I'll see you tomorrow.

340
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:18,391
- Oop!  Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- It's quite alright.

341
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:52,576
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- Gromek.

342
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:53,851
That's okay.

343
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,946
Are you positive we got two rooms?

344
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,532
- Of course.
- Okay.

345
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,351
- Oh mister, you dropped something.
- Gromek.

346
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:13,622
You're welcome.

347
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,705
- Cigarette?
- No, no thanks.

348
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:22,311
- I insist.
- Okay, if you insist, I'll be happy to.

349
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,658
Say, these are pretty mild, you know?
Well, Gromek very much.

350
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:34,223
You know, this is an
easy language to pick up.

351
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,187
But you can't put us both in the same
room, I won't sleep.  This man snores.

352
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,518
I'm sorry Herr Morgan,
but we're overcrowded.

353
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,100
For tonight there are no other room.

354
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:48,833
- But I distinctly told the man 2 rooms!
- I am very sorry.

355
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,099
Well, I know you're sorry, but listen
to me for one minute, my friend.

356
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,482
When this man snores,
it's like nothing human,

357
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:55,351
it's like it comes out of a
machine or something.

358
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,152
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:57,673
I know you're sorry,
but it isn't his fault.

360
00:23:57,892 --> 00:23:59,183
He's got a deviated septum,

361
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,715
and every time the cold air hits
his nose, it make the most awful...

362
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,116
What seems to be the trouble?

363
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:06,079
Oh, we've only got one room,
and my associate snores.

364
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,139
This young man is a
particular friend of mine.

365
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,391
I'd appreciate if you would
accommodate them both.

366
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:11,792
Yes, Mr Langston.

367
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,633
- Goodnight Mr Morgan.
- Goodnight Mr Langston, see you tomorrow.

368
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,005
- Noon, my suite.
- Yes, capital.

369
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:19,283
Ah, yes!

370
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,841
I find you can have
two adjoining rooms.

371
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,147
However, it's the old wing,
there are no private baths.

372
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,774
Oh, that's quite alright my good man.

373
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:31,390
Mr Brown will be in 311,
and you will be in 312.

374
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,413
- Gromek!
- No, Gromek is in 418

375
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,244
Easy language to pick up.

376
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,062
My key, please.

377
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:56,089
You know Jerry, you better take
this pill and get a good night's sleep.

378
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,311
Oh well, you know how I hate
to take these things, Marty.

379
00:24:58,312 --> 00:24:59,754
They always make me so groggy.

380
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,430
You've got to be clear-headed when
you see the doctor in the morning.

381
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,060
Now come on, get under
the covers and get some rest.

382
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:10,981
Nice and warm.

383
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,229
- Marty?
- Yeah.

384
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:16,486
You don't think the doctor is going to
find out I'm crazy or anything, do you?

385
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:17,687
Of course not.

386
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:22,333
- Now put your cigarette out, Jerry.
- I don't think I'm crazy.

387
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,789
I think I'm a little peculiar
but that's not crazy.

388
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,838
Well that's about all, now.  I want
you to get a good night's rest.

389
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,812
A lot of people are peculiar
but they are not crazy.

390
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:29,873
A lot of people are peculiar.

391
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:31,694
Of course I won't admit that
I'm high strung and nervous,

392
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:35,044
and irritable, sometimes I'm a little
over-talking but that certainly isn't crazy.

393
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:35,945
It's just peculiar.

394
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,443
- I'm high strung.
- I know that you're peculiar too.

395
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:40,915
But you're not crazy.
Nobody says you're crazy.

396
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:43,983
You won't be put away simply because
people said that you were peculiar.

397
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,313
I mean, nobody is going to put
anybody away.  I want you to go ...

398
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,795
In my business people have to be tough
it isn't high school ... but it's certainly not ...

399
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:51,741
- Go to sleep!
- Look, I know one thing,

400
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:54,214
I know crazy is crazy
and peculiar is peculiar.

401
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,233
- Are you through?
- Yeah.

402
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:57,665
Good night.

403
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,219
Marty?
Yeah?

404
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,835
Suppose after we've
gone all this trouble,

405
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:07,486
the doctor finds out there's
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

406
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,458
That would be very peculiar.
Goodnight.

407
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:18,255
- Yeah?
- Did you wish to be called in the morning?

408
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,946
- Yes, at 8 o'clock, please.
- Very well.

409
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:27,054
- Yes?
- Would you like also your breakfast sent up?

410
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:32,476
Oh yeah.  I'd like some orange juice,
and just toast and coffee, I guess.

411
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,990
- Very well.
- Okay.

412
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:37,904
What is it?
- When?

413
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,535
When?  When do you suppose?
First thing in the morning.

414
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,648
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to get some sleep.

415
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,027
Very well.

416
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:44,224
Snoring is better than this.
I'll go and sleep with Marty.

417
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,737
What are you doing here?

418
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:35,729
Where's Martha?
- Marty?

419
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:39,180
This is strictly a business trip,
and he knows it.  Now where is he?

420
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:42,454
Young man, I don't know who
you are or how you got here,

421
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:45,514
but if you're not out of my
room in exactly one minute,

422
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,760
I shall call the authorities.

423
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,184
Your room?

424
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:53,317
I'm terribly sorry.
This is a dreadful mistake, I...

425
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,284
You see, I took a sleeping pill last night.
I thought I was walking into Marty's room.

426
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,804
I had no idea I was
coming into this room.

427
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:00,481
I don't usually walk into Marty's
room either because he snores,

428
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,952
he has a deviated septum and
makes the most awful racket,

429
00:29:02,985 --> 00:29:05,788
but the radiator started go ...

430
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,786
Anything is better than
sleeping with the radiator

431
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,032
so I thought I'd go
into Marty's deviated ...

432
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:13,747
I had to be up early because I have
got to be at Dr Kreuger's clinic,

433
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,581
I mean Dr. Clinic's Kreuger ...

434
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:19,157
Well, it's been a very pleasant evening.
I do hope I'll see you again.

435
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:22,999
- If you don't mind.  My slippers...
- Slippers?

436
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,846
Well, thanks again.
... Er, pillow.

437
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,111
Thank you.
It's been wonderful.

438
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:38,312
Come on if you're going
to take a shower,

439
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,663
you got 45 minutes
to get over to Kreuger's.

440
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:44,885
Marty, the strangest thing happened.
I got up in the wrong room this morning.

441
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,047
You got a good night's sleep?

442
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:48,523
I don't know how I got
there.  I can't figure it out.

443
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,343
You'll feel better after
you take your shower.

444
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:52,887
Now pick up a hotel robe.
It's in the closet.

445
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:55,127
The washroom is down the
hall.   Now come on, hurry.

446
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,803
I don't want to miss my breakfast.

447
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,688
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Marty?

448
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,164
Who is Marty?

449
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,596
Listen, if this keeps up you'll
get us kicked out of Switzerland.

450
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:06,882
Young man, you are in the ladies shower room.

451
00:31:06,883 --> 00:31:11,647
I don't ... Ladies shower room?
Holy ... Ladies ...

452
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,661
If you're not out of here
in exactly 3 seconds...

453
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:18,422
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, this is
a dreadful mistake, really...

454
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:21,242
I could explain all this but
it would take too much time.

455
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:23,339
You see, I've got to be at
Dr. Clinic's Kreuger.

456
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,515
I mean, Dr Kreuger's clinic.

457
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:29,542
Like I told you before,
Marty has this nose trouble ...

458
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:32,570
- You see one of his nostril...
- I know, deviated septum.

459
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:36,609
- Oh, do you suffer over that too?
- Just get out!

460
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:39,128
Yes. I hate to bathe
and run like this but...

461
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:43,296
Like I told you I ...
- If you don't mind, my slippers...

462
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,813
Slippers?
Oh, slippers!

463
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:47,335
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:53,248
I could explain this,
but you'd never believe it.

465
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:00,091
Where is it?

466
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,770
The third door on the right, but lock
the door, they'll walk right in on you.

467
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,485
- Don't you understand? I'm Gromek.
- Hmm?

468
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:10,519
- Gromek.  G -R -O- M -E- K.
- Oh, that spells Gromek, all right.

469
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,907
Maybe this will help.

470
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:14,731
- I'm a friend of  Brodnik.
- Hmm?

471
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:18,131
Brodnik, B - R - O - D - N - I- K.

472
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:20,420
No, that doesn't help,
but you sure can spell.

473
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,132
Philips ask to mention the
name, Maurice Papinek?

474
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:26,670
Oh, Papinek!  Oh sure.
Are you a friend of Papinek?

475
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:29,707
- I am to contact you.
- You are?

476
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:34,383
Oh, of course, about the glue.
Well tell him it turned out just fine.

477
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,989
Turned out fine?

478
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:37,904
Yeah, I broke the head
of my dummy last night,

479
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,974
and he fixed it.
He did a beautiful job.

480
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:42,205
Oh, I see.

481
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:45,363
- I'm sorry to have troubled you.
- Oh, it's no trouble at all.

482
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,647
Oh, and by the way when you
see Papinek, give him my regards,

483
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,765
and tell him Gromek.
Gromek ever so much.

484
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,306
Gromek ever so much.

485
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,170
Gromek ever so much?

486
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:36,499
Good morning.

487
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,940
- I have a report from Paris.
- Well?

488
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:42,753
Morgan seems to be on the
verge of some sort of breakdown,

489
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:44,277
and he came here
for treatment.

490
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:46,853
Last night he broke his
dummy, and have it repaired

491
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:49,620
at the shop of a man
named ... Papinek.

492
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:54,596
Papinek!  Papinek ... that name.
Well, of course ...

493
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,486
Maurice Papinek the Perini ring.
Oh, how foolish of me.

494
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,629
Brodnik must have
brought the plans to Papinek,

495
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,566
and there's where they
stuck them into the dummy.

496
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,126
The red-headed fool is
nothing but a mailbox.

497
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:08,623
They just took the
dummy from the hotel.

498
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,242
Now let me know the
moment they get back.

499
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:13,894
We got to get hold of that
dummy at the first opportunity.

500
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:14,830
Very well.

501
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,937
Well, that's pretty much
the story, Dr Kreuger.

502
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,286
It's happen the same
way now, five times.

503
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:21,785
- I see.
- I meet a girl, fall in love with her.

504
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,547
When I begin to think of marriage,

505
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,671
Clarence suddenly comes
alive and breaks it up.

506
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,552
You're quite sure you wouldn't
like to see me work with him?

507
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,186
No, that won't be necessary.
And I have a practical suggestion.

508
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:35,188
A psycho-analyst who
practices in London,

509
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:39,074
and entirely familiar with my
technique, is here on consultation.

510
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:41,941
Now since you must
perform in England in 10 days,

511
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,811
I'd like this doctor
to observe this session,

512
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,762
and continue to
treat you in London.

513
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:50,970
- Oh, that's fine, doc.  Sure.
- Please have Dr Nordstrom come in.

514
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:54,472
I'm sure this will help us
achieve a short treatment,

515
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:55,992
and a rapid recovery.

516
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:58,702
Come in!

517
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,894
Well, hello!

518
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:07,567
Good morning.

519
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:10,311
Well, this is quite a surprise,
I didn't expect to see you here.

520
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,277
- You two know each other?
- No, not really.

521
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,234
We slept in the
same room last night.

522
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:18,776
I mean ... we took a shower together

523
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,009
Actually, we've
never been introduced.

524
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:27,129
This may take a little
longer than I thought.

525
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,521
We are...
- I'm sorry.

526
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,497
Our path crossed quite
accidentally, Dr Kreuger.

527
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:33,274
Yes.

528
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,810
- It was a normal mistake.
- Oh, quite normal, you see.

529
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,327
This radiator was going ...
and my friend who has this

530
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,773
deviated septum.
Oh, she has the same trouble.

531
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:43,115
Well, he gave me the
sleeping pill because he couldn't ...

532
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:45,554
- Prepare the injection.
- Yes doctor.

533
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,950
- Prepare the injection?
- Yes.

534
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:50,685
Give me your coat,
please, and lie down.

535
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:53,819
This was quite a normal mistake, I don't
think we need any injection for this.

536
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:57,162
- What kind of sort of an injection ...?
- Lie down and roll up your shirt.

537
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:00,968
- What kind of an injection is this?
- A simple painless injection Mr Morgan.

538
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:03,030
You will have a deep
sleep and talk freely.

539
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:06,251
I talk pretty freely, anyway.
I guess you've found that out by now.

540
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,793
Your sleeve, please.

541
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,812
Dr Nordstrom, I'd like to
explain about this morning.

542
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:15,176
I'm really not in the habit of
taking showers with strange women.

543
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,672
- Or even those I know very well.
- Please!

544
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:21,241
But I want to assure you, doctor, that
if I had to take a shower with someone,

545
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:24,852
there's no one in the world I would
rather... You'd better give me that shot.

546
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,392
Deep breath.

547
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:30,759
Gosh, I just can't get
over you being a doctor.

548
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:34,665
I mean, you're so ...
pretty for a doctor.

549
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:37,906
- No offense, Dr Kreuger.
- Relax Mr Morgan.

550
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,567
Gosh, I don't think of a
doctor as having such

551
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:44,742
beautiful blue eyes,
such lovely hair,

552
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:50,795
this pretty lips ...
You know, if I wouldn't ...

553
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:53,721
You're beautiful ...

554
00:36:55,974 --> 00:37:01,074
You're asleep now.  We're going
back, far back into the past.

555
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,910
Years are falling away.
And you're now a little boy.

556
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:11,037
Yes, I'm a little boy.
I'm a very little boy.

557
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:12,792
I'm a little boy.

558
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:16,489
I'm five years old and everybody
says I am cute and smart and bright.

559
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,922
But actually I'm the
most unhappiest, loneliest,

560
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,971
most miserablest little
boy in the whole world.

561
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,452
Tell me, Jerry, why
are you so unhappy?

562
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,440
Because my mummy and
daddy are always fighting

563
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:27,909
and yelling and
screaming at each other,

564
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:30,644
- and throwing things and everything.
- And why do they do that?

565
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:32,994
They have to.
They are married.

566
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:38,168
- You think that all married people fight?
- Yes, I do and I don't like it.

567
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:41,191
I don't like it one bit.  I hate it,
that's what I do. I just hate it.

568
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:44,094
Then I'm going to run away from home.
I'm going to go to China and Africa,

569
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:46,917
and I'm going to hunt tigers and lions
and I'm going to climb mountains.

570
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:49,801
- Why don't you?
- I'm not allowed to cross the street.

571
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,217
Tell me, Jerry, what do your
mummy and daddy do for a living?

572
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,575
Well the have Vaudeville act,

573
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:59,370
but they're always yelling and
fighting and screaming at each other.

574
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:00,351
Why do they fight?

575
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,980
Because mummy says that daddy is always
looking at Zelda, the fire eater and then,

576
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:08,275
- of course there's his drinking.
- I mean, just how bad is that?

577
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,295
I don't know, but mummy says that if
you can buy it, burn it or bottle it,

578
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,887
if he could sip it, swallow it
or gurgle it or gargle it

579
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,982
if you could squeeze it out of the
bottle or squeeze it out of a damp rag

580
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:20,473
or just put it in a glass
and swish it around

581
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:22,056
he'll drink it.

582
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:27,741
But, Jerry, isn't there anything about
your life, that's pleasant or happy?

583
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,579
Yes.

584
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:32,649
Yes there is.  When my
mummy and daddy go on the stage,

585
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,982
it's just beautiful.

586
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:39,199
All the colored lights go on,
and the music is playing.

587
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,007
It's the most wonderful thing.

588
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,535
- Hi Zelda.
- Hi dear.

589
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,440
Hey, how do you like
the new spaghetti joint?

590
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:56,096
Why don't you stick to your characting,
kid.   You're out of your class.

591
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,613
- Come on, move along!
- What's the matter with you, big mouth.

592
00:41:58,614 --> 00:41:59,355
I didn't say anything.

593
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:01,036
There's a big difference
between staring and watching?

594
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,500
- Hell, how was I in love with her?
- That's what you were thinking ...

595
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:06,544
Mummy, daddy, stop, stop, stop...

596
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:10,380
Mummy, daddy, stop it.
Stop it, mummy, daddy, stop it ...

597
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:14,403
Relax Jerry, please.
You're alright.  You're with friends.

598
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:18,187
What's your opinion, doctor?

599
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:24,345
It seems a rather standard case.  Lonely
child, product of a unhappy home life,

600
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:26,672
grows up with a strong
resistance to marriage.

601
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:28,940
Precisely.
And being a ventriloquist,

602
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:32,426
he uniquely expresses his
resistance through the dummy.

603
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,353
He needs concentrated therapy.

604
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:36,632
I suggest we both leave
for London immediately.

605
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:42,818
Good.  But remember, he must have
absolutely no contact with the dummy.

606
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,688
Doctor, there's just one thing.

607
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:50,900
The young man has already indicated
some sort of an attraction to me.

608
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,764
Do you think this would
endanger the treatment?

609
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:59,346
Well, I think that's a risk
we'll just have to take.

610
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:05,339
Jerry ... Jerry,
you can wake up now.

611
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:11,287
- Beautiful blue eyes, lovely hair...
- You can wake up now.

612
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:13,242
We are going to London.

613
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:17,068
We are?
That's nice.

614
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:23,597
This is very nice of you, Mr Langston.

615
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:25,820
To go out of your way
and give us a lift like this.

616
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:27,729
That is not out of my way at all.

617
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:31,265
As I explained to you, I had
an emergency call from London.

618
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:33,744
So I had to charter
this plane anyway.

619
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,396
- Well, I still think it's pretty nice.
- It's my pleasure.

620
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,875
And I hope when you get to London, you'll
come down to Langsmeyer, and visit me.

621
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:41,074
Oh, I'd like to.

622
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:43,404
I have many friends
who'd enjoy your company.

623
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:46,561
Perhaps you let me give
you cards to all my clubs.

624
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:48,084
Cards to your clubs?

625
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,239
Oh, that's very generous.  How
am I ever gonna repay you for this?

626
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:52,919
Don't mention it, my dear boy.

627
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:55,854
This sort of thing
carries its own reward.

628
00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:02,197
Now, if you, two young
people will excuse me,

629
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:04,214
I think I'll go and
get a bit of a nap.

630
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:09,886
- Perhaps you'd like a tea or sandwiches?
- No, thanks.  Maybe a little later on.

631
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:15,582
Isn't he a wonderful man?
He's so kind and fatherly.

632
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:18,965
It's terribly
important to you, isn't it?

633
00:44:19,342 --> 00:44:22,148
Yeah.
I wonder why?

634
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:27,298
Could it be that Godfrey Langston
seems strong, dependable,

635
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:31,759
everything that little Jerry Morgan
longed for and never had in the father?

636
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,952
Do you know, doctor,
you're awfully smart?

637
00:44:35,277 --> 00:44:38,483
This dependence of feelings could
be one of your basic problems.

638
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,245
Doctor, what are
doing for dinner tonight?

639
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:46,216
Mr Morgan, let me caution you,
from the outset that our relationship

640
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:49,485
must be completely and
strictly impersonal.  Is that clear?

641
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,584
Oh, yes, yes.

642
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:54,333
And, there is another thing
we'd have to guard against.

643
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:58,519
You see, in almost every
therapy the patient becomes

644
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:01,055
emotionally involved
with his analyst.

645
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,289
It can take various forms, of course.

646
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:09,999
But, as I am a woman and you
are a man, it's quite possible,

647
00:45:10,022 --> 00:45:11,851
that during the course of our work

648
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:14,777
you will even get the notion
that you're in love with me.

649
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:19,299
You know, it's amazing
how fast this stuff works.

650
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:32,605
And so the case of
Lafayette X.V.27 moves to England.

651
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:35,612
where, that night, at
Langsmeyer, his country estate,

652
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:39,508
Godfrey Langston, confident that
he possesses the complete plans,

653
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:43,314
starts negotiations for their
sale, to a man in Istanbul.

654
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:46,292
A man known only as Brutchik.

655
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,117
Tell Brutchik we have plans.

656
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:50,750
He's flying here at once.
He'll wire the time of arrival.

657
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:51,851
Excellent.

658
00:45:52,713 --> 00:45:56,152
Meanwhile, at the Royalton, a
nondescript hotel in the Soho district,

659
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:59,673
Gromek, confident that he
too has the complete plans,

660
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:02,896
has contacted
Maurice Papinek in Paris.

661
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,011
Papinek, delayed by police
surveillance assures Gromek

662
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:08,844
that will arrive in
London within 24 hours.

663
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:12,674
Later that evening, at
the Kensington Park Hotel,

664
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:16,805
Marty wasted no time, setting up
a conference with the British press.

665
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:21,279
" American ventriloquist
arrives from Paris. ".

666
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:26,803
Two dummies.
Lucky we picked the right one.

667
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,235
Thank you.

668
00:46:47,914 --> 00:46:49,914
"Always yours, darling: Richard"

669
00:46:54,536 --> 00:46:56,442
- Good morning, Mr Morgan.
- Good morning.

670
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,988
I brought you a few little posies.

671
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:03,577
Oh, thank you.  But I make it a practice
not to accept gifts from my patients.

672
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:07,257
If you don't mind, I'll give it to the
children at the clinic in which I work.

673
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:08,777
No, I don't mind at all.

674
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:11,308
- If you'll just sit down and relax.
- Over there?

675
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:15,108
- Yes, please, if you don't mind.
- No, I like sitting here, I think.

676
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:17,928
Very briefly, our technique is this.

677
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:20,769
I want you to say anything
that comes into your mind,

678
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,016
and I'll take notes of
the pertinent facts.

679
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:25,534
- So shall we start?
- Yeah.

680
00:47:26,774 --> 00:47:29,276
- Anything that comes into my mind?
- Yes, please.

681
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,487
- Who is Richard?
- Pardon?

682
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:39,556
- Who's the fella in the picture?
- Oh, just a friend of mine.

683
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:42,657
- American, isn't he?
- He was.

684
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:44,779
What do you mean "was"?
Is he dead?

685
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:47,887
Mr Morgan, I cautioned
you yesterday, didn't I?

686
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,280
Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm sorry.
I apologise.

687
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:52,068
Very well.
Let's proceed.

688
00:47:53,693 --> 00:47:56,552
I was born in Philadelphia,
right in the middle of a matinee.

689
00:47:57,425 --> 00:48:01,515
Then my family moved on to ...
Were you in love with him?

690
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:04,380
If that picture distracts
you, I'll remove it.

691
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,459
No, no, no.
It doesn't distract me.

692
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,942
I mean... I don't know even know the man.
Why should it ... it doesn't distract me.

693
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:15,470
Probably somebody was just
in love with it or something ...

694
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,027
Were you in love with him?

695
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:24,066
Quite obviously we can't proceed
until your curiosity is satisfied.

696
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:31,823
His name was Richard Thompson.
He was a pilot in the  American air force.

697
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:37,703
I was a nurse. We met. We fell in love.
During the invasion, he was killed.

698
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:41,004
- That's a shame.
- I always wanted to become a doctor.

699
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:44,892
I became a doctor and then an analyst.
And that's all.

700
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:48,237
Now, may we proceed,
please, Mr Morgan?

701
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:53,555
Yeah. After we left Philadelphia
we went ...  That's all?

702
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,519
That's all you've done?
Just been a doctor and nothing else?

703
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,629
- I beg your pardon?
- I mean, haven't you any social life

704
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,929
of romance, or dates or gone out
with men or people or anything?

705
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:06,990
- Really, Mr Morgan!
- Oh doctor, you're in a lot of trouble.

706
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,636
We gonna have to do
something about it.

707
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:10,261
I'm afraid we made
a dreadful mistake.

708
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:11,178
Now, wait a minute!

709
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:12,840
I'll see that you get a
competent male analyst.

710
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:15,270
I don't want a competent male
analyst, I am very happy with you.

711
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,040
But you're stubborn
and refuse to cooperate!

712
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:19,966
That's not true.  You told me to say
anything that came  into my mind.

713
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:21,473
- Yes.
- Alright, I mentioned Richard.

714
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:22,434
What if I did?

715
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:23,898
Suppose I had a horse
once named Richard,

716
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,194
and he kicked me in
the head or something.

717
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,408
That's quite possible.

718
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,297
You know what I think?

719
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,049
I think that if can't
mention Richard,

720
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:32,418
it doesn't necessarily mean that
there's something wrong with me,

721
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:33,958
it might mean there's
something wrong with you.

722
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:35,634
And you ought to do
something about it right away.

723
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:38,231
- I'll call Dr Manfred.
- I don't want Dr Manfred, I want you.

724
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,362
I mean, I need a
young and beautiful doctor

725
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:42,306
and you're just what
the doctor ordered, doc.

726
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:45,007
- I've had quite enough of this Mr Morgan.
- Now, let's face the facts.

727
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:47,841
When is the last time a
man held you in his arms?

728
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:50,622
When is last time a man told you,
you were young and beautiful?

729
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:53,928
- And you are young and beautiful.
- Mr Morgan, would you please go?

730
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:55,610
No, not until I finish
what I've got to say.

731
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,303
What are you fighting?
What are you so dreadfully afraid of?

732
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,348
I find it absolutely impossible
to work with you, Mr Morgan.

733
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:04,412
- So would you please go.
- Alright, I'll go.

734
00:50:04,437 --> 00:50:06,868
But there's a darn side more wrong
with you than there is with me

735
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:07,740
and I'll prove it to you.

736
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:11,005
- If you don't mind, my umbrella, please.
- Oop, sorry.

737
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:36,307
" Sigmund Freud"
"Introduction to Psychoanalysis. ".

738
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:56,380
Possessively approaches and
hidden in the unconscious and ...

739
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:59,041
Oh good morning.  I'd like
to see Dr Nordstrom please.

740
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:01,756
I'm sorry.  This is the
doctor's day at the clinic.

741
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,468
Oh, well I'm sure it will
only take a few minutes.

742
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,796
Oh good morning, doctor.

743
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:07,283
I haven't reach
Dr Manfred yet, but I will.

744
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:08,705
So will you excuse me.

745
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,232
Oh, you don't have
to reach Dr Manfred.

746
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:12,249
I have been up all night
studying your problem,

747
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,092
and I think I've got the answer.
It's very common, it's in all the books.

748
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:19,160
All you've got is a little
"guilt complex" that's all.

749
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:23,048
You see, you are a victim
obsessive reproaches,

750
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:25,429
and obsessive reproaches are
hidden in the unconscious mind.

751
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,366
Do you understand?

752
00:51:26,473 --> 00:51:28,973
As Heinrich Lastvogel said...
Wait a minute!

753
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,874
Don't you understand?
You are regressive.

754
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:41,701
And regression is a defense
mechanism used against guilt feelings

755
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:46,571
rationalized again and again for distorted
use of the gratification of the Oedipus.

756
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,789
Listen to me, for just
one minute, please.

757
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:12,080
Look, forget all those big words.

758
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:14,803
I don't know what they mean
anyway.  But I do know this.

759
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:17,523
I know that you loved Richard
and Richard loved you.

760
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:22,265
And when he died, you felt kind of guilty
because it was him instead of you.

761
00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:23,930
Don't you understand?

762
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:26,610
You're blaming yourself for
something that isn't your fault.

763
00:52:26,612 --> 00:52:29,860
It's like punishing yourself
because you didn't die too.

764
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:33,574
Don't you see that?

765
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:37,881
It's true, isn't it?

766
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:41,416
I just didn't think it showed.

767
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:44,883
Maybe you will feel
better if you talk about it.

768
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:46,380
- No, I'm...
- Oh, please.

769
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:51,939
- I don't ...
- It sometimes helps.  Just talk.

770
00:52:56,687 --> 00:53:00,600
This is where it all happened.
The town where Richard was stationed,

771
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,310
and hospital where I was a nurse.

772
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:06,967
I come here every week,
work at the clinic,

773
00:53:08,114 --> 00:53:09,714
visit his grave ...

774
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,421
Why don't you keep talking?

775
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:24,773
Just received a wire, sir.  Mr Brutchik
has left Istanbul.  He arrives tonight.

776
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:16,281
- Are you sure you won't have a drink?
- Oh, no, no.

777
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,377
You know what's the funny
thing about me and drinking.

778
00:54:18,617 --> 00:54:21,322
All I have to do is smell the
cork, I fall flat on my face...

779
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,768
Now do you suppose your father's
drinking has anything to do with the ...?

780
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:28,442
This is your patient
not mine, remember?

781
00:54:29,738 --> 00:54:33,538
- Would you like to dance?
- You may be sorry.

782
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:36,065
I'll probably be all feet.

783
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,567
And with the rest of you, makes
it so worthwhile.  Come on.

784
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:58,970
<i> I never dreamed, but
I've been dreaming lately,</i>

785
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,877
<i>all about you,</i>

786
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:08,263
<i>Whatever I do,
My thoughts are,</i>

787
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:12,145
<i>all about you,</i>

788
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:18,340
<i>You're so caressable,
sweet and blessable,</i>

789
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:22,031
<i>so unguessable too</i>

790
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:28,856
<i>that I'm in a spin
because of inaccessible you,</i>

791
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,094
<i>What will I do?</i>

792
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:37,171
<i>The friends I call, that
I've been calling lately.</i>

793
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:40,590
<i>I call about you,</i>

794
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:46,833
<i>And not just a few,
I want to tell them,</i>

795
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,650
<i>all about you.</i>

796
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:56,433
<i>Is it unbelievable or conceivable,</i>

797
00:55:56,601 --> 00:56:00,022
<i>you care at all about me.</i>

798
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:07,438
<i>Do you want my arms
as I do all about you.</i>

799
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:32,019
<i>Is it unbelievable or conceivable,</i>

800
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,966
<i>you care at all about me.</i>

801
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:45,227
<i>Do you want my arms
as I do, all about you.</i>

802
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,514
Well Mr Brutchik, what do you think?

803
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:59,943
Very good, very good.
Now show me the second half.

804
00:56:59,944 --> 00:57:01,993
The second half?

805
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,429
This is only the primary mechanism.
There's a triggering device?

806
00:57:05,457 --> 00:57:11,356
- There's a second blueprint?
- Second blueprint?  Two halves?

807
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:17,055
Why of course, that picture in
the paper.  The two dummies.

808
00:57:17,084 --> 00:57:18,785
If this is some sort of a game?

809
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:22,119
Telephone London.  Tell our friends
to go to Morgans Hotel immediately,

810
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:25,295
and get that blueprint from the
other dummy.  And I don't care how.

811
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:26,214
Yes, sir.

812
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:29,143
Don't worry, we'll
get the other half.

813
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:31,201
Contact me when you do.

814
00:57:45,649 --> 00:57:49,056
- Oh, it was a really wonderful day.
- Wasn't it, doc?

815
00:57:49,496 --> 00:57:52,941
- I can't remember having a nicer time.
- No?

816
00:57:53,214 --> 00:57:55,760
Oh, it was very kind of you
making me do all those things,

817
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:59,922
- I haven't done for years.
- I couldn't be more pleased.

818
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:06,004
Do you suppose I could come back
tomorrow, as a patient, I mean?

819
00:58:07,136 --> 00:58:10,584
- I don't see why not?
- Good.

820
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:13,962
- Well ...
- Yes?

821
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:18,568
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

822
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:22,519
What time is my appointment?

823
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,680
I'll be early.

824
00:59:06,655 --> 00:59:09,688
You go to Morgans Hotel now,
tonight, and get the other plan.

825
00:59:09,706 --> 00:59:11,297
And nothing will stop you.

826
00:59:12,452 --> 00:59:14,912
- When do I get paid?
- You will go now.

827
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:19,048
- Not till I get my money.
- You will go now,

828
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:22,321
or you will have very
little use for money.

829
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:37,924
- Good evening, sir.
- Sure is!

830
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:31,458
Hello.

831
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:35,133
Where have you been all day?  Not a call,
not a word.   I've been worried sick.

832
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:36,973
Boy, have I got news for you.

833
01:01:37,123 --> 01:01:41,015
I have got great news for you.
I'm in love, Marty, really in love.

834
01:01:41,016 --> 01:01:41,734
What?

835
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:44,107
Yeah, with the most
beautiful doctor in the world.

836
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:47,319
- Now don't start that again. You're ...
- No, this time it's different.

837
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,394
- It's always different.
- But this is, Marty, honestly, it is.

838
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:53,160
I can't stop it, you can't
stop it, she can't stop it.

839
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:55,341
I'll tell you something.
Not even Clarence can stop it.

840
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:56,053
Clarence?

841
01:01:56,054 --> 01:01:57,983
Yeah, I'll get him out
and prove it to you.

842
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:01,609
Jerry, you can't do that.   You're
in no shape to go near that dummy.

843
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,550
Now listen, I'm not dressed.  Will you
please come down here and talk to me?

844
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:07,102
Just talk to me before
you do something silly.

845
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:10,664
Alright, you're still a nervous wreck,
but I'll come around and see you.

846
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:58,042
It's quite obvious you won't find what
you're looking for, because we have it.

847
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:01,630
Just as it's quite obvious that
you have what we're looking for.

848
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:03,234
Get up!

849
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,255
Where is the blueprint?
Where is it?

850
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,010
Where is it?

851
01:03:10,355 --> 01:03:11,453
You will pay?

852
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,871
You'll be well taken care of.
Where is it?

853
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:16,858
- Papinek.
- Where?

854
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:19,985
- Royalton Hotel, room 314.
- How do I know?

855
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:26,723
- Here ... key.
- Key proves nothing.

856
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,940
Get him on the phone.

857
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:37,105
Please get the Royalton hotel.
Yes, thank you.

858
01:03:38,262 --> 01:03:39,093
What do I say?

859
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:41,823
Tell him you have the blueprint
and we'll be right over.

860
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,970
Royalton Hotel?
Please, get me room 314.

861
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:53,809
- Hello?
- Hello... Papinek?

862
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,901
- Yes.
- Gromek.

863
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:01,019
I have it.  I come now.

864
01:04:02,953 --> 01:04:04,453
Walk!

865
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:08,434
Walk!

866
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:13,226
Open it!

867
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:52,459
Clarence!
Terence!

868
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,057
U... mm... murder.

869
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:09,581
Murder!

870
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:16,576
Hello?  There has been a murder, would
you send the police up here, ... body...

871
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,377
Help!

872
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:22,175
Uh ... murder!  Help police,
somebody ... Murder!

873
01:05:22,337 --> 01:05:24,344
Police ...!
don't go away ...

874
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:28,281
Police, murder, help!
Murder, police, police, help!

875
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:31,771
There has been a murder in my room!
Send for the police!  Help!

876
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:34,888
Murder, here, murder!
Police, help!

877
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,109
... and then I opened the closet and
there was this fella stuck on my door.

878
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:47,638
- Marty!
- Jerry, what have you done?

879
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:50,609
What have I done?  You don't
think for one minute I had ...

880
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,600
Listen to me, I told
you not to go near ...

881
01:05:51,602 --> 01:05:54,168
- Marty, don't you believe me?
- All right, man, just give me the knife.

882
01:05:54,193 --> 01:05:56,162
What's the matter, you all gone crazy or something?

883
01:05:56,163 --> 01:05:57,705
I tell you I came in here,
I opened the closet,

884
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:00,823
and there was this character stuck
up on it like a big piece of shashlik

885
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,337
- a great big piece of shashlik.
- Just give us the knife.

886
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:04,020
And then I looked down, and
there was Clarence and Terence,

887
01:06:04,022 --> 01:06:06,048
so badly slashed I couldn't
tell Terence from Clarence

888
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:08,272
- or Clarence from Terence!
- Alright laddie, the knife.

889
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:09,946
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course I believe you!

890
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:11,507
You do not.
I know what you're thinking.

891
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:13,156
Go on, say it.
I'm a killer!

892
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:16,539
I knife people all the time.  Sure
I've got buddies all over, haven't I?

893
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:19,076
Why don't you look around,
What about the body under the bed,

894
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:21,502
or the one in the bathroom,
or this one in here!

895
01:06:23,635 --> 01:06:25,135
I didn't do it!

896
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:13,839
"Welcome Sons of Hibernia"
( Hibernia = Latin name for Ireland ).

897
01:08:32,059 --> 01:08:34,010
- Well, what did he do?
- What did he do?

898
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,320
- Oh, you mean Monahan?
- How did he fight his way out?

899
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,146
Fight...  well ...

900
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:57,611
- What did he say?
- Right in the face!
- Oh!

901
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:18,601
Oh, figure it out.

902
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:20,654
You mean when Molly fell
into the whiskey tank?

903
01:09:20,655 --> 01:09:22,523
How did he save her from drowning?

904
01:09:59,845 --> 01:10:02,245
- He figured it out!
- Right!

905
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:20,510
- That's a charming voice you have.
- Thank you.

906
01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:30,801
That's a jolly note you got to your voice
me boy.  What did you say your name was?

907
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,828
Well, I didn't say exactly.

908
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:36,207
Patrick Michael Carmedi, junior.

909
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:38,661
Would that be the
Patrick Michael Carmedi Junior

910
01:10:38,662 --> 01:10:40,675
or Patrick Michael Carmedi Senior?

911
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:45,264
- Oh, why wouldn't they know!
- Gentlemen, this is Carmedi boy!

912
01:10:46,351 --> 01:10:50,451
This calls for a drink in memory
of his dear departed father.

913
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:54,826
Come on me lad, we must drink
to your dear departed father,

914
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:57,039
the past President
of this organization.

915
01:10:57,061 --> 01:10:59,462
And one of the plentiest
drinking when we ever had.

916
01:10:59,557 --> 01:11:00,929
Set him up, double.

917
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:03,660
Well now, when it comes to drinking,
gentlemen, really, I'm not like my father.

918
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:06,643
Now, now no modesty.
We've heard all about you.

919
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:08,289
- You heard?
- Like father, like son.

920
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:12,260
What kind of a drink is that
should be given a Carmedi boy?

921
01:11:12,546 --> 01:11:14,648
- No, no, way I finish this thing!
- Here you are, relax.

922
01:11:15,816 --> 01:11:19,269
- To your dear departed father.
- For my dear departed father.

923
01:11:19,403 --> 01:11:20,903
- Bottoms up.
- Bottom up.

924
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,237
As fine and decent
a man has ever graced

925
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,333
the good green south
of the blessed ... hill

926
01:11:27,368 --> 01:11:28,907
- Him self!
- Him self!

927
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,644
Ah, good companion, a fine
father and a loving husband!

928
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:35,168
- Ah, him self!
- Him self!

929
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:41,049
A man who is trustworthy alive,
friendly, courteous, kindest,

930
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:44,994
and cheerful, obedient, clean, reverent.
Bottoms up.

931
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:52,761
I finished it!

932
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,178
Of course you did,
you're Carmedi's boy!

933
01:11:55,188 --> 01:11:58,988
I know, it's funny, I usually
take one drink, and I go ...

934
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,359
Ah, the poor boy!

935
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,331
Strong lungs but a weak stomach.

936
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,019
We can't let the poor lad lay on
the floor, we'll take him to his lodge.

937
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:09,050
- Alright, look for his key.
- Oh, that I will.

938
01:12:10,267 --> 01:12:14,181
Here it is.
Royalton Hotel, room 314.

939
01:12:14,283 --> 01:12:16,016
That's just down the street.
- Come on now.

940
01:12:16,097 --> 01:12:17,697
Well, come along lad,
we'll take you there.

941
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:32,476
He was kind, courteous, always obedient,
cheerful, frisky, pleasant and ...

942
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:44,490
Hello.

943
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:47,415
It's noon sir.  Would you
like your brunch sent up?

944
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,377
Ahh?  Oh yeah ...

945
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:09,787
Royalton?

946
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:20,101
Well, would you get me,
Strand 4110 please?

947
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:32,921
Hello?
Oh, Jerry...

948
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:38,226
Yes... yes I can go.

949
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,075
- Are you alright?
- I don't remember very much.

950
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:46,022
I need you very bad.  I
think I'm in desperate trouble.

951
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:48,177
There was murder last
night, I didn't do them.

952
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,599
- I know you didn't.
- Where is he?

953
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:54,626
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes, of course I believe you.

954
01:13:56,106 --> 01:13:58,655
Tell me, Jerry, where are you?

955
01:13:59,955 --> 01:14:03,361
I'm in Room 314 at
the Royalton Hotel.

956
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:07,423
Darling, I've got to see you.
Would you please come right over.

957
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:11,494
You just stay there.
I'll come right over.

958
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,271
Royalton Hotel.
Room 314.

959
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:23,495
- You'd better come along with us doctor.
- Yes.

960
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:37,193
- Who is there?
- Your brunch sir.

961
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:40,412
Just a minute.

962
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:48,911
Good afternoon sir.
Your brunch.

963
01:14:49,548 --> 01:14:51,291
Er, just nicked myself shaving.

964
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:54,193
Oh, you ain't the only
one who's cut up sir.

965
01:14:54,738 --> 01:14:56,340
Take a look at this.

966
01:14:57,279 --> 01:14:59,169
I'll get the table out.

967
01:15:03,598 --> 01:15:05,098
Papinek!

968
01:15:07,618 --> 01:15:10,324
The Ripper!
The Red Headed Ripper!

969
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:13,060
No... no... I'm good.
Wait.

970
01:15:13,095 --> 01:15:16,195
- Help! Murder!
- I am not a murderer.

971
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:18,711
Help!  Police!

972
01:16:38,986 --> 01:16:45,296
" Langleys "... Langleys, Langston!
Got to get on to Langstons!

973
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,254
Sorry.  Mustn't miss my bus.

974
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:05,433
It's the Ripper!

975
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:13,886
Sorry.

976
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,420
Oop!
I'm terribly sorry.

977
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,970
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

978
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:17,230
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

979
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:18,737
Could I be of assistance?

980
01:18:18,938 --> 01:18:22,856
Possibly, I don't think so at the moment.
I'm just merely looking around.

981
01:18:22,891 --> 01:18:25,237
- But, devilish look familiar...
- Oh, really?

982
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:28,171
- Hey, have we met?
- I don't think so, old man, I...

983
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:31,142
I haven't been here, actually.  I have
been abroad, you see.  At Prevaling,

984
01:18:31,152 --> 01:18:33,344
Foreign Office Indra,
that sort of thing, really.

985
01:18:33,345 --> 01:18:35,104
Ah, India ...  yes.

986
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:38,701
Did mountain climbing there, it's
rather good fun this time of the year.

987
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:43,440
Snow covered slopes, antelope
tracks, sheeing and zorted

988
01:18:43,638 --> 01:18:45,500
good sport, you know.

989
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:49,027
- What do you think of the Himalayas?
- I beg your pardon?

990
01:18:49,293 --> 01:18:51,476
I said, what do you
think of the Himalayas?

991
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:54,759
Loved him, hated her.

992
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,927
Was there any particular
model you had in mind?

993
01:19:00,993 --> 01:19:03,569
I don't know, actually ...

994
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:07,313
possibly 4 wheel, perhaps an engine
or some sort things you see ...

995
01:19:07,321 --> 01:19:10,278
Maybe you're interested in this
one of our most popular models,

996
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:12,612
The custom built sports vehicle.

997
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,572
Automatic transmission,
deluxe 5 side walls,

998
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:20,652
high compression, overhead valves,
extremely low petrol consumption,

999
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,138
4 wheel hydraulic
pepper touch brakes,

1000
01:19:23,237 --> 01:19:25,403
single sheet glare-proof windscreen,

1001
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,445
- and conservatively priced at 1750 pounds.
- I say that is rather conservative ...

1002
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:33,101
Could you tell me, what that red
thing, sitting out there, so attractive?

1003
01:19:33,117 --> 01:19:35,031
That's our super
automatic demonstrator.

1004
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:38,792
Demonstrator?  Do you suppose
we could go out for a bit of a spin?

1005
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,916
Unfortunately, can't leave the floor, huh?
- Oh, pity.

1006
01:19:40,924 --> 01:19:42,042
Do you care to take it out yourself?

1007
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,253
I'd be delighted to.  If you just give
me the keys, I should be most happy.

1008
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:47,026
- I'll be back quickly.
- Let me explain about starting this ...

1009
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:51,044
No need at all.  It isn't necessary. You
see I'm absolutely wizard with no help.

1010
01:19:51,065 --> 01:19:52,944
The governor would know
that I'm mechanical ...

1011
01:19:52,952 --> 01:19:55,148
- That's you, huh
- Not at all. Goodbye.

1012
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:56,747
- Cheerio.
- Ever so tall.

1013
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:03,042
Aw, there you are!  Exactly
how to find a salesman here.

1014
01:20:03,043 --> 01:20:06,199
- I say, are you free?
- No, you see, I'm a ...

1015
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:09,933
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Anything I can show you, sir?

1016
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:13,243
Well, I am terribly interested in the new
"Superb".  Is it as automatic as they say?

1017
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:14,314
Oh, good heavens, yes.

1018
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:17,677
It's one of the most automatic automatics
we have in all the automatics here.

1019
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:19,750
- This is a two-seater?
- Two seater?  Yes ...

1020
01:20:19,754 --> 01:20:22,184
Well I'm rather tall you know and
I try to have the seat set back.

1021
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:24,096
Well our seats set are
back at lovelier at the moment.

1022
01:20:24,097 --> 01:20:26,169
And for the moment our seat sets
are back to arrives back yard,

1023
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,295
they'll have them set
your seat for you ... back.

1024
01:20:28,296 --> 01:20:30,070
Well, I'm not awfully
keen on this color,

1025
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:32,615
- but I saw one out there.
- But we do have its own demonstrator.

1026
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:33,357
Red?

1027
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:35,010
Yes.  Perhaps that color
would suits you better.

1028
01:20:35,015 --> 01:20:37,482
You will just come along with me.  I
should be most happy to explain it to you.

1029
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,130
Oh, yes.
It's very nice.

1030
01:20:49,257 --> 01:20:50,238
Very nice lines.

1031
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:53,136
Oh, there is a very interesting
feature here I must show you.

1032
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:53,921
Oh, what is it?

1033
01:20:53,922 --> 01:20:56,893
Well, it's our overhead underslung
isolating compression decraminator.

1034
01:20:56,928 --> 01:20:59,276
- What does it decraminate?
- The Degasca chamber.

1035
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,140
Curious, it looks
just like the hubcap.

1036
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:04,374
What does it matter effect it is except
when you're decraminating of course,

1037
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:07,159
which only during low gears
out in the open road.  What?

1038
01:21:07,213 --> 01:21:10,128
- It has everything, hasn't it?
- Hasn't it, and ...

1039
01:21:12,374 --> 01:21:15,504
- I say, shall we get cracking?
- Good idea.
- Yes.

1040
01:21:21,742 --> 01:21:26,664
Here we are.  I could just
find the ignition here ... and

1041
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:31,528
Ignition here ... well ...
yes, here ...

1042
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:35,556
- Which is the ignition?
- It was here a moment ago...

1043
01:21:35,738 --> 01:21:37,634
Oh you see, this is one of
our very special feature ...

1044
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:40,442
Oh you know, super
concealed.  Prevent stealing.

1045
01:21:40,635 --> 01:21:45,245
Occasionally, prevents driving.
Ha, ha, this is one of the witty one.

1046
01:21:45,274 --> 01:21:49,693
Oh yes, here we are.  You put it
in here exactly, and here we go.

1047
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:51,818
Oh, I see.  It's the wrong button.

1048
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:53,452
Oh, terribly sorry.

1049
01:22:38,508 --> 01:22:41,508
- Decraminating quite a bit, isn't it.
- Yes.

1050
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:49,065
I thought perhaps, you'd
like to see it all at once.

1051
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,249
Thank you, but...
some another time.

1052
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:54,499
- Thank you.
- Yes ...

1053
01:23:17,313 --> 01:23:19,013
Get me the police!

1054
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:31,187
- Thank you.  Morgan has stolen a car.
- A car?

1055
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,353
Do you have any idea
where he might be heading?

1056
01:23:33,754 --> 01:23:35,024
No.

1057
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:39,371
No, he doesn't know anybody in
London but myself and Marty and ...

1058
01:23:40,575 --> 01:23:42,943
You don't suppose he's
gone to see Mr Langston?

1059
01:23:42,944 --> 01:23:45,400
- Who?
- Godfrey Langston.

1060
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:47,745
He was friend to
Jerry in Switzerland.

1061
01:23:48,021 --> 01:23:50,823
- Jerry was terribly impressed.
- I see.

1062
01:23:52,668 --> 01:23:54,818
Get me Godfrey Langston.

1063
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:03,575
Very well, we'll be on the
lookout.  Thank you, Inspector.

1064
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:07,016
That idiot, Morgan may
be a little toothache.

1065
01:24:07,038 --> 01:24:09,544
If he turns up, hold
him and inform the police.

1066
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,151
- Mr Brutchik has arrived, sir.
- Oh, good.

1067
01:24:33,546 --> 01:24:37,019
Hello, I'm Jerry Morgan.  You wait a
minute, I'm a friend of Mr Langston!

1068
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:40,158
- He's going to give me cards to his clubs.
- Call the police!

1069
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,301
Let's get this over with
as quickly as possible.

1070
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:18,946
I trust you're not wasting my time.

1071
01:25:19,144 --> 01:25:20,925
I cannot understand
why it's taken so long.

1072
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:23,942
You realize, my dear, Brutchik, this
is no ordinary case of espionage.

1073
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:26,973
You have the plans?
Please, be seated.

1074
01:25:28,653 --> 01:25:32,753
- This is not a trick, you are sure?
- Study them yourself.

1075
01:25:33,313 --> 01:25:37,923
You will find, you are now in complete
possession of Lafayette X.V.27.

1076
01:25:40,829 --> 01:25:43,945
Two simple blueprints which hold
the greatest power of annihilation

1077
01:25:43,946 --> 01:25:45,000
the world has ever known.

1078
01:25:45,003 --> 01:25:49,224
Ah yes, excellent!  No question
about these being the complete plans.

1079
01:25:49,725 --> 01:25:52,365
Very good.
Very good, indeed.

1080
01:25:57,965 --> 01:26:01,969
Whoever controls this weapon,
may well control the world.

1081
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:04,262
What are you trying to say?

1082
01:26:04,463 --> 01:26:07,824
I'm suggesting a
renegotiation of our agreement.

1083
01:26:08,171 --> 01:26:10,825
- What do you mean, renegotiation?
- Just that.

1084
01:26:11,294 --> 01:26:14,455
- Renegotiation of the money.
- I'm sorry.

1085
01:26:14,659 --> 01:26:17,668
- Brutchik, you realize ...?
- You realize this,

1086
01:26:17,808 --> 01:26:21,348
I'm about at the end of patience.
We have made a commitment.

1087
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:25,755
Arm and generous commitment.
I've lived up to my end of the bargain,

1088
01:26:25,787 --> 01:26:27,395
and expect you to do likewise.

1089
01:26:27,481 --> 01:26:30,150
You realize that we run
more risks than planned.

1090
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:32,735
That's entirely your
affair my dear Langston.

1091
01:26:32,843 --> 01:26:36,258
You made the dealing.  What do you
mean more risk than planned?

1092
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:39,045
- Four men have had to be killed.
- Four men!

1093
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:44,511
- Brodnik, Gromek, Papinek.
- And Shaslik!  Oh...

1094
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:49,901
Hello.

1095
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:54,168
- Morgan's here, somewhere in the house
- Yes, I know.  Take him.

1096
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,196
Take your hands off me!

1097
01:26:57,883 --> 01:27:00,534
- How convenient Mr Morgan.
- Don't you sweet talk me.

1098
01:27:00,564 --> 01:27:03,585
You are a murderer, that's all!
A spy, a traitor and murderer!

1099
01:27:03,628 --> 01:27:06,690
And I'll tell you something else.  You
don't have to send me cards to your clubs.

1100
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,077
- I don't want them now.
- Have you notified the police?

1101
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,120
I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of
this young man before they arrive.

1102
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:14,144
Quickly and not too much of a mess.

1103
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,383
Make it look like self-defense.

1104
01:27:15,384 --> 01:27:17,462
What's the matter, did
you run out of knives?

1105
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,554
I'm sorry about this, old
man.  I rather liked you.

1106
01:27:20,555 --> 01:27:22,102
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

1107
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:24,990
I shan't haggle.
Take this and go.

1108
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:27,120
The plane for Istanbul
leaves at 11 o'clock.

1109
01:27:27,129 --> 01:27:29,950
11 o'clock plane to Istanbul, eh?
It's lucky we got here in time.

1110
01:27:29,983 --> 01:27:31,741
Put up your hands!
You are all under arrest!

1111
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:33,556
Fool around with
Scotland Yard, will you?

1112
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,200
All right you spies, unhand that man!

1113
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:43,298
Run quickly after him!

1114
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,020
Quick!  After him!
He mustn't reach London alive!

1115
01:28:49,696 --> 01:28:51,196
Thank you.

1116
01:28:51,437 --> 01:28:54,843
He's escaped from Langston
after making an attempt on his life.

1117
01:28:56,048 --> 01:28:58,357
I just can't believe them.

1118
01:28:58,969 --> 01:29:01,609
An all points report :
Morgan's headed towards London.

1119
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:05,605
I want him taken, alive if
possible, but take no chances.

1120
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:08,189
Repeat : Take no chances.

1121
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,147
Hello, nice to see you again.

1122
01:29:37,475 --> 01:29:43,225
- Nice looking chap. I wonder who he is?
- I'll ask him next time, Sue.

1123
01:29:50,456 --> 01:29:51,956
Audrey.

1124
01:30:05,497 --> 01:30:07,737
- Where can I find Miss Greene?
- Who?

1125
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:12,828
You'll find her upstairs.
Dressing room number 3.

1126
01:30:12,829 --> 01:30:13,949
Okay.  Thanks.

1127
01:30:20,514 --> 01:30:21,539
- Audrey.
- Oh, no!

1128
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,640
Audrey, you've got to help me.

1129
01:30:22,736 --> 01:30:23,822
Don't you come near me!

1130
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,950
Don't believe the papers.  I am innocent,
Audrey.  You've got to call the police.

1131
01:30:25,951 --> 01:30:27,540
- Sure Jerry.  Anything.
- There's a man called Brutchik.

1132
01:30:27,575 --> 01:30:29,622
He's going to blow up the whole world.
Don't you understand that?

1133
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:31,614
Now look, they won't believe
me but they will believe you.

1134
01:30:31,623 --> 01:30:32,636
You ... you've got to go to the police

1135
01:30:32,637 --> 01:30:35,454
and tell them to stop the 11 o'clock
plane to Istanbul, do you understand?

1136
01:30:35,489 --> 01:30:37,056
- The man's name is Brutchik.
- Oh, Brutchik.

1137
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:40,240
- Now hurry up, Audrey.
- Now, you stay right here and don't you move.

1138
01:30:40,275 --> 01:30:42,565
Istanbul.
Brutchik is the man's name.

1139
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:09,584
Murray, would you hurry up!
Why you always the last one?

1140
01:31:09,585 --> 01:31:11,186
All right, all right.

1141
01:31:15,259 --> 01:31:18,263
Get over here as fast as you can.
He's stark raving mad.

1142
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:21,747
Yes, Jeffrey's in my dressing room.

1143
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:32,557
Oh, you take that side,
and I'll cover this.

1144
01:32:05,154 --> 01:32:06,654
Come on Boris, hurry up.

1145
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:18,235
Take me, I'm innocent!

1146
01:40:19,466 --> 01:40:22,198
I know that you're making a terrible
mistake. You should stop Brutchik.

1147
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:24,476
He's on the 11 o'clock
plane to Istanbul.

1148
01:40:24,548 --> 01:40:26,299
Oh darling, you should
have believed me.

1149
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,800
But I do, Jerry.  I do.

1150
01:40:27,804 --> 01:40:29,339
They don't understand?
Don't you understand.

1151
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:32,023
Brutchik is on the plane to Istanbul.
He'll blow up the whole world!

1152
01:40:32,058 --> 01:40:34,271
- Go on Medical, get some brandy.
- I am not hysterical.

1153
01:40:34,295 --> 01:40:35,924
Morgan, are you ready
to make a confession?

1154
01:40:35,981 --> 01:40:38,482
Look, I'll tell you everything,
if you'll just listen to me.

1155
01:40:38,553 --> 01:40:40,053
- Stenographer!
- I'll take it down.

1156
01:40:40,121 --> 01:40:42,524
It's all so simple,
anybody could understand it.

1157
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,230
There was Brodnik and Gromek,
and Shaslik and Brutchik.

1158
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:46,614
Now Gromek got it from Brodnik

1159
01:40:46,615 --> 01:40:48,950
who brought it to Shaslik
who in turn gave it to Brutchik.

1160
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:51,560
You see, the stuff was in
Clarence, but it was also in Terence.

1161
01:40:51,567 --> 01:40:54,117
Now they didn't know Clarence from
Terence, or Terence from Clarence,

1162
01:40:54,143 --> 01:40:55,785
so Gromek killed Shaslik.

1163
01:40:55,786 --> 01:40:57,816
Have you got that, Gromek?
G - R - O - M - E - K.

1164
01:40:57,831 --> 01:41:00,457
Gromek killed first Shaslik.
The second Shaslik got Papinek.

1165
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,546
- Papinek?
- Yeah.

1166
01:41:01,547 --> 01:41:03,527
- Maurice Papinek?
- Yes, but he's not important.

1167
01:41:03,528 --> 01:41:04,422
He's not the brains.

1168
01:41:04,534 --> 01:41:05,964
That's him!
That's the spy!

1169
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:09,732
Wilton, I want it clearly understood that
this boy's interests are to be protected.

1170
01:41:09,764 --> 01:41:12,393
- He is a personal friend of mine.
- My friend, he tried to kill me!

1171
01:41:12,394 --> 01:41:14,209
- He should have the best medical care.
- Don't believe him.

1172
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,011
- My personal attorney.
- He's a traitor.

1173
01:41:16,012 --> 01:41:18,709
- I will underwrite the whole of his ...
- He can put you to those plans,
I was telling you about.

1174
01:41:18,727 --> 01:41:20,958
Two pieces of blueprint
with that fancy French name.

1175
01:41:20,966 --> 01:41:23,397
You can see the poor
boy's out of his mind.

1176
01:41:25,423 --> 01:41:28,724
Really you can't put any credence
in the ravings of this maniac?

1177
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:32,457
I mean, you can't possibly think
that I'll be involved in anything as

1178
01:41:32,473 --> 01:41:35,274
infamous as the theft
of the "Lafayette" papers?

1179
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:39,070
How did you know the name
of the secret document?

1180
01:41:39,105 --> 01:41:43,221
What?   Well, this poor
idiot just mentioned it.

1181
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,450
I beg your pardon.
He didn't.

1182
01:41:45,465 --> 01:41:49,869
What he said was "He gave Brutchik
those plans I was telling you about,

1183
01:41:50,105 --> 01:41:54,183
two pieces of blueprint with
some fancy French name".

1184
01:41:54,249 --> 01:41:56,587
But inspector, this is
preposterous, I ...

1185
01:41:56,602 --> 01:42:01,722
Detain the plane for Istanbul.  Mr Langston,
I'm afraid I must hold you for questioning.

1186
01:42:01,869 --> 01:42:02,919
Take him out.

1187
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:06,886
I'm sorry about this, old man.
I rather liked you.

1188
01:42:10,351 --> 01:42:12,956
Mr Morgan, I'm afraid we
all owe you a great apology.

1189
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:15,397
It's all so simple, a child
could have understood it.

1190
01:42:15,522 --> 01:42:18,236
They was Gromek and Brodnik, and
Shaslik and Papinek.  Now when Gromek ...

1191
01:42:18,237 --> 01:42:19,822
You look strained, take this.

1192
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:22,533
- When Gromek met Papinek ...
- Just drink it.

1193
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,781
He didn't know that Brodnik had
taken the plans from Shaslik, and ...

1194
01:42:29,424 --> 01:42:34,524
You know, you do have the prettiest eyes
of any doctor I have ever seen.  I would...

1195
01:42:36,292 --> 01:42:38,797
- I'll take care of him.
- I'll do it.

1196
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,628
I haven't seen the end
that he could use to.

1197
01:42:49,305 --> 01:42:52,296
- Marty, where's the car?
- Across the street.

1198
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:55,424
Here.

1199
01:42:56,064 --> 01:43:01,164
- Hey, terribly sorry. We just got married.
- I am awfully sorry.

1200
01:43:02,544 --> 01:43:06,150
Healthy looking couple.
Probably'll have a large family.

1201
01:43:06,325 --> 01:43:08,925
We better get a bigger car.
