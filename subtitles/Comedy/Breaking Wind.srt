My tooth! Aa-hh!

00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:55,834
What the fuck?

00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,846
Ow!
What the fuck?

5
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,893
Oh, Jesus Christ! That is so vile.
Ugh.

6
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,398
I'm sorry!

7
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:41,313
I'm so sorry!

No, seriously, change me.

Uh, bunnies are good.

Wow, what are you doing here?

25
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:48,235
Grandma, I want you to
meet my boyfriend Edward.

26
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,668
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

27
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:54,708
Oh...

28
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,009
Yes.
Hello, grandma.

29
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,509
Ah-hh.

30
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,650
Oh-hh!

31
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:08,756
No teeth.

32
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,990
- Oh God.
- Ah, yeah.

33
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,661
- Ah, yeah.
- No.

34
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:29,906
Hey, sweetheart.

35
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:32,910
Looks like somebody got in
a little late last night.

36
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,412
Actually, I got in
at exactly 8:00.

37
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,315
So, what, Edward's trying
to brown-nose me now?

38
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,851
- What?
- Got a surprise for you, sweetheart.

39
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,890
Look who's gonna be staying
with us for a few weeks.

40
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,091
- Grandma?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:51,461
Yeah, grandma thought she'd
come out and see you graduate.

42
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,567
- Oh no.
- Oh hey, bell.

43
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,976
Who's your vampire, huh?
Yeah!

44
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,842
<i>Hey.</i>

45
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,043
Good morning, sweetheart.

46
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:10,381
Ooh, looks like somebody got
in a little late last night.

47
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,684
Actually, dad, I got in
exactly at 8:00.

48
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,085
So, what, Edward's trying
to brown-nose me now?

49
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,354
You know, dad?
Let's just move on.

50
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:19,024
Look, uh,

51
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,385
you know why
I grounded you, right?

52
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,895
Because I suggested the features that
made Facebook as lame as MySpace?

53
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:27,665
- What?
- Because I've been asleep for three movies?

54
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,068
- What?
- Or was it because I accidentally trapped

55
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,070
those 33 Chileans in a mine
for over a month?

56
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,551
No no. It's because I wanted
separation between you and Edward.

57
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,040
Dad, there's nothing
you can say.

58
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,012
- Edward's in my life.
- Hello.

59
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,815
Yeah, I gathered that.

60
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:44,455
<i>All right, look,</i>

61
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,118
I'll make you a deal.

62
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,785
You're not grounded anymore

63
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:52,623

of your newfound freedom

64

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,762
Like Jacob.

66
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,063
Honey, he's going through
a real rough time now.

67
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,069
His dad's worried about him.

68
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,802
I remember when that was you.

69
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,641
You needed a friend,
Jake was there.

70
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,042
Not to mention
that they're turning

71
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,143
that Indian reservation
into a casino.

72
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:15,847
Honey, you could marry
into a ton of cash.

73
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,616
Then you could finally buy your
old man three taiwanese hookers.

74
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:21,386
- What?
- Two taiwanese hookers?

75
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,694
- Ugh.
- I'm good with one. Not selfish.

So we spotted Bella
and Edward together again.

106
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,832
And according to them, they
swear they're not an item.

107
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,838
Whatevs. He's so dropping
his nuts in her mouth.

108
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,007
As opposed to dropping them
on her chest.

109
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,551
Well, wouldn't that
make them "chestnuts"?

110
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,254
<i>Sorry, Harry, blond dude's
nuts joke was better!</i>

111
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,758
<i>Hey, so what's the deal guys?
You together or what?</i>

112
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,227
<i>Come on, you got die-hard fans.
They wanna know what's going on.</i>

113
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,164
<i>Bella, is Edward well-hung
or does he have a tiny penis?</i>

114
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,266
That is wildly inappropriate.

115
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,268
<i>Well what about Bella, Edward?
Does she have a large vagina?</i>

116
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,905
Whoa, that too is
incredibly inappropriate.

117
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,945
It's huge.

118
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,912
T-shirts!
Get your t-shirts right here.

119
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,814

00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,918
We got buttons.
We got pins.

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
We got notebooks.
We got underwear.

<i>All right, here we go.</i>

126
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,328
I've decided to throw a party.

127
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,297
After all, how many times do we
get to graduate high school?

128
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,367
Hmm.
Another party, Alice?

129
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,637
It'll be fun. We'll have a
chalupa truck, a petting zoo...

130
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,071
And we'll drink some blood.

131
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,312
- What?
- Huh?

132
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:10,351
Oh, look who's in town.

133
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,851
There's no one there.

134
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:17,893
Look again.

135
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,264
Aw-ww, who are they?

136
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,398
The little cullens.

137
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,368
<i>They're little versions of us.</i>

138
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,204
<i>They swoop into towns
after we've left them behind</i>

139
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,243
<i>and pick up all
the emotionally-wounded scraps.</i>

140
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,420
Don't look now, bell, but little
Edward is totally eyeing you.

141
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,043
- Little Edward.
- Edward.

142
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,277
We have a pact,
you little putz.

143
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,713
You're not supposed to be
within 100 Miles of me.

144
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:18,682
I'm well aware of that,
but I don't give a crap.

145
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,350
I'm hot for Bella.

146
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,787
She's one hot piece of ass.

147
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,926
See?

148
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,163
You're just jealous
'cause Bella wants me.

149
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,332
-<i> Little Jasper.</i>
- Jasper.

150
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,171
You never answered
any of my calls.

151
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,305
- I miss you.
- You were stalking me.

152
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:45,350
- I miss your scent. I miss your forehead.
- I miss everything.

153
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,719
<i>Edward seemed a little uneasy</i>

154
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,488
<i>about the arrival
of the little cullens.</i>

155
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,257
<i>From what I was told, they always
seem to put him in a weird place.</i>

156
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,792
<i>He just wasn't acting
like himself.</i>

157
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,731
<i>It was making me nervous.</i>

158
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:10,784
<i>But nothing outweighed
the disdain he had for Jacob.</i>

159
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,221
Don't let him touch you.

160
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,455
I measured it off
at 6 3/4" this morning.

161
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:34,425
- What?
- Huh?

162
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,127
Where have<i> you</i> been?

163
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,028
Hanging out at home.

164
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,399
While you were hanging out at home,
the guys spotted your ginger.

165
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,469
Victoria.
Alice's vision.

166
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,037
- I was trying to protect you.
- By lying to me?

167
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,206
See, that's what you get
with these vampires.

168
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,209
With me, you get so much more.

169
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,513
You get honesty and 8 3/4".

170
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,181
I thought you said
you were 6 3/4".

171
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:00,520
I lied.

172
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,488
- I need to talk to him.
- I don't trust him.

173
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:07,865
Don't worry.
He's a great driver.

174
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,801
Okay.

175
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,036
Lose the grin, Jake. We're
just going for a ride.

176
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,474
Damn right we are.
Watch your leg.

177
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,441
Oh!
Hold on.

178
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,476
I got my pant leg caught.
Oh, there we go.

179
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,178
- You ready now?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,181
All right, here we go.
Ow!

181
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,187
- You okay?
- Yeah, hop off, hop off.

182
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,388
- Hey, can you help?
- Sorry.

183
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,259
Ah, rats.

184
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,296
I got the corn dog, so you're
good with this, right?

185
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,500
I knew it.
How was school today?

186
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,601
It hasn't started yet.

187
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:54,506
Oh, mother of pearl,
this is heavy.

188
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,307
Is this bike made of bricks?

189
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,609
<i>Light a fire under your ass.
Let's move!</i>

190
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,378
Okay.

191
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,114
That first mile,
there were a lot of snakes.

192
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,483
Like, I mean, an ungodly
amount of snakes.

193
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,619
I can't believe that. Just leave
that there if you want to.

194
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,488
Hey-- hey
hey hey hey.

195
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,624
Are you all right?

196
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,331
It's okay, she didn't mean it.

197
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,537
Be back to take care
of you later.

198
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:28,272
Hey, are you sure
it's cool that I'm here?

199
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,374
I mean, I'm not a werewolf.

200
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,543
You worry too much.
Of course.

201
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,412
Ah, look who's back.

202
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,314
What up, bell?

203
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,919
- Quiel, you too?
- Yup, finally made the pack.

204
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,889
No thanks.
I'm good.

205
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,492
Glad you're here, Bella.
Now we can finally get a break

206
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,896
- from Jacob constantly humping the pool heater.
- Not to mention the mattress.

207
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,898
- Don't forget the fresh cantaloupe.
-<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

208
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,965
It's his way of imprinting.

209
00:13:55,966 --> 00:14:00,271
What? It just feels
really good, okay?

210
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,150
Yeah, it does, right?

211
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,984
So, what's this whole

212
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,921
"imprinting" thing?

213
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,691
Imprinting.

214
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,561
Uh...

215
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,098
Imprinting is when you see<i> her.</i>

216
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,365
And...

217
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,235
Just everything changes.

218
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:35,705
It's no longer gravity that's
keeping you on the planet.

219
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:39,609
It's simply her.

220
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,015
And nothing else matters.

221
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,320
Sounds like
you know the feeling.

222
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,254
Have you ever, um,

223
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,956
imprinted on anyone?

224
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:55,495
I imprinted on my face
first thing this morning.

225
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:00,730
<i>Now look at this little guy
we've got here.</i>

226
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:03,336
Jacob, Edward's going to
change me after graduation.

227
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,504
What?

228
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,139
- You knew this was coming.
-<i> Not in a month or--</i>

229
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,780
before you even lived.
Or I had the chance

230
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,345
to imprint over the great abs
you've got there.

231
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,626
My God! Would you
look at the ass

232
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,281
<i>on that sweet bitch?!</i>

233
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,119
I would tear that shit up
in two seconds.

234
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,119
Jacob, I know that this
hurts right now,

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,724
but in time,
you'll forget about me.

236
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,426
Jacob?

237
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,663
- Jake!
- I've got a six-pack.

238
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,298
I was just saying,

239
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,539
in time,
you'll forget about me.

240
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,571
Bella...

241
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,009
You really have no idea

242
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,682
how much you mean to me.

243
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,384
Ah!

244
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,055
Don't touch me.

245
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,726
I just imprinted in my pants.

246
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,619
Oh, Frank.

247
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:49,833
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

248
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,402
- I was with Jake.
- Oh.

249
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:55,338
Dad, what is on your face?

250
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:57,144
What?

251
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,778
<i>Hey, Gary Coleman's cock.</i>

252
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,747
Hey.

253
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,816
Do you understand
how worried I've been?

254
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,851
I was perfectly safe.

255
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:11,189
I almost broke the treaty and had
to cancel my blow-dry appoint--

256
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,629
oh, God-- sorry, I know.
I smell like dog semen.

257
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,709
No, something's wrong.

258
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,644
Edward, what's wrong?

259
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,313
Someone's been in here...

260
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:38,388
And he hijacked
your "ebony thunder."

261
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,360
- Who was it? Someone we know?
- Just a stranger.

262
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:53,797
I didn't recognize his scent,
but it was intoxicating.

263
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,665
A nomad just passing through?

264
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,235
A passerby wouldn't have
left Bella's dad alive.

265
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,937
I wouldn't have.

266
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,440
The scent disappeared about five
Miles South of Bella's house.

267
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,875
It was very pungent.

268
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,451
I think he had
huevos rancheros.

269
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,384
- Someone's orchestrating this.
- Victoria?

270
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:16,886
I would have seen her decide.

271
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,788
Has to be the volturi.

272
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,891
I don't think
it's the volturi either.

273
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:23,460
I've been watching
James' decisions too.

274
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,329
So we keep looking.

275
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,531
We'll all take shifts
watching Bella at her house.

276
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,901
Another protection detail
for this little bitch?

277
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,009
- Rosalie.
- No, she's-- she's totally right.

278
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,612
You guys can't protect me, watch
my dad, follow the intruder,

279
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,614
stock up on glitter,
and keep yourselves fed.

280
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,281
I'm not gonna leave you
here unprotected.

281
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:46,816
Well, I won't let you starve.

282
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,986
And besides I won't
be unprotected.

283
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,320
Jacob and the wolves can help.

284
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,958
Abs!

285
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,996
You know what I'm thinking?

286
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,895
Oh, shit.

287
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:02,531
We've missed the first five
minutes of "ace of cakes."

288
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,268
- No!
- God damn it.

289
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:08,644
- <i> I do love that guy.</i>
<i>- No! Season finale!</i>

290
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,412
<i>Sometimes I wish
I'd never moved to forks.</i>

291
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,373
<i>I've caused so much drama, I would have
been better off staying in Arizona.</i>

292
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,549
<i>But at the same time,</i>

293
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,319
<i>i was kind of a loser
in Arizona.</i>

294
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,290
<i>I ate lunch by myself,
stayed home on Saturday nights,</i>

295
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,492
<i>went to the homecoming dance
with chao-lin,</i>

296
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,362
<i>the blond Korean pool boy.</i>

297
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,065
<i>You know, on second thought, I guess
I really should have moved here.</i>

298
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,307
<i>This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.</i>

299
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,304
<i>Well, besides
dry-humping chao-lin.</i>

300
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,572
<i>Is somebody eating
junior mints?</i>

301
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,009
<i>I totally smell junior mints.
I</i> love<i> junior mints.</i>

302
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:48,478
<i>Sometimes I'll eat like, 20 at
a time and then throw them up.</i>

303
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,314
<i>I'm bulimic and vegan.</i>

304
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,386
<i>Oh shit. There's an in-n-out.
I gotta run.</i>

305
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,922
Well, whoever it was
forgot to flush the toilet.

306
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,591
That thing was huge,
but we picked up his scent.

307
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,826
It won't be hard to miss
next time we cross it.

308
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,429
We can handle it from here.

309
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,065
We don't need you to handle
anyone or anything.

310
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,600
- I'll handle your balls.
- All right, we're done here.

311
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,370
No,<i> you're</i> done here.

312
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,974
Or maybe it's
just the beginning.

313
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:20,977
Stop!

314
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:24,614
Stop it. Stop!

315
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,451
God, I am<i> so</i> tired of this.

316
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,053
You know what, from now on,
I'm Switzerland, okay?

317
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,625
By Switzerland,
you mean large vagina?

318
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,893
<i>Edward hated the idea.</i>

319
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,895
<i>But it wasn't about
rivalry anymore.</i>

320
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,833
<i>It was about my safety
and Charlie's...</i>

321
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,939
<i>And the amazing package
the host had at c.P.K.</i>

322
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,940
<i>In the days that followed,
I got them both</i>

323
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,377
<i>to at least try
to work together.</i>

324
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,578
Hah...

325
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,983
Damn you, Jacob the werewolf!

326
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:03,787
<i>It wasn't exactly an easy
alliance, but it worked.</i>

327
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,589
<i>While Edward and his family
went out to hunt,</i>

328
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,924
<i>I'd spend time with Jacob.</i>

329
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,927
Are you sure it's
okay that I'm here

330
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,462
seeing as I'm a
vampire girl and all?

331
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:16,932
Do I have perfectly
chiseled abs?

332
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,403
Besides, the tribal council
has something special

333
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,737
planned for you for tonight.

334
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:22,640
Jake! Jake!

335
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,681
The quileutes have always been a
small tribe from the beginning...

336
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,751
And we have always had
the magic in our blood.

337
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,090
We were great spirit warriors,
shape shifters.

338
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,593
We transformed
into powerful autobots

339
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:46,729
that fought the Decepticons

340
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,101
while our children
turned into smurfs

341
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:54,104
and we formed an alliance
with captain crunch

342
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,009
and fought the hamburglar.

343
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,178
We were unstoppable...

344
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,680
That is,

345
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,088
until<i> they</i> showed up.

346
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:14,992
Anyone in the mood
for a good salad tossing?

347
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:24,201
Our warriors' sharp teeth
finally tore it apart.

348
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,236
It tasted like chicken.

349
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,137
<i>We completely
killed it--</i>

350
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:30,707
the blockbuster franchise

351
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,077
and the amusement ride.

352
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:36,145
However, they lived in fear

353
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:39,152
that the cold man
was not alone.

354
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:44,688
And they were right.

355
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,489
<i>There was a herd
of them--</i>

356
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,124
all of them
different characters

357
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,261
played the exact same way.

358
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,946
Mmm. Smells like oak
with a hint of Berry.

359
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,154
Oop. That's two
for flinching.

360
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,293
Don't you know
you can't have tea

361
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,996
without the tea bag?

362
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:29,199
Here we go.

363
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,735
And the cold ones went insane.

364
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,077
They wiped out most of the tribe
before they could escape.

365
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:51,153
<i>Our eldest chief, Marc Epstein,</i>

366
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:55,725
was the only spirit warrior
left to save the tribe

367
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,279
<i>after his son was killed.</i>

368
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,785
<i>Chief Epstein's second wife
saw that he would lose.</i>

369
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,188
The second wife was
no match for the being,

370
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:28,827
with no special powers
but one--

371
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,711
courage.

372
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,021
The second wife's sacrifice

373
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,824
distracted the cold ones
long enough

374
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,227
for chief Epstein
to destroy it.

375
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,962
She saved the tribe.

376
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,797
It was a<i> mitzvah.</i>

377
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,871
Over time, our enemies
had disappeared.

378
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:17,707
But one remains--
the cold ones.

379
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,376
<i>Our magic awakens
when they're near.</i>

380
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,778
<i>We sense it now.</i>

381
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,681
We feel the threat

382
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:29,085
in our blood, our loins,
our cornholes.

383
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,787
<i>Deep inside.</i>

384
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,389
Kind of vibrating,

385
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,929
probing around, pure heaven.

386
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,664
Something terrible is coming.

387
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,333
We must be ready.

388
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,367
Ready to break wind
if we have to,

389
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,375
to get their attention
and defeat them.

390
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,690
Excuse me a minute.

391
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,698
Oh, he just sharted himself.

392
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,399
This is a great
new art piece, guys.

393
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,934
Oh, thanks, honey.
Actually, it's old.

394
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:21,104
Rosalie found it
in the basement this morning

395
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,038
and I just thought
it'd be fun to look at.

396
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,241
Nice find, Rosalie.

397
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:29,445
Yeah, the guy it was made after
was some African tribal leader.

398
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,448
Mom used to date him.
As you can see,

399
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,084
he was excessively endowed.

400
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,720
Well, not as big
as your father, honey.

401
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,988
Dad was just girthy, mom.

402
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:42,424
He's not as long as nimbat...

403
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:45,295
Oh, you see, Alice and I
used to share nimbat...

404
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,931
Actually,
mom stole him from me.

405
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,232
Now, don't be angry because
you're too tight to do anal.

406
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,235
Yeah, Alice, anal's cool.

407
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:55,104
Wait. Shh shh.
I wanna hear this.

408
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,172
<i>Seattle is in a state of terror</i>

409
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,808
as police are baffled
by the escalating murders,

410
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,379
disappearances, and how Brendan
Fraser keeps getting work...

411
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,019
- Aghh-- Brendan Fraser!
- It's getting worse.

412
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,385
We might have to do something.

413
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:13,522
It takes more than one of our
kind to report damages like that.

414
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:17,126
Quite a few more. They're
undisciplined, conspicuous,

415
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:19,394
and they all sag their pants
a little bit.

416
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:23,133
Newborns.
Aka "noobs."

417
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,135
Oh, like a level two orc
in "warcraft."

418
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,439
The first few months
after the change--

419
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,208
right, that's when we're
at our most uncontrollable.

420
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,143
We're vicious, bloodthirsty

421
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,444
and we have this weird
ocd thing

422
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:37,212
where we have to count
all the time.

423
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,516
"One testy-testy,
ha ha ha.

424
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:43,353
Two testy-testy,
ha ha ha.

425
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,889
Three testy-testy,
ha ha ha."

426
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,324
Nobody tell anyone
I have three testicles.

427
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,160
<i>It's something
to look forward to--</i>

428
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,296
the counting,
not the testicles.

429
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:55,464
- Right.
- I'm gonna go check the mail out front.

430
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,435
I just ordered
a new box of proactiv.

431
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,470
Now these nooblets
are untrained,

432
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,274
- but this isn't random.
- Someone's creating an army.

433
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,808
A vampire army?

434
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,876
No, the salvation army, bitch!

435
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:11,314
Jesus Christ! What do you think
we've been talking about?

436
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:13,516
You know, you really are an idiot.
I fucking hate you.

437
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:15,585
We're the only clan
closest to Seattle.

438
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,153
Regardless of why
they were created,

439
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,274
if we don't do something about
them, the volturi will.

440
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm surprised they haven't
already done something.

441
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:30,566
Jesus Christ!
Don't you ever die, bitch?!

442
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,537
Ugh!

443
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,037
What the hell
are you doing, Rosalie?

444
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,606
I'm sorry. She's just
so effing annoying.

445
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,967
Why don't you just talk it out
with her, for Christ's sakes?

446
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,483
Are you okay, bell?

447
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,087
Oh, thank goodness.

448
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:54,089
Oh, shit.

449
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,124
"Project runway" just started.

450
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,927
We can watch it
on the big screen upstairs.

451
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:01,970
Yeah. Come on, bell,
and stop being so pretentious.

452
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,537
I don't know how
you do it, Carlisle.

453
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,605
Do what?

454
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:11,641
Work around
injured patients all day.

455
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,276
How do you not get tempted?

456
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,112
I've been doing this
for a long time, Bella.

457
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:18,280
I've mastered
self-control.

458
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,453
I wish all vampires
had such control.

459
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:25,354
You know what I mean?

460
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,557
I do. Is that Edward outside?

461
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,663
Where?

462
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:34,663
Oh, my bad.

463
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:37,333
You might feel a little prick.

464
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,903
Ow, what are you doing?

465
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,906
Nothing. It's standard
for this kind of injury.

466
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,308
Okay.

467
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,570
Sorry.

468
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,104
<i>I was falling off the bed</i>

469
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:18,941
and I grabbed what I could
to break my fall.

470
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:20,942
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

471
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,518
You mind giving
little Edward a hand?

472
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,319
Ooh, ooh.

473
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,522
You're so
incredibly hot, Bella.

474
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:36,592
I don't know
what you see in Edward,

475
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,694
but I'm prepared
to give you all of me.

476
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,529
Let me show you.

477
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,010
Oh, can you--
can we just not do that?

478
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,136
Sorry.
Whew!

479
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:50,707
Truthfully, I got
kicked out of my place.

480
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,575
Can I stay with you
for a while?

481
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,013
- I can't let you stay here.
- No, not here.

482
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:59,716
Inside your cavernous vagina.

483
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,285
Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,586
- Oh, no. No!
- Ooh, yeah!

485
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:06,255
- Dude, dude, dude. Wait wait wait.
- What are you doing?!

486
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,490
Dude, dude, dude.
I'm so sorry, dude.

487
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:11,361
I know I'm not supposed to be
here, but I can't help myself.

488
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,031
I just can't stop thinking
about her constantly.

489
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:18,468
Day and night.

490
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,069
She's like my own
little personal heroin.

491
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,275
I just want her
to touch it, touch it.

492
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:30,313
Gyah!

493
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:32,717
Tee shot!
Whoo-hoo!

494
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:35,586
I'll hump you later, okay?

495
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,691
Ugh...

496
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,357
<i>Oh yeah...</i>

497
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:44,028
<i>Unh... oh yeah.</i>

498
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,770
<i>Oh my God. Oh my God,
I left my mic on.</i>

499
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,738
It's so pretty here.

500
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,775
Alice is throwing
this huge graduation party

501
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,610
which, of course,
you're invited to.

502
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,678
She's got some really
cool stuff planned.

503
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,814
She's having, I guess,
something about Lindsay Lohan

504
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:08,351
coming with some ping-pong
balls and a mule?

505
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,690
Yeah.
I figured as much.

506
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,826
What?

507
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,693
I wanted to
do this differently.

508
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:21,697
Smoother, but...

509
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:23,836
But now I'm out of time.

510
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:28,604
Time for what?

511
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,506
You need to know
the truth, Bella.

512
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,541
You have to understand
all your options.

513
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,745
And right now,
you have to understand

514
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,448
that I'm 12 3/4".

515
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,283
<i>Holy shit!</i>

516
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,384
Is that wrapped
around your leg?

517
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:44,252
Yeah, three times.

518
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,354
This new cream that
I got is so incredible.

519
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:48,624
It's gotten so big
and girthy now.

520
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,425
Hmm...

521
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,095
Bella, I want you to choose me

522
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:54,729
over him.

523
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,531
I thought you understood, Jake.

524
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:58,166
I just don't feel
that way about you.

525
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,737
Shh.
Shh shh shh.

526
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,573
Listen.

527
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,341
I know you feel
something for me.

528
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,313
You just won't admit it.

529
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,415
<i>Now you won't have to change</i>

530
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,887
for anybody or say
goodbye to anyone.

531
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,858
I can give you more
than he can.

532
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,127
<i>♪ I love it when
we're all alone-- ♪</i>

533
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:27,395
Really?
Watch it, a-hole.

534
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:29,832
<i>Hey, sorry, but I'm just wonderin'
how you guys are doing.</i>

535
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,368
We're doing fine! Do you
want to leave us alone here?

536
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,837
<i>Hey, come on. So are you
guys a couple or what?</i>

537
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,674
No! Trying to work on that!
God damn it.

538
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:41,910
<i>Come on, Jacob.
You guys look great together.</i>

539
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,881
<i>Tell us what's going on. Someone just
said they spotted the two of you</i>

540
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,149
<i>canoodling at boa's
the other night.</i>

541
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,618
<i>Hey, give us the goods.</i>

542
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,321
<i>So Jake, you all right
getting Eddie's cheese?</i>

543
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:54,690
Really, huh? You want to talk about cheese?
How about that?

544
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:58,831
Hey.

545
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:05,702
Oh my God. This house is amazing. I
just took the biggest dump upstairs.

546
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,421
- What are you doing here?
- Someone told me something

547
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:28,927
about an all-you-can-eat buffet
catered by red lobster.

548
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:35,934
Congrats, Bella.
I made you a little something.

549
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,737
That is so sweet.
Thanks, Jacob.

550
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,239
Ooh, sorry.

551
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,284
I mean-- ahem--
I have a six-pack.

552
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:06,965
So it is true.

553
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,572
Ugh, I'll be right back.

554
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:16,973
What did you see?

555
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,975
The decision's been made.

556
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:23,312
- What does that mean?
- Not going to Seattle.

557
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:25,448
They're coming here.

558
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,521
Ah-hh!

559
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:34,460
Sorry.
Imprint.

560
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,428
They'll be here in four days,

561
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,529
but not before
stopping off at ihop

562
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,897
for all-you-can-eat
pancakes.

563
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,767
How do you know all this?

564
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,904
I follow her tweets.

565
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,939
"Just had the most amazing
dinner at the brewery.

566
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,676
Can't wait for ihop all-you-can-eat
before killing Bella."

567
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:56,044
- This could turn into a bloodbath.
- Who's behind it?

568
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:57,583
I didn't see anyone
I recognized.

569
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,750
- Maybe one.
- I know his face.

570
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:04,986
Ronald steers. He just
friended me on Facebook.

571
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:07,922
Look, bottom line is
there's an army coming here

572
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,859
and there's not enough
of us to stop them.

573
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,526
Wait. What--
what damn army?

574
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:13,062
Come on, dude.
Noobs.

575
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:14,663
Okay?
Our kind.

576
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,700
They're coming
straight for Bella.

577
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,435
They got her scratch-and-sniff
vagina scent

578
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,037
from this
"ebony thunder" magazine.

579
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,805
So what does that mean?

580
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,806
It's like a really good
magazine-- 10 issues for $9.95.

581
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,977
It means there'll be an
ugly fight with lives lost.

582
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,538
But we'll probably get to wear
some really cool outfits. - Yes.

583
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:34,109
All right.
We're in.

584
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,986
No. You'll get yourselves
killed, no way.

585
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:40,055
I wasn't asking permission.

586
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:43,993
- Edward.
- It means more protection for you.

587
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,727
We'll all need some training.

588
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,663
Fighting noobs requires
knowledge that Jasper has.

589
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:51,100
Ah, yes. Yes.

590
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,600
You're welcome to join us.

591
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,071
All right.
I like to do things.

592
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,872
Name the time and the place.

593
00:37:56,873 --> 00:38:00,109
This is all happening...

594
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,882
Because of me.

595
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,984
I'm the center of it all!

596
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,886
God, I'm the best!

597
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,988
Ah! Whoo!

598
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:16,032
Me, me, me, me--

599
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:24,500
<i>we had to prepare
for what was coming,</i>

600
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:27,136
<i>which meant another h.P.V.
Inoculation</i>

601
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:29,005
<i>and a 30-day supply
of tucks.</i>

602
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,076
Thank you.
Well, I studied.

603
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:36,946
What is that?

604
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,482
Oh, it's just a graduation
present from Jake.

605
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,850
Don't worry.
I can't eat white cake.

606
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,986
Gives me really bad gas.

607
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:47,089
I mean, literally the minute I
eat it, I just start ripping.

608
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,558
It smells really bad.

609
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,828
Kind of like a coyote carcass

610
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:54,596
that's been left on the side
of the road for nine months

611
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,765
with a side of melted
gruyere cheese.

612
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,801
Or kind of like

613
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,636
an underground
turkish sewer system

614
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,471
after a gay pride parade
in the month of July--

615
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:06,174
or like I just ate
a llama's dump after--

616
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:09,444
okay, I get it!
It stinks.

617
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,663
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

618
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:27,584
Sorry we're late, guys.

619
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,001
Jacob got his dick stuck
in the pool heater again.

620
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,603
Took us a while to get it out.

621
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,839
What?
It felt really good.

622
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,841
<i>- Damn good.</i>
- We know, man.

623
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:39,908
- We know.
- It was fun.

624
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,547
Anyways, welcome.

625
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,948
Jasper has experience
with noobs.

626
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,484
<i>Hell yeah.</i>
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

627
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:52,824
Well, how are you vampires
different from those noobs?

628
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,058
They wanna know how
we differ from the noobs.

629
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:59,127
Ahh...

630
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,730
They're a lot more
powerful than we are.

631
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:05,634
Not only do they have
human tissue in their blood,

632
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:09,205
- they all juice up.
- Like on steroids?

633
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,007
No, like minute-maid, moron!

634
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,010
Carlisle! Can we
please just kill her

635
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,180
so we can live the rest of
our lives in peace? Please.

636
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,716
Unfortunately for our kind, the
first few months of this life

637
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:23,887
are our most powerful.

638
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,228
Let me show you some
of their recent activities.

639
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:34,201
This should be good.

640
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,237
I hate these.

641
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,275
It's worth seeing, guys.

642
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:48,114
Sorry.

643
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,549
Is that a "b" or "p"?

644
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,151
- It's a "p".
- It's a "p", honey.

645
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,021
I think "b".

646
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,089
It was a "p".

647
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,898
Fuck!

648
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,198
Sorry.

649
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,267
Anyway,

650
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:14,770
Jasper's gonna teach us
how to fight these monsters.

651
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,805
- Jasper?
- Thank you, Carlisle.

652
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:19,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
the two most important things

653
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,176
about taking down noobs
are as follows--

654
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:23,913
number one, do not let them
come at you from behind.

655
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,247
Keep your assholes<i> tight.</i>

656
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:30,285
They will get in, they will slip
in like my Uncle Chris slipped in!

657
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:32,988
Number two, do not let them
fondle your nuts!

658
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:35,790
They love nuts. It's one of
their top three favorite foods

659
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,625
that are also body parts.

660
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:40,629
They love them.
I've seen it. Okay?

661
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,933
Rosalie.
Don't hold back.

662
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,802
Never.

663
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,339
Don't be blonde.

664
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,501
That was rule number zero. I
just didn't say it. Alice!

665
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:01,619
I love you so much!

666
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,324
Jasper.
Lick dog ass!

667
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,725
Who's next?!
Who's next?!

668
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:13,328
- Oh crap. Just go.
- Just run. Run.

669
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,598
Mighty Joe young

670
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,041
ain't got nothing on me!

671
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,243
Whoever said that silk
tastes like regular milk

672
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:30,245
is completely full of shit.

673
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:33,247
Screw this diet.
Jesus.

674
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:35,384
So what's the plan here,
paleface?

675
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:38,021
Well, this field will be
an advantage in battle.

676
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,390
We need to lure the noobs
here with Bella's scent.

677
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:42,151
This will end here.

678
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,727
Edward and I are going
to a campsite on Saturday.

679
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,330
But even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up my scent.

680
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:51,734
Your scent, however,
is revolting.

681
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,167
What's that supposed to mean?

682
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:55,303
Ooh.

683
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:58,339
Oh, it's a good one.
Sharp!

684
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,743
Well, maybe-- maybe
just a test sample.

685
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,879
Okay. What Edward means
is that if you carry me,

686
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,949
your scent will mask mine.

687
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:08,783
So let's do a test run
for Saturday.

688
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:10,021
All right.
Let's do this.

689
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,055
Three--

690
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:14,756
<i>--two, one.</i>

691
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,091
Okay, sorry.
Sorry.

692
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:17,926
Oh!

693
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:20,696
- Um...
- We'll get there.

694
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:23,265
<i>We'll get there.</i>

695
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,334
<i>Even though it was
Edward's idea,</i>

696
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:28,671
<i>he really wasn't a fan of me
spending time with Jacob.</i>

697
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,339
<i>I'd just wish
he'd finally understand</i>

698
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,808
<i>that my feelings for him
are way stronger</i>

699
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,843
<i>than my feelings for Jacob.</i>

700
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:37,779
<i>Well, except when Jacob
sweats between his breasts.</i>

701
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,049
<i>I enjoy that.
They're fun.</i>

702
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,257
<i>I call them my fun bags.</i>

703
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,091
Hey.
You want a sandwich?

704
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:50,362
No, I'm good.

705
00:43:53,362 --> 00:43:55,698
Dad, I was wondering.

706
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,665
Hmm?

707
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:59,706
Why didn't you ever
get married after mom?

708
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,339
Well, uh...

709
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,341
Actually I almost did,
sweetheart.

710
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:08,276
Really?

711
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:10,212
Yeah.

712
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:12,147
Yeah.
His name was Frank.

713
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:15,384
He had the hottest eight-pack
I'd ever seen in my life.

714
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:17,453
He loved tennis
as much as I did.

715
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,421
On the weekend,
we go to palm Springs

716
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:22,957
and get one of those rooms
with two queens for $69.69.

717
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:28,330
We'd go antiquing,
take the skytram, ass hump.

718
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:30,499
Oh gross, dad.

719
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,734
Why don't you just tell me
some more about the skytram?

720
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:34,803
Of course, I'm sorry.

721
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:37,473
Skytram is when I get nude
and stand on the bed

722
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,508
and he lies on the floor
and jerks off.

723
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:41,310
If he shoots a load
up in the air

724
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,111
and I catch it in my mouth,

725
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,380
we both yell out
"skytram!"

726
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:50,852
Oh, wow, that's really gross.

727
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,855
I should have just asked
you about antiquing.

728
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,223
Oh. Well, that's
when you skytram

729
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,493
with an 85-year-old man.

730
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:00,495
Okay, dad, can I just
ask you something, please?

731
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,165
Anything.

732
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:06,440
- Do you believe in marriage?
- Of course. Why?

733
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,942
Is there something
you want to tell me?

734
00:45:14,943 --> 00:45:16,779
Were you not careful, Bella?

735
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,346
What?

736
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:20,348
Look, there are things
you need to know

737
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,019
before you become
physically intimate.

738
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:27,221
Okay, dad. Mom already had
this talk with me so--

739
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:29,091
uh-hmm.
Look, sweetheart.

740
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:32,833
This isn't a game. You need to
know what sex is all about.

741
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:41,403
Now a man has a penis

742
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:42,937
and a woman...

743
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,473
Has a vagina.

744
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,808
Some women have
very big vaginas.

745
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:48,416
- Dad!
- Too technical? Okay.

746
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:56,317
Now once insertion is achieved,

747
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,421
the man and woman
begin humping each other.

748
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:01,324
Could you guys
demonstrate, please?

749
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,562
Dad! Edward is not
interested in sex.

750
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:10,531
- Get out of here.
- No, he's not. I'm serious.

751
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:13,535
No, I mean it. Get out of here. You're wasting
my time then. I've got business to do.

752
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,870
<i>Go.</i>

753
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,573
I'm sorry. My daughter
has a huge vagina.

754
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,576
Like, gaping.

755
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,248
Hey, anybody up
for a little antiquing?

756
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:28,288
You guys up? Have you
heard of skytramming?

757
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:34,055
I can't believe
we have the whole house

758
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:36,491
- to ourselves for the night.
- Pretty cool.

759
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,259
There's a bed?

760
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,130
Thought you might
need one to sleep in.

761
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,198
Okay, I wanna
ask you something.

762
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:46,634
Anything.

763
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:50,210
Marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

764
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,143
- Yes.
- Okay.

765
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:58,546
I wanna negotiate
my own condition.

766
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:01,616
Anything you want, it's yours.

767
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:02,917
You promise?

768
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:05,188
Yes.

769
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:08,556
- Put this on.
- What?

770
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,658
- Please?
- Why?

771
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:12,496
Thought it might be fun.

772
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:15,564
For you, anything.

773
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:18,634
Okay. This too.

774
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:19,608
Uh...

775
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:27,442
How's this?

776
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,143
Oh, it's perfect.

777
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,613
Okay, um,
now call me your bitch.

778
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:34,283
What? I can't--

779
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,984
oh, oh, okay. Uh, how about ho?
Can you say ho?

780
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:39,620
No, that's not
how I was raised--

781
00:47:39,621 --> 00:47:42,624
oh-hh!

782
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,127
You're my motherfucking bitch!

783
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,128
Ooh!
You're my goddamn ho!

784
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,933
Oh yeah. Okay, now talk
about my milky-white ass.

785
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,366
I love your
milky-white ass.

786
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:54,535
Oh, yes, that is so good.

787
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,605
Oh, give me your
chocolate pole, lebron.

788
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:59,640
Okay okay okay, stop.
I-- I can't do this.

789
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:02,544
What? It's just
a little roleplay.

790
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,413
- I'm out, I'm out.
- It's just for f--

791
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,614
okay, I'm sorry.

792
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:09,951
Let's just be us--

793
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,056
you and me?

794
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:16,601
You're the hottest thing
around here anyway.

795
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,437
<i>♪ One day ♪</i>

796
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,038
<i>♪ no more pain-- ♪</i>

797
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,207
Oh oh, whoa. Okay, what--
what-- what are you doing?

798
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,612
Oh, just go with it, Edward. I'm
gonna make you feel so good.

799
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:39,748
<i>♪ One day, no more-- ♪</i>

800
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:44,752
Oh, ow! Whoa, okay. I-- I
can't let you do that.

801
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:47,025
Bella, Bella, Bella,
I'm not ready.

802
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,625
Aren't you
attracted to me, Edward?

803
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:55,663
I mean, we can
work through this.

804
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:59,301
I can get liposuction
or I can breast implants,

805
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:01,335
or shave my roast beef.

806
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:03,337
I mean, whatever you want.

807
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:06,674
No, bell-- I'm attracted
to you, Bella.

808
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:09,280
It's just I--

809
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,116
<i>do you have the most enhanced
breasts in the world?</i>

810
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,125
- Does that help?
- Nope.

811
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,292
<i>Please direct your
attention to stage seven</i>

812

813
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:28,731
<i>to Bella.</i>

814
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:40,308
Try stuffing this
in your fire crotch.

815
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,315
Thanks, mister.

816
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:49,417
Really?

817
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:50,255
Here.

818
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,097
Drink that.

819
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:04,066
- Nothing.
- God damn it!

820
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,134
What the hell
is wrong with you?

821
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,502
Any guy would give his left nut

822
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:10,538
to be nailing me right now.

823
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,809
Nailing me fucking hard!

824
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,313
You know what?
Screw yourself.

825
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:21,561
Thanks a lot, fuck-snort.
I lost my wood.

826
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:34,462
<i>You're not coming with us?</i>

827
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,165
It'll be a last-minute decision.

828
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,436
I told you how it works.

829
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:44,105
The cullens have powers.

830
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:46,841
Don't underestimate them,
Ronald.

831
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:50,212
You'll have the numbers,

832
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,783
but they'll be able to
anticipate your every move.

833
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,319
According to your friend.

834
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,425
Yes.
My<i> dead</i> friend--

835
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:04,459
Gary Coleman.

836
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,694
He found out about the
things they could do,

837
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,562
so they killed him.

838
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:12,167
But not before
he told me about--

839
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:16,138
<i>hey, looks like you two
have become quite the couple.</i>

840
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,439
- Fuck.
- What?

841
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,875
<i>No, seriously. You guys are
like a vampire version</i>

842
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,709
<i>of Bonnie and Clyde.
It's so cool.</i>

843
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,310
All right.
Do-- do you mind?

844
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:25,747
<i>No, I get it.
You want your privacy.</i>

845
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:27,515
<i>But tell me, is the sex better</i>

846
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:30,288
<i>as a vampire or as a human?</i>

847
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,922
<i>Oh, come on, Ronny.
Don't be shy, man.</i>

848
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:37,491
<i>Come on, what's the deal?
Is she not giving it up?</i>

849
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:40,294
- Would you-- no comment.
- Come on.

850
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:42,897
<i>Oh, shit. She's not
giving it up, is she?</i>

851
00:51:42,898 --> 00:51:44,933
<i>You're a vampire virgin.</i>

852
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:47,169
<i>Aww, little Ronny's
a vampire virgin!</i>

853
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,840
All right, stop it!

854
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,274
We mess around, okay?

855
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:55,276
We do everything but.

856
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:57,913
You know, we just dry humped
like half an hour ago.

857
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,249
<i>Whoa.
Dry humping. Wow.</i>

858
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,551
<i>That's some real
Jonas brothers shit, right?</i>

859
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:04,752
- Get off me!
- What?

860
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,821
<i>Why don't you give each other
promise rings</i>

861
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:08,622
<i>and jerk each other off?</i>

862
00:52:08,623 --> 00:52:10,357
I didn't do anything.
You are on thin ice.

863
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:11,947
- Victoria.
- No.

864
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:43,225
Don't you think you're
going a little overboard?

865
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,892
If this is all I have to
contribute, I want to be thorough.

866
00:52:44,893 --> 00:52:47,696
- Thorough about what?
- Hey, Jacob.

867
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,863
Alice says there's a storm
coming through tonight.

868
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:53,334
Yeah yeah.
I can feel it.

869
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:55,736
I definitely have maximum
shrinkage going on.

870
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:58,010
Oh, this needs ketchup.
Ooh.

871
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,910
Chipotle.

872
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:05,983
I'll meet you up there
in a couple hours.

873
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,718
- Ready to go, milady?
- Yeah, yes.

874
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,752
All right, you know what to do.

875
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:13,687
Got it.

876
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:15,489
And now-- oh my God!

877
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,493
- Did you gain weight?
- Did you lose muscle?

878
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:20,629
I'm protecting you.
Ready?

879
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,497
Ahh! That's one.

880
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:25,701
Yeah, they're not gonna
follow me after that.

881
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,337
Ooh, Jesus, is that
really necessary?

882
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:30,498
You wanna be safe, don't you?

883
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:44,454
Um, Ronald? I'm not too
strong of a swimmer.

884
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:47,988
Neither am I.

885
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:51,493
I was taking lessons at the y
and my teacher got gonorrhea.

886
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,060
She had to move back to Kansas.

887
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:56,298
I don't know how to swim,
and I have a vagina.

888
00:53:57,967 --> 00:54:01,870
Enough!
We will figure it out.

889
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,077
Such babies.

890
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:11,546
Oh Christ, so sorry!

891
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:14,415
Oh my God!

892
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,918
No worries.

893
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:22,857
You're gonna really wanna
hurry up there, sweet tits.

894
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:24,219
Those vampires
are hot on your ass.

895
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:38,085
Oh, we're almost there.
Awesome.

896
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,787
- Almost got it.
- God, this is hard.

897
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,589
Oh my God.

898
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,431
Let me know when you want
me to jump off, girl.

899
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:00,794
We're almost there.

900
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:03,067
Whew.
That burn.

901
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:08,112
- Okay.
- All right.

902
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:19,113
- Thank you.
- It was no problem.

903
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:21,116
We ran into a small
stumbling block

904
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,084
a few Miles down,
but we made it through.

905
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,087
You should probably head
back before the storm hits.

906
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:29,056
Nah, I'm good.

907
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:31,625
I think I'm gonna
camp out here tonight.

908
00:55:31,626 --> 00:55:33,595
Besides, I have a dove bar.

909
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,096
Why are you staying here?

910
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,932
'Cause I like to watch.

911
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:40,708
Let's get you inside the tent.

912
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,781
<i>I'm sorry, sweetie,</i>

913
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,848
I wish there was
something I could do.

914
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:56,985
It's okay, I'm fine.

915
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:03,158
Guys, we've got a problem.

916
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,093
Did<i> anybody</i> bring hot sauce?

917
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:08,163
'Cause this burrito is dry--
whoa, Bella, are you all right?

918
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,864
We're all right, Jacob.
Just leave us alone.

919
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:13,100
- She doesn't look fine.
- Leave us alone, man.

920
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:16,104
Hey, this isn't about
you and me,<i> Edward.</i>

921
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,208
<i>This is about Bella.</i>

922
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,075
Come to terms with it, man.

923
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:22,154
I'm just hotter than you.

924
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,522
You serious?

925
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:36,156
Keep it clean.

926
00:56:36,157 --> 00:56:37,859
Hey, you got it.

927
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,895
<i>Keep it clean.</i>

928
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,101
Oh yeah.
Really really clean.

929
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:49,169
I gotta say, Jacob--
I mean,

930
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,677
if the situation
wasn't what it is...

931
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,681
I think we'd probably
be friends.

932
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:02,954
I know it's weird, but I...

933
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,055
...I think
you're a good guy.

934
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,124
Good, good-- a nice guy.

935
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,963
I-- I mean,
uh, I think...

936
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:16,897
Your intentions seem to be
in the right place.

937
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:19,237
It's-- damn it,
man, I mean...

938
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,037
Is it our fault
that our ancestors

939
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:24,278
have been feuding
for centuries?

940
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:26,908
Pile-drive me!

941
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,944
- I like you Jacob and...
- I need energy.

942
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:34,082
- ...I'd like to start over with you.
- Oh God!

943
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,584
Maybe catch a movie,
grab a coffee.

944
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:40,187
- Road trip to Vegas?
- Ah!

945
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:41,723
It's crazy.

946
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,158
Vampire, wolf boy,
hanging out, right?

947
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,160
No, I know. I know, right?
But think about it.

948
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:48,428
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

949
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:52,165
We could change things for our
kind for future generations.

950
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,535
Oh Buddha.

951
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,871
Fucking-a, man,
we can make a difference.

952
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,922
What do you say?
Wanna go to palm Springs?

953
00:58:13,922 --> 00:58:15,924
Did you have
a good night's sleep?

954
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,959
Yeah, it was good.

955
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,729
I gotta say,
Jacob's not half bad.

956
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,299
I mean, he's a real,

957
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,167
genuine, trustworthy gentleman.

958
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:29,837
It's hard to find that
in someone these days.

959
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,586
I told you.

960
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:46,304
Nah.

961
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:05,105
Oh my God,
these woods are amazing.

962
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:08,043
I just took the biggest dump
next to poison sumac!

963
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:11,382
<i>O.M.G.!</i>

964
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:15,984
We've been totally
looking for you guys.

965
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,386
Hello, Laverne, Shirley.

966
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:20,855
We called you guys
like, a million times.

967
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:23,256
We posted, like, a gazillion
messages on your wall.

968
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:25,993
We sexted nude pictures
to Jasper like, every day.

969
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,328
I did not put that picture

970
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:29,830
as my desktop profile
picture. I did not.

971
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:32,332
Listen, ladies, we're a
little busy right now.

972
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,838
Of course, blow us off again, Carlisle.
We're used to it.

973
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:39,073
You seemed to have
plenty of time for us

974
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:41,012
during the last exam
of our vaginas.

975
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,078
Okay, girls, honestly.

976
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,247
We're about to go
into battle here.

977
00:59:47,248 --> 00:59:48,982
Look, cut the bullshit.

978
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:52,085
Are you adopting us or not?

979
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:53,821
Unfortunately, no.

980
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:57,125
Well, fuck you, Cullen family.

981
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,664
Fuck you hard.

982
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:03,131
You wanna go now?

983
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,981
Did anyone notice they kinda
looked a little similar?

984
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:21,314
What the fuck, hmm?

985
01:00:21,315 --> 01:00:23,317
I thought you knew
where we were going!

986
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:26,070
<i>Recalculating route.</i>
Damn GPS!

987
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,404
The noobs will be forced to
enter from the east side.

988
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:47,341
We'll wait until they get
halfway across the battlefield

989
01:00:47,342 --> 01:00:50,377
and then we'll strike, but only
on my command. You got it?

990
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:52,148
- Right.
- On my command!

991
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:56,389
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

992
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,857
Okay, let's do this.

993
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:05,292
Lee-Roy-yy
Jenkins!

994
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:08,932
- Emmet, you moron!
<i>- God damn it.</i>

995
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:12,902
- Ooh!
- That's enough!

996
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:16,437
Enough!

997
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:19,483
- We want<i> them!</i>
- Oh hell no!

998
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,487
It's starting.

999
01:01:32,487 --> 01:01:34,764
He says it's starting.

1000
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,400
They're planking.

1001
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:55,843
And now they're owling.

1002
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:58,925
It's really gay.

1003
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,459
Oh my God, they're owling.

1004
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,028
That is<i> so</i> gay.

1005
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:17,802
Jacob just arrived.
He's marking his territory.

1006
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:23,005
Still going. Still going.
Anybody still going?

1007
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:35,383
Someone's hurt?

1008
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,386
She's close.
I can hear her thoughts.

1009
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:42,556
Something about
needing a Brazilian wax

1010
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:46,194
because she's getting major
chaffage when she runs.

1011
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,833
Seth, go!

1012
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,533
She found us.

1013
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:55,106
She's not alone.

1014
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:00,416
Oh God.

1015
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,383
Ronald, listen to me.

1016
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:12,520
Victoria is just using you
to distract me.

1017
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:14,958
She knows I'll kill you.

1018
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,060
In fact, she'll be happy

1019
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,995
to not have
to deal with you anymore.

1020
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:23,064
Don't listen to him, Ronald.

1021
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:26,268
I told you about
his mind tricks.

1022
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,638
Don't keep distracted.
Keep watching. Keep watching.

1023
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:34,452
Oh, which one it could be? Whoa,
whoa, here we go. Here we go.

1024
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,319
- Oh, son of a bitch!
- Ha!

1025
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,256
Oh my goodness.

1026
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,927
You're fucking dead!

1027
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:54,197
You won't get another
chance like this again!

1028
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,665
You want her.
You want me to feel

1029
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,167
the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1030
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:02,203
when I tore him to pieces,

1031
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,337
when I turned him to ash,

1032
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:05,739
when I smoked him out of a bong

1033
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,579
and gave everyone a contact high
at an Enrique iglesias concert.

1034
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:29,264
Where are you going?

1035
01:04:34,101 --> 01:04:36,204
Aggh!

1036
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:50,487
Get over here.

1037
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:55,166
<i>Take this.</i>

1038
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,271
<i>You, where do you think
you're going?</i>

1039
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:12,722
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

1040
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:36,068
Bella!

1041
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:41,570
Don't do it.

1042
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:47,043
<i>Oh, your girlfriend's bleeding.</i>

1043
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:53,714
Come on!

1044
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:55,018
<i>Oh, I hate you so much.</i>

1045
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,027
So much.

1046
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:08,096
Mmm...

1047
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:33,220
Huh.

1048
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:35,122
- Want one?
- No.

1049
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:39,160
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's bad!

1050
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,761
That's really-- oh my God,
that's really bad.

1051
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:45,299
Oh, it's so bad it smells like
coyote carcass with melted gruyere

1052
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,801
that's been left on the side of
the highway for nine months.

1053
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:51,638
So bad-- oh, it smells
like a turkish sewer system

1054
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:55,076
after a gay pride parade
in the month of July.

1055
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,676
Oh, oh, so bad, it smells like

1056
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:59,080
you ate a llama's dump
after it just--

1057
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,816
okay yeah, I know,
I know. It smells bad.

1058
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,517
- Hey, there they are.
- Love the llama's dump line.

1059
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:05,553
That was really good.

1060
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,802
Congratulations.

1061
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:24,772
Impressive. I've never seen
a small group like yours

1062
01:07:24,773 --> 01:07:26,473
defeat a large army
like theirs.

1063
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:28,542
- We were lucky.
- I doubt that.

1064
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:30,544
Luck is when you have
a six showing

1065
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:32,879
and the dealer shows
a king and you hit

1066
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,881
and pull up a four and a queen.

1067
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:39,653
Or when you bet exacta box
on two 50-1 horses

1068
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:42,288
and they come in win and place.

1069
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,491
Or if you take grambling
over Southern,

1070
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:47,560
but you have to lay 10 and cover
on a last-second hail Mary.

1071
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:50,230
- We're gonna have to off all of you.
- Excuse me?

1072
01:07:50,231 --> 01:07:53,302
It'll be quick.
You won't feel a thing.

1073
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:55,903
Oh, crap!

1074
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:58,677
- "Storage wars" is on in five.
- What? No one TiVo'd it?

1075
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,683
I'd like to commend you all
on a job well done

1076
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:12,620
and hope to see you at Edward
and Bella's wedding next month.

1077
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,187
Mazel!

1078
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:16,724
Married?!
You two are getting married?

1079
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,559
Jacob, you knew
this day was coming.

1080
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,596
By my bronzed body.

1081
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:24,167
Ah-ha.

1082
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,237
Call off the wedding
or I'll take my life.

1083
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:32,907
Jacob, put the knife down.

1084
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,876
This does not qualify
as an emergency situation.

1085
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:38,711
- Call it off.
- Just put the knife down and we'll talk, okay?

1086
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:40,179
<i>Hey, what's up, Jacob?</i>

1087
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,816
<i>How you feel about the
conflict in the middle east?</i>

1088
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:44,617
You kidding me? Get the hell
out of here, you asshole.

1089
01:08:44,618 --> 01:08:47,854
<i>Oh, dude.
Dude, I'm sorry.</i>

1090
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:51,229
My abs.
My glorious abs!

1091
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:01,479
To Edward and Bella!

1092
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,814
- You have something--
- huh?

1093
01:09:47,815 --> 01:09:50,483
- You have something right here.
- What?

1094
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:52,685
You've got a goddamn booger
hanging from your nose

1095
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:54,994
- and it's fucking gross!
- Sorry.

1096
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:03,964
<i>No measure of time with you
would be long enough,</i>

1097
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:06,567
<i>but we'll start with...</i>

1098
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:08,680
<i>Forever.</i>

1099
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,965
Ah-hh!

1100
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,974
<i>Skytram!</i>

1101
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:51,577
It's impossible.
You're pregnant?

1102
01:10:51,578 --> 01:10:53,080
No, you idiot.

1103
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:54,583
Oh Christ.

1104
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:03,691
God, it's a really
bad case of the shits.

1105
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,760
God, I knew I shouldn't have
taken those stupid shrimp tacos

1106
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:09,396
from that guadalajaran
street vendor last night.

1107
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:23,911
You're definitely
pregnant, Bella.

1108
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,112
There's only one
slight inconsistency.

1109
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:28,114
The results of
the blood test reveal

1110
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:31,585
that the baby's DNA doesn't
exactly match that of Edward's.

1111
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:32,685
What?

1112
01:11:32,686 --> 01:11:34,520
That's impossible.

1113
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:36,024
Not according to science.

1114
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:39,359
Well, then whose is it?

1115
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,097
Daddy's home, bitches!

1116
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:51,938
Everyone, David here, and I'm
about to watch the new trailer

1117
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:54,375
for the "twilight" saga
"eclipse" movie.

1118
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,076
We're about
to watch it, people.

1119
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:58,679
Should we hold hands? We've
always held hands before.

1120
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,047
We probably should.
Very true.

1121
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:03,384
"The following preview has been
approved for appropriate audiences."

1122
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,019
I'm so nervous.

1123
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,956
Excuse me if I start screaming.

1124
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,405
Oh my God.

1125
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:26,706
- No. No no no.

1126
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:28,675

1127
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:30,479
...God.

1128
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:33,045
Oh my God!
Did you see that?

1129
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:34,915
- Oh my God.
- Holy shit!

1130
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:36,018
Oh, Alice--!

1131
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:45,192
New "eclipse" clip. New "eclipse" clip.
New "eclipse" clip.

1132
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:46,626
New "eclipse" clip.
New "eclipse" clip.

1133
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:48,661
New "eclipse" clip!
I'm gonna watch it

1134
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:51,130
because I need to watch it.
I've been waiting to all--

1135
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:53,066
well, not all day,
but most of today to watch it.

1136
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:54,867
And I really can't wait anymore

1137
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:56,769
because apparently
it's got the volturi in it.

1138
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,072
I love the volturi.
Oh my God.

1139
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:00,072
"Eclipse" clip!

1140
01:13:00,073 --> 01:13:02,576
Oh my God. No...

1141
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:04,877
I'm looking right now

1142
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:06,880
at the page and I can watch
the trailer now

1143
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:08,514
and I'm so nervous!

1144
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:10,184
Oh<i> my</i> God.

1145
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,719
I can't wait.

1146
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,222
Oh my God, it's the volturi!

1147
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:18,592
Oh my God!

1148
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:26,666
Oh my God.

1149
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,635
It's amazing!

1150
01:13:29,636 --> 01:13:31,671
And I love
the part where--

1151
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:34,774
the "twilight" trailer--
I love the whole part!

1152
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:36,677
The whole thing!
I love the whole thing!

1153
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,651
Oh my God!

1154
01:13:44,652 --> 01:13:47,254
Why have they not
leaked more? Okay?

1155
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,188
Do they not know
that "twilight" fans

1156
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:51,524
need more?!
We need more!

1157
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:54,126
More. Please.
Hi. More, please.

1158
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:56,229
I love this already.

1159
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,898
I've just seen it.

1160
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:00,099
I'm crying
because it was so good.

1161
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,103
I've got no voice because
I've spent the last day--

1162
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:07,107
I'm gonna go book a ticket
for tomorrow morning

1163
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:09,242
'cause I need to see it again.

1164
01:14:09,243 --> 01:14:11,844
Oh my God, oh my God. I've just
seen it for the fifth time.

1165
01:14:11,845 --> 01:14:14,648
I saw it four times yesterday
and I've just gotten home

1166
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:18,519
after seeing it for the fifth
time and I am totally exhausted.

1167
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,621
And I'm never gonna get
sick of this film ever.

1168
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,223
It's just not gonna happen.
No, it's not gonna happen.

1169
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:25,259
No, it's not.
I fucking love this film!

1170
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,792
I fucking love this film!

1171
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:28,629
I fucking loved
every single minute of it

1172
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,096
and I didn't get kicked out,

1173
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:31,532
which is actually
quite a surprise to me

1174
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,001
because that's normally what would
happen, to be totally honest with you.

1175
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,005
Oh my God, I have to go and see it
again and again and again and again.

1176
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,639
I don't even have
any other words.

1177
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,674
And I'm tired,
yet I'm still hyper

1178
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:42,709
and I've never really
done that before.

1179
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,313
And I'm eating jaffa cakes
for no apparent reason.

No reason.
