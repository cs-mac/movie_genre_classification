put my daughters?

1118
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,756
0ne in the attic and one on top
of the chippie with Abdul.

1119
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,559
Don't worry, it's very roomy.

1120
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,877
Wouldn't it be more convenient

1121
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,032
if your sons
were to live with us?

1122
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,639
I thought daughters-in-law lived
with their husband's family?

1123
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,039
Wouldn't you be grateful
for the space?

1124
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,678
I know I would.

1125
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,593
Excuse me, I'll, um...go and see
what's happened to those kids.

1126
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,429
You should've been here an hour
ago. Where's me cigs?

1127
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,715
Look what's in the box, Mam.

1128
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,279
0h!

1129
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,833
You dirty little bastard.

1130
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,353
Mam, it's Art.

1131
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,069
I'll Art you,
you dirty little sod.

1132
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,038
I'll burn the bleedin' thing!

1133
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,429
- No!
- Give it here!

1134
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,912
[Arguing loudly outside]

1135
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,117
[Saleem] You're pulling
all the hair ouuutttt!

1136
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,228
[Silence]

1137
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,753
- Ahh!
- Waah!

1138
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,791
What is this thing?! Move it!

1139
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,632
Take it away from me!

1140
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,710
I am so sorry, Mrs Shah.

1141
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,236
The hair came off in me hand.

1142
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,676
This is an insult
to me and my family.

1143
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,876
I will never allow my daughters

1144
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,872
to marry into
this family of half-breeds!

1145
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,670
At least they're not friggin'
inbred like them monstrosities.

1146
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,672
- Ella!
- Who d'you think you are?

1147
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,912
Tellin' me my house isn't good
enough for your daughters.

1148
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,357
Your daughters aren't good
enough for my sons, or my house.

1149
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,670
And if I hear another word,

1150
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,718
I'll stick that fanny
over your bastard head.

1151
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,998
Your wife's a disgrace.

1152
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,957
Ah, go on, piss off.

1153
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,429
Go on, sling your bleedin' hook!

1154
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,399
Go on, piss off!
Piss off out of my house!

1155
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,199
And take
Laurel and Hardy with you!

1156
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,588
[Women screaming
and dog barking]

1157
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,194
You bastard bitch.

1158
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,953
You bring a shame on our family.

1159
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,028
No, you should
be ashamed, George.

1160
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,916
'Cause you're not interested
in these kids being happy.

1161
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,675
You just wanna prove
what a great man you are.

1162
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,880
Because you're ashamed of me
and you're ashamed of our kids,

1163
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,520
and you won't even admit it.

1164
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,478
- Don't you dare!!
- Don't touch her! Bastard!

1165
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,630
[Abdul] No, Dad! Get off her!

1166
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,756
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

1167
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,398
- Bitch!
- Get off!

1168
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,596
You will not touch her again.

1169
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,671
No talk like that.

1170
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,352
No, it's over, finished!

1171

Sajid, will you pack it in?!
[Ripping]

1172

Are you happy?
Is this what you wanted?

1173
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,037
I know what is best for you all.

1174
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,269
Maneer, you understand me.

1175

1176
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,229
Got the message?

1177
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,629
Bastard! All your fault!

1178
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,233
Calm down, right?

1179
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,997
I only want to help you, Son.

1180
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,640
I no want to hurt you.

1181
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,309
Ella...

1182
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,916
No, just go, George. Just go.

[Saleem] Should've kicked
his head in, Abdul.

1189
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,393
I couldn't hit me dad.

1190
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,391
That bastard's not a father.

1191
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,234
Pack it in,
you get on me bleedin' nerves.

1192
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,792
If it's not you, it's your dad,
if it's not your dad, it's you.

1193
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,189
You're nothing
but bleedin' trouble.

Pablo bleedin' Picasso.

That ''bastard'' that you are
talking about is my husband.

1197
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,869
And whatever you might think
of him he is still your father.

1198

If I hear another foul-mouthed
word, I will have you.

Where's Sajid?

1200
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,791
He ran out.

1201

I ripped his hood off.

1202

Well, it's a start.
