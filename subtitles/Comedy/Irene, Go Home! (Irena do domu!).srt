1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Year 1941

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,200
- Irena Sendler, your work?
- Department of Social Services.

3
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,750
I see that, my question is about today?

4
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,200
What is your work today,
Why are you here?

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,200
Inspection of the refugee centers.
Prevent the spread of typhus.

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,100
You Poles must solve this
problem, it's a disgrace.

7
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Please, buy it from me...

8
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
What do you think you are doing?

9
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
And you do not want any?

10
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,450
Yes.

11
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:02,200
Irena it is Sofia, I know
it's curfew but can you come?

12
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Yes, I will come right away.
- How soon?

13
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,200
I will walk so, 20 minutes?

14
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,200
- Come now hurry
- Please, stay calm.

15
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,600
- Irenka?
- Its all right Mama, go back to sleep!

16
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
- Thank God you are here.
- Where is she?

17
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,299
With Krzysztof.

18
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,460
Tonight, when Krzysztof came home
the way our neighbors looked at him.

19
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,850
We were betrayed.
I just know, I'm sorry Irena.

20
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:54,200
If Germans find us hiding a Jew,
they will execute us.

21
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,600
It's all right, it's all right

22
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,700
Hello, Anna, it's Irena.
Do not need to be afraid.

23
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,622
And tonight you going to stay with me.

24
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,200
Would you like that?

25
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,500
Is that you?

26
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,550
Yes this is my father.

27
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,300
- Where is he?
- He died.

28
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Mine too.

29
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,800
- Mama, you should not be up.
- Believe me, I know.

30
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,700
- Hello sweet heart
- Anna, this is my mother.

31
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,600
See what I have for you.
Look at this.

32
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Time for bed.

33
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,200
- How many mothers do you have?
- I just have one.

34
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Already, I had three.

35
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Why do they not like me?
Who does not like you?

36
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,050
My mothers.

37
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:44,697
Your mothers love you.
And I love you.

38
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:47,600
And I will always love you.

39
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Go to sleep

40
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,980
- Mom, we have to go now.
- Here.

41
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,100
It is safe to take
her out in broad daylight?

42
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,251
She passes as Christian.
Are you worried?

43
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,000
Not one bit.

44
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:13,650
- Mama, hmm?
- Ahh, good.

45
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:16,200
- Eva will love it.
- It's Perfect.

46
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,400
Mama! Take your medicine.

47
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,300
Mama, please.

48
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,127
The cat is counting,
playing hide-and-seek.

49
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
You make me laugh.

50
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
You're so smart.

51
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,000
- Come in Anna!
- Anna, this is Miss Jadwiga.

52
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Hello sweetie, come in.

53
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Thank you, come in.

54
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,555
Anna, you can play with
Miss Jadwiga's children

55
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:58,200
while I find you a lovely place to live.

56
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Good girl.

57
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,950
She has passed outside
the ghetto all this time.

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
There must be a Polish family
who can take her.

59
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,979
Not any we know personally.

60
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll ask father Godlewski
he will know some we can trust.

61
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,200
- Wait. You mean now?
- His soup kitchen's on my way.

62
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,817
- You're going to the ghetto?
- Yes, I’ll see you later.

63
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,148
Irena you remember we had a
meeting with public housing.

64
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:25,300
Be charming, give nothing.

65
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Monsignor Godlewski. Good morning!
- Ah, Irena.

66
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
What do you hear?

67
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,036
In the last two weeks, they
have filled 20 train cars

68
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:50,250
of Jews in Luxemburg and Vienna,

69
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:52,800
deported them all
to the ghetto in Lodz.

70
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,077
And here,

71
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,500
every day they bring more.

72
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,895
You know we are doing all we can to
help Jews survive outside the ghetto.

73
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:03,300
Yes yes I know, of course.

74
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,100
And today I have a little girl

75
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,500
and no Polish family to hide her.

76
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,500
It's more difficult now.

77
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Perhaps in your congregation?

78
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:18,400
Irena, please of all people, you
know the risk for a Polish family.

79
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,805
Even so, is it not
possible there are some

80
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:23,700
or even many Poles who want
to help but don't know how?

81
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Yes, yes, yes

82
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
It is possible.

83
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
- Eva.
- Irena.

84
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,901
Come, come.

85
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,299
Good morning, Hannah.

86
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,671
Oh, Irena, always
such a faithful friend.

87
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,500
God bless you.

88
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,200
- Rabbi Rozenfeld.
- Irena, how are you this fine day?

89
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,350
Is this work for a Rabbi?

90
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:23,200
We all must live with dignity,
especially in the days of hatred.

91
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,200
Miss. Irena! Miss. Irena!

92
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Karolyna! Or should I say, the famous
Miss Nijinska, Prima ballerina?

93
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Do you know what I learned to do!
Do you want to see?

94
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
Of course, you must show me!

95
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,465
- Bravo!
- How is your mother?

96
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,600
Well enough. if she behaves.
And your Jacob?

97
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Last week he came back to the
ghetto to hug his daughter.

98
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,200
And to kiss you,
I am sure.

99
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,200
Maybe yes, a little.

100
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I brought a few things.

101
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,101
Let me, let me!

102
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
I brought you a skirt.

103
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,200
You made this?

104
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,061
Can you imagine me putting
two stitches together?

105
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,000
- Then your mother.
- She misses you, so do I.

106
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,400
My dearest friends in the
whole world. Please thank her.

107
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,400
Eva, I need to talk with you.

108
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,737
Over the last few weeks, they
have deported 20 freight cars

109
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,200
of Jews from Austria
to the ghetto in Lodz.

110
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,686
Yes, we heard last night.

111
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:52,900
The Jewish Council says they're
headed for work camps.

112
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,800
Eva, your Jewish Council
was appointed by Germans.

113
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,550
How many years have we listened
to their terrible propaganda?

114
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,200
What they say about Jews,
what they say they have in mind...

115
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,300
It's just talk, rumor. Who can believe it?
These are cultured people.

116
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:13,900
Anyway, we're almost five hundred thousand
in this Ghetto. What could they do?

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,700
It's so confusing.

118
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,950
One day someone says something
is true, another says it's not.

119
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,200
Every morning I wake up,
my body is cold.

120
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
We have to get you all out of here.

121
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,200
They would never leave.
I could never leave them.

122
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,200
I could find Polish families
willing to hide you.

123
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,000
Most people believe it's better
to stay all together, inside the wall.

124
00:12:56,001 --> 00:13:00,200
I want you safe,
all of you.

125
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,400
Irena, what is safe?
Where?

126
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Good morning, Miss Irena.

127
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:17,000
Good morning Doctor Majkowski,
have you had a chance to consider my...

128
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:22,100
Yes, I have selected your friend,
Maria Debinska to join your department.

129
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,501
Thank you, doctor.

130
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,964
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Irena.

131
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,050
Maria, welcome to our little
department, thank you.

132
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,100
My thanks to you.

133
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,400
- Good morning, Miss Irena.
- You missed an exciting meeting.

134
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,300
Issued today, the new ration card.

135
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,940
2613 calories a day for Germans,
699 calories for Poles,

136
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,700
300 calories for residents
of the ghetto.

137
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,700
So we will have starvation along
with a Typhus epidemic.

138
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,299
And winter almost here.

139
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,450
We'll need to bring in food,
clothing, medicine.

140
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:08,000
Maria, talk to Doctor Majkowski, see how
much Typhus vaccine you can get.

141
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,050
Since The Occupation Jadwiga
has done a brilliant job

142
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,900
trying to balance to
balance an impossible budget.

143
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,350
But...

144
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:21,075
But, if we continue to spread our
services over every district in Warsaw,

145
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,399
we will not be helping anyone.

146
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,850
From now on we must focus our
full attention in the Jewish ghetto

147
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,300
Excuse me, Miss Irena.
The Jewish Quarter is not our problem.

148
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
Why not?

149
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,700
The Germans put them there to protect us.
- Protect us from what?

150
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Maria, you are a nurse, you know very well.
- What do I know, tell me?

151
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,800
They have lice, spread disease and...

152
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,400
You know what I'm talking about.

153
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:59,800
Danuta, if Jews are sick, it is
because Germans put them there.

154
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,950
One reason, another reason
what does it matter.

155
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:14,075
All I know is I am not going to bring
Typhus home to my family.

156
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,088
Whatever it is you're thinking,

157
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:20,600
I’m sorry, I can't be part of it.

158
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,729
Anyone else who does not
agree with this direction,

159
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,600
I will arrange a department transfer.

160
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Stefania, you have only been
with us for two months.

161
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,200
I have not yet been inside the walls,
but I know I must do it.

162
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Very good.

163
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Later we go to the refuge center.

164
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Stefania...

165
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,600
We are at war, you are soldier now.

166
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,800
A soldier must be tough
or she cannot fight.

167
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
Oh! Hold her.
Hold her still, good, good.

168
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,399
- Why do you bother?
- Because we want your child to survive.

169
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,700
If you want her to live, please,
take her from me, get her out of here.

170
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,201
I' begging you take her.

171
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,900
I’m sorry, but it's not possible.

172
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Next please, next.

173
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Please, Mama,
go back to bed.

174
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm fine.
Do not worry.

175
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
What is it?

176
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Tell me.

177
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Irena?

178
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,200
Irenka, tell me what.

179
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Today, I understood something.

180
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,200
Something about what?

181
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,200
I thought I was doing
all I could, but...

182
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,200
but the truth is
I am doing nothing.

183
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,200
Nothing?

184
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Is it my imagination

185
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,100
or was there a little Jewish child
sleeping in your bed last night?

186
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,200
One child is not enough!

187
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,250
Oh Irena, you are so like your father.

188
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,100
Little Anna has always lived
outside the Ghetto.

189
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,400
Inside the wall there are thousands
of children who could be rescued.

190
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Take them out?

191
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Is that what you're thinking?

192
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,700
Past the Gestapo?

193
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,000
German soldiers, Jewish police?

194
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
How is that possible?

195
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,500
You are a social worker,

196
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,300
a good social worker

197
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
With a biggest heart I know

198
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,700
but to risk everything

199
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,600
for something you know nothing about...

200
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,900
I remember what father used to say.

201
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
You see a man drowning,

202
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
you must try to save him,
even if you can not swim.

203
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Thank you.

204
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,255
- And you?
- Two loaves and 250 grams of butter.

205
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,555
- You are a Jew.
- No, I'm not.

206
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
One of those filthy little
smugglers from the ghetto.

207
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,637
No, I'm Polish.

208
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:43,698
Let us see you make
the sign of the cross!

209
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Come on, come on, do it!

210
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Every day I pray to God
this boy lives safe in this city.

211
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,606
But the way he looks and he behaves,

212
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,200
you can not imagine in
what we have been through.

213
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Come on!

214
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,225
With this red hair, you do
not think you look Jewish?

215
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,699
- And get yourself a cap.
- Yes, miss.

216
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,580
If you want to survive outside the
Ghetto you must lie with more conviction.

217
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,800
And learn how to cross
yourself. Like this.

218
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Now, you.

219
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,600
Again. Quickly!

220
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Very good. Get out of here.

221
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Wait!

222
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,801
Jasio, I have to go
on police patrol.

223
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,600
But, I do not want you
going out after curfew.

224
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
They can shoot you on spot.

225
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,600
Why risk your live
to smuggle a few potatoes?

226
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,699
I make enough.

227
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,400
You're a traitor!

228
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,998
Can you not understand.

229
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,000
I only do what I do
so that we can survive.

230
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
It is you who does not understand.

231
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Mr. Policeman.

232
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>I want to help children
inside, the, ghetto.</i>

233
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,600
It is very dangerous.

234
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,699
Too dangerous.

235
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes, probably, but what would it take?

236
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,500
Well, I suppose an organized
network of people you trust,

237
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,400
enough money for each
child's room and board.

238
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,699
And if you agree,

239
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,000
more Polish families
willing to hide a Jewish child.

240
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,688
I will try to find some.

241
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,399
What about identity cards?

242
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,514
If I destroy some of the
parish death certificates,

243
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:43,300
issue new baptismal certificates.

244
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,800
That is all the proof Germans
need for an identity card.

245
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,600
The only thing is,
how to get them out?

246
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,600
There is someone you must talk to...

247
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,600
a young man who smuggles
potatoes from the Aryan side,

248
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,800
he works in Korczak's orphanage.

249
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Ask him to introduce you
to Stefan Zgrzembski.

250
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,700
- Zgrzembski?
- Yes, that's him.

251
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,900
Guten morgen, Father.

252
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,900
Professor Korczak, how many
children live inside the ghetto?

253
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,724
Including all the ones
who live in the streets?

254
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:52,028
There must be at least 80 thousand,
half under the age of ten.

255
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:54,098
Be brave now.

256
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,600
Have you ever tried to get any out?

257
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,699
Out to where?

258
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,100
Not so many Poles want to hide
a Jewish child.

259
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,600
And how many Jews would let
their children live with Gentiles?

260
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,600
What about orphans, these ones?

261
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,933
Even if you found a way, most of mine
could not survive outside the wall.

262
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,699
- Why not?
- It's the language.

263
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
She only speaks Yiddish.

264
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,600
Is that not right?

265
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,600
They all speaks excellent Yiddish.

266
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Polish, that's another matter.

267
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
And they are all beautiful

268
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,600
but most are not passable as Aryan.

269
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Irena?

270
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Hello, Stefan.

271
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,600
Hello.

272
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,600
Zgrzembski, Irena came to see you.

273
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,600
You attended my classes together.

274
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,600
Yes.

275
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
A long time ago.

276
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,600
Zgrzembski, let me deal with this

277
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,400
horrible little savages right here!

278
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,100
I've found something here with
prof. Korczak and the children.

279
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm glad.

280
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
But you still smuggle potatoes.

281
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,600
Irena Sendler,
always straight to the point.

282
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
Tell me how.

283
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,400
I know a few safe ways to get out,

284
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,800
blind spots the Germans overlooked.

285
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,600
- There is the courthouse.
- Which courthouse.

286
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,600
On Ogrodowa street.

287
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
There also an entrance
for the ghetto's side,

288
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,300
and a friend with the key.

289
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
- The other ways?
- I can show you.

290
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,600
The main sewer line goes all the
way down to the central junction

291
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,699
under Gdanski station.

292
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,699
- And from there?
- Anywhere you want.

293
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,222
One line goes under Okopowa Street,

294
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,600
another goes under Marszalkowska,

295
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,900
third line goes under
New Town and Miodowa Street.

296
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,800
The Germans keep the courts so busy
they have forgotten this entrance.

297
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,600
You remember our summer walks
along the Vistula River?

298
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,201
- Every step.
- Shall we?

299
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,705
- Welcome to Warsaw.
- Thank you Stefan.

300
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,700
We will use this way first.

301
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,600
- Be careful.
- You know me.

302
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
That is what I mean.

303
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Be careful about yourself.

304
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Come fast, hurry!

305
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Documents!

306
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Hello.

307
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,600
My name is Irena.

308
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,800
Can you tell me yours?

309
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,900
The boy who sits beside
you every day.

310
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,600
Is he your brother?

311
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
He died.

312
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I'm sorry.

313
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,200
Can you tell me where you live?

314
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
All right.

315
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Come with me.

316
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
We have hot soup.
Just made for you.

317
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,600
Are you going to get
her changed in here?

318
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Yes. I think it's a good idea.

319
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,000
All right. We need to do
something about her hair.

320
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,699
Can we braid it?

321
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,600
Please help if you would.

322
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
All right.
Lets take this skirt off.

323
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Very good girl.

324
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,845
And try a beret.

325
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,699
It will keep you warm.
Much better.

326
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
Good girl.

327
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,600
You look so beautiful.

328
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,800
Ready for a little walk
in the courthouse?

329
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,200
Come on sweetie,
we must...

330
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,600
Such a little trouble-maker.

331
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
You have no idea.

332
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Come along, sweetheart.

333
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
- Rabbi.
- For me?

334
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,500
Such a dashing fashion for a Rabbi.

335
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
And...

336
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
for you, Miss Nijinska!

337
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,600
Oh, yes,

338
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
I remember this book!

339
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,600
Welcome! Come in, come in!

340
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Rabbi, thank you so much.

341
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
So many people without shelter.

342
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,963
Eva! Hannah!

343
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:22,700
Come! Help me, please.

344
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,600
This is perfect.

345
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,600
Let us read a little bit.

346
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,200
Blankets for you.
It's very cold outside

347
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,699
We are very well, Rabbi.

348
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Come on.

349
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,700
Is she your little girl?

350
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Why do I have to be a Jew?

351
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
What if I want to be something else?

352
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,100
I don't like being
hated by everybody.

353
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Everybody does not hate you.

354
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Yes they do.

355
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
You know it's true.

356
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,737
What did we ever do?

357
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
It's not fair.

358
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,600
There are ways to get out of the ghetto,

359
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,600
ways that are still safe.

360
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,600
- I cannot.
- Yes, I know.

361
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,600
But I've been thinking about Karolyna.

362
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,699
Karolyna?

363
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,400
We know Polish families who
can be trusted,

364
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,600
several priests,
convents in the countryside.

365
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,600
Stop, Irena!

366
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,699
Let me ask you one thing,
tell me from your heart.

367
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,967
How is it possible for a
mother to give up a child?

368
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:49,152
How?

369
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,700
Now I must ask you something...

370
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,600
a terrible thing.

371
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
No, no don't, please...

372
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,200
If it happened that
the rumors are true...

373
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,675
and if for Karolyna...

374
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:07,300
you had to choose
between life and death...

375
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,600
Please, I cannot face it, I cannot.

376
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,600
You can, Eva
and you must.

377
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,200
Please, speak with your Jacob.

378
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,700
Irenka. Do you know what this
author says about life?

379
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,699
Mama, please, I have to go.

380
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,200
Please, take one moment to breath.

381
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,600
What this writer says is in order
to have a happy life,

382
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,500
you must exercise your own free will.

383
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,699
Interesting. Bye-bye.

384
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,300
Which is why I would never
tell you not to do something

385
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,793
or suggest to you that I
might possibly be worried.

386
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,518
I would never do such a thing.

387
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
No matter what happens.

388
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Thank you, Mama.

389
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,994
Thank you.

390
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,600
What has happened?

391
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,600
All the Social Service programs
have been suspended.

392
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,699
Who has access?

393
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,700
From now on only nurses, doctors,
workers in the Health Department.

394
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,600
Today I was told I am officially

395
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,600
responsible for any
further spread of Typhus.

396
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
But it is impossible,
what do they...

397
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,400
Of course it's impossible.
That's their point.

398
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,600
If I cannot help myself,
how can I help you?

399
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,600
I will need Health Department
work passes,

400
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,500
four... no, no maybe
five nurse's uniforms.

401
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,699
Is that all?

402
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,495
I hope so.
Perhaps a larger vehicle.

403
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,600
We will seek orphans and
homeless in the market area

404
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,600
and specific families we already know are
willing to let us place their children...

405
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,600
One of Doctor Majkowski's
drivers has volunteered,

406
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,699
Piotr Lipinski.

407
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,699
Miss Irena.

408
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

409
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,699
Thank you, Piotr.

410
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,600
Mr. Lipinski sprays for Typhus.

411
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,600
You understand the risk?

412
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,600
Only small problems,
but I am not too worried.

413
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,900
We will use my disinfectant truck.

414
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,600
I beg you, keep them together.

415
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm sorry, its not possible.

416
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,396
Sister Jolanta, please understand

417
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,965
whatever happens they will
always have each other.

418
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,300
One slip, one word in Yiddish.
They could give each other away.

419
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
How will I ever find them?

420
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,600
I will keep a record
to where I place them.

421
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I promise.

422
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,000
Mom, and I do not want to go!

423
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:45,374
Take her. Please go!

424
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
You can go.

425
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,600
Tell me, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

426
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,600
A priest.

427
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,600
Yes, very good,

428
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
that's perfect!

429
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Up you go, you can do it.

430
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:38,222
<i>Papers? Vehicle check.</i>

431
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:41,456
<i>What do you have in the truck?</i>

432
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,908
We have a problem.
Roadblock. Vehicle check.

433
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,700
All right. Let's go for a walk.

434
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Our Father who art in Heaven,

435
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,800
Hallowed be thy name...

436
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,800
Thy kingdom come.

437
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,600
Thy will be done.

438
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,600
On earth,

439
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
as it is in heaven.

440
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,600
Give us this day.

441
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
our daily bread.

442
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
And forgive us of our trespasses.

443
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
As we forgive those

444
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
who trespass against us.

445
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,000
#Ashes, ashes... we all fall down#

446
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Children!

447
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,600
Come now, all together.

448
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,600
Show Miss Irena how we
know our bedtime prayers.

449
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,500
Now I lay me down to sleep,

450
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,467
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;

451
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,300
And if I die before I wake,

452
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,900
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

453
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,100
First month. Room and board.

454
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,000
Is there anything else I should know?

455
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
She had a brother.

456
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
- This is Adam.
- Hello, Adam!

457
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
- Does he speak Polish?
- Perfectly.

458
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,600
Irena.

459
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
Jacob!

460
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,600
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I have to be so careful.

461
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,600
Is Eva all right, Karolyna?

462
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,600
Yes, everything's the same.

463
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,600
Irena, your instinct
to take our daughter.

464
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,500
It is difficult, Irena.
But it's the right thing to do.

465
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,600
Eva has met with community leaders.

466
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,600
They want to speak about
hiding their children.

467
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Of course

468
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,900
And what if my wife and I do
not survive the war?

469
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,600
Who will claim our son?

470
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
I keep a record of every child.

471
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,600
And if this record or you are destroyed?

472
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,600
What guarantee can you give
our children will survive?

473
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,600
I can not guarantee anything,

474
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
not even escape from the Ghetto.

475
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,600
Babies will pass more easily,
but if they can speak

476
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,600
they must speak Polish.

477
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
They must know Catholic hymns
and prayers.

478
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,600
My children only speak Yiddish.

479
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,000
I understand this is very difficult.

480
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,600
They will need to memorize
their new Christian names,

481
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,600
their new home address,

482
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,800
the entire history of their new family,

483
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,600
harmless gossip about
their neighbors - all of it.

484
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,800
What you are saying is we must
teach our children to lie.

485
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,700
To survive, yes.

486
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:16,699
What about conversion?

487
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,800
I make it clear I do not wish this.

488
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,678
You may not wish it, but on young,
impressionable minds,

489
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,549
time and education will surely
dim any memories of their past.

490
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,400
In this case, he will grow up
a good Christian.

491
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,600
For mothers and fathers,

492
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,160
to give away a child
is an unthinkable act.

493
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,600
This is the truth.

494
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,600
The other truth is Hitler calls
Jews a cancer on the nation

495
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,700
and speaks openly about the annihilation
of every Jew on the continent.

496
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,500
Outside these walls there are
Poles prepared to risk their lives

497
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,700
to save your children.

498
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,100
We Jews, we Jews have survived
in the hardest times.

499
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,700
And now we are faced
with another extinction.

500
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:14,136
Perhaps this time we can only
be saved by a new generation of Jews.

501
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:19,400
How wise are we to take away
the birthright of this new generation?

502
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,100
I recommend we
consider this proposal.

503
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,133
I am not in favor of sending our
children into such a dubious world.

504
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,600
Now America is in the war.

505
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,600
This news favors our liberation
for this we should wait.

506
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,400
Our dear friend has presented us with

507
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,900
the difficult truths of our time.

508
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,600
We should thank her for
her courage to speak.

509
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,100
Jasio go back,
there's another bag!

510
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,200
- No! I will not.
- Go get it!

511
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Let me go!

512
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,700
No, No!

513
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,699
Hey! Jasio! Stop!

514
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,700
Jasio!

515
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,700
Jasio!

516
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Sister Jolanta. Walk with me.
Please, please.

517
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,600
My name is Michal Laski,

518
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,600
I know who you are and what you do.

519
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,600
The man you saw just now.
He is Untersturmfuhrer Karl Brandt.

520
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,600
He is in charge of Jewish Resettlement.

521
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,533
We are told in a few
months they will begin

522
00:49:03,534 --> 00:49:05,699
to send everyone in ghetto
to work camps in the East.

523
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,300
- Why do you tell me this?
- I have a son, Jasio.

524
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Ten years old.

525
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,600
His mother died last year,
he has no one.

526
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,427
- He has you.
- He lives with smugglers,

527
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:22,700
goes under the wall at night,
risks his life every day.

528
00:49:22,735 --> 00:49:24,600
I want to get him out before
he's caught and shot.

529
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,200
If from time to time I help you,
will you help me?

530
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,600
Mr. Laski, I will help your
son without conditions.

531
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,388
If from time to time you help me,

532
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:34,200
you would be helping many
children, including your son.

533
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,968
There's a passage through a
brick wall on Twarda Street.

534
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,600
On the other side in
the abandoned house.

535
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,400
Your Jasio... does he
have red hair like you?

536
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,300
Yes but thanks to God
he now wears a cap.

537
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,100
You know about this new German
that is now in charge of the Ghetto.

538
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,000
Yes, for work camp resettlement.

539
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,600
Stefan!

540
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,700
Do not be like this.

541
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,400
You know how many thousands of Jews
have disappeared from the Lodz Ghetto.

542
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Vanished. And to where?

543
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,600
Some place they call Resettlement.

544
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,500
Doctor Korczak told me
to prepare for the worst.

545
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,300
If there is no other way,
that is what I must do.

546
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,600
Where is everyone?
What has happened?

547
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,100
Books, bank accounts, invoices,
receipts they've taken over all of it.

548
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Who?

549
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,699
The Gestapo.

550
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,700
Guten tag.

551
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,560
Amen.

552
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,300
Karolyna, can you tell us why this night
is different from all other nights?

553
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:53,119
Sweetheart?

554
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
I know why tonight is different.

555
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,800
Tonight is different because once
we were slaves and now we are free!

556
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,400
Jacob...
Welcome... Papa!

557
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,700
I am not here for Seder.

558
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,300
I have some news you must hear.

559
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,000
The underground received information
verified by Polish train machinists,

560
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,600
some lucky Jews who escaped,
even from a few good Germans.

561
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,797
They all say camps are being built.

562
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:53,100
Concentration camps, work camps.
Auschwitz is like this, we know.

563
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,200
You remember the thousands of Jews
who were deported from Lodz,

564
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,700
the ones who disappeared.

565
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,000
Last week 300 train cars of
clothing returned for sorting.

566
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,600
What else, Jacob?

567
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,100
We hear rumors they are building
another camp. Treblinka.

568
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Only 90km from Warsaw.

569
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,600
Where there are fake station platforms.

570
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,600
Underground bunkers.

571
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,600
One thing they have not
constructed - barracks.

572
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
No barracks?

573
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,400
I do not understand.
Why no barracks?

574
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,600
Mama, they do not...

575
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
In such camps,

576
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,700
the only purpose is death.

577
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,900
We need to find a way
to get you out of the Ghetto.

578
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,300
Get out, you say! Get out how?
Get out to where?

579
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,700
Papa.

580
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,100
Irena has made
an offer for Karolyna.

581
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,200
- There is a convent in the countryside.
- This is not possible.

582
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,600
She will become converted!
Never!

583
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,700
Chaim!

584
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,200
These many months
I have said nothing.

585
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,800
Now I will give my opinion.

586
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,900
Our dearest Irenka has risked
her life for us many times.

587
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,600
Now, she has made an offer for
Karolyna we must accept.

588
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,600
I believe a convent is best.

589
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,500
- No, no, no. This must not be done.
- Chaim Rozenfeld!

590
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,200
You have loved me since I
was a little girl in pigtails

591
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,122
and after these many
years you know very well

592
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,900
an opinion from me
is not a suggestion.

593
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,800
Next time, when you come
she will be prepared.

594
00:55:19,463 --> 00:55:21,135
Irena...

595
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:23,600
the Underground knows
what you're doing.

596
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,600
They want to help.

597
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,600
There's a man you should speak to,
goes by the name Trojan.

598
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,887
- 24 Zurawia Street.
- Zurawia, 24.

599
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,600
For Karolyna, I promise,
I will do everything...

600
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,577
We know that, Irena. We know.

601
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,400
<i>You have created an efficient
network already saved many children</i>

602
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,600
<i>and so far no one has
been betrayed or exposed.</i>

603
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,612
<i>We the Underground have
a good deal of money.</i>

604
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:05,699
<i>And Victor here has many contacts.
It could be a good arrangement.</i>

605
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,600
This money, where does it come from?

606
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,700
Polish government in exile in London.

607
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,701
- To help the Jews?
- Zegota is only for that.

608
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,699
- Who is Konrad Zegota?
- He does not exist.

609
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,102
Which makes him hard to find,
especially for the Germans

610
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:20,900
who will never stop looking.

611
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,600
What is your proposal?

612
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,900
We will help you rescue
children. If you agree.

613
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:35,035
I agree.

614
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,600
<i>We will provide you with funds,
papers and identification.</i>

615
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,000
<i>You obtain this by picking
of Konrad Zegota's laundry.</i>

616
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,800
<i>A little shop on Bracka street,
near Three Crosses Square.</i>

617
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,700
- Looks like we're back in business.
- Let me count.

618
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,700
Look. Identification cards.

619
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,900
Very good quality, these will work.

620
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,700
Hey, what's going on?

621
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:30,826
They're deporting the
section, all the orphanages.

622
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:36,375
What's happening?

623
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:38,600
They've begin Deportations,
started with the orphanages.

624
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
- Which once?
- All of them.

625
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,700
Stefan!

626
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,640
<i>Stay quietly and obey the orders.</i>

627
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,874
<i>If you act against resettlement,
you will be shot.</i>

628
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,600
<i>Attention! All Jews.</i>

629
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:21,040
<i>You will be resettled to the East.
You will be safe.</i>

630
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,900
<i>But you must remain
calm and obey the orders.</i>

631
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,300
Stefan!
You must be get out of here.

632
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,800
Do it, for me, for the children.
You must see and remember.

633
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,105
And then survive.

634
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:37,699
Go. Go on, quickly.

635
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
Now.
Go, go!

636
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,700
You know how to do it.

637
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,600
<i>Attention! All Jews.</i>

638
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,318
May God walk with you.
Go! Go!

639
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,700
<i>Remain calm as you move forward.</i>

640
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,000
<i>If you act in any way against
resettlement you will be shot.</i>

641
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,150
<i>Attention! All Jews.</i>

642
01:00:00,151 --> 01:00:05,643
<i>Obey the orders and remain
calm as you move forward.</i>

643
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:11,960
<i>If you act in any way against
resettlement you will be shot.</i>

644
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,700
Thank you, Lord God.
- Mom.

645
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,600
They took so many children.

646
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:46,000
They took them. They took them
and there was nothing I can do.

647
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,600
I've heard this news.

648
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,700
Who told you?

649
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,700
Your friend, Irena.

650
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,700
Now we must be quiet.
Everything will be all right.

651
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,600
We can not do it now.

652
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,400
Please, one more day. Just one.

653
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,600
He will understand.

654
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,100
Now is still possible,
tomorrow is uncertain.

655
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,201
- This section may be emptied.
- Tomorrow he will be ready, I promise.

656
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,699
Look.

657
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,800
No more courthouse entrance.

658
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,600
It's a big problem.

659
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,899
Oh, stop fiddling,

660
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,600
- You're making me nervous.
- You need to get more rest

661
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,699
For Heaven's sake,

662
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,700
if I'd had a stroke, I'd be dead.

663
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,337
I'm telling you, I got up too fast,
I fainted. That's all.

664
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,600
It is serious, Janina.

665
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,700
With this I can hear the truth.

666
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
You are a very brave young woman.

667
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Stefan?

668
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,699
There is room for two.

669
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,700
What are you doing?

670
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,700
A little carpentry.

671
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,700
What do you think?

672
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,200
I feel a little bit confined.
I think I need to get out.

673
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,500
It's, it's not opening.
It's stuck.

674
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,205
It, it, hmm...

675
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:05,300
Can you please try? Please.

676
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:09,110
- It's stuck from the outside.
- No. Please, open it. Please.

677
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:28,183
OK. All right, I need to,
we need to get out of here.

678
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Mama?

679
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,700
Irenka?

680
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,800
<i>Any Jew that hide and
found hiding will be shot.</i>

681
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
Jews out!

682
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,700
Jasio!

683
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,700
Are you hungry?

684
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Drink this.
You must drink something.

685
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,700
Jasio?

686
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
Do you remember?

687
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
I can't leave them.
I will not.

688
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,162
You have done a good thing,
Jasio, a very important thing

689
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,600
and it may be hard to understand but
the future will need your compassion

690
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,500
even more than now.

691
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,300
Which is why tomorrow
you must save yourself.

692
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
You know the coal room?
Where the Rabbis study?

693
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,200
Two o'clock tomorrow my friend
will meet you there.

694
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
She wears bright red lipstick.

695
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,700
Be strong,

696
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,700
say your good byes.

697
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,700
I will never see you again.

698
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,373
I will never see any of
you again, any of you.

699
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:34,600
Yes, you will, I promise.

700
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,700
No, you can't promise.

701
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,605
Nobody can promise anything any more!

702
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,700
Darling... Darling.

703
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
I love you with all my heart.

704
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,300
My love for you is so big and
strong it will never go away.

705
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,600
It will always be with you.

706
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,200
Whenever you think of me,
I will be there,

707
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,600
right over your shoulder.
Forever and ever.

708
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.

709
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,600
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.

710
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,200
But when I grow up I want
to live in Bavaria.

711
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,600
My uncle says Germany
is much more beautiful...

712
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,699
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.

713
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,033
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.

714
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:39,000
But when I grow up I want
to live in Bavaria. My uncle...

715
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,700
Quick, quick in!

716
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,700
Out, out. Get out of here.
Out, get out! Out. Out!

717
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,200
Leave them alone,
they are old and sick.

718
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,700
They did nothing to you.

719
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
Jasio?

720
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,700
Michal Laski!

721
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,600
Everybody out!

722
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,700
You...
Come with me!

723
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,700
And you, come!

724
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,535
Get away from here.
Walk slowly.

725
01:10:14,536 --> 01:10:16,600
- I saw Jasio. He will get out.
- Thank you.

726
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Jasio?

727
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,000
We can not wait for him any longer.

728
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,700
I know.

729
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,700
Come.

730
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,700
Jasio.

731
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,600
Jasio!

732
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Jasio, no.

733
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,600
Jasio!

734
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,700
Papa. Papa!

735
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,600
- I tried to get out but they...
- It's all right, it's all right.

736
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,900
I am here.
I am here now.

737
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Stay close to me.

738
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,800
Hold on to me.
Hold on tight.

739
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,700
No! He's my son!

740
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,300
My family is protected!

741
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,699
Come.

742
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,700
Look at that.

743
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,700
Thank you.

744
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,700
Treblinka
60 km

745
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,700
Papa! Papa!

746
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,800
Jasio, I understand now why you
lived in the street.

747
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,900
It was God's way to make you
strong so you can survive.

748
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,700
Here, give him my sweater.

749
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,600
I cannot do it. I'm afraid, Papa.
Please, I can't.

750
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,700
Yes, you can.
Listen, to me, you can do it.

751
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,700
Jasio, listen to me.

752
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,046
Land on your elbows,
keep your head down.

753
01:14:38,096 --> 01:14:40,392
- Come with me.
- Keep your head down

754
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,546
and stay still until you
see the train is gone.

755
01:14:42,596 --> 01:14:44,699
Papa, please come with me!
I love you, papa.

756
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,000
Then you must run as fast
as you can into the trees.

757
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:52,526
I love you, Papa. Please! Come with me.
I don't want to please!

758
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,600
You must be brave.

759
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,600
Jasio, are you ready?

760
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,700
I can't! Papa! I can't.
Please come with me. Please.

761
01:15:01,139 --> 01:15:02,699
- One...
- No!

762
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,700
Two...

763
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,700
Three!

764
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,700
Papa.

765
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,700
Children!

766
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,600
Children.
Children.

767
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,200
This is Angela, she will be joining us.

768
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,700
Please don't leave me, please.

769
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:50,800
This war will end and you will survive
to be a mother and tell your story.

770
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,623
And one day, if we are both very clever,

771
01:16:56,673 --> 01:17:01,700
I will find you.
I promise.

772
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,600
Now there is something you
must promise me.

773
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,900
You must promise that
you will always remember

774
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:13,620
that you are the famous Miss Nijinska,
Prima ballerina.

775
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,700
I love you.

776
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,700
Me too.

777
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,875
Go on, now.

778
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:35,925
Let me go.

779
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,700
Laundry Kazik

780
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,699
Gestapo.

781
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,700
Come with us!

782
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,600
Come!

783
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,700
Come on!

784
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,699
Over and under.

785
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,700
Shouldn't you have taught
me this as a child?

786
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,600
That is beautiful.

787
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,200
- You are so mean to me.
- He's telling the truth.

788
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,700
It's hideous.

789
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,700
This is never going to be...

790
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,500
Stay outside.
I walk into.

791
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,700
Gestapo!

792
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,700
I will do it.

793
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,700
Open.

794
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,700
Open!

795
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,700
- Irena Sendler?
- I am

796
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,600
Do you have Jews here?

797
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,800
Of course not.
It's against the law.

798
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
You will come with us.

799
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,700
Let me get a few things.

800
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,700
There is no need.

801
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,600
Irena Sendler.

802
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,600
Good afternoon.

803
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,600
I work for the city of Warsaw.
Department of Social Services.

804
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,700
I know. I know.

805
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,400
Your father was a doctor,
worked with Jews.

806
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,600
He worked with anyone who was sick.

807
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,500
Yes. Until the Jews gave him Typhus.

808
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,700
Who is Konrad Zegota?

809
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,700
Who?

810
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,600
Who is Konrad Zegota?

811
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,700
I don't know.

812
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,700
Who is Konrad Zegota?

813
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,700
I don't know!

814
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,000
You have been denounced by many people.

815
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,600
For example, the little shop
where you pick up your laundry.

816
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,700
On Bracka street, near
Three Crosses Square.

817
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,900
We know you are not so involved
with these criminals.

818
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,900
And if you tell us where to find
this man you will not be executed.

819
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,700
Sendler! Get up!

820
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,700
Sendler!
Dentist.

821
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,600
You're wasting your time and mine.

822
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,700
"Zegota will help you"

823
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,200
I'm ordered to place a dressing,
I place a dressing.

824
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,500
For what? She will be
dead in the morning.

825
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,600
I do what I'm told, that's all.

826
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,600
Stefania?

827
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,700
You're alive!

828
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,600
I swear, I told them nothing.

829
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:02,651
I was quiet as a mouse.
You know I would never betray you.

830
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,800
- As a good soldier.
- Yes.

831
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:06,098
A good soldier.

832
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,700
You have done very well.

833
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,700
Out!
Out!

834
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,700
Thank you for what you did.

835
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:35,000
- We did it together.
- No, I mean for me.

836
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Out!

837
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:03,699
Not you!

838
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,700
No! Wait!
What are you doing?

839
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,700
Aim!

840
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,600
Target!

841
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,600
Fire!

842
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,700
Get away from here.
Go!

843
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,699
Go!

844
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,800
But, I, I don't have
my identification card!

845
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:34,699
You are dead with them!

846
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,700
Go! Run away! Get out!

847
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,700
Irena!

848
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,700
Thank you.

849
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:24,200
They will find out.
And they will search for you.

850
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,600
I'll be safe.

851
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,600
Your mother is right.
In time you will need a specialist.

852
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,800
I know for you this difficult, but
please until end try to stay of them.

853
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,700
Hi Irenka.
What you have done,

854
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:00,547
is a good and decent thing.

855
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,700
So many I could not save.

856
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,700
Believe me, in this world...

857
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,000
to do a decent thing is not so bad.

858
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,700
It is time.

859
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,700
We must be in mountains before dark.

860
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,700
I love you.

861
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,700
Do not worry, I'll be fine.

862
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,700
Go.

863
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:18,600
- Irena...
- Trojan.

864
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,000
Thank you so much for all
you've done.

865
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,600
No. Thank you.

866
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,800
There's something
Konrad Zegota must have.

867
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,700
They are all here.

868
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,700
Every child.

869
01:30:38,271 --> 01:30:39,699
Where we hid them.

870
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:45,400
When all this is over, they must be returned
to whatever remains of their families.

871
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,700
I will do it, I promise.

872
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,700
Thank you.

873
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,000
From now on you are
Irena Dabrowska.

874
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:29,216
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

875
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,000
I am so fond of stories
that begin that way.

876
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,800
I have kielbasa and beer with onions.

877
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,700
- You like it?
- Yes, I do.

878
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,000
- First, you must come meet my pigs.
- Really Piotr, it's not necessary.

879
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,100
It is true, what they said about Jews
that they're terrible farmers.

880
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,700
Please, please put me down.

881
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,700
Oh, thank God.

882
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,700
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

883
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,300
Irena and Stephen were married in 1947.

884
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:04,200
Irena Sendler saved 2500 Jewish
children during the Holocaust.

885
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:08,000
In 2007, she was nominated
for the Nobel Peace

886
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,000
Not so long ago it was the Mother's Day.

887
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:17,600
So today I would like us to
celebrate that holiday

888
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,600
in the name of some of the most
anguished mothers in the world.

889
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:26,400
The Jewish mothers who
separated from their children

890
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,700
during those terrible times.

891
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:37,300
And let us reflect on
those polish women.

892
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:41,100
Who took the Jewish children in and
brought them up as their own.

893
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,000
Risking their lives, every day

894
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,700
and every hour in the process.

895
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,300
They loved those children
so much, that when war ended.

896
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,700
They could hardly bare to part of them.

897
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,800
So let us give thought to those mothers.

898
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,400
Irena died in Warsaw
in May 2008. She was 98.
