1
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,157
Shit.

2
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,331
I see.

3
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,167
Is that right?

4
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,544
Well, have you ever
seen "Starlight Express?"

5
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:07,050
<i>- Daddy, of course I have.
- Well, face it. It's no "West Side Story."</i>

6
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,511
You don't know what kind it was?

7
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,554
It was a mix.

8
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:14,265
There's English.
There's Rednose.

9
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,226
There's Staffordshire.
There's all kinds. There's American-

10
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,437
That's what she says:
"It was a longhaired pit bull."

11
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,897
- There's no such thing.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

12
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,232
- It's an obvious discrepancy.
- One of you guys gonna get that?

13
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:28,071
I'm not attacking him-
just working this out.

14
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:31,532
Carlucci. One second.

15
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,992
Feege, you gotta call on two

16
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:37,455
We okay here? Because this is just-
It's formality.

17
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:41,084
- I might have to do it all over.
- Lieutenant Gruman speaking.

18
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,043
"Lieutenant"?

19
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,135
How can you say that?
Rita Moreno was fabulous.

20
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:56,390
- At least she wasn't on roller-skates.
- "Makin' fun of me 'cause I like Xanadu?"

21
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,934
- What?
- Lucinda just called.

22
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,479
Let me call you back.

23
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,651
- You know Mona Dearly?
- What about her?

24
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,654
She was proceeding southbound
on Route 9...

25
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:14,783
when apparently her vehicle was involved
in a 2-11-07.

26
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:22,750
- What?
- She drove into the river.

27
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:28,005
She's dead, Wyatt.

28
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,222
So what happened to your hand?

29
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:21,684
This thing? It's nothing.
What are you gonna do?

30
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:25,645
- So what'd you say your name was again?
- Maria Lasala.

31
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,191
- That's a nice name.
- Thanks.

32
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,235
- So are you married or something?
- Maybe.

33
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,420
- She's 13, man.
- Yeah. Finally.

34
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,758
- I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9:00.
- For what?

35
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:58,720
- What do you mean, "For what?" For work
-9:00?

36
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,768
- That's early.
- But it's Carlsson's.

37
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:05,727
- So?
- It's Carlsson's Nursery.

38
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,397
I heard you the first time, Bobby.
I ain't mute.

39
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:11,067
I'm just saying, Carlsson's Nursery
is gonna make us a lot of money.

40
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,779
I mean,
it's gonna save the business.

41
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,072
I get half.

42
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,823
I know.

43
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,785
And none of that "50%" bullshit.

44
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,227
That's it!

45
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:06,290
What do you think? Should I do the
Yellow Apple Six report or Apple Seven?

46
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:12,002
- What's the difference?
- The Yellow Apple Six involves water.

47
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:15,214
Feege, the car
is submerged in water.

48
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,300
What do you think?

49
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:20,468
- Let's go with Yellow Apple Six.
- Yeah.

50
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,637
I think that's a good idea, Feege.

51
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,975
She's dead.

52
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:29,646
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

53
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,125
There he is. Here they come.

54
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:55,879
So...

55
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:59,384
you wanna tell Jeff about his mom,
or do you think we should do it, or-

56
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,177
Yeah.

57
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,344
That's-

58
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,681
We'd be more than happy
to do it, Phil.

59
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:10,103
It's just that coming from you,
it may cushion the blow.

60
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:12,647
Being that
he's your son and all.

61
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,650
Well, in that case,
it might be best if one of you did it.

62
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:20,905
Right.

63
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,367
- We could do that.
- Do you wanna? I could do it.

64
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,037
- Are you- I could do it.
- Who's gonna do it?

65
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:31,916
- Jimmy's gonna do it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll handle it.

66
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,084
I got it.

67
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:40,341
Hey, Jeff. I'm afraid I got
some bad news. How you doin', Bobby?

68
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:44,512
- Where's my car?
- It's more serious than your car, Jeff.

69
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,352
Would somebody mind tellin' me
what the hell's goin' on here?

70
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,938
It's- I'm afraid-

71
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:58,734
Your mother was in a car accident.
I'm afraid she's dead, Jeff. She's dead.

72
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,488
What was she doin' in my car?

73
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:31,391
Where you been? Oh, you gotta talk
to Mark we were goin' over the menu...

74
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,062
and I mentioned the boneless breast
of chicken, and he's, like, "Boneless"?

75
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,148
"You never said you wanted boneless."
Can you believe that?

76
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,650
I'm, like, "You don't serve
chicken bones at a wedding."

77
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,942
God forbid someone chokes to death.

78
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:43,320
It'll cost an extra five bucks a plate,
and at a hundred plates we're lookin'...

79
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,990
at half a grand, $500,
just to get rid of the bones.

80
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:47,492
Like we got that.

81
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,829
What's wrong?

82
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:54,290
Mona Dearly's dead.

83
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:58,294
What? You're kiddin' me.

84
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:01,005
No. I mean, yeah. I mean, no.

85
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,341
No, she's dead.

86
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:06,468
My God. What happened?

87
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:11,975
It was just a car accident
on the road, I guess.

88
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:17,438
Well, we gotta celebrate.

89
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:21,318
What? God, Ellie. Jesus.

90
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:25,362
She's a human being.
"We gotta celebrate." Have some respect.

91
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:27,615
I don't gotta have respect
for no one in that family.

92
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:30,285
Bobby, think about
how they've treated you.

93
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:33,622
- How they'd treat me?
- Badly. They're horrible people.

94
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,707
They're a houseful of freaks.

95
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,877
Hey, Philibuster,
check out how fast I'm doin' this.

96
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,882
- Cut it out, would you?
- No, I'm on a roll. Look at it.

97
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,511
Cut it out, you little shit,
or I'll kill ya!

98
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,139
All right.

99
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,891
Geez.

100
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,977
Now, about the name
of this business.

101
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,646
You given any thought
to it yet?

102
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,901
Well, I thought
we should call it "B.J. Landscapin'."

103
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:12,744
"B.J."?

104
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,583
- I don't get it.
- You know.

105
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,083
"B" for Bobby and "J" for Jeff.
"B.J. Landscapin'."

106
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,921
Well, I think "J.B."
has a nicer ring to it.

107
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:29,886
Besides, you don't want anyone calling
you "Blow Job Landscaping," do you?

108
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:36,392
Well, then, what if
we call it "J.P.'s," right? That's good.

109
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,312
- "J.P.'s" ain't an option, Jeff.
- How come, smarty two-shoes?

110
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:42,023
'Cause his name
don't start with "P."

111
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,278
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus.

112
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,614
- What's that, Mr. Dearly?
- You say something, Phil?

113
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:55,243
- You gonna contribute or what?
- Yeah, what do you think?

114
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,457
I think that it's-

115
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,628
Whatever you two decide is-

116
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,423
All right. Thanks, Mr. Dearly.

117
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:09,467
For what?
He didn't say jack!

118
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,761
- Why you kissin' his ass?
- I wasn't kissin' his ass.

119
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:16,100
I thought you were done kissin' ass.
He was totally kissin' ass.

120
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:19,268
- Kiss-ass!
- Look at the little kiss-ass!

121
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,938
- You disgust me, you little kiss-ass.
- Little kiss-ass.

122
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,648
Get out of my sight.

123
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:33,782
She deserved it. I bet property values
go up. So, you gonna fire Jeff?

124
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:36,744
What? No. Why would
I want to fire Jeff?

125
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,830
'Cause you been wantin' to
for years.

126
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:42,251
No, I haven't. I stopped wanting
to fire him a long time ago.

127
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,962
Well, what about him
killin' the Schneider dog?

128
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,633
He didn't kill the Schneider dog. That
was an accident when he killed the dog.

129
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:53,178
Bobby, he ran over it
with a lawn mower.

130
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,512
Yeah.

131
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:01,436
I don't want to talk about it right now.
The guy's mother just drove off a cliff.

132
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,983
Yeah. Too bad Jeff
wasn't ridin' shotgun.

133
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,990
That would've been funny.

134
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:17,826
<i>Ever so gracefully...</i>

135
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:20,705
the yellow Hugo-
sort of floating-

136
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,044
It was almost slow motion-like.

137
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,294
And it did a swan dive
right into the river.

138
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:29,546
- A swan dive, huh?
- It was tragic and frightening...

139
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:32,592
yet beautiful
in an obtuse way.

140
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,473
- What'd he say?
- Clarence?

141
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:40,725
He said she drove into the river.

142
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,314
You know, Feege,
I was looking around up top...

143
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:47,816
and there was something
very odd about this.

144
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,234
- What's that?
- There are no skid marks.

145
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:52,903
She never hit the brakes.

146
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:56,741
We should do some checking to see if she
suffered from any medical conditions...

147
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:59,245
like narcolepsy or something.

148
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:01,496
Could've been "Barstein" syndrome.

149
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,082
Yeah.

150
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,011
Rash, she was a lousy driver.
It probably caught up with her.

151
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:12,674
- You knew her pretty well, didn't you?
- Our paths crossed time to time.

152
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:16,052
Juliet, Echo, Papa, Hotel.

153
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:20,557
You had that little thing with her
a while back? A bit of an altercation?

154
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:27,481
Let me see your hands!

155
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:30,567
- Why'd you pull us over, Feege?
- Let me think about that for a second.

156
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:35,488
You're riding on rims. And B: Just
went 2,800 on an officer of the law.

157
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,242
And C: What the hell's
the matter with you, Jeff? Oh, boy!

158
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:41,453
Look what you did!

159
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,578
- I didn't do nothin'!
- You scared him half to death!

160
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:45,081
- He's drunk!
- No, he ain't!

161
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:48,459
Get out of here, ya jerk!

162
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:51,714
That's okay, baby.
Everything's okay. Mommy's here now.

163
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,423
Yes. Okay, baby.

164
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,592
You're gonna pay for this, Feege.

165
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,470
You just lost a lawn service, pal!

166
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:05,059
It's a real shame, though. Him and Bobby
did a fabulous job on my place.

167
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:08,896
So what do you think, Lucinda?

168
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,109
What do I think? I think she took a turn
for the worse and broke her stupid neck.

169
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,113
A fitting end
toa less than laudable life.

170
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:17,112
I'm talkin' about the car.

171
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:20,326
- I'll have her fixed in no time.
- Lucinda.

172
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,330
Look, dude,
if somebody rigged it, you'll know.

173
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:27,831
- I'm countin' on you, all right?
- All right. It'll cost you.

174
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,627
- You gonna charge him double?
- You know it.

175
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,897
- She's dead.
- I know.

176
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,816
I can't believe this.

177
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,156
I mean, it's just-
Man, I mean-

178
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,745
This is it, right, Rone?
I mean, this is it. I'm-

179
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:32,415
- I don't like it, Phil, one bit.
- What's the matter?

180
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,960
I have to ask you something,
and I want you to be honest.

181
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,462
Sure.

182
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,256
- What?
- Did you do it?

183
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,884
- Did I do what?
- Did you kill her?

184
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,514
- How could you ask me that?
- It looks suspicious, Phil.

185
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,140
It was an accident.
It was a stroke of good luck.

186
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:51,977
Good luck doesn't happen to people
like us. Good luck happens to Madonna.

187
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:57,275
Tony and Jimmy said it could've
been slippery on the road or something.

188
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,275
- I don't know.
- Sure.

189
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:03,404
Couple of months, they're gonna find me
floatin' at the bottom of the Hudson.

190
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,951
Don't talk like that, baby.
Don't talk like that.

191
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,993
'Cause if you're down there,
I'm down there.

192
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:13,499
I'll go down with the catfish.

193
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,291
I'll go swim in the murk

194
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,335
- Phil?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:20,463
- Are you okay?
- I'll live.

196
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,266
No bacteria. Honest.

197
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,105
I am a priest. A priest.
You can't cut me off.

198
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:41,026
Padre, stow it. You're breakin'
my concentration, for cryin' out loud.

199
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:44,654
Threats not with standing, cut the sermon
and give me goddamn beer!

200
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,491
What? You want me to squirt you in front
of God and everybody here? I'll do it.

201
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:51,663
Murph, what's all this
about the chicken?

202
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:55,873
The chickens? We got bigger fish to fry.
Get your ass over there. Come on.

203
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,341
- Tell me you didn't do it, Bobby.
- Do what?

204
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,683
What do you mean?

205
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,891
Come on. They were
killing your business, Bobby.

206
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:17,145
That whole family
was ruining your life.

207
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:19,272
No, they weren't.
They weren't ruining anything.

208
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,650
I didn't do it. Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?

209
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,611
I'm just sayin' there's a lot of people
that wouldn't blame you if you did.

210
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,196
- Come on, Murph. Jesus Christ.
- All right.

211
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,491
I'm just doin' the big brother thing,
you know?

212
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,494
I'm just- I'll back off.

213
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:38,499
Guess who got
in an altercation last night.

214
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,919
- Who?
- Valerie Antonelli.

215
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,506
- Big talk! Big talk from the big man!
- You talkin' to me?

216
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,383
Where's Bobby Calzone
when you need him?

217
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,302
What are you gonna do, hit me?

218
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:58,561
Come on, Murph. She's a girl. You don't
let her get slapped around like that.

219
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:01,731
- What's the matter with you?
- She wanted to be a landscaper.

220
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,569
Sue me.

221
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:11,783
All right. Listen, Murph,
what's up with the whole chicken thing?

222
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:15,621
- You gonna help us out?
- Look, if you want somebody to sit...

223
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,248
and yank the bones out of a hundred
chickens, it's gonna run you money.

224
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,751
You know, you're the best man
at the wedding, Murph.

225
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:24,295
I'm not making any money
on this weddin' as it is.

226
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:29,635
You're my brother. Can't you do
a brotherly deboning or something?

227
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:31,511
Okay.

228
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:35,807
How long is this gonna goon?
I'm frontin' ya for your business.

229
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:40,937
I'm helping with you weddin'. Last year
I declared you a dependent on my taxes.

230
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,943
I'm havin' a hard time at work,
and I'm a little short handed with Jeff.

231
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,288
Well, maybe due
to the untimely demise of Mona Dearly...

232
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:54,575
you can finally get rid of that
one-armed bandit partner of yours.

233
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:06,504
Bobby, come on.
I can't let you carry me like this.

234
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:11,427
Wait a second.
I have to close the door.

235
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,553
I'm not ready.

236
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:15,513
You're no fun at all.

237
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:18,391
<i>You have one new message.</i>

238
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,602
<i>Hi, honey...
It's your old dad callin'.</i>

239
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:24,106
<i>Just wanted to see how plans
for the big day are shapin' up.</i>

240
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:28,026
<i>I thought we could hop over
to the diner for some breakfast.</i>

241
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,945
<i>Tomorrow's no good,
but maybe Saturday... Okay.?</i>

242
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,407
<i>Say. "hey" to Bobby...
Be good,</i>

243
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,952
- What do you think he wants?
- I don't know.

244
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:41,957
Sounded pretty cryptic.
Something about breakfast, Saturday.

245
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,001
Hard to say.

246
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,385
What's wrong?

247
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,347
Nothin'.

248
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:11,444
<i>Up a lazy river
with a robin's song</i>

249
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:14,031
<i>Awaits the bright new morning</i>

250
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:17,076
<i>We can loaf along</i>

251
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,629
I just thought I'd stop by
and pay my respects.

252
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:32,048
- Your dad's not home, is he?
- No.

253
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:39,182
I know this is trying times
for the two of you.

254
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:43,434
- You want a beer or something?
- No, thanks.

255
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:46,563
You don't happen to know where he went?

256
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:53,111
Did your mother suffer from any
medical conditions you might know of?

257
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,115
I think she had
a personality disorder.

258
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:01,911
No, not necessarily
like that. It's-

259
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,456
It's just there are some aspects
to this accident that-

260
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,252
You think someone killed her?

261
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:13,380
- Well, I didn't do it.
- I never said you did.

262
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:17,136
But if you were to know if somebody
had a grudge against her...

263
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,430
or something like that,
you know.

264
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:23,724
Yeah. I don't wanna point any fingers
and what not, but Bobby Calzone did it.

265
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:31,066
I find that hard to believe.
He doesn't have a violent bone in his body.

266
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,110
Why don't you see how Peaches
feels about that?

267
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:36,779
Peaches? The Schneider dog?

268
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,324
Yeah. With the lawn mower.

269
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:42,161
- Great job with Peaches, there, Bobby.
- Drop dead, asshole.

270
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:44,581
"But, Bobby, that poor little dog."

271
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,581
"Poor little dog."
It was in the way.

272
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:49,125
You were the one chasin' after it
with the lawn mower, not me.

273
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,961
It wasn't my fault.

274
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:54,006
- It got in the way.
- Now we lost that account.

275
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:56,341
Blame me. Blame me
like you blame me for everything else.

276
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,259
- I don't care.
- You killed Peaches.

277
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:02,555
- I would've fired us for that.
- Like you never killed a dog?

278
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,434
If you keep losin' our accounts,
pretty soon we'll be out of business.

279
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:08,060
- Then how you gonna take care of Ellen?
- "Take care of Ellen."

280
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,813
- Ellen freakin' schmellen.
- Honey, I hate to see you guys-

281
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:13,150
What are you saying?
I can't hear you, Mrs. Dearly.

282
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,694
- What?
- You're hurting me!

283
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:19,697
Shut up! One step closer, Jeff, and
I swear I'll tear out your ovaries!

284
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:24,243
- Don't you talk to my boy like that.
- Your boy has the IQ of a garden pest!

285
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,288
And so do you,
you dumb wench!

286
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:29,040
- Bobby, I don't think-
- What? You don't think?

287
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,958
That's your problem!
You don't think!

288
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,879
You don't think!
I've had it!

289
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:37,007
I can't take it anymore!
Especially you, Mona Dearly!

290
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,009
What's that supposed to mean?

291
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,551
You know what it means!
You know what it means!

292
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:50,645
He said "ovaries"?

293
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:54,357
- Yeah, all the time.
- And he threatened your mom's life?

294
00:24:56,234 --> 00:25:00,197
- Why didn't you report this?
- 'Cause everyone threatened her life.

295
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,409
"Ovaries."

296
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:15,671
<i>She took a turn for the worse</i>

297
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:18,883
<i>You know she swam with the fishes</i>

298
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:22,511
<i>You know she dug in the dirt</i>

299
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:30,561
<i>Why did she have to die, die</i>

300
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:44,033
Catchy.

301
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,032
That was nice.

302
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,077
Thanks.
How's that daughter of yours?

303
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,496
- She's great. Thanks for asking.
- Yeah? Wedding plans going smooth?

304
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:54,210
- Like silk on glass.
- I want you to take a look under here.

305
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:56,419
If somebody were
to sabotage the brakes-

306
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,922
- "If"?
- "If." It's a conditional clause.

307
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:00,340
"If."

308
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:04,511
If somebody were to sabotage the brakes,
he's got two options.

309
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:08,598
He can be smart and puncture a hole
in the brake fluid tank...

310
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:13,145
or he can be a total freak
and cut all four of the brake lines.

311
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:16,398
I'll show you.
These here are the brake lines.

312
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:19,233
- They've all been cut.
- Total freak.

313
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:22,112
- That rules out accident-
- Slow down, pal.

314
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:24,406
We're just gettin' started here.

315
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,909
All right. Now...

316
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,412
know what this is?

317
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:32,830
- I don't know shit about cars.
- That's the brake fluid tank.

318
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:36,419
- What's that hole?
- It's a hole.

319
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,920
So I figure the perp...

320
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,963
used some kind of sharp instrument-

321
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:43,508
a screwdriver, an awl,
what have you-

322
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:46,179
took it, drove it through the tank
with a hammer.

323
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:48,972
Just, bam, bam! See this?

324
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:51,307
This here?
Fetzervalve.

325
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:55,187
- I'm not familiar with the fetzer.
- Nor should you be. Serves no purpose.

326
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:59,193
- So what's the problem?
- Somebody poked a hole in that too.

327
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:01,985
- Is that bad?
- This car was done to death.

328
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,153
- "Done to death"?
- Fixed to kill.

329
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,699
"Fixed to kill."

330
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:08,701
This was no accident.

331
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,584
"Sorry to bother you.

332
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,964
I just wanted to express my sorrow
over the loss of your tragic-"

333
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:24,465
"Hi, Jeff and Phil.
I'm really sorry to bother you."

334
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:28,220
"Hi. Sorry to bother you.

335
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:32,349
Listen, I just wanted to
express my sorrow over the loss of-"

336
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,643
Mr. Dearly.

337
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:41,359
I just wanted to express my sorrow
over the loss of your tragic loved one.

338
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,901
My loved one?

339
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,240
- Your wife passed.
- Yeah? Who'd she pass?

340
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:50,034
What do you want?

341
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:53,788
Bobby came by to express his loss
over our sorry loved one.

342
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,831
- Yeah, I ain't workin' today.
- No, you shouldn't work

343
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:59,835
You're definitely
on a grievance leave...

344
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,838
and I'm just coming by
to say that I'm really sorry.

345
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:04,840
That's great,
if that's what you wanna tell yourself.

346
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:07,383
If you ask me,
he sounds real broken up about it.

347
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,554
- I mean, look at him.
- Yeah, no kiddin'.

348
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,764
- All right. So-
- Listen, Bobby.

349
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:15,184
If you're tormented by this, you should
come by Cubby's Funeral Home tonight...

350
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,725
and have a full release.

351
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,562
Yeah. We're havin' one of them
"wake and bake" services.

352
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:21,732
Yeah. Sure.
I'll come by Cubby's.

353
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,567
You do that, you little kiss-ass.

354
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,070
Yeah. Make sure
you wear them kiss-ass shoes too.

355
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:28,738
And that landscapin'
kiss-ass T-shirt.

356
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,408
"I'll mow your lawn, I'll trim
your hedges and I'll kiss your ass!"

357
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:34,787
- There he goes. Look at that.
- Yeah.

358
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,082
Little hesitation before the kiss.
Careful. Don't kiss the dog's ass.

359
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:47,634
All he talks about
is how much the wedding's gonna cost...

360
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,384
and how Jeff's ruining J.B.'s.

361
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,636
I'm worried about him, Dad.
It's like he's obsessed.

362
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:54,932
Well, I'll talk to him,
see if I can help.

363
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:57,769
No. That's all right.
You've already done enough.

364
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:01,437
You know, this is gonna sound terrible,
but with Mrs. Dearly dyin'...

365
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,440
this is the first break
he's caught in a while.

366
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,444
Okay, folks.

367
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:13,157
Shame about Mona Dearly, huh?
I mean, so young. Tragic.

368
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:17,247
- It's taken everybody by surprise.
- Yeah. Poor family.

369
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,333
- So, what can I get ya?
- I'll have the usual and a cup of joe.

370
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:23,960
And you, hon? You want the heart attack
special, just like your daddy?

371
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:25,963
The vegetarian plate.

372
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:28,424
Back in a jiff.

373
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:33,470
A box of friggin' meat for my wedding.
Like I'm registered at a deli.

374
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:36,141
What do you think about "Ice Castles"
for a spotlight dance?

375
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:40,103
- You can't go wrong with "Ice Castles."
- That's what I was thinking.

376
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,358
It looks like there's going
to bean investigation into this thing.

377
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:51,280
I have to tell you that this wedding
of yours is all anybody's talking about.

378
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:56,159
And the fact you two even considered
having me there- Well, forget about it.

379
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,829
Yeah, well, me and Bobby
really want you there, Rone.

380
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:03,210
Well, I just want you to know
it moved me, down deep.

381
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:06,045
- Really. It moved me.
- Good.

382
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,673
Enjoy your meal.

383
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,553
- So where was I?
- You said you were gonna investigate.

384
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,057
Right.

385
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:20,642
- What I was thinkin' was-
- "Goddamn it."

386
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,854
Don't give me that shit, Phil.

387
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:26,522
I am not overreacting. He was there.
He was talkin' to Ellen.

388
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:29,902
- Come on, sweet nipple.
- "Don't "sweet nipple" me, Phil."

389
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:32,905
But we got nothing to do with it, honey.
I'm dumpin' her stuff right now.

390
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:34,741
What does that
have to do with anything?

391
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:36,660
Do you know why our prisons
are so overcrowded?

392
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:40,036
- I don't know. Too many criminals?
- "Wrongful imprisonment, Phil."

393
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,917
<i>Erroneous convictions Eleven percent
of all inmates currently serving time...</i>

394
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:48,252
are counterfactually incarcerated
for crimes uncommitted.

395
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:50,880
<i>Did you ever see Tom Selleck
in An Innocent Man?</i>

396
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:53,217
- Yeah. Was that with Kurt Russell?
- Phil, look.

397
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:55,177
Rash is askin' a lot of questions
about all of you...

398
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,262
and I don't like one bit what
he's insinuating, not one bit.

399
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:59,055
Relax, Vanna.

400
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:02,936
He's just doin' his-
Oh, shit.

401
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,145
- Rash is here.
- What?

402
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,815
<i>I gotta go.</i>

403
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:16,032
- Hey, Chief.
- Hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.

404
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:18,367
I was just gettin' ready
for Mona's wake. How you doin'?

405
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:21,453
I'm fine.

406
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,705
That's a really nice picture
of the two of you.

407
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:31,005
I can't tell you
how sorry I am about Mona.

408
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:35,552
She was a passionate
and committed woman.

409
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:41,098
This is probably
the exact wrong time to ask you-

410
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:47,312
Whatever I can do to help.
I mean, you know me. I'm a team player.

411
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:50,399
I need to ask you a couple of questions
about your wife.

412
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:53,276
Yeah? What about her?

413
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:58,073
Phil, sweetie,
you got a minute for me?

414
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,330
Honey, they're lookin'
for the shooter.

415
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:06,122
Get in here, Phil.

416
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,124
You should've seen this guy,
taking potshots in his skivvies.

417
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,835
He looked like Father Tom.

418
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:16,341
- Yes, dear?
- Where were you this afternoon?

419
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:19,845
- But-
- Where the hell were ya?

420
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:22,306
I called the warehouse.
You were MIA.

421
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:24,143
You sure you had the right number?

422
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,352
- Oh, boy.
- Who is she, Phil?

423
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,854
- Who's who?
- What's her name?

424
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:33,692
Sweetness. Oh, Jesus, honey,
you could hurt somebody with that.

425
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:36,694
I don't wanna hurt someone, Phil.
I wanna hurt you!

426
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:39,865
- What's gotten into you?
- You.

427
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:42,868
- You don't find me attractive no more?
- Of course I don't-do.

428
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:47,039
You got something goin' on,
don't you, Phil? Don't you?

429
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:49,457
You've been playing Wheel of Fortune
with someone else.

430
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,799
<i>Don't tell anyone, but...</i>

431
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:01,053
I was a battered husband.

432
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:06,393
Phil, that was the Wednesday night
prior to the accident?

433
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:08,560
That's right.

434
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,313
And at no point during the evening
did you leave the house?

435
00:33:11,397 --> 00:33:14,525
No, I was watching TV
the entire evening.

436
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,986
What about Jeff?

437
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,737
Well, him and Mona
had a fight earlier that night.

438
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:24,076
- Do you recall what was said?
- Yeah.

439
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,080
He said she was an embarrassment
to the family and then took off.

440
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:33,209
The kid was lit up like a Christmas tree. I've never seen him so drunk.

441
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,364
Yeah. Yes.

442
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,333
I was talkin' to Ellen earlier.

443
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:15,878
She told me
you were worried about finances.

444
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,593
And I just-You know, you and I
are practically family now...

445
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:27,890
and, you know, you shouldn't
have to bear that burden alone.

446
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:32,228
If ever you wanna talk
or get something off your chest-

447
00:34:32,311 --> 00:34:33,979
I appreciate that.

448
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:37,690
Just imagine that you're Annie
and I'm Daddy Warbucks.

449
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:39,443
- Daddy Warbucks.
- Yeah.

450
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:43,990
Or I'm Auntie Mame,
and you're little Patrick.

451
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:45,492
Yeah?

452
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:52,164
Well, tell me something, Bob.

453
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,293
What did you think
about Mona Dearly?

454
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:06,012
<i>She was the worst person
I ever knew in my entire life.</i>

455
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,305
How you doing?

456
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:11,976
- I just came to give Jeff his pay.
- How come you're all dolled up?

457
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,353
- I'm taking Ellie to dinner theater.
- Come on.

458
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,313
- What you gonna see?
- "Oh, Calcutta."

459
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:18,898
Get over here. Give me my money.

460
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,819
Look at this guy.

461
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,156
What is this? You trying to tell me
it's what I've been bustin' my anus for?

462
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,701
For287.50?

463
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:31,452
- It's always 287.50.
- He's tryin' to rip me off.

464
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:34,456
- You holdin' out on us, Calzone?
- Where's the rest of it, you dick?

465
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,501
- Looks to me like he's wearin' it.
- Yeah.

466
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:37,876
Nice shoes.

467
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,880
- This is a joke, right?
- No, you're a joke.

468
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,674
- You guys are kidding, right?
- Kidding?

469
00:35:43,757 --> 00:35:45,718
You feel like laughing?
Laugh at this.

470
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:52,641
- Kick his ass, Mom, yeah! Get in there.
- You're payin' for that headlight!

471
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:55,936
- What are you doing? Get out of there.
- Take it out of Jeffrey's pay!

472
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,521
Yeah.

473
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,733
Get out of there.
What are you doin'?

474
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:03,318
- Let go!
- God! I mean, enough's enough.

475
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:07,364
All I wanted was a nice, professional
business so Ellie and I could have-

476
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what this is?

477
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:12,537
This is the world's
smallest tambourine.

478
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:16,832
- And it's playin' some song.
- Shut up!That's a violin.

479
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:19,002
Give me that thing.
Give me that.

480
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:22,380
I think it's time we start talkin'
about dissolvin' the business.

481
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:25,089
- Nothing personal. It's business.
- No way.

482
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:27,259
- Don't even think about it, scumbag.
- Yeah.

483
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:29,094
As I see it, you got two options:

484
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:34,391
- Buy us out or pray for an early death.
- Yeah, get out of here, you mooch.

485
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,727
Go enjoy your dinner theater.

486
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,149
But, you know,
she probably had her good points too.

487
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,152
Well, most people
have two sides.

488
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:50,532
Yeah, well,
she just showed me the one.

489
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,585
- That Jeff Dearly, man.
- What about him?

490
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,921
You gotta hand it to him.

491
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:07,590
Jeff, what's your handle?

492
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:11,804
- Jeff, hands up.
- What's your handle?

493
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,308
Speaking of which,
guess what I heard.

494
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:32,157
- That's not a logging accident.
- What's the difference?

495
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:35,662
Why? What'd you hear?

496
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:52,970
What about that fishing accident?

497
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,821
- Are you serious?
- See?

498
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:11,281
Wow.

499
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:18,997
"It's a terrible loss."

500
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,083
"It's a terrible loss."

501
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:26,170
<i>What a void in my life.</i>

502
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:28,965
All right.

503
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,809
"Father Tom,
it has been difficult."

504
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,937
"Father Tom,
it has been difficult."

505
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:47,316
"It's been really hard."

506
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,154
Jeff, come on.
We don't wanna miss this.

507
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,365
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Right.

508
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,573
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

509
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:43,372
- What did your dad wanna see you about?
- Nothing.

510
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:45,793
He just asked me some questions
about Mrs. Dearly.

511
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,628
What about her?
What kind of questions?

512
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:51,587
- About the accident.
- What does he think?

513
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,257
He doesn't think anything.

514
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,306
Really? I mean, you'd tell me, right,
if he said something?

515
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:01,223
For chris sakes, Bobby!

516
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,689
All right. I'm sorry.
I don't-

517
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:10,401
I don't care.
I don't know why I'm asking.

518
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:13,776
With Jeff not at work,
I'm shorthanded. I-

519
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:17,282
I'm just really tired.

520
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:22,994
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Forget about it.

521
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:30,502
Do you imagine the Dearlys
were like us when they were our age?

522
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,841
No. She was always fat.

523
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:57,613
What time is it?

524
00:41:01,117 --> 00:41:04,704
- 8:30.
- Jesus. I'm dyin' over here.

525
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:07,706
Keep in mind
we're remembering a lifetime.

526
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,043
Yeah. All right.
Ten more minutes, then.

527
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,678
To hell with it.
Let's go.

528
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:24,641
Hey, Cubby.

529
00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:32,148
Me and Jeff don't think there's
much point hangin' out, you know.

530
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:36,152
In my experience...

531
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:39,154
wakes aren't very well attended.

532
00:41:39,238 --> 00:41:43,910
I've found that often times
the tragedys so recent...

533
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:48,539
that loved ones are, in effect, paralyzed...

534
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:49,915
by their grief.

535
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,086
Listen.
Who are we kiddin', huh?

536
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:55,839
No one's gonna come,
not with the game on.

537
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:59,260
Oh, shit.
I got money on that game.

538
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:01,301
Yeah. You and everyone's mother.

539
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:11,687
- I thought you were comin' by.
- Yeah.

540
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,564
You know, yeah.

541
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:19,112
You know,
I can't say your mom was good people-

542
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,405
- Are those pies fresh?
- No.

543
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,118
- Shame about Mona.
- Yeah, well, you snooze, you lose.

544
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:28,747
Hey, guys. How you doin'?
All right?

545
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:33,208
- Can we sit down already?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take that booth.

546
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:35,878
Thanks, babe.

547
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,592
What?

548
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:54,938
- Good evening, friends.
- Jesus, Cubby!

549
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:56,982
You've got-

550
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,446
You've got nice pictures in here.

551
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:04,074
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

552
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:06,909
- Where is everyone?
- Jeff and Phil are at the Palace...

553
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:10,747
getting some grub, but if you care
to look at the deceased-

554
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,248
Sure.

555
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,045
- Wow.
- Yeah.

556
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:22,759
- She looks so peaceful.
- In death, one finds serenity.

557
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,844
I guess.

558
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:51,203
Beautiful.

559
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,291
Dynamite stuff.
That's fantastic.

560
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:08,222
- Some turnout.
- Yeah.

561
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,890
So who showed up?

562
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,856
Bobby and Ellen
stopped by about an hour ago.

563
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:21,399
Otherwise,
it's just been me and my dinner date.

564
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:27,198
Tell me something, Cubby.
You notice anything odd lately?

565
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:30,578
Other than the fact that no one
seems to care about this woman's death?

566
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,037
- Along those lines.
- Hell, Wyatt...

567
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,707
I've seen people more upset
over losing change in a candy machine.

568
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:41,714
Who says you can't catch nothin'
in the river?

569
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:50,889
Feege is right.
We should show a little respect.

570
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,599
Jeff, why don't you say a word?

571
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:59,606
- Jeff, why don't you say a word?
- About what?

572
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:01,816
About your mother.

573
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:07,907
To Mom. Yeah, she was kind of mean,
but she was still my mom.

574
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:10,075
Someone had to be.

575
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:08,050
<i>All right, everybody...
Let's hear a nice round of applause...</i>

576
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:11,760
for our final contestant,
Mona Dearly.

577
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:19,852
All right. Nice grouping.

578
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:22,147
Everybody,
give her another round of applause.

579
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:26,234
Now we await the judges' decision.

580
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:32,823
The judges are deciding
who will win the coveted Golden Angel.

581
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:45,002
The winner of Verplanck's
knife-throwing contest is...

582
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:48,758
Bobby Calzone!

583
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,509
Oh, my God!
I never win anything.

584
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:53,636
Just a goddamn minute!

585
00:46:57,056 --> 00:46:59,517
- You didn't vote for me.
- Well, sorta.

586
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,311
"Sorta"?
They all say "Bobby."

587
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:03,687
- Really?
- Phil, you're my husband.

588
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:07,193
- You're supposed to support me.
- Yeah, but Bobby had really good form.

589
00:47:07,275 --> 00:47:09,862
- Thanks, Mr. Dearly.
- You're welcome, Bob.

590
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:12,574
- We're just having a little fun here.
- Fun?

591
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:16,033
I lost, Wyatt. I'm a loser.
Does that sound like fun to you?

592
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,661
- Mona, I'm sorry that you lost, but-
- Yeah.

593
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:21,373
It's just a lousy little contest.
I know.

594
00:47:21,456 --> 00:47:23,709
- Everybody can't be a winner, Mona.
- But I've never been a winner.

595
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,960
- I've never had my chance.
- You're blowin' this out of proportion.

596
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,881
- It's just a knife-throwing contest.
- To you, maybe.

597
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,384
But not to me.
I really wanted this-

598
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,511
just for one day,
one day, to be a winner.

599
00:47:34,595 --> 00:47:38,806
To have everybody look at me and say,
"Yo, way to go, Mona."

600
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,142
Would it have killed you
to let me take home that prize, huh?

601
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:45,398
Just for one day,
to let me feel good about myself?

602
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,692
I don't know what to say.

603
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:53,571
You can have the trophy.
I'm gonna have a second chance.

604
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:57,199
Why don't you take that trophy
and shove it up your ass, Calzone?

605
00:47:57,282 --> 00:48:00,203
Mona, Bobby's just trying to help.

606
00:48:00,286 --> 00:48:02,538
- I don't need his sympathy.
- Know what my mother used to say?

607
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:05,250
"Life gives you potatoes;
make potato salad."

608
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,878
Well, life handed me a pile of shit.
What am I supposed to make out of that?

609
00:48:09,962 --> 00:48:11,422
Shit salad?

610
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:17,471
Just shut up.

611
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:19,722
The whole pack of youse
just shut up!

612
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:07,145
Come here.

613
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:09,190
Look. I've been thinkin'.

614
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:11,651
Oh, no. Don't.

615
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:13,275
Listen to me.

616
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,198
Jeff Dearly's key chain
is on a rack in his kitchen.

617
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,241
- Great. Wonderful.
- But where's it supposed to be?

618
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,454
- I have no idea. Why don't you tell me?
- Hanging from the ignition...

619
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:25,579
of the victim's car.

620
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:28,000
- What about Mona's keys?
- That's what I'm sayin'.

621
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:31,086
Mona's keys were on Jeff's keyring
in the kitchen.

622
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:34,006
Jeff's keys were on Mona's key chain
in the car.

623
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:35,881
So somebody switched their keys?

624
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:40,303
- Definitely.
- No, I don't think so.

625
00:49:40,387 --> 00:49:42,389
Oh, you don't think so?

626
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,102
As far as I'm concerned, "Ding-dong,
the witch is dead." End of story.

627
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:05,914
One less ain't gonna kill her.

628
00:50:09,749 --> 00:50:12,584
It's kinda weird, you know,
seein' the tombstone and all.

629
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:17,675
"Devoted wife, mother and dressmaker."

630
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,843
I didn't know your mom
was a dressmaker.

631
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,886
Me neither.

632
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:45,952
Guess what. They're callin'
Mona's accident a "case"...

633
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:49,998
which means they don't think she died
because of some slippery road.

634
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:53,626
- So?
- So that means there's an investigation.

635
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:57,424
It means they have leads.
Phil, I watch A&E.

636
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,967
I understand
the way a cop's mind works.

637
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:02,845
You see, they see you
standin' here touchin' me...

638
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:06,014
and the next thing you know, there's
the background check and the profile...

639
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,599
and the psychological workup.

640
00:51:08,516 --> 00:51:12,103
- I just came for lunch.
- Phil, these are smart guys.

641
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:14,605
These are really, really smart guys.
They have tools.

642
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:17,484
- Tools?
- Yeah. Of the trade?

643
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:20,071
So what are you tryin' to say?

644
00:51:20,154 --> 00:51:23,322
Just stop bein' so damn conspicuous,
would you, please?

645
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:25,075
Okay.

646
00:51:25,158 --> 00:51:27,077
Good. I'll see you later
at the Charm.

647
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:29,120
- Yeah.
- Stop it!

648
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,151
- What's up?
- Light beer, please.

649
00:52:22,424 --> 00:52:25,594
So Chief Rash
has been snoopin' around a bit.

650
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:27,805
What do you think
he's lookin' for?

651
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:31,348
Hard to say, Phil.
What do you think?

652
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:34,478
- Been gettin' much sleep lately, Bob?
- Yep.

653
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,398
Any nightmares or bad dreams?

654
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,569
Listen. There's
a lot of talk goin' on...

655
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,696
you know,
the kind where things get said...

656
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,241
fingers get pointed,
landscapers get incarcerated.

657
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:51,493
- Hold on a minute.
- I want to say something to you.

658
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,958
You did the greatest favor
anybody's ever done for me.

659
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,962
I just came by to say thank you.

660
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:04,423
Thank you, Bob.
Would you like a beer? I'll have one.

661
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:07,386
Can I have a beer, please?

662
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:08,887
Cheers.

663
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:27,906
"Fingers get pointed."

664
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:29,991
"Fingers get pointed."

665
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:35,788
"Landscapers get incarcerated."
Landscapers.

666
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:59,103
<i>Always a little kiss-ass.
Look at the little kiss-ass.</i>

667
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:03,567
- Get outta my sight.
- Kiss-ass.

668
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:06,569
- Pray for an early death!
- Don't.

669
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,488
Laugh at this!

670
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:10,740
<i>Bobby, he ran over it
with the lawnmower...</i>

671
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,080
Jeff, don't do that!
Don't! Peaches!

672
00:54:17,663 --> 00:54:18,957
Man!

673
00:54:20,668 --> 00:54:22,795
- What's the matter with you?
- What are you doin' here?

674
00:54:23,921 --> 00:54:27,548
Listen. I was tryin'
to tell you somethin' last night, and-

675
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,550
What? Wait.

676
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:33,471
It's a mistake.
I mean, she wasn't supposed to die.

677
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:36,183
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what happened to me.

678
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:39,810
They were driving me crazy. Every
single day, they were haranguing me.

679
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,646
- What are you saying?
- I snapped.

680
00:54:41,688 --> 00:54:43,983
I thought I was killing Jeff.
I punctured-

681
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:47,861
I didn't know I was puncturing things,
but I thought it was Jeff's.

682
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:51,531
I didn't know I needed to-
What did you do that for?

683
00:54:51,614 --> 00:54:53,491
You killed Mona Dearly!

684
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:56,954
- I know.
- But why?

685
00:54:57,038 --> 00:55:00,622
Because I thought
I was killing Jeff.

686
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:02,834
- My dad is the chief of police!
- I know.

687
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,961
- But I wasn't gonna go through with it.
- It doesn't matter.

688
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:09,133
- You killed someone!
- I know, but I was doing it for us.

689
00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:13,344
Jeff was killin' the business,
and Mona wasn't gonna let me out, so-

690
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:18,517
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

691
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:20,896
" A good idea at the time"?
Cut the grass at 6:00...

692
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:23,021
lay the sod at 7:00,
drown the Dearly's at 8:00?

693
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:26,358
I was doin' it for us. It was for us.
It was for our perfect life...

694
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:28,486
'cause everything we wanted-

695
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,529
That's just great.

696
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:36,743
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, I'm pregnant.

697
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:39,830
What? You're pregnant?

698
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:44,543
- It's mine?
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:55:47,296 --> 00:55:50,549
- That's fantastic.
- I thought so too until a minute ago.

700
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:54,259
I can't believe this. How could you?
We're not killers. We're good people!

701
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:56,783
- I wasn't gonna go through with it.
- You're not supposed to get to that.

702
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:59,224
You're supposed to have that thing
that goes off in your head that says...

703
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:01,352
"bad fuckin' idea," Bobby!

704
00:56:01,435 --> 00:56:04,355
I have that thing. I have it.
It just didn't go off.

705
00:56:09,985 --> 00:56:13,447
I'm sorry. Please.
Please. I love you.

706
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,034
Man, I can't believe
you killed someone!

707
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,914
- Where are you goin'?
- Home!

708
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,377
We need milk.

709
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:48,065
Hey, Chief. Please come in.

710
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:49,567
Thanks, Phil.

711
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:54,613
Have a seat.

712
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:03,413
Thanks for comin' by, Chief.

713
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:05,916
What's on your mind?

714
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,211
It sure seems clear to me...

715
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:11,628
that my Mona was a victim
of an act of treachery.

716
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,758
There's no doubt in my mind
that she's been murdered.

717
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:18,929
- What makes you so sure?
- I saw it happen.

718
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,513
You saw it happen?

719
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:25,310
Now, granted,
this ain't easy for me to say...

720
00:57:25,393 --> 00:57:28,147
and it's something
I should have said before-

721
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:30,150
You been playing Wheel of Fortune
with someone else!

722
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:59,637
I would have told you before,
but when family's involved...

723
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,681
things can get a little dicey.

724
00:58:04,723 --> 00:58:07,352
I appreciate your discretion.

725
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:13,234
What can you tell me
about Rona Mace?

726
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,990
- Rona?
- Mace, yeah.

727
00:58:21,909 --> 00:58:24,203
Well, that's-

728
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,746
She's-

729
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:28,748
She's a good friend...

730
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:31,710
who's been real supportive
since the tragedy.

731
00:58:31,793 --> 00:58:35,215
Was she supportive
prior to the tragedy?

732
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:40,927
Chief, I may not
have been happily married...

733
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,515
but I did take an oath.

734
00:58:57,945 --> 00:59:00,822
- The usual, madame?
- If you'd be so kind.

735
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,371
Good luck on your free spin.

736
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:40,947
<i>I'm a Wheel watcher</i>

737
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:42,780
I want it, baby.

738
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:44,908
Oh, yeah. Come on.

739
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:47,953
Free spin, honey.

740
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:52,083
Free spin.

741
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:00,549
<i>I'm a Wheel watcher</i>

742
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:03,300
Will you cut the shit
and get down to business?

743
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:06,262
Okay. Can I buy a vowel?

744
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:10,142
You know what, Phil? I've really
been a good sport about this.

745
01:00:10,184 --> 01:00:13,021
I really have.
I've really tried to do what you want.

746
01:00:13,104 --> 01:00:16,313
You wanted to buy an "o"?
So I let you buy a vowel. I did.

747
01:00:16,398 --> 01:00:20,778
Because you wanted to buy a vowel.
So I let you buy an "o."

748
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:22,905
But that wasn't good enough.
You had to have the free spin.

749
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:25,197
You wanted to have the trip to Acapulco.
You know what?

750
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:27,200
You've landed on bankrupt, buddy.

751
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:29,286
But I wanna solve your puzzle.

752
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:32,164
Please, Phil, please. I beg you.

753
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:37,002
Please tell me I didn't spend all
this time with you to end up like this?

754
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:39,295
Don't do this!

755
01:00:39,379 --> 01:00:41,507
I'm a 33-year-oldwaitress...

756
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,510
at a friggin' diner
that doesn't encourage tipping!

757
01:00:44,552 --> 01:00:45,720
Thirty-three?

758
01:00:47,846 --> 01:00:49,806
What the hell
are you doin' here?

759
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:53,312
Me and Rona here were-

760
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:55,396
Jesus Christ. Bea man.

761
01:00:55,479 --> 01:00:58,523
Jeff, whatever you think is
happening in here is happening.

762
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:00,150
You're cheatin' on Mom?

763
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:02,236
Mom's dead, son.

764
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:07,991
But, baby,
how could you do this to me?

765
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:10,201
Excuse me.
Did you just say "baby"?

766
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:12,538
Keep it down over there!
I'm payin' by the hour!

767
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,872
You shut up!

768
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:16,167
- People!
- Please! Have some respect!

769
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,252
What is the matter with you?

770
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:21,337
You're a dead man, Dearly.

771
01:01:23,174 --> 01:01:25,216
I gotta get the hell
outta this joint.

772
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:43,527
What's this?

773
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:46,697
I thought we'd
celebrate the baby...

774
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,533
but I'm not really
in the mood right now.

775
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:54,372
Who's that?

776
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:58,249
What am I, Dionne Warwick?

777
01:01:58,335 --> 01:01:59,752
Hang on!

778
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:04,464
- Dad!
- Hi, honey.

779
01:02:04,547 --> 01:02:07,718
What are you doin' here? Hi!

780
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,305
How are you doin', Mr. Rash?

781
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,642
What's that?

782
01:02:15,767 --> 01:02:18,604
You might wanna sit down for this.
We're pregnant.

783
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:23,317
Congratulations, Grandpa.

784
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,028
That's just-That's great.

785
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:33,160
I know it's sooner than we thought,
but we're in love.

786
01:02:33,244 --> 01:02:35,245
Starting a family
is all we've ever wanted.

787
01:02:35,328 --> 01:02:38,581
- It is. I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

788
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:41,460
Come on, Dad.
Have a drink with us.

789
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:55,434
So how's the police force
coming-going?

790
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:01,187
I understand you don't cut
the Schneiders' lawn anymore.

791
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:05,026
No, sir. Not since Jeff killed Peaches.

792
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:09,112
Jeff killed Peaches? I thought
it was the other way around.

793
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:10,905
That Peaches killed Jeff?

794
01:03:10,947 --> 01:03:13,659
No, that you killed Peaches.

795
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:16,830
Me? I loved Peaches.

796
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:20,206
Poor Peaches.
I can't believe you did that!

797
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,502
- It was in the way!
- You chased it with the lawn mower!

798
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:25,005
Like you never killed a dog.

799
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:26,339
We lost that account.

800
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,924
Blame me, just like you blame me
for everything else.

801
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:33,137
If you keep losing the accounts,
then we're not gonna have a business.

802
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,139
Then how am I gonna
take care of Ellen?

803
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,017
Are you trying to screw up
Jeffrey's business?

804
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:40,894
You're hurting my neck!

805
01:03:40,977 --> 01:03:43,146
What are you doin'?
Don't touch my mom!

806
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:45,523
What do you think you're doin'
touchin' my mom?

807
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:46,984
You nuts?

808
01:03:47,026 --> 01:03:49,820
You tore my overalls!

809
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:53,073
- I don't think that's a-
- That's your problem! Ya don't think!

810
01:03:53,156 --> 01:03:56,202
- I've had it with you, Calzone!
- What's that supposed to mean?

811
01:03:56,285 --> 01:03:59,372
You'll see.
Trust me, buddy. You'll see.

812
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:05,378
You said overalls?

813
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:09,173
Yeah.

814
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:14,094
I need to know
one more thing, Bobby.

815
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:17,348
I need to know where you were
Wednesday night.

816
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,937
At the Hideaway.

817
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,519
Are you sure?

818
01:04:24,229 --> 01:04:27,066
Yeah. I'm at the Hideaway every night.

819
01:04:27,149 --> 01:04:29,193
Well, I mean,
not every night, but-

820
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:34,321
Well, yeah,
I'm there every night, so-

821
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,574
so, yeah, I was there.

822
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,096
Hi, Valerie.

823
01:04:57,178 --> 01:05:00,307
Gotta flat?
You need a hand?

824
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,976
How ya doin', Mr. Rash?

825
01:05:03,728 --> 01:05:05,396
That's some shiner.

826
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:07,814
- It's nothin'.
- It's not nothing.

827
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:11,318
I got clocked in the eye
Wednesday night at the Hideaway.

828
01:05:11,402 --> 01:05:12,653
Wednesday night.

829
01:05:14,196 --> 01:05:16,074
Ellie never mentioned anything.

830
01:05:16,198 --> 01:05:18,908
I don't think she knows about it.
Her and Bobby weren't there.

831
01:05:21,036 --> 01:05:22,288
What happened?

832
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:25,207
I was just drivin'
when all of a sudden the tire blew out.

833
01:05:25,249 --> 01:05:29,753
- I pulled off the flat and found this.
- Where do you suppose that came from?

834
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:35,634
J.B. Landscaping.

835
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:48,774
She was a lousy driver.
It probably caught up with her.

836
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:53,319
I was a battered husband.

837
01:05:55,946 --> 01:05:57,365
This car was done to death.

838
01:05:58,617 --> 01:06:00,534
<i>Ding-dong, the witch is dead.</i>

839
01:06:00,618 --> 01:06:02,494
End of story.

840
01:06:02,578 --> 01:06:04,496
<i>I would have told you before,
but when family's involved...</i>

841
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,499
<i>things can get a little dicey...</i>

842
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:08,793
<i>I don't think she knows about it.
Her and Bobby weren't there.</i>

843
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:10,795
I'm at the Hideaway every night.

844
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:13,463
- "Bobby. Calzone did it."
- "Fixed to kill."

845
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:24,057
Look, Jeff, I am sorry if I hurt
your feelings and everything.

846
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:29,522
I thought maybe if your dad and I got
married, maybe the three of us could-

847
01:06:29,563 --> 01:06:32,317
What? Live together
so you could bang the both of us?

848
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:36,194
Well, sort of.

849
01:06:36,277 --> 01:06:38,990
I can't do this.

850
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:43,537
I've been going crazy all day just
thinking about you and that freak Phil.

851
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,538
If you're worried
about me and Phil getting married...

852
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:49,667
forget about it,
'cause it ain't gonna happen.

853
01:06:49,749 --> 01:06:51,544
Then why don't you marry me?

854
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:55,255
Come on, Jeff. I mean, come on.

855
01:06:57,258 --> 01:06:59,719
Be serious.

856
01:06:59,802 --> 01:07:01,554
I'm totally serious.

857
01:07:01,595 --> 01:07:05,225
I know I don't got no ring
or nothing...

858
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:08,893
but I love you,
and, like, I always loved ya.

859
01:07:08,977 --> 01:07:12,524
If I lived a life without you...

860
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:14,609
it just wouldn't be a life
worth livin'.

861
01:07:16,735 --> 01:07:18,446
Come on.

862
01:07:21,323 --> 01:07:23,576
Can we play Wheel of Fortune now?

863
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:33,627
No, stop.

864
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:35,714
Stop.

865
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:38,923
Stop. Phil?

866
01:08:00,153 --> 01:08:02,489
Where are you goin'?

867
01:08:02,572 --> 01:08:04,658
I can't sleep. Go back to bed.

868
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:07,162
Okay.

869
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:21,800
Hey.

870
01:08:22,884 --> 01:08:25,471
Don't kill anyone, honey.

871
01:08:26,973 --> 01:08:28,975
Okay.

872
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:57,669
Excuse me, Murph.

873
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,469
Give your daddy some sugar.

874
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:07,722
It's Bobby. Murph, wake up.

875
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:11,184
- Cuddles?
- No, it's Bobby.

876
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:14,855
I know you think
I killed Mona, right?

877
01:09:14,938 --> 01:09:20,192
The truth is that I might
have done something that-

878
01:09:28,074 --> 01:09:29,994
Hey. Hey!

879
01:09:31,078 --> 01:09:33,415
I touched her once, one time.
That's it.

880
01:09:33,497 --> 01:09:36,085
Listen, hey.
I need you to do me a favor.

881
01:09:38,626 --> 01:09:40,587
Can you cover for me?

882
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,256
Hey.

883
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:47,262
Yeah, I'll cover for ya.

884
01:10:12,702 --> 01:10:15,456
- Use the lambskin to clean it.
- Hey!

885
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:17,458
- Chief, how are you doin'?
- How you doing?

886
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:20,379
Good. I'm fine.

887
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:23,004
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions about Bobby.

888
01:10:23,089 --> 01:10:27,760
I ran into Valerie, and she had
the black eye thing going there.

889
01:10:27,843 --> 01:10:31,680
Yeah, it's terrible times
we're living in...

890
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:34,100
when a gal can't
even go get a beer...

891
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,143
without getting clocked
in the eye.

892
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:39,439
She said to me that if
Bobby was here the other night...

893
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:41,900
he would have kept her
from getting beat up.

894
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:43,942
So he wasn't here, is that it?

895
01:10:43,984 --> 01:10:46,779
Bobby was here. No, he was here.

896
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:49,323
He was here.

897
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:52,619
Picked a hell of a time
to go to the bathroom.

898
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:01,252
What's wrong?

899
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:03,630
Nothing.

900
01:11:19,854 --> 01:11:22,816
Drowning. Terrible way to go.

901
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:26,610
Rather take a bullet in the head.

902
01:11:26,652 --> 01:11:29,487
Rather get thrown off a skyscraper.

903
01:11:29,572 --> 01:11:31,699
Or thrown in front of a truck.

904
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:33,826
I had a dog drown on me once.

905
01:11:33,868 --> 01:11:35,329
No kidding?

906
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:38,788
She couldn't paddle.
You think they can all paddle-

907
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:43,127
Here comes the chief.

908
01:11:43,169 --> 01:11:45,129
We're gonna have to go in now.

909
01:11:49,466 --> 01:11:52,261
Get him out!
What are you standing around for?

910
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:56,183
We were just trying to preserve
the integrity of the crime scene.

911
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:59,686
- Forensic disturbance of the-
- It's water. Get him out!

912
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:02,188
We're goin' in. Here we go.

913
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,315
Let's go. All right.

914
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:06,151
Here we go.

915
01:12:09,569 --> 01:12:10,862
One more.

916
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:27,839
This used to be
such a nice, quiet town.

917
01:12:27,963 --> 01:12:31,092
- He was a battered husband.
- Yeah.

918
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:39,892
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, Chief.

919
01:12:39,977 --> 01:12:42,560
Don't go anywhere.

920
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:54,531
Hey, Clarence.

921
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:59,705
I see you took a little dip
in the water, huh?

922
01:12:59,746 --> 01:13:03,581
Every once in a while a fellow
has got to cool himself off.

923
01:13:06,459 --> 01:13:08,254
Yeah.

924
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:15,928
You want to tell me
what happened?

925
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:31,738
Hi, Murph.

926
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:35,490
- How ya doin', Ellie?
- Not bad.

927
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:42,496
Guess who's a bad swimmer.

928
01:13:44,915 --> 01:13:47,460
Guess who sleeps with the fishes.

929
01:13:47,543 --> 01:13:49,794
What do you mean?

930
01:13:49,836 --> 01:13:54,133
Phil Dearly wound upon the wrong end
of the proverbial beverage.

931
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:56,595
Speak English.
What happened to Phil?

932
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:58,763
They found him this morning...

933
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:01,766
dead in the water, so to speak.

934
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:01,535
- Where's my dad?
- What's going on, honey?

935
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,618
Where's my daddy?

936
01:15:03,702 --> 01:15:06,664
Calm down. Slow down.
Take a deep breath.

937
01:15:06,747 --> 01:15:08,666
What's going on?

938
01:15:11,878 --> 01:15:16,006
Juts found out!
Murph told me!

939
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:22,807
- I can't. Not tonight. Not tomorrow.
- Bobby's a murderer!

940
01:15:24,306 --> 01:15:25,849
I can't do it.

941
01:15:35,025 --> 01:15:39,405
You got problems, dude.
I covered for you long enough.

942
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:42,909
- The bodies are starting to pile up.
- Bodies are piling up?

943
01:15:42,951 --> 01:15:45,910
- Get in the car.
- Get-

944
01:15:47,078 --> 01:15:48,164
Okay.

945
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:52,044
- How ya doin'?
- Shitload better than your dad!

946
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:54,546
- What-
- What's wrong?

947
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:56,964
- What happened to his dad?
- What are you turning into?

948
01:15:57,048 --> 01:15:59,091
A serial killer?

949
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:03,220
Seen Ellen?

950
01:16:08,016 --> 01:16:11,563
Don't go anywhere because you and I
need to have a little dialogue.

951
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,568
- Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell outta here.

952
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:21,781
Listen, if Phil calls,
you don't know where I am.

953
01:16:21,864 --> 01:16:25,409
- Didn't I tell you?
- Tell me what?

954
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:27,954
Phil's dead, honey.

955
01:16:29,622 --> 01:16:33,084
Phil's dead?
Why didn't you tell me?

956
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:36,253
I told somebody.

957
01:16:40,048 --> 01:16:42,802
We're gettin' married Sunday!

958
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:45,930
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

959
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:48,684
- Breathe.
- I gotta go.

960
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,145
The closer we get to the wedding,
the more people he murders.

961
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:58,235
I've heard of cold feet.
But I can't marry a murderer!

962
01:16:58,318 --> 01:17:01,571
That's not who I am.
That's not what I'm about.

963
01:17:01,653 --> 01:17:03,780
It's gonna be okay.

964
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:06,367
I really appreciate
you doing this.

965
01:17:06,451 --> 01:17:09,371
That's what friends are for.

966
01:17:09,454 --> 01:17:11,039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

967
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:15,626
Yeah. It's okay.

968
01:17:32,979 --> 01:17:35,062
Everyone says weddings are stressful.

969
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:39,859
I didn't see it coming.
Maybe we should have eloped.

970
01:17:39,943 --> 01:17:43,488
Maybe I pushed him too hard with
the boneless breast of chicken and all.

971
01:17:43,523 --> 01:17:45,155
Don't do this to yourself.

972
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:48,993
If he really did kill anyone,
it's just' cause he loves me.

973
01:17:50,411 --> 01:17:52,038
I'm not saying it's okay.

974
01:17:52,121 --> 01:17:55,168
It's just that's how committed
he is to the relationship.

975
01:17:55,209 --> 01:17:58,252
Sweetheart, there are other ways
to show you care.

976
01:17:58,336 --> 01:18:02,049
- I know. I love him so much, Dad.
- I know you do.

977
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,345
I'm gonna sort
this whole mess out, all right?

978
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:07,011
Okay.

979
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,431
Was Ma like this
before you guys got married?

980
01:18:10,514 --> 01:18:12,934
- That was a little different.
- How's that?

981
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:14,936
No one died then, honey.

982
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,188
Right.

983
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:21,067
- Dad?
- Yeah, baby?

984
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:25,781
You're not gonna tell him
about Lucinda, are you?

985
01:18:26,823 --> 01:18:28,241
Of course not.

986
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:33,454
Besides, I experimented a bit
when I was your age too.

987
01:18:45,509 --> 01:18:46,718
Hi, Jeff.

988
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:49,096
What are you doin'?

989
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:52,180
What does it look like? I'm gettin'
the hell out of here. Want to help me?

990
01:18:52,264 --> 01:18:55,434
That's very funny. You didn't think
stumpy was funny last night.

991
01:18:55,518 --> 01:18:57,603
What about last night?

992
01:18:57,688 --> 01:18:59,732
What do you mean,
what about last night?

993
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,116
- I told you to stay away from her!
- You're gonna pay for this.

994
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,783
You got the short end of the dick.
She don't love you!

995
01:19:11,866 --> 01:19:13,786
It ain't the meat but the motion.

996
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:16,915
You don't know how screwed you are,
all of you, you, Rona, Bobby.

997
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,791
I'm gonna expose ya all.

998
01:19:22,711 --> 01:19:25,131
- Give me your hand.
- Yeah, yeah! Whatever!

999
01:19:25,214 --> 01:19:28,467
Why don't you friggin' swim home?

1000
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:31,096
You think I killed him?

1001
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:35,641
I'm not gonna stick around
and wait for the autopsy.

1002
01:19:36,642 --> 01:19:38,352
So you're leaving me?

1003
01:19:38,436 --> 01:19:42,274
No offense.
Your family is whacked.

1004
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:47,028
Fine. Fine. I'm leaving, then.

1005
01:19:47,111 --> 01:19:48,447
Okay.

1006
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,139
This is 002. Come in, 001.

1007
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,559
Go, Feege.

1008
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:21,396
- "Remember Rona Mace?"
- Vaguely.

1009
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,982
She's about a heartbeat away
from scratching gravel.

1010
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:27,985
- "Did you say scratching gravel?"
- Copy that, Chief.

1011
01:20:28,027 --> 01:20:30,363
Get Tony and Jimmy over there.
I'm on my way.

1012
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:33,325
Hang on.

1013
01:20:46,296 --> 01:20:48,757
Miss Mace? Seen Ellie?

1014
01:20:52,218 --> 01:20:54,012
What's the matter?

1015
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:04,939
- Is he apprehending him?
- Calm.

1016
01:21:07,526 --> 01:21:08,695
If we take him down-

1017
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:10,445
- I didn't do it!
- Put your hands down.

1018
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:12,947
- I didn't do it!
- Put your damn hands down.

1019
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,616
- I didn't do it.
- I didn't do it either.

1020
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:16,201
- Put your hands down.
- I didn't mean to kill her.

1021
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:19,746
Keep your mouth shut.
Move over here and shut up.

1022
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:22,330
- Where you goin'?
- I'm owed vacation time.

1023
01:21:22,414 --> 01:21:24,125
I find that highly unlikely.

1024
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:26,794
No son-in-law of mine
is going to go to prison.

1025
01:21:26,877 --> 01:21:32,259
In case anyone cares, Jeff Dearly is
at the cemetery with a gun to his head.

1026
01:21:32,302 --> 01:21:34,051
Holy shit.

1027
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,555
Nobody move.

1028
01:21:37,596 --> 01:21:41,643
Tony, Jimmy,
just keep everybody here.

1029
01:21:41,728 --> 01:21:43,769
Feege, you come with me.
Come on!

1030
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:47,107
- Stay here!
- Stay calm.

1031
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,984
- Don't let them move!
- You got it, Boss.

1032
01:22:08,795 --> 01:22:10,255
Come on, baby!

1033
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:50,252
Don't move any closer, Sheriff.
I swear to God, I'll do this!

1034
01:22:50,336 --> 01:22:52,296
He's not a sheriff!

1035
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:57,512
I know how upset you are
about your dad.

1036
01:22:57,553 --> 01:23:01,305
To hell with him!
Everyone knows he's not my real daddy.

1037
01:23:01,347 --> 01:23:04,725
- Then why are you doing this?
- She said she was gonna marry me.

1038
01:23:04,809 --> 01:23:07,437
- Who?
- She said she was gonna be my wife.

1039
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:10,481
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Rona!

1040
01:23:10,523 --> 01:23:13,067
- I love her!
- I love you, too, baby.

1041
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,820
I told you to stay put!

1042
01:23:15,695 --> 01:23:18,741
Honey, please, don't make me a widow
before we get married.

1043
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:19,742
Do it!

1044
01:23:21,242 --> 01:23:23,327
Don't do it!

1045
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:26,373
You've got your whole life ahead of you,
unless you blow your brains out.

1046
01:23:26,455 --> 01:23:28,583
Don't do it.

1047
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:31,587
I know you all think
I killed my parents.

1048
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,630
- We don't think you killed anybody.
- You're full of shit.

1049
01:23:34,714 --> 01:23:38,593
Everyone knows I've been wantin' to
get back at her ever since that night-

1050
01:23:40,554 --> 01:23:42,514
Ma, there's no more beer.
Give me some of yours.

1051
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:44,390
Don't touch that beer.

1052
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:45,433
I said-

1053
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:52,025
- Was I so wrong?
- Bet your ass!

1054
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:54,024
Yeah, but I didn't kill her.

1055
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:58,613
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad
she's dead and all, but I didn't do it.

1056
01:23:58,697 --> 01:24:00,782
I know you didn't kill her.

1057
01:24:01,658 --> 01:24:03,452
I didn't kill my dad neither.

1058
01:24:03,536 --> 01:24:06,912
- Then why don't you give me the gun?
- 'Cause my life sucks, man!

1059
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:08,957
- Don't do it. It's not gonna feel good.
- Give it a whirl.

1060
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,374
Would you shut up?

1061
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:14,254
You know what? To hell with all of you.
This is bullshit.

1062
01:24:27,098 --> 01:24:29,102
Damn! Damn!

1063
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:30,978
- Damn!
- I'm all right.

1064
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:35,526
- Is anybody hit?
- I'm all right.

1065
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:39,529
- I got the gun. Come back!
- You got it?

1066
01:24:39,612 --> 01:24:41,322
All right.

1067
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:42,783
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1068
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:46,954
Everything jake here, Chief?
Just securing the circumference.

1069
01:24:48,454 --> 01:24:51,165
Come with me.
Come on, ya little baby.

1070
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,876
Come with me.

1071
01:24:52,959 --> 01:24:54,753
- Am I in trouble?
- No.

1072
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:56,922
Listen to me very carefully.

1073
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:59,089
I want you to remember
every word I say.

1074
01:24:59,799 --> 01:25:01,760
I spoke to Clarence earlier...

1075
01:25:01,801 --> 01:25:05,263
and these are
the exact words he used.

1076
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:09,933
- I'm deeply hurt.
- How do you mean?

1077
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:14,106
All this talk about Ellie's weddin',
and I wasn't even invited.

1078
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:16,441
Of course you were invited,
you and your wife.

1079
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:19,445
I'm married?

1080
01:25:21,696 --> 01:25:26,200
Clarence, now,
what the hell's goin' on?

1081
01:25:26,284 --> 01:25:29,789
You mean with the damp clothes
and the hair?

1082
01:25:29,872 --> 01:25:32,331
That's a start.

1083
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:34,959
That's 'cause
just last night I killed-

1084
01:25:34,994 --> 01:25:36,712
What's his name?

1085
01:25:36,795 --> 01:25:39,172
Phil Dearly?

1086
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:41,841
I killed Phil.

1087
01:25:46,013 --> 01:25:47,597
Hey, Clarence!

1088
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:49,599
Give me your hand.

1089
01:25:49,683 --> 01:25:52,852
- Come on!
- Hold on, buddy. Hang on.

1090
01:26:05,865 --> 01:26:07,366
Any reason why?

1091
01:26:09,786 --> 01:26:11,204
Any reason?

1092
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,210
Well-

1093
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:22,257
<i>You know the night in question?</i>

1094
01:26:23,843 --> 01:26:26,177
<i>I was seein' it all go down.</i>

1095
01:26:28,012 --> 01:26:30,849
<i>I gotta tell ya,
it didn't look good for Bobby...</i>

1096
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:10,388
Phil Dearly knew that
Bobby tried to kill Mona.

1097
01:27:10,429 --> 01:27:12,431
Bobby wound up in the hoosegow.

1098
01:27:12,515 --> 01:27:15,268
- Pardon?
- The jug, the can, the coop.

1099
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,815
If Bobby got thrown in the pokey...

1100
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:21,399
what kind of a life would that be
for Ellie and the baby?

1101
01:27:21,483 --> 01:27:23,068
How'd you know she was pregnant?

1102
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:26,363
The point is, I just couldn't
sit there and let Phil Dearly...

1103
01:27:26,447 --> 01:27:29,741
take down the only decent people
still left in this town.

1104
01:27:31,784 --> 01:27:35,455
Wow. Thank you, Clarence,
for the thought...

1105
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:40,253
but you still did
a very, very bad thing.

1106
01:27:42,878 --> 01:27:45,340
To bad people.

1107
01:27:46,383 --> 01:27:49,886
You punctured the fetzer valve.
Phil cut the brake lines.

1108
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,307
Then he switched Mona's keys and
drove the final nail into her coffin.

1109
01:27:55,183 --> 01:27:58,270
I don't know what to say, Mr. Rash.

1110
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:02,150
Don't say anything.
But know this.

1111
01:28:02,233 --> 01:28:05,360
I will die before I ever let you
ruin my daughter's life.

1112
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:09,156
I will hunt you down,
chasing you to the ends of the earth...

1113
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,785
pursuing you relentlessly
until I am satisfied...

1114
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:15,704
that you know what it is
to suffer the wrath of God.

1115
01:28:15,786 --> 01:28:19,708
You will welcome the relief
that death will bring.

1116
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,544
- Got it?
- Got it.

1117
01:28:21,627 --> 01:28:23,755
I just want us to be happy.

1118
01:28:24,837 --> 01:28:29,635
You, me, Ellen, the baby.

1119
01:28:31,136 --> 01:28:33,305
We're gonna be like
the von Trapp family.

1120
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:39,061
You know, "The Sound Of Music," the
family from Austria, Julie Andrews...

1121
01:28:39,143 --> 01:28:41,188
and all the little kids singing.

1122
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:45,860
Come with me.

1123
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:50,822
Marriage is an institution
not to be entered into lightly.

1124
01:28:50,864 --> 01:28:54,702
So, is there anyone here
who feels that this couple...

1125
01:28:54,744 --> 01:28:57,036
should not be joined
in holy wedlock?

1126
01:28:58,412 --> 01:28:59,872
Last chance.

1127
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:03,585
Okay, so be it.

1128
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:05,588
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1129
01:29:18,516 --> 01:29:20,851
What are you waiting for?
I'm dying here.

1130
01:29:20,893 --> 01:29:23,271
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1131
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,777
Congratulations.

1132
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,278
Way to go.

1133
01:29:42,457 --> 01:29:44,667
Where's your date?

1134
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,670
I don't have a date.

1135
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:52,425
Then what are you
gonna do afterwards?

1136
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:54,219
Nothing.

1137
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:56,805
Unless somebody dies.

1138
01:29:58,974 --> 01:30:00,934
Congratulations, you two

1139
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:13,112
Well, Clarence, buddy, it's time.

1140
01:30:13,154 --> 01:30:14,613
Ready?

1141
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:17,951
- Things good?
- Yeah.

1142
01:30:17,993 --> 01:30:20,288
- How about you?
- Okay.
