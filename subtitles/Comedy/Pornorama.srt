00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:20,388
The Confessions Of
Nymphomaniac Seamstress Rita Brauchts

2
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:23,190
(Rita "Needs It")

3
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:56,403
First row attention!
Line up in two rows!

4
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,527
And remember, no art.

5
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,972
Yes, boss.
All right.

6
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,846
Revolution is doable!

7
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,802
Up with the skirt!

8
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,278
Look, the skirts are getting
shorter and shorter.

9
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,242
I wonder where that will end.

10
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:31,327
Tender in bed,
hard with the cops!

11
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,279
Attention! The squares are out!
They've become a social menace!

12
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,287
A problem for global peace!

13
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,845
The police not only regulates
the road traffic,

14
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,598
but also the traffic in our beds!
We claim Free Love!

15
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,687
We have a right to orgasm!

16
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,243
Give me the film,
you fucking cop!

17
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,968
Freddie?

18
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:40,243
Calm down, this is a project by
the Film Academy.

19
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:45,082
You're at the Film Academy?
- Not me, but my brother...

20
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,167
is at the Film Academy.
- What?

21
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,848
Sorry, I thought you were
such a police cameraman.

22
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,723
The always wear Che Guevara T-shirts.
- Really?

23
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,808
That's perverse!
- What's your film about?

24
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,368
Well, everything, what
you do here, actually.

25
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,767
Really?

26
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,120
Well, if I can help
with your film...

27
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,971
Come and visit us.

28
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:32,887
My name's Luzie.
- Bennie.

29
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,487
What a hottie, she likes you.

30
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:54,443
Come on, Walter, stupid cops.
- Just a pity that you're a cop.

31
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:17,363
I'm working with a big project,
and I'd like you in there.

32
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:22,961
No. Absolutely not. Not again.
- Man, it's death-proof business!

33
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,841
Freddie...

34
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,048
I've got nothing, really.
- Tell me, how come,

35
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:35,217
that you think I want something?
- It's been so since I was 4!

36
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,765
You always wanted to make films, right?
- I do it.

37
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,359
I'm trained as a cameraman
at the police school.

38
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:48,368
To control suspicious revolutionaries.
Actually... you're

39
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:52,368
a fucking informer! Bennie,
you can't make it for long.

40
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:56,038
You tell me?
You've never had a job

41
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,559
more than 3 days!
- Come on, at the bank

42
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,045
I've been over a week already!
- As watchman!

43
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,684
You wanted to go to film school
and become a filmmaker!

44
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:10,279
Instead, you've let Dad
talk you into the police.

45
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,288
You know it was Dad's great wish.
- I know.

46
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,608
But I'll give you the chance to make
the film you always dreamed of.

47
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,562
Love! Hate! Jealousy!

48
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,369
Great feelings!

49
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,837
You give me the chance
for a film? You of all?

50
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:36,997
You'll see. Come on. Let's
say hello to some people.

51
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:48,457
Here's Cesare, our producer.
He'll pre-finance the film.

52
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,838
Cesare also owns a pizzeria.
- Buona sera, Bennie.

53
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,710
Freddie has told a lot about you.

54
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,616
Oh, really?

55
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,079
Lothar has an apprenticeship
as electrician.

56
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,518
Started.

57
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:08,531
Well, I currently think
about starting.

58
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,479
That's Irene. Lothar's girlfriend.

59
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,008
Irene has done a course
at a hairdresser. She could...

60
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,106
take over the make-up.
If you agree.

61
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:25,558
I'd be very happy!
- And this is Mr. Eckert.

62
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,568
Mr. Eckert is a real professional.
He's the projectionist here.

63
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,444
He has worked at the DEFA studios
since the war.

64
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,118
Eckert.
I feel very honoured,

65
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:41,481
that you have taken me on board.

66
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,998
3 MILLION VIEWERS.
SENSATION IN THE GERMAN FILM BUSINESS:

67
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,706
Oswalt Kolle, Germany's love guru, won
The Golden Screen for Miracle of Love.

68
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:55,361
A new record. 3 million viewers
in 11 weeks."

69
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,447
So what?
- Bennie, we can do that too!

70
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,528
Bennie, together we make
such a big bag full of money.

71
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,162
3 millions: Stronzo!

72
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,407
A cinema ticket costs 2.50.

73
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,487
Time 3 millions,
make 7.5 millions.

74
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,408
Holy Virgine! 7.5 millions!
- Conservatively counted!

75
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,919
Cesare suggested a great lead!
She shall be talented!

76
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:28,882
She has two great talents!

77
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,083
You wanna make such a film?
- You'll see.

78
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,760
Love, hate, jealousy.
Great feelings.

79
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:44,046
Caress me down here.
- Hey, what do you mean?

80
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,764
Let me do it my way!
- But you have no ideas!

81
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,007
Always the same! And then so quick.
- Maybe best we forget it.

82
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,168
You only think about yourself!
It's the same what I feel!

83
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,248
Don't you have fun?
- Yes. But not enough time!

84
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,020
I come only if I...

85
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,328
If what?
- If I do it myself.

86
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,767
What? You masturbate?
Why did you even marry me?

87
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,210
She's sweet, eh?

88
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,365
Promise that you stop it.
- I can't.

89
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:18,368
She must promise. She's a wife!
- But that's perverted!

90
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:22,368
You must have a bad conscience!
- Yes, but not because I do it,

91
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:26,368
it's because I do it secretly.
I feel I deceive you.

92
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:30,164
With whom? With that one?
What a joke!

93
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,259
Shut up!

94
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,023
Bennie? Bennie!

95
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,967
What's going on?
- I can't do that.

96
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,588
I know that the film isn't
really on your thing...

97
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,079
My adjuration as policeman is
in 2 weeks. When it gets out

98
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,088
that I'm making a sex film,
its over and out.

99
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,246
And in fact for ever.
- From whom should they hear it?

100
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:17,327
Just a few days, come on.
Let's do it.

101
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,945
There's more.

102
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,249
What?

103
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:30,208
I can't make a film about sex.
- Why not?

104
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,403
I've never...
- You've never had sex?

105
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,962
Beautiful evening.
- Bennie!

106
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:49,007
Bennie, wait. Bennie.

107
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,365
I haven't told you
about the pills.

108
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,447
What kind of pills?
- Birth control pills.

109
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:01,248
I've got 5000 packs for sale.

110
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,600
But that's illegal!
- Only if you get caught.

111
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:11,757
On the open market I could sell them
for five times the price.

112
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,403
Why "could have"?

113
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,204
I can not believe it!
You steal money from a bank!

114
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,958
I don't steal anything.
I'm watchman, an employee.

115
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,368
I took out a short-term advance.
From Friday to Monday.

116
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:30,049
Yes, and then?

117
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,998
Then I found out, that these
weren't birth-control pills.

118
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,881
What then?

119
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,609
Peppermint.

120
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:46,080
The guys with the 10000
were of course long gone.

121
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,528
And what will you do now?
- Well, the film.

122
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,401
With you.

123
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,648
Bennie, you're the only one
I know, who knows,

124
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,047
how to make films.
And this film is my only chance

125
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:08,289
to pay back the money to the bank.
Otherwise, I end up in jail.

126
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,151
Everything is thoroughly prepared.
We're waiting for you.

127
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,007
Freddie...
- You are my brother.

128
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,168
You can't abandon me.
I need you.

129
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,569
2nd reminder.

130
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,767
How's it going?
- Not so good.

131
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:03,201
We need to draw on the reserves.
- Dad's stamp collection?

132
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,962
Probably we've got no choice.
But if we sell it,

133
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,047
we'll get out a fair sum.

134
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,402
Can't you wait a little?
Maybe I get an idea.

135
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,396
Oh, Bennie.
- Who knows, sometimes...

136
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:27,082
sometimes miracles happen.

137
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,125
You talk like your brother.

138
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:35,888
To find straight story
for our film,

139
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:40,784
I would like to... invite you.

140
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:44,682
For a short ride through
the most successful productions

141
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,977
of the recent past. Questions?
- None.

142
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,287
Well. Then let's go.

143
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:57,688
Well.
I'll write down the best topics.

144
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,643
Exactly. And we simply
put them into our film.

145
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,447
Ok.

146
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,246
Darling?
- Yes!

147
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,327
May I come nearer?
- No.

148
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,687
I can't now.
- Why not?

149
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:19,127
Why, why?
- Can't I ask?

150
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:23,208
I shall always be ready for you.
I'm not in the mood.

151
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,745
Well, was it good?
- No!

152
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,921
Not recommended is this position
often chosen by the less experienced,

153
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,928
because the man lies from
above between the legs...

154
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:53,803
of his partner, forcing
his nose located too deep...

155
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,478
between the legs and
near the anus.

156
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:02,364
The demonstrated movements...
- Just forget it.

157
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:06,368
An ideal pace for the intercourse
doesn't exist.

158
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:12,618
But they should always be rhythmic,
as rhythm intensifies the sensations.

159
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,198
While the penetration
of the penis for the man...

160
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:30,348
immediately leads to an increasing
arousal, striving towards an orgasm,

161
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:37,631
the arousal of the woman also increases
through direct physical stimuli

162
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:41,242
although she can't
step up with him.

163
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:46,397
The imaginative lover...
- Well, well, I thought,

164
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,078
better start with the basics, huh?
- ...an erogenous zone,

165
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,282
but due to the knowledge
of all erogenous zones...

166
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:58,368
a symphony of perfect happiness
is composed.

167
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:03,483
Why not? Just write it down.
- After the foreplay...

168
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:08,285
with the woman lying on her back,
the man kneels next to her thigh,

169
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,825
so that he is in right angle to
her body. Then he pushes...

170
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,763
the left arm under the knees...
- What kind of angle?

171
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,914
I'm not sure right now.
Just go on...

172
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:24,718
The legs are lifted so high,
that they form a right angle...

173
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:29,559
with the thighs.
- Sorry, but I find it complicated.

174
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,441
Totally.

175
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,248
Undressing in front of the partner
won't fail it's effect on the man.

176
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,044
It is perhaps the oldest
seduction method of the woman.

177
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:48,323
Today, it is often commercially
exploited with the striptease.

178
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:55,001
Have you ever practised group sex?
- Yes.

179
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,802
Why did you do it?
- Out of curiosity.

180
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:01,888
Why is group sex so popular?
- Out of boredom, because...

181
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:05,888
alone it's too boring, well...
Curiosity as well.

182
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,161
What did you like most about group sex?
- Nothing.

183
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:13,361
Have you ever seen a porn magazine?
- Yes.

184
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:18,085
Do you think one should lift the ban
of porn for adults? - No.

185
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:21,936
That shouldn't happen.
- Continue it?

186
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:25,020
Yes.
- So you think porn is bad?

187
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,087
Actually not.
- But you want...

188
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,600
the ban to be continued?
- Yes, yes.

189
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,361
Doctor, what about the third way
to orgasm, through masturbation...

190
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:38,791
or onanism.
- 99% of all young men and girls...

191
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,318
masturbate occasionally,
while 1% lies.

192
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:47,157
Did you know that you on the size
of the mouth of a woman...

193
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,693
can infer the size of her vagina?
- The vagina of a normal, healthy woman

194
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:57,000
is so elastic that she usually adjusts
to the size of the penis.

195
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,438
There's the coffee!

196
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,524
I actually can't recognise
any concept.

197
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:20,808
Concept?
Tits and ass, that's the concept.

198
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,800
A scientific framework
is in fact required, huh?

199
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,968
We'll meet tonight at Cesare, ok?
- All right.

200
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:42,168
Shall I give you a lift?
- No thanks, I've other plans.

201
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,198
But don't forget the red thread!

202
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:06,721
Hello...

203
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,642
Well, let's see.

204
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,722
What? "I wanna fuck you?"

205
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,401
Shit!

206
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,688
Hi, Bennie!
- Bad timing?

207
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,369
No. Come in.

208
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,118
That's Lasse!
Always listening the Beijing Radio.

209
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,118
What, you speak Chinese?
- No, why?

210
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,687
I just listen out of solidarity.

211
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,487
Do you like one too?
- No, thank you.

212
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:55,560
And how's your film going?
- It's going rather... going fine.

213
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,247
Time for breakfast.
- This is Walter.

214
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,049
This is Bennie. You know,

215
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:14,801
who wants to make the film with us.
- It's that Stalinist nonsense.

216
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:22,043
Luckily I built too many yesterday.
Always think about the future.

217
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,002
Pre-building is really important.

218
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,081
Tell me,

219
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:38,322
I know you somehow.
- He was at the demonstration.

220
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:42,283
No, not there. It was
when they arrested me,

221
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,958
at the police station, can that be?
- Me?

222
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:56,843
What was your film about?

223
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,887
.
Never seen a naked woman?

224
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,712
Yes.

225
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,362
You know, Benjamin,

226
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:28,070
I'm quite curious if your film
is ideologically correct.

227
00:22:28,503 --> 00:22:32,074
Yes, well, actually...
Yes.

228
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:37,023
So it is? And how will you
arrange everything?

229
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:42,296
Marxist-Leninist? Or do you rather
see the barter after the revolution?

230
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,479
Walter,

231
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:47,804
stop that ideological
dick comparison.

232
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:50,445
I just want to know
on which side he is.

233
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,123
Well, we'll show frankly
the marriage as...

234
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,647
Have I heard the word marriage?

235
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:28,364
Yes, just that marriage
is actually over and out,

236
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:32,198
and that a woman easily
can be with several men.

237
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,047
And what about the men?

238
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,283
Hello, my name's Köpke,
C.I.D. Ramersdorf.

239
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:41,522
Could it be that your car
was stolen? - Yes.

240
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:47,721
But how do you... I called the police
but no one answered.

241
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:51,788
Saturday... Ramersdorf...

242
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,459
There it is. That's unbelievable!
How have you done this so fast?

243
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:06,527
A well-known car thieve.
We had traced him for a long time.

244
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:10,198
You do what you can.
- That's really great.

245
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:15,080
And how did you get him?
- It was a few hours ago.

246
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,889
At a traffic light.

247
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:26,964
He wanted to show off, but
he just stalled the engine.

248
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,847
How could something
so stupid happen?

249
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,718
I asked that myself.

250
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:38,162
And? What's next?

251
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:43,619
I think we should complete
some formalities.

252
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:48,087
Of course. Come on in...

253
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:55,438
So, it will... be like...

254
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,687
Oswalt Kolle, for example.
- Pardon?

255
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,404
That square tries only to save
the marriage! - Exactly!

256
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,362
And we oppose it.

257
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:10,207
We put the revolution and the
sexual liberation against it.

258
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:18,081
That's not bad. With that contrast
he exposes the square moral clichés.

259
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,003
Funny concept!

260
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:33,356
Hey, don't you need more material
about square points of view?

261
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:36,479
Yeah, Sure! I mean,
it's going to be square.

262
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:39,951
Maybe I've got an idea.

263
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,207
Well, an educational film...
- Yes.

264
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:49,586
You play the cop again?
- The director has to decide.

265
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,918
Before I leave you my hall,

266
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:56,839
You must explain more detailed
what happens in this educational film.

267
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:00,764
I'm single. It's easy
to attract gossip.

268
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,519
Men shall get educated about
the sexual needs of women.

269
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,607
I see. And you're the expert?

270
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:10,447
Mom?

271
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,447
Who are you?
- I'm Freddie.

272
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,513
He is a film producer.

273
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:23,078
You don't look like one.
- How do I look then?

274
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:25,769
Like a show-off.

275
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:31,843
Mama, I'm visiting Georg.
- But don't stay so long again.

276
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:39,948
This is Emmelie. My daughter.
- Pretty... saucy.

277
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:42,289
Indeed.

278
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,849
Get rid of it. Off, off!

279
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:58,529
Everything must off.

280
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,007
One moment.

281
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:11,244
Tell me, did you know there
are women who are obsessed

282
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,656
with every day eating another
type of vegetable.

283
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:16,125
But why?

284
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,589
What has this obsession for vegetables
to do the your sex life?

285
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:24,675
Well, for me it's with men.
If I, for example,

286
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:30,184
have slept with an Italian, I would
avoid Italians for a good while.

287
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,329
Then comes a Frenchman,

288
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:36,534
a Dane, a Spaniard, and so on.

289
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:43,809
Only... after a certain number
men of different peoples?

290
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,478
Ten.
- Ten? You need ten men...

291
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:51,808
different nationalities,
to satisfy yourself?

292
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:56,840
And then I'm only number 11.
- It must be tough for you.

293
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,409
Yes.

294
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,552
What's your profession?
- I am a seamstress.

295
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,489
Seamstress? I see!

296
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,878
When you pedalled the sewing machine,
I mean...

297
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,287
did the rubbing of the thighs give
you voluptuous sensations?

298
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:16,846
Indeed!

299
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:22,608
There was one a day
where I sewed 45 pants!

300
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:24,226
45?

301
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:31,505
Scientifically the case is clear: The
friction of the thighs while sewing...

302
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:35,480
gave you a lively
sexual stimulation.

303
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:39,568
High doses at a young age
can cause nymphomania,

304
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:43,848
also called...
Man-eater sickness!

305
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:48,958
Is there any hope
for our love?

306
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:53,928
You should pause your sewing
for a while. As for you,

307
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,962
so you can satisfy your friend,
it is recommended

308
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,923
during the act to recite
prime numbers, or to

309
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:06,645
recall unpleasant experiences.
It will delay the ejaculation.

310
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:12,630
That was amazing. The scene
is essential for the film!

311
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,565
Exactly.
And I play the counselor!

312
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,655
I got the story for the film.

313
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:19,778
The innocent girl Rita

314
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,798
gets through her hard work
at the sewing machine

315
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:27,443
unintentionally sexually aroused.
- With a sewing machine?

316
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,958
Yes.
- Wicked...

317
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,785
Careful, careful!

318
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:23,175
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,007
Well...

320
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,642
Just take a look through!

321
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:03,328
Could you possibly
go back a little? Yes.

322
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,500
Yes. That's good, that's good.

323
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,918
One more from the front, okay?
- Yes.

324
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,808
Mom, you look great!
- I agree.

325
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:45,878
Emmelie, come,
I'll help you with homework.

326
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,363
Will he sleep more often with us?
- Don't be so curious.

327
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:00,517
Great. With such a camera you look
right into the heart of everything.

328
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:04,931
Huge, huge!
- Yes. Ok, Freddie...

329
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:10,323
You play the sexually exhausted
friend of Rita. - What?

330
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:15,328
Sexually exhausted, me?
- You shall just play it.

331
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:22,810
Oh, shit!

332
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,047
People, listen everybody!
Irene...

333
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:30,567
Bennie?
- Luzie, who comes right now,

334
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:34,602
may never understand that the film
we make is about sex.

335
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:38,688
And not a word that I'm a cop.
Is that clear?

336
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,489
Clear.
- Got it.

337
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,687
Clear.

338
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,075
Hello. I'm Luzie.

339
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:54,880
This is our team. The best you can find.
All professionals.

340
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:59,038
Here is your text for the scene...
- Thank you.

341
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,968
We're just missing the lead actress.

342
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,728
That can't be true!
- Where is she?

343
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:15,800
More than three hours already...
- Freddie, what shall I do?

344
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,463
Gina... she is a diva.

345
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:21,788
Cesare?

346
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,127
Gina?

347
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,367
Ciao!

348
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,078
Ciao, Bella!
- Ciao.

349
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:03,841
Well, she really has talent!
- Let me introduce you, Signorina Gina!

350
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm the Bennie.
- I've heard so much about you.

351
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,287
Si!

352
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,635
I'm very happy that you take
the lead role in our film...

353
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:22,162
and I hope that...

354
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:27,044
and... I am convinced that we will
really work well together.

355
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:28,921
Va bene!

356
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:36,886
Good, then nothing can't go wrong
anymore. Would you please change now?

357
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,761
Va bene.

358
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:46,604
Change... wardrobe. For the role
you need different clothes.

359
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,481
Va bene.

360
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:57,928
Say, does Gina also speak German?
- German!

361
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:02,168
The language of love is Italian.
All over the world.

362
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,648
If she doesn't speak German,
she can't play in the film.

363
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:10,318
Is that clear?
- Is there a problem?

364
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:15,449
Everything is fine.
Freddie, I'll say it again,

365
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:19,895
I'm the producer.
If Gina doesn't play in this film,

366
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:24,160
I give no mark, no penny
not even a lira.

367
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,041
Capito?

368
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,313
She's got her text, she shall just
recite it. Tell her that!

369
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,205
You need to somehow
manage the text in German.

370
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,769
That one?
- Si.

371
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:58,562
Then comes first a "Dane"...

372
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:06,049
A Frenchman...

373
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:10,089
A Spaniard...

374
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,604
And so on...

375
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:15,931
Doesn't work, huh?
Doesn't work.

376
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:20,803
I can't do this.
I don't understand anything.

377
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:24,703
And now?

378
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,647
Bennie, do something.

379
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,849
Please. No matter what.

380
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:41,689
And... Please!

381
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:47,429
Well, now please tell me frankly,
what your problem is.

382
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:56,007
Hold on, please! Where is the problem?

383
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,483
I don't know how to play it.

384
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:03,318
What shall I say, if I don't
understand what's it about?

385
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,189
Gina doesn't know how to play
if she doesn't know what to say?

386
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,209
We just agreed that she can say
what she wants.

387
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:14,487
You can say what you want.

388
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:20,101
What shall I say?
Shall I just improvise?

389
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:24,357
I don't have a text. So I don't
know what to say, ok?

390
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:29,643
Gina says she can't think of any text.
- We've got a problem, huh?

391
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:39,681
Okay. She shall just recite
anything from your menu.

392
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:43,643
From my menu?
- Yes, your menu!

393
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:47,594
Come on, tell her. We can't spend
a whole day on that, man.

394
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:53,005
Recite all the dishes
from the restaurant.

395
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:56,406
Then they are satisfied.

396
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:02,049
Va Bene.
- Good!

397
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,323
We are "ready"!
- We shoot the next one.

398
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,001
Sound?
- Running!

399
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:11,881
And... please!

400
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:17,244
Well, now please tell me frankly,
what your problem is.

401
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:28,879
Mozzarella... with tomato.

402
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,918
And...

403
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:36,957
Saltimbocca.

404
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,603
And...

405
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,049
Freddie, Freddie,

406
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,049
Take over!

407
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:59,978
And then I, after...
repeated ejaculation...

408
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,205
collapsed unconscious. I!
- I don't hear anything!

409
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:07,162
I don't see anything. Off!

410
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,994
I don't want to play director,
But this

411
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:17,232
Italian talk will nobody understand.

412
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:19,649
We will dub it.

413
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:22,727
That's international
common practice.

414
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,924
In here.
- Has a little bit of air.

415
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:30,609
Good, good, very good!

416
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:34,436
Gina says,

417
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:38,237
she feels like a dog on a leash.
- Then she shall watch out,

418
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:42,203
that she doesn't get strangled!
- Ready?

419
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:44,441
Moment.

420
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:49,809
I'm... moment. Well...
Sound running!

421
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,717
Camera running. And please!

422
00:39:55,609 --> 00:40:01,241
You need 10 men of various Nationalities
in order to satisfy yourself?

423
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:05,207
And I'm always only number 11...

424
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:12,008
That must be tough for you.
You have to learn,

425
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:16,518
that you still
are a valuable person.

426
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,249
Always these tomatoes.

427
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:23,762
Spaghetti.

428
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:25,402
Minestrone.

429
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:27,854
Sea...

430
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,328
Gina, por favore.
- Everybody come close.

431
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:43,009
Stay tuned.

432
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:46,649
Well, we're shooting.

433
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,569
Sound!
- Sound running!

434
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,529
And... Please!

435
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:57,044
Lasagna al Forno.

436
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:01,128
Pizza Margherita.
- Stop. Off.

437
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:04,759
Excuse me,
but I've never seen

438
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:07,545
that three people
speak into a bouquet.

439
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,736
Either sound or no sound.
- So what now?

440
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,462
No, we rearrange.
We go here... on the two.

441
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:21,998
Freddie, Gina, the wall must go,
come on.

442
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:44,362
Well, we're shooting. Sound!

443
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:49,747
Running!
- Camera is running.

444
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:51,563
Please.

445
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:54,647
Lasagne al Forno. Pizza Margherita.

446
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:59,119
First if you have intercoursed with
several men from different

447
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,208
nationalities in a particular order.

448
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:07,564
Cesare, they shall start crying now.
Tell her!

449
00:42:07,689 --> 00:42:10,522
Gina, go ahead and cry, please.

450
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:17,889
Di bella Carbonara...

451
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:20,842
More expression, please!
- Hah?

452
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:25,305
"Molto espresso"!
- More expression! Come on, darling!

453
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:29,562
It was only the Parmesan.

454
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,409
Ah!
- Stop!

455
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,841
Highway!

456
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,329
Ah!
- Fantastic!

457
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,886
That was much better.

458
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:46,718
We may have to do it again.
- No.

459
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:51,881
Once more isn't possible.
Bennie, we're not doing art!

460
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:56,189
What? I don't about art. Well...
- Well? Go ahead!

461
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,239
It is what it is.
- I have to say now, unfortunately,

462
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,998
that the camera after 6 pm
no longer available is.

463
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:07,041
And it's already later.
- What?

464
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:11,216
Köpke, please set in the film that you
made at the demonstration,

465
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:15,168
so we can have a look
at the leaders.

466
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:21,408
Sorry, boss.
I'm afraid it's not possible.

467
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:25,442
Unfortunately the material
got exposed to light.

468
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,238
What? That's not possible...

469
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:31,129
Yes, unfortunately is
everything gone.

470
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:34,207
You're such a pinhead, Köpke!

471
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:38,208
Inspector. Maybe I can help.
- Yes, please.

472
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:43,288
At the demonstration I was assaulted
by an agitator with a cake.

473
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:45,968
I investigated the incident
independently...

474
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,605
and I can report that the culprit
lives nearby...

475
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:55,673
in a so-called commune.
- Here, in Ramersdorf?

476
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:02,120
Their lair is certainly full of drugs.
Enough for a couple of years.

477
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:06,083
I'll order an immediate crackdown.
Where there's one of this mob,

478
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:09,884
is certainly a whole nest.
We'll move out in half an hour.

479
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:14,048
Boss, I've got a proposal.
What if I drive ahead...

480
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:17,923
to observe the entrance?
- Good idea, Köpke!

481
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:22,600
I want photos of everybody
going in and out there. - Yes, boss!

482
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:29,687
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

483
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:42,169
Freddie! Freddie!

484
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,718
What's going on?
- Come on, get in! You gotta help me!

485
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,409
Come on!

486
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,926
Hey, you promised my mother,
that you are watching over me!

487
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:57,882
Oh man! Stupid adults.

488
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:02,528
What's that tone?
I'm a person of respect!

489
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:06,438
And you, please explain me,
what's going on.

490
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:12,044
Come on, give me your clothes!
- Your brother's even worse than you.

491
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:13,124
What?

492
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:28,007
And no nonsense!
- Okay.

493
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,849
Thank you.
- Good luck!

494
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:42,349
Stop! But not that way!
Are you insane?

495
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,042
Hey, hands off!

496
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:59,763
Switch it off at once!
- Why? I always wanted to do that.

497
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:02,241
Me too.

498
00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:12,005
What was that?

499
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:18,520
The cops are making a raid here!
- What? Come in.

500
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,719
Well, Stalin?
Come on, have a little smoke.

501
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:32,808
Oh man, dump that!
The cops are coming!

502
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:56,088
Not a bad idea, with the cake.
- "Manual for hiding drugs".

503
00:47:03,129 --> 00:47:07,042
Where's the back door?
- What back door?

504
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:10,479
Stay here. A raid is fun.

505
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:14,443
No, they may not find me here!
- What are you scared for?

506
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:17,402
Because of the film I'm making.

507
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:24,371
Open up! Police!

508
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:31,567
Come.

509
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:35,202
And into the oven.

510
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:43,400
God bless you, gentlemen.
- Rösner, come on, run!

511
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,562
Not in the closet!

512
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:52,524
Come under the blanket!

513
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,721
Moment.

514
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,204
Give me your finger!
- What?

515
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,680
Strip off!

516
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:28,407
Whoa!
- I've nothing to hide, officer!

517
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:34,448
Here we've got an evidence
of extramarital intercourse.

518
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:38,630
This is all legal. If you'd

519
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,448
excuse us. We're about to carry out
our duty for the German people

520
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:46,589
and produce a small, sweet and
submissive taxpayer.

521
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:52,199
The possession of a cake
must be legal, no?

522
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:57,119
At the last demonstration there was
exactly such a cake used as a missile...

523
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:01,208
Anything?
- Yes! I've confiscated an arm.

524
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:05,488
Nonsense Stürmer.
Put that back. March out!

525
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,322
That was luck. The good stuff.

526
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:19,243
Now tell me, how did you know
the cops would come?

527
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:22,327
Luzie, I have to confess something.

528
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:26,167
So, in reality, I'm...

529
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:33,080
Man, you've saved our ass!
- Well done, Bennie!

530
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:37,873
Come on, first piece for you.
- Can't you get lost for a moment?

531
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,807
And I thought you'd share
everything in a commune.

532
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:28,558
Gina,
you need to show emotions.

533
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:34,765
You must look really desperate
under your confession.

534
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,846
Tell her!

535
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:48,529
Everything from the grill.

536
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:53,402
With lots of cannelloni.

537
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:57,883
But not now!
The camera needs to run!

538
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:00,559
Sound!
- Sound running!

539
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:04,108
Camera's running...
And please.

540
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:10,921
Please.

541
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,969
What's up?

542
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:29,408
What does she say?
- Gina has no more emotions left.

543
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,881
What?
- She has let out all her emotions,

544
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:36,874
because you told her too soon.
Now she has none left.

545
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,081
Nice!

546
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:43,641
And now?

547
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:53,362
One... two... three...

548
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:58,729
Four... five... six...
- Oh! That must be tough for you.

549
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:02,885
Is there still hope for our love?
- But of course.

550
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:08,349
(talks Italian)

551
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:15,767
Cut!

552
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:22,084
That was it.
People, that was great!

553
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:25,884
And now we shoot the scene
where Gina only stands naked...

554
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,967
and says nothing.
The one with the pointer.

555
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:32,909
(talks Italian)

556
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:44,504
(talks Italian)

557
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,807
No.

558
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:59,341
Gina plays not naked.

559
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:03,198
What does that mean?
"Plays not naked"?

560
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:08,920
But you have told Gina,
what kind of film we're making?

561
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,998
And that in a sex film
you must play naked?

562
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:18,678
I said, it's a film about love.
- How?

563
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,559
Love?
- Much love.

564
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:25,568
Maybe Gina has misunderstood.
- You're kidding, no?

565
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:29,568
We shoot a sex film with an actress,
who doesn't speak German,

566
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:33,921
and doesn't want to strip off!
The first sex film without sex?

567
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:37,962
How shall we make money with that?
- Don't talk to me like that!

568
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,638
I've paid everything here!
- Yes, 800 Mark!

569
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:44,569
Si.
- Bennie?

570
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,769
Come with me outside.

571
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:02,823
You ripped me off quite a bit.
It's only about money, nothing else.

572
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:12,208
This film... I do it only
for my brother.

573
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:16,288
He's in an economical mess.
- I see. So what?

574
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:21,286
I must help him earn money
otherwise he goes to jail.

575
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:23,969
To prison.

576
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:32,475
How's the title of the film?

577
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:37,767
Well,

578
00:54:40,649 --> 00:54:42,844
"Pornorama!

579
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:46,928
The Confessions Of Nymphomaniac
Seamstress Rita Brauchts! "

580
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:51,489
Good title.
- Yes.

581
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,728
What does that mean?
- Well, Rinchen just helps out.

582
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:13,367
What?
You've heard it.

583
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:18,078
Gina's won't do it.
Not even in a bikini.

584
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:22,238
It doesn't matter who
is playing that scene.

585
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:25,327
Well, let's shoot it this way.

586
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:27,967
Sound.

587
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:30,921
Sound running.

588
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:34,757
Camera is running. And please!

589
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:39,008
Here we have the left breast.
I want to mention,

590
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:43,728
that the nipple houses the
greatest pleasure factor.

591
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:48,398
Particularly in case of
so-called Nymphomania.

592
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,723
Nymphomani-ani-a.
- Oh, that's really stupid now.

593
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:57,813
I must load a new film.

594
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:02,466
When that roll is finished, we have
no more. It was the last one!

595
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:04,749
We gotta to buy more.

596
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:09,209
Cesare, you heard it.

597
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:14,163
But I've nothing with me.
- Then we'll go to your place first.

598
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:19,443
No. There's a problem. My Mom
checked the cashier yesterday.

599
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:24,607
And?
- She saw that the cashier was empty.

600
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:29,601
And what does that mean?
- She is upset.

601
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:34,883
I can't give anything more.
- You are only joking, right?

602
00:56:40,049 --> 00:56:43,837
I'll kill you, you slimy,
small pizza maker.

603
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:55,398
Well, I could sell my scooter.

604
00:56:57,249 --> 00:57:01,587
That's a hundred for sure.
- People, that's meaningless.

605
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:06,622
We're not going to
make it.

606
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:11,286
Only the camera, footage.
Add the price for the copies.

607
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:15,687
We are quite simply screwed.
- So stupid, that we've paid...

608
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:20,963
the ads for the premiere already.
That money is now gone.

609
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:24,602
I'm really sorry, Freddie.

- Yes!

612
00:58:52,009 --> 00:58:54,967
People, I've good news.

613
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:58,482
We continue as planned.

614
00:58:58,729 --> 00:59:01,307
One, two...

615
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:02,790
and three.

616
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:10,610
Wow.
That gets us a little further.

617
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,362
Where's the money from?

618
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:17,767
It doesn't matter.
The main thing, it's there.

619
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:22,728
I agree...
The only question is,

620
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:26,848
how we solve the problem with Gina.
In one scene it was quite ok,

621
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,848
but I can't double her all the time.
- I've been...

622
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:33,927
thinking about it already.

00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:46,403
Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein.
- I don't get it.

625
00:59:46,523 --> 00:59:53,011
How shall he help us?
- It's not just naked or not naked, huh?

626
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,314
Now it's only to study
the rules thoroughly...

627
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:01,483
Then we can show sex,
without showing sex.

628
01:00:03,489 --> 01:00:06,003
Association Montage.

629
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,127
Silence!

630
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:19,682
Mess! I'll call the police!

631
01:00:40,529 --> 01:00:44,488
Bonjour, Madame.
A la Bouillabaisse et la Marseillaise.

632
01:00:51,009 --> 01:00:52,761
Kalinka!

633
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:55,603
Cut. Thank you.
- Well, I was good?

634
01:00:55,729 --> 01:00:58,402
Yes, very good!
- Bene.

635
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:02,567
Freddie, pull yourself together.

636
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:20,049
 Cut.

637
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:24,081
On the bed.

638
01:01:24,769 --> 01:01:27,727
More jump! People, people! More!

639
01:01:32,729 --> 01:01:35,562
I'd like to go to the cinema.

640
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:39,569
Listen to this:

641
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:44,448
"Pornorama!
The Confessions Of Nymphomaniac Seamstress

642
01:01:44,569 --> 01:01:48,403
Rita Brauchts ".
- What a mess! Let me see.

643
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:53,322
"Premiere at the Apollo Cinema."

644
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:59,408
That's just around the corner.
- We must report it.

645
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:04,928
People, today's our last
shooting day.

646
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:09,438
And what comes now,
is the key scene in our film:

647
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:13,528
The scene where the seamstress
becomes nymphomaniac.

648
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:17,643
And we'll shooting really erotic.

649
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:32,367
You're not serious not, are you?

650
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:38,524
Can't you at least leave
some buttons open?

651
01:02:38,649 --> 01:02:41,073
I'm sorry, she's adamant.

652
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:46,997
Well.

653
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:07,407
Finally.
- Man, Lothar.

654
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:17,717
Great, pull the tulle over,
a little softer.

655
01:03:23,922 --> 01:03:25,458
Toilet defective!

656
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,405
Sound!
- Sound running!

657
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:33,281
Camera running!
And, Luzie, Gina.

658
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:37,447
Please!
- Fournier claims that young girls...

659
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:41,357
through certain activities like
machine sewing can be the cause...

660
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:45,653
for self desecration. With good reason!

661
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:54,247
Well done, slowly, slowly!

662
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:58,929
Fantastic, Lothar!

663
01:04:01,729 --> 01:04:05,688
Through the continued rubbing
of the thights...

664
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:10,082
are lively sensations on the
external genital areas generated.

665
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:15,841
Of course, the effect gets stronger
the faster the pedal is moved.

666
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:17,722
Oh yes!

667
01:05:23,372 --> 01:05:25,408
Saved.

668
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:48,840
Two hours left. The countdown is on.
- Cool, Cool man.

669
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:53,488
I'll open the ticket sale
for the first people, huh?

670
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:25,478
Hey man, look at that!
- Unbelievable.

671
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:29,568
We really did it.
- You did it.

672
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:32,647
You shot your first film.

673
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:38,527
Come on!

674
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:07,522
What's going on here?

675
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:26,207
I haven't sold any ticket yet.
- What?

676
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:31,011
(talks Italian)

677
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:37,367
Do I miss anything now?
Why are all the people out there?

678
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:41,448
Obviously they don't want
to see the screening.

679
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:46,287
Lechbach, chief inspector. The
screening is prohibited by the police.

680
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:50,960
Why, if one may ask again?
- That's typical!

681
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:55,680
Always this repressive crap!
Why don't you get lost?

682
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:59,287
Bennie,
what are you doing here?

683
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:04,798
You should have worked today!
- Exactly, Köpke, where were you?

684
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:08,888
One day before your adjuration
as police officer!

685
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:10,607
What?

686
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:14,329
You are a cop?

687
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:20,919
Luzie, Luzie, wait!

688
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:23,609
Luzie! Luzie!

689
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:25,845
Get lost!

690
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:31,683
Luzie, listen to me!
I know I should have told you.

691
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:35,964
Yes, I wanted to tell you also.
- I can't believe it.

692
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:40,241
I've fucked with a cop.
- Damn, what's so bad with it?

693
01:08:40,369 --> 01:08:43,327
There must be policemen too.

694
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:47,887
Your car would be stolen every day.
- I have no car.

695
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:53,641
Then your bike.
Or you're robbed every night.

696
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:59,083
Luzie, I love you and I wish
I had never lied to you.

697
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:02,042
Bennie, I've had enough.

698
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:06,842
Find another idiot.

699
01:09:15,929 --> 01:09:18,238
There will be a sequel!

700
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:33,067
One time
"Animalistic, Lickerish & Shameless"

701
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,478
2.80 mark, please.

702
01:09:45,858 --> 01:09:50,189
And now I want to know
who screwed it up.

703
01:10:08,878 --> 01:10:11,711
"Swedish Birch Forests"?

704
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:22,547
She doesn't want to see you.
- I'd like to hear it from herself.

705
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:25,511
Piss off, you fucking cop!

706
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:39,877
I don't get it.
- There might be more nature lovers,

707
01:10:39,998 --> 01:10:42,558
than you'd think.

708
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:58,941
KINKY SWEDES

709
01:11:58,543 --> 01:12:01,200
I need to talk to you.

710
01:12:16,478 --> 01:12:19,436
Pornography is illegal, I think!

711
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:23,316
Stop that gossip about censorship.

712
01:12:24,318 --> 01:12:28,197
Now the others drive their money
home in wheelbarrows. Shit!

713
01:12:28,318 --> 01:12:32,277
Madonna, what have we done?
Nothing.

714
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:34,662
And we got all that police!

715
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:38,908
We didn't pay for "Kinky Swedes"
but for "Swedish Birch Forests".

716
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:40,496
That's the trick.

717
01:12:44,398 --> 01:12:46,150
That's it.

718
01:12:47,638 --> 01:12:49,385
It's over.

719
01:12:50,478 --> 01:12:54,027
Let's go home.
- No, let times.

720
01:12:55,678 --> 01:12:58,238
I'll follow later.

721
01:13:24,678 --> 01:13:28,432
What will you do now?
- I fly to New York tomorrow morning.

722
01:13:28,558 --> 01:13:31,709
New York?
- I just saw an old girlfriend.

723
01:13:31,838 --> 01:13:35,717
She has borrowed a few bucks.
- And Mom? If you fly so early

724
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:41,038
you can't say goodbye to her.
- Right now that's maybe better.

725
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:46,277
The money for the film, right?
You've tapped her.

726
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:50,997
I haven't tapped her. I've...
- Yes, what?

727
01:13:51,918 --> 01:13:54,478
Say it!

728
01:13:55,918 --> 01:13:59,433
I've pledged the stamp collection.

729
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:03,517
You what?
- God, what should I have done?

730
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:08,436
From somewhere the money had to come.
- Are you completely nuts?

731
01:14:08,558 --> 01:14:11,118
That was her pension!

732
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:15,148
It's possible she must
sell the house now.

733
01:14:15,278 --> 01:14:18,827
How much did you get?
- 10,000.

734
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:25,114
Are you totally insane? The collection
was worth at least 50,000.

735
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:35,488
I can redeem it, right?
Think I leave Mom in the lurch?

736
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:39,711
Those few thousand marks.

737
01:14:40,638 --> 01:14:43,596
In America I'll earn dollars.

738
01:14:43,798 --> 01:14:47,632
You know what, Freddie?
You're still my brother,

739
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:54,231
but I've got enough with you.

740
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,957
I begin with the adjuration
of our candidates.

741
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:18,677
Ludwig Rösner, do you swear
to exercise your duty...

742
01:15:19,438 --> 01:15:22,828
in all conscience?
- I swear.

743
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,791
Go home, you morons!

744
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:46,233
Do you swear to exercise your duty
in all concience?

745
01:16:00,558 --> 01:16:04,028
Sorry, boss, but I have to pass.

746
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,116
Köpke, have you lost your mind?

747
01:16:07,827 --> 01:16:09,104
Yes.

748
01:16:32,078 --> 01:16:34,638
Peter Thomas Friedl.

749
01:16:39,998 --> 01:16:42,831
That was a great act.

750
01:16:57,278 --> 01:17:00,111
Bennie, telephone.

751
01:17:07,678 --> 01:17:11,227
A Mr. Badewitz
wants to talk to you.

752
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,196
Yes?

753
01:17:17,398 --> 01:17:20,231
What? Are you sure?

754
01:17:23,798 --> 01:17:25,868
Yes, of course.

755
01:17:25,998 --> 01:17:28,831
So, we are six people.

756
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:34,352
No. Seven.
Well, then we'll meet the 27th?

757
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:37,110
Bye.

758
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:40,310
Well then!

759
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:43,162
International Film Festival
Hof

760
01:17:43,478 --> 01:17:48,029
Sorry, where're you going?
The screening is almost over!

761
01:17:48,342 --> 01:17:50,564
(talks Italian)

762
01:17:56,398 --> 01:18:00,107
I'm sorry, but we are sold out!
- Sold out?

763
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,197
She's the star of the film.
She is Gina Ferrari!

764
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:11,998
Well then.

765
01:18:17,438 --> 01:18:21,824
Nastrovje, Borschtsch, Kalinka!

766
01:18:28,318 --> 01:18:32,834
Finally, where were you?
The film's almost finished!

767
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,791
But good you're here.

768
01:18:49,598 --> 01:18:52,556
Such a mess! I'll call the police!

769
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:11,827
Well, maybe a little
too much Eisenstein.

770
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,916
You're a genius! A film-God!

771
01:19:24,118 --> 01:19:29,272
The director of the film,
Benjamin Köpke.

772
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:44,157
I congratulate you sincerely
to this success.

773
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:49,957
What will you do with the money?
- Well, so I...

774
01:19:50,598 --> 01:19:53,556
10,000 go to my producer...

775
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,032
and my actors,
led by Gina Ferrari.

776
01:20:03,478 --> 01:20:06,038
Grazie!
- And my brave crew,

777
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,116
that enabled me
to make this film.

778
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,516
And as far as the other 10,000,

779
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:38,472
I will invest them...
In stamps.

780
01:20:44,598 --> 01:20:49,239
And now I'd like
to thank one person.

781
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,833
She gave me the idea
for the film...

782
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:58,112
and so I'm very sorry
that she can't be here today.

783
01:21:11,478 --> 01:21:15,130
Excuse me, I'm just a little...
I see... I see

784
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:21,394
that she there anyway. Back there.
I ask her to join us on the stage.

785
01:21:26,638 --> 01:21:29,471
Luzie, I beg you!

786
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:05,436
Yes, I hope that I still...

787
01:22:05,598 --> 01:22:09,557
I can make many more films
together with her and...

788
01:22:13,558 --> 01:22:15,913
a lot more.
- Do you mean,

789
01:22:16,038 --> 01:22:19,587
I don't need a sewing machine
anymore?

790
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:02,951
Pants down. I wanna see.

791
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:07,358
Full House.

792
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,350
Moment!

793
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:19,596
So what? 3 tens and a couple.

794
01:23:20,438 --> 01:23:23,396
I've got two kings.
- I have three.

795
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:25,750
Exactly.

796
01:23:26,678 --> 01:23:30,512
Have you ever seen five kings
in one game?

797
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:34,119
Are you implying that I swindle?

798
01:23:35,918 --> 01:23:38,751
Köpke. You have a visitor.

799
01:23:45,718 --> 01:23:49,267
Say, do you have to stay here
much longer?

800
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:53,226
Not that long. A year or two,
perhaps even less.

801
01:23:53,849 --> 01:23:56,748
After all I've turned myself in,
voluntary.

802
01:23:56,878 --> 01:23:59,836
When you get out, we'll be there.

803
01:24:52,678 --> 01:24:55,511
I want to fuck you! What?

804
01:24:57,918 --> 01:25:03,550
Well, Stalin? - Shit, I can't
remember what I wanted to say.

805
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:12,271
In order to... Can I come again?
- Yes, please.

806
01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:18,356
Cut!

807
01:25:19,318 --> 01:25:22,276
I'm sorry. Shit, again.

808
01:25:26,678 --> 01:25:29,520
Sorry...
- Off!

809
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,396
Can we do it once more?
- Try.

810
01:25:34,955 --> 01:25:38,229
One time
"Animalistic, Lickerish & Herma"...

811
01:25:38,349 --> 01:25:39,514
Once more.

812
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:48,083
