Hey. Hey.

151
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,986
- Brock.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

152
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,699
- Hi !
- Hey. Hey, baby.

153
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:40,676
[ Chuckles ]
What's up ? How's it going ?

154
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:44,057
Who the hell
does she think she is ?

155
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:47,854
There are 2,000 girls in this school,
and l can bump monkeys
with every one of 'em.

156
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:51,985
- Taylor Vaughan is totally replaceable.
- Spare me this wax shit...

157
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,988
about replaceable, because we're
talking about Taylor Vaughan here.

158
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,659
- Sorry, man. He's-- He's right.
- Of course l'm right.

159
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,662
l mean, the girl's
an institution in this place.

160
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:01,416
Every girl wants to be her,
and every guy wants to nail her.

161
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,921
- Basically, she's you... with tits.
- [ Laughs ]

162
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,467
Nah, nah, you're wrong, you see.

163
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,890
The Taylor Vaughan you just described
is an illusion, a myth.

164
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,394
You strip away
all that attitude and makeup...

165
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:17,398
and basically all you have is
a C-minus G.P.A. with a wonder bra.

166
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,401
Oh, give it up.

167
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,447
Take, uh--
Take her for example.

168
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,492
Short, decent rack,

169
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:27,580
kind of a Chelsea Clinton
thing going on.

170
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,334
But given the right look,

171
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,462
the right boyfriend, bam !

172
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,175
ln six weeks, she's the one
being crowned prom queen.

173
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:38,221
- You're serious ?
- As a heart attack.

174
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:42,728
You're clearly delusional. But how
about a chance to prove me wrong ?

175
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,483
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. Dean,
Dean, Dean. The boy's buggin' here.

176
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,571
You're taking advantage of a friend
in a vulnerable situation.

177
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:52,910
Gee, that's swell, Preston.
A fifth of Chivas and a uterus
and you could be my mom.

178
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:57,542
No, seriously.
The guy thinks he could do anything.
Let him prove it.

179
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,421
- What do you say, Zack ?
- A bet ?

180
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:04,010
Yeah. Unless, of course,
you're too heartbroken.

181
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,558
- Just name the terms.
- All right, it's simple.

182
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:13,399
l'll pick the girl, and you got six
weeks to turn her into the prom queen.

183
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,739
Okay, okay, we get it, okay ?

184
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,242
- Everybody has a big jimmy.
Now can we just--
- You got it.

185
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:26,043
- All right. Let's go shopping.
- [ Laughing ]

186
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,006
Oh, man, this is
gonna be so much fun.

187
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:32,052
- [ Preston ] What about her ?
- [ Dean ] Nah, l don't think so.

188
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:35,181
- [ Girl ] l mean it's still scabbing.
See, l saved it.
- How about this one ?

189
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,351
A-Are you sure about Bubbles ?

190
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,855
Nah, we can do
better than that.

191
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,568
[ Zack ]
What about her ?

192
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:46,156
Rectal archaeology. Very nice.

193
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,790
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid.

194
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,001
[ Gasps ]

195
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,715
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

196
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:00,428
[ Zack ]
What, Laney Boggs ?

197
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,639
Uh-uh ! No.
No, no, no, no.

198
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,726
Hey, a bet's a bet.
Right, Preston ?

199
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,229
Hey, man, this is
between you guys.

200
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:10,526
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Exhales ]

201
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,283
Look, fat l can handle.

202
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,037
Weird boobs, bad personality,
maybe some sort of fungus.

203
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,753
Come on. Scary and inaccessible
is another story.

204
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:26,258
Hey, man, if l were you,
l wouldn't be wasting my time,

205
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:29,137
'cause by my calculations
you got six weeks until the prom.

206
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,683
And if-- if Laney Boggs
is gonna be queen,

207
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:34,687
l'd say you pretty much got
your work cut out for you.

208
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,404
- Hi, Laney. You got a second ?
- [ Boy ] Here comes Zack.

209
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,242
What's up, Spaz ?

210
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:45,495
He knows my name.

211
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,500
That's not your name.
That's not his name.

212
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,544
Oh. Sorry.

213
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,217
So, Laney, listen.

214
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,555
-l was wondering if maybe you'd wanna...
-Let's go, Simon.

215
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,893
embarrass me horribly
in front of all these people ?

216
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:05,024
- Laney--
- Come on. Dad's waiting. Let's go.

217
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,738
[ Laughter ]

218
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,956
Wait ! Watch this.

219
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:18,795
- [ Farts ]
- Oh ! Damn it, Brock.

220
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,221
Relax, man. Smells like roses.

221
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:28,226
l will not relax.
You-- You are being disrespectful.

222
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:31,022
You are disrespecting me,
and you are disrespecting Harmony.

223
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:34,151
lt's not about disrespect.
lt's just gas.

224
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:38,950
- That's about enough of this.
- How's the queen of The Real World ?

225
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:41,746
How did you know about that ?

226
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:45,251
Please. They've only run that
spring break thing like a zillion times.

227
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:49,675
- So who's the lucky rebound skank ?
- Rebound skank ?

228
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:54,891
- Well, there's gotta be
somebody, right ?
- Well, l wouldn't say somebody.

229
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,562
But there is sort of a project.

230
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,940
- Project ?
- Yeah.

231
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:04,405
To tell you the truth, she kind of,
uh-- she kind of blew me off.

232
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,533
l like her already.

233
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,246
Well, the only thing l can figure
is it's gotta be some kind of mistake.

234
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,167
Zack, l realize it's
a difficult concept...

235
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,712
for a bitch magnet
such as yourself to grasp,

236
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:19,261
but did it ever occur to you
to make a little effort ?

237
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,557
- What do you mean ?
- Find out where she hangs out.

238
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:25,353
- Find out what she likes.
- [ Door Closes ]

239
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,358
Oh, crap.
Mom and Dad are home.

240
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,279
lf they ask, l'm at Ashley's.

241
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,450
Her brother's home.
He's so cute.

242
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:38,248
He just got kicked out
of military school.

243
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:44,215
Zachary, how was
the first day back ?

244
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,218
Ah. School is school.

245
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,972
Taylor and the girls
have a good time in Florida ?

246
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,435
- l guess so.
- There's still no word on
the Dartmouth application ?

247
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,480
Obviously not.

248
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,984
You haven't heard
from a single university yet.

249
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:00,239
- lsn't that a bit unusual
at this point in the year ?
- Not really.

250
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:02,784
You know maybe l ought to give
Ken Wortham in the alumni office a buzz.

251
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:08,209
- l owe him a call anyway.
- Nah, nah, let's give it
a couple of days.

252
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:11,214
Probably hear something
by Friday.

253
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,470
We'll give it till
the end of the week.

254
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,491
Does my tattoo
look red to you ?

255
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:01,956
- Come on, girl. Don't you care
about anything anymore ?
- What are we spewing about ?

256
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:06,713
Well, two weeks ago,
we were helping you plan
your prom queen acceptance speech.

257
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:09,885
Now all of a sudden, everything's
like "Brock this" and "Brock that"...

258
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,930
and "my tattoo."

259
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:15,018
Taylor, the last thing you wanna do
five weeks before the election...

260
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,146
is alienate people.

261
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,483
- And what is that supposed to mean ?
- l think...

262
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:23,238
what she's trying to say
is you should be careful. Right ?

263
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,241
Careful of what ? Okay.

264
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,912
l can win this thing
in fluorescent lighting...

265
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:30,958
on the first day of my period,
cloaked in tacky rags. Okay ?

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,295
My mother was
prom queen in '71.

267
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,674
My cousin,
prom queen in '82.

268
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,469
And my sister would have been
prom queen in '94...

269
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,472
if it wasn't for that scandal
on the Color Me Badd tour bus.

270
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,809
Okay, l am a goddamn legacy.
All right ?

271
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:46,565
And besides, not to be a bitch,
but who's gonna beat Taylor Vaughan ?

272
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,361
God, l hope that's not
your acceptance speech.

273
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:55,245
Okay, sir, that will be one tahina kebab
with a side of spiced hummus salad.

274
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,456
Would you like to super-size
those falafel balls ?

275
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:01,254
Hmm. Let me see.

276
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:06,470
- Laney.
- Exactly what does
this super-size entail ?

277
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:09,391
Stalking is illegal
in all 50 states.

278
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:12,771
- Come on. l just wanna talk.
- l find myself torn.

279
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:15,149
Perhaps l could see
a sample ball...

280
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,780
to better equip myself
for such a decision.

281
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:22,577
- Don't you have a break coming up ?
- One moment, sir.

282
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,081
Uh, uh, miss ?

283
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,293
One moment, sir.

284
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:29,796
l'm not smart.

285
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:33,010
- What ?
- What ? You figure l could--
l could tutor you or something ?

286
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:36,181
- You think, "Oh, well,
there's Laney Boggs. She's a dork.
- Look, Laney.

287
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,226
- Laney.
- She must at least be smart."
Well, guess what, l'm not.

288
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:42,482
Laney, l have the fourth
highest G.P.A. in our class.

289
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,405
Mm-hmm.

290
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:51,203
Oh. What is this, some kind of new dork
outreach program ? l'm just not, uh--

291
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:54,208
- No, it-- Are you always like this ?
- No.

292
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,297
- Yes.
- Come on. Five minutes.

293
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:01,010
- [ Customer ] Miss ?
- Five seconds.

294
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,308
Okay. Um, l really
wanted to talk to you about...

295
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,272
- art.

Don't you ever just kick back ?

1196
01:25:20,308 --> 01:25:23,730
Yeah, do you have a Dean Sampson
registered in room 4-0-9 ?

1197
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:26,985
Do you have a room 4-0-9 ?

1198
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:32,702
- Shit.
- [ Dialing ]

1199
01:25:35,748 --> 01:25:37,710
Yeah.
Sunset Marquee, please.

1200
01:25:40,422 --> 01:25:44,970
And that is
the kidney-shaped pool.

1201
01:25:45,096 --> 01:25:46,973
- Hello ?
- Mmm ?

1202
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:49,310
lf you're gonna help me out this summer,
you're gonna have to know this stuff.

1203
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,480
Okay ? What shape is that ?

1204
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,483
- Kidney ?
- Thank you.

1205
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:58,950
They come in a lot of different
shapes and sizes. Here's--

1206
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:01,245
Hey, pumpkin-nose, how did it go ?

1207
01:26:02,705 --> 01:26:06,962
Fine. You were right.
l did have fun.

1208
01:26:07,003 --> 01:26:09,382
Well, hey, uh,
come here a second, will ya ?

1209
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:16,643
l don't know, Dad. l'd really
just rather go upstairs and--

1210
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:26,825
Okay. Well,
l gotta get up pretty early.

1211
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:30,831
We're getting up early
to, uh, install a spa.

1212
01:26:30,956 --> 01:26:33,209
So, we'll head to bed now.

1213
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:36,589
lf you two wanna talk, maybe you can go
in the backyard, hmm ? [ Kiss ]

1214
01:26:36,673 --> 01:26:38,801
- Sure, Dad.
- Good night.

1215
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:48,941
Listen, Zack. Uh, sorry about
that whole asshole thing.

1216
01:26:48,983 --> 01:26:51,487
lt's cool.

1217
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:00,625
Are you all right ?

1218
01:27:04,006 --> 01:27:06,134
Jesse told me he heard Dean
talking about how he wanted to--

1219
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:09,639
l just figured it out
a little late is all.

1220
01:27:19,487 --> 01:27:22,617
You know, sexual harassment
is still a big issue these days.

1221
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,620
lt's on my walls downstairs.

1222
01:27:27,624 --> 01:27:29,961
That's why--

1223
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:32,715
why l carry this.

1224
01:27:32,757 --> 01:27:36,095
You push a little button,
and it makes a noise like a foghorn.

1225
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,392
You can hear it
about half a mile away.

1226
01:27:39,475 --> 01:27:42,396
l put it up to his ear.

1227
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:47,404
- l just hope it doesn't
cause any permanent damage.
- [ Chuckles ]

1228
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:58,963
So how long have you
been here anyway ?

1229
01:27:59,005 --> 01:28:00,966
A while.

1230
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:06,432
- You missed your prom ?
- Yeah.

1231
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,944
[ Sighs ] You know, l made that bet
before l knew you, Laney.

1232
01:28:15,196 --> 01:28:17,115
Before l really knew me.

1233
01:28:19,953 --> 01:28:23,541
What was it for anyway ?
l mean, what did you end up losing ?

1234
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:28,090
My best friend.

1235
01:28:30,928 --> 01:28:32,805
She taught me a lot.

1236
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:35,393
Before her,

1237
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,439
l thought we had to have
all the answers right now.

1238
01:28:39,983 --> 01:28:41,944
And now ?

1239
01:28:41,986 --> 01:28:45,908
l'm kind of liking the fact
that l don't.

1240
01:28:49,247 --> 01:28:52,710
So can l have the last dance ?

1241
01:28:56,424 --> 01:28:58,302
No.

1242
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:04,186
You can have the first.

1243
01:29:36,734 --> 01:29:41,659
l feel just like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

1244
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:43,745
You know, except for
the whole hooker thing.

1245
01:29:48,419 --> 01:29:50,463
So... what now ?

1246
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:55,721
l don't know.
Art school. You ?

1247
01:29:55,763 --> 01:29:58,308
l've been kind of thinking
about art school myself.

1248
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,648
- Art ? You don't take art.
- Yeah.

1249
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:06,654
Yeah, but l'm thinkin' more
along the lines of performance art.

1250
01:30:06,738 --> 01:30:09,492
- Be silent, be still. Be silent--
- Zack.

1251
01:30:09,617 --> 01:30:13,331
- What ?
- Shut up.

1252
01:30:30,106 --> 01:30:32,485
- Zack ?
- What ?

1253
01:30:32,526 --> 01:30:34,988
- About the bet.
- Yeah.

1254
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:38,494
- What were the terms, anyway ?
- You'll see.

1255
01:30:38,535 --> 01:30:39,996
l never back out on a bet.

1256
