1
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Let's see what you have there...

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,195
This picture looks scary...

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,228
Everyone ready?

4
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,121
Let's see it.

5
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,665
Do you believe in karma?

6
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,633
Does a snake's mother
drink from a well?

7
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,356
Go drink that well water.

8
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,232
I'm sorry you can't go in.

9
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,884
I'm a relative.

10
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,116
You'll have to help us then.

11
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,310
Grannie doesn't trust me.

12
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,867
Grannie, what are you doing here?

13
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,442
I've been looking everywhere for you.

14
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,069
I've got to go now

15
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,506
or I won't be on time.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,241
Grannie, where are you going?
Grannie!

17
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,304
Grannie!

18
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,550
Grannie!

19
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,108
Wait!

20
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,548
So you're back!
Yes.

21
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,363
Hello Pong.

22
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,265
Let me help you.

23
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,304
Thanks.

24
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,985
Hey Pong what's that
powder outside? It stinks.

25
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,281
It's some herbal powder.

26
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,114
With all the rain lots
of poisonous snakes came out.

27
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,787
Safety first!

28
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,864
Has anyone moved out lately?

29
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,588
We've got a few free rooms.

30
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,348
Oh, I forgot to give you this.

31
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,038
I got you some chocolate.

32
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,752
- For me?
- Yes

33
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,835
I'm very grateful.

34
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
Make sure you eat all of them.

35
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,195
I will.

36
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,147
Just wait for the lift, please.

37
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,070
Thank you.

38
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,944
Shit, this is just no good.

39
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,347
I think that song
we played yesterday was OK.

40
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,913
Like the rehearsal.

41
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,905
Guys

42
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,119
Someone's complained
about loud music in your room.

43
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,435
So can't you make
it a little quieter?

44
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,665
Come on let's go.

45
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,599
Fuck him!

46
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,316
When we rehearse it has to be noisy!

47
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,401
Yeah, how can we make it quieter?

48
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,198
I'm not deaf and dumb.

49
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
The phone's broken again.

50
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,039
We can't get online either.

51
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,263
There's the security guard.

52
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Hey guard what's wrong with the phone?

53
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,147
Did you call the repairman yet?

54
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,706
I've called already and
he's coming this evening.

55
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,760
What floor, please?

56
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,641
7 please.

57
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,276
Hold on.

58
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,023
Thanks.

59
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,188
What kind of costume is that?

60
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,593
An angel.

61
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,195
Wait please!

62
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,789
Hi, Nho?

63
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,583
I'm on the way.

64
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,152
I forgot something.

65
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,184
Yes ma'am.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,787
Hey guys, didn't it say in the
news there were more than this?

67
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,479
That's right but

68
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,625
they've all gone away.

69
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,506
These are all I could catch.

70
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,154
These snakes look dangerous.

71
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,117
Yeah, I know what you mean.

72
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,026
They've come out because of the rain.

73
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,270
Hey Wit, be careful.

74
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,909
Well, will you go with me?

75
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,153
You've been here already.

76
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,910
Where to?

77
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
What are you doing here?

78
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,037
Someone told me that loads
of people got snakebites here.

79
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,473
Not one.

80
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,036
The only thing is someone
complained their phone is broken.

81
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,151
Could you please check?

82
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,114
You can go I don't
need you for anything.

83
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,747
What's going on Nin.

84
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,640
Somebody's said there were
a lot of snakebites here.

85
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,627
And they need help quickly.

86
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,762
In our building?

87
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,638
I put herbs all around the building already.

88
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,833
There shouldn't be any problems.

89
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,547
Believe me for you own good.

90
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,913
Because if what was in the news is true

91
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,441
it could be really dangerous here.

92
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,434
You better just leave.

93
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,904
Dead.

94
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,869
Dead already.

95
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,185
Grannie Pai.

96
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,434
Dead already.

97
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,203
Pai, who's dead?

98
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,281
Hey Pong, you and Chit stay here.

99
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,193
Never mind Grannie.

100
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,185
Pong, take care of everything here.

101
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,595
Yes I'll click the lift button for you.

102
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,674
Is it true, sir?

103
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,835
Yes it's true, cobras.

104
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,304
Go on, check.

105
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,669
Cobras?

106
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,026
He went out already.

107
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,349
He said that

108
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,598
he went to see his friend.

109
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,188
I'll have to put up with it.

110
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,119
Three to nothing.
You've lost again.

111
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,752
Today did you beat me or not?

112
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,864
So are you cheating?

113
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,143
Cheat what?

114
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,711
You lose all the time and say
that I've cheated...

115
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,029
I don't need to play you anymore.

116
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,791
Hey Thang come play with me.

117
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,114
Hey you can take my turn.

118
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,160
Can you go look at him?

119
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,504
You go, you lost!

120
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,783
You go look at him!

121
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,264
You order me around all the time.

122
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,868
Hey Thang what are you doing?

123
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,745
This is in real time. Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,598
Just let me see a little bit.

125
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,951
Get away! Get away! Get away!

126
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,280
I made that hole so let me look!

127
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,025
Move it!

128
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,792
What the fuck!

129
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,023
Aren't you gonna play?

130
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,392
Both of you,
you're only interested in sex!

131
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,066
Nobody answered.

132
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,602
That's the last room.

133
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,116
So it must be the right one.

134
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,123
You'd better take me up there.

135
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,602
Of course, follow me.

136
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,721
Where are you going?

137
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,748
I know the room.

138
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,669
Let me go too.

139
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,384
That's not necessary.

140
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,710
There's someone here to see you anyway.

141
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,200
I want to go too.

142
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,636
Go on, go talk to him.

143
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,388
How are you?

144
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,148
Why do you care?

145
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,385
Can't we speak in a civilized manner?

146
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,264
So when I was in a good
mood where were you?

147
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,760
- I don't understand.
- It's not that you don't understand!

148
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,023
It's because you never have the feeling.

149
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,628
Hey, you said it wouldn't be long.

150
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,150
Where's Chai?

151
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,283
Hold on a minute, he went upstairs.

152
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,069
Wait again?

153
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,865
Run! Run! Run!

154
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,185
Run! Run!

155
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,669
Officer Pong!

156
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,921
What's the matter, what happened?

157
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,840
Where's Chai.

158
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,160
On the third floor.

159
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,395
What's going on up there?

160
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,835
I'm not sure. I heard some
noise so I went to look.

161
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,543
Nin, Wit, you two stay down here!

162
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,311
Don't go anywhere!

163
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,264
I'm going too.

164
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,196
No you're not!

165
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,907
This is my apartment you know?

166
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,401
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

167
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,440
Wit stay here! Don't move!

168
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,824
Hurry up!

169
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,156
Chai!

170
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,025
Stop!

171
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,590
Don't come in here.

172
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,954
What's going on Chai?

173
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,944
Hurry up Nin!

174
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,921
Fast!

175
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,948
Hey Chai! Chai!

176
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,681
Chai!

177
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,309
Help me!

178
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,949
Be calm! Be calm!

179
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Please help me!

180
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,823
Help me!

181
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,563
- Be calm!
- Help me please!

182
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,911
Hold on I'll be back!

183
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,228
Help me!

184
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,593
Please help me!

185
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,923
Chai!

186
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,195
- Be strong
- Open your eyes, Chai!

187
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,240
Be strong! Hold on!

188
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,354
Chai how do you feel?

189
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,551
Chai!

190
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,269
Wake up!

191
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,990
Hurry!

192
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,321
Is there anyone else there?

193
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,823
Come on hurry up!

194
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,148
How come you look so shocked?

195
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,303
Run! Run!

196
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,403
Wit!

197
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,990
Wit!

198
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,796
Wit!

199
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,911
Wit!

200
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,985
Please!

201
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,789
Look at Chai first!

202
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,468
Chai!

203
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,665
Hey! Chai! Chai!

204
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,482
Chai!

205
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,830
Chai!

206
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,663
Mom!

207
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,353
- Get out of the way!
- I haven't seen anything yet!

208
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,203
Come on let me look!

209
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,072
What are you doing?

210
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,561
Shit!

211
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,161
I'm sick of this.

212
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,557
You want it again,
Hia?

213
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,278
I itch, Hia.

214
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,754
Hia.

215
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,110
What's that noise?

216
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,720
What the fuck is going on?

217
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,590
What is it?

218
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,149
What's wrong?

219
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,675
- Joop!
- Aek!

220
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,478
Joop!

221
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,393
Hey Tang!

222
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,074
It's a snake!

223
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,390
Aek!

224
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,762
Aek!

225
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,959
Tang, Tang, where are you?

226
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,228
Snake!

227
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,991
It won't close!

228
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,401
Mae!

229
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,193
What the fuck is that?
Help me! Help me!

230
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,877
Mae! Help me! Help me!

231
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,710
Help me!

232
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,267
Choop go!

233
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,199
I'm your friend!

234
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,160
Can't you let me
get in there too?

235
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,403
Oh, was that the house in
the news for the snakes?

236
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,992
Oh yeah, it's just near here!

237
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,323
Sure thing. I'll get over there,
get the story and send it to you fast!

238
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,591
Choop! Choop!

239
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,083
Help me!

240
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,153
Help me! Help me!

241
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,470
You've gotta help me and my friend!

242
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,788
Hey you!

243
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,189
Choop.

244
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,751
Help me!

245
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,029
Help me!

246
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,910
Run! Fast!

247
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,762
Chai!

248
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,424
Chai!

249
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,876
Chai!

250
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,145
Choop! Choop!
Don't pass out, wake up!

251
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,625
Why did you press up?
Don't you want to go down?

252
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,384
We can't go down!

253
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,310
Why not?

254
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,073
There's nothing but snakes down there.
Do you want to die?

255
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,038
Nong, don't sleep!

256
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,601
Go take care of your friend!

257
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,744
Wake up!

258
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,236
Wit?

259
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,669
Don't sleep, Choop!

260
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,199
Wake up! Wake up!

261
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
Nho... The whole building is full of snakes!

262
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,200
Is there anyone wounded?
Yes, someone's been bitten behind me.

263
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,065
Take a picture?

264
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,185
Don't pass out! Wake up!

265
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,118
- You want me to take a picture?
- I told you to wake up!

266
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,003
Did you get a chance to get any news?

267
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,323
Don't you want to be a reporter?

268
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,232
I just escaped with my life.

269
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,823
Hurry up! Send us a report!

270
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,872
Choop, wake up!

271
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,514
Choop, wake up!

272
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,436
Wake up!

273
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,423
Choop!

274
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,430
Wit!

275
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,722
Wit!

276
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,841
Brother!

277
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,745
Wit!

278
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,990
Brother!

279
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,200
- Brother
- Is that you Wit?

280
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,910
Hurry up!

281
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,473
Help me! Help me!

282
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,434
Hold my hand!

283
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,513
Brother, I'll help!

284
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,357
Hey help my friend!

285
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,471
My friend's been bitten by the snake!

286
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,470
Move!

287
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,264
Where?

288
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,514
On his leg.

289
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,269
Open your eyes!

290
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,668
Choop be strong, hold on!

291
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,078
Take your shirt off fast!

292
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,641
If we don't get him to
a hospital soon he won't make it!

293
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,116
Anybody got a phone?

294
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,150
I've got one!

295
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,267
I hope you're OK!

296
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,983
No signal!

297
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,913
Anyone got another one?

298
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,481
Shit!

299
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,915
Help me!

300
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,226
Snakes! Snakes!

301
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,026
The whole room is full of them!

302
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,162
It's not one room,
it's every room on every floor!

303
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,641
They're coming up from downstairs!

304
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,999
Where did they come from?

305
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,118
How come you let them get up here!

306
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,306
You know one of my
friends is dead already!

307
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,867
So what do you want to do now?

308
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,561
Don't move!

309
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,992
We'd better find a
way to get upstairs.

310
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,041
Mae!

311
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,590
I don't think I can make it.

312
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,596
Be strong. Come on.

313
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,444
Pai, we discussed this before didn't we?

314
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,273
Don't bother, let me do it my way!

315
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,230
No way!

316
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,880
If it's like this then who
would want to rent a room?

317
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,720
How does he feel now?

318
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
It looks pretty bad.

319
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,710
Grannie.

320
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,113
It's just karma.

321
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,475
You have to beg God for forgiveness.

322
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,714
We can't keep making
mistakes again and again.

323
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,063
Pornapha.

324
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,754
Pornapha.

325
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,274
Don't you understand?

326
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,470
Your daughter has bad karma.

327
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,032
I've made enough merit already.

328
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,511
I can take care of my kid.

329
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,560
You'd better look after yourself first.

330
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,594
Grannie, enough of this crap.

331
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,307
I can manage it myself.

332
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,904
Nin, are you keeping some secret from me?

333
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,824
It's not important.

334
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,762
Sorry, Chook.

335
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,469
Where are you going?

336
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,387
Chai, the serum's in my bag.

337
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,754
I'll go get it.

338
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,319
I'll go with you.

339
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,543
Then what about here?

340
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,625
Let's look for something
to block the way in.

341
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,784
Come on!

342
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,403
That should do the trick.

343
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,072
I'll get Chai's bag.

344
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,672
Then I'm coming, maybe I can help.

345
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,388
Hey Wit, no need to come.
Stay here.

346
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,160
No need to go.

347
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,026
The you're leaving me here?

348
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,263
No matter what when we leave
here we're all going together.

349
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,956
OK, brother.

350
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,157
Come on.

351
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,586
Just hang in there.

352
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,514
It hurts, it hurts so much.

353
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,310
Mae, I can't make it, I can't make it.

354
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,785
Just hang in there.

355
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,872
Just cut my leg off, Mae.

356
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,758
Are you nuts?

357
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,913
There's only way I can survive
You've gotta cut it off.

358
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,002
No way! I won't do it!

359
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,150
Please!

360
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,315
No!

361
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,908
- Like this I'm gonna die.
- No

362
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,467
You have to help me.

363
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,475
I won't do it!

364
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,393
- You've gotta cut it off, cut it off!
- I'm not gonna do it!

365
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,034
- I won't do it!
- You have to help me!

366
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,638
You have to help me.

367
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,678
You have to help me.

368
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,633
Help me, Mae!

369
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,472
So tell me, where will you move to?

370
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,560
I'm not sure yet.

371
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,023
I'm worried about you.

372
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,358
You should spend more
time worrying about your job.

373
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,953
I can take care of myself.

374
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,640
So I'm wrong?
The way I work, eh Nin?

375
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,755
No you're not wrong.

376
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,826
Your job just takes up all our time!

377
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,904
Never mind,

378
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,364
because the only thing
I need you can't give me!

379
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,999
Nin, you've changed too much!

380
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,432
I haven't changed at all!

381
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,561
Yes ma'am.

382
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,675
Where are you?

383
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,873
I'm in the building.

384
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,672
So how come you haven't
sent the pictures yet?

385
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,263
There's snakes.

386
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,512
Are you scared of snakes or getting fired?
No matter what you have to send them!

387
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,143
Hey, it looks worse than we thought!

388
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,190
Look at this!

389
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,308
Call the cops!

390
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,790
Not yet.

391
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,798
Wait until she sends some more.

392
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,999
What are you staring at?
Work!

393
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,063
The gods!

394
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,523
They have to be pissed off!

395
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,561
We have to pray for mercy.
Please have mercy.

396
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,390
This is bullshit, begging to snake gods!

397
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,712
They have them for sure.

398
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,548
I already made a spirit house.

399
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,398
If you have no respect for them,
you'll die a horrible death.

400
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,550
Do you mean the spirit house
outside the building?

401
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,153
You've all lost your minds!
This is 2010!

402
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,758
Dad's here!

403
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,028
Dad!

404
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,800
Where have you been?

405
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,744
Run! Fast!

406
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,710
Snakes!

407
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,238
The snakes are marching in!

408
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,073
Come on! Move it!

409
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,503
Fast!

410
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,955
What's going on?

411
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,184
Nothing.

412
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,311
Come on move! Fast!

413
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,874
Hurry up!

414
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,144
Hurry up!

415
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,921
Come on!

416
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,516
Blood!

417
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,436
Mae!

418
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,115
The lift's here!

419
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,748
Come on let's get out of here!

420
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,226
Get in! Get the baby in there!

421
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,440
Come on Grannie!

422
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,036
The door won't close!

423
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,996
Come on close!

424
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,073
Lift, damn you close!

425
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,909
Close!

426
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,515
Oh man, close!

427
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,747
Close!

428
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,394
Why won't it close!

429
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,913
Can't you do something?

430
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,755
Open it!

431
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,469
Open it!

432
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,633
Don't leave me!

433
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,029
Open it!

434
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,680
Open it!

435
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,959
Don't leave me!

436
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,944
Open it!

437
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,041
Open it!

438
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,640
Open it!

439
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,676
Don't leave me! Open it!

440
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,145
Open it! Open it!

441
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,040
Don't leave me!

442
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,596
Hello? Hello, is that the Police?

443
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,840
Are you there?

444
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,560
Hello, hello!

445
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,675
Oh shit!

446
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,827
Where the hell are they?

447
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,790
Wit!

448
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,185
Wit!

449
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,824
Wit!

450
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,670
What are you doing?

451
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,069
We'd better get out of here!

452
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,720
What's going on?

453
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,240
It looks like there's
someone in that room.

454
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,035
Who's that?

455
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,029
Wit, don't!

456
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,550
Wit!

457
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,921
Grannie!

458
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,401
Grannie!

459
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,633
I'm glad everyone's still here.

460
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,829
Where's my brother?

461
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,879
Where are you going?

462
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,592
I'm gonna find my brother?

463
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,635
Wait a minute!

464
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,831
Help my baby a snake's bitten her!

465
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,234
Gif, my baby!

466
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,515
Gif!

467
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,677
Gif!

468
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,722
Gif, my child!

469
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,556
How is she Doctor?

470
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,160
Her leg's bitten!

471
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,802
Gif!

472
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,625
Gif! Gif!

473
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,400
How many bottles of
serum have you got?

474
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,722
Two.

475
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,023
Then give my kid one, please.

476
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,001
Please!

477
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,200
Hold it! If you give that kid one then

478
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,708
what about the rest?

479
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,870
How can you talk like that?

480
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,313
Can't you see my kid's dying!

481
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,833
Relax, everybody!

482
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,435
I'll be right be back!

483
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,795
Doctor, Doctor, where are you going?

484
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,194
You didn't give my kid a shot yet!

485
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,554
Right now your kid's still OK.

486
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,760
I'll be right be back!

487
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,748
Doctor please give her
the shot first and then go!

488
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,148
Please give the shot first!

489
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,918
Just relax, I'll be right back!

490
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,035
Give the shot first!

491
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,673
Can't you give my kid the shot first?

492
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,990
Can't you help us first?

493
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,916
Take it easy! Take it easy!

494
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,760
Where are you going give her the shot first!

495
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,273
Can't you just relax?

496
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,913
You're all selfish!

497
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,431
You know you're all making bad karma!

498
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,560
Don't you know it will all
come back on you.

499
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,516
Stop!

500
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,668
Give my daughter the shot

501
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,394
or else I'll shoot you!

502
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,993
Drop the gun!

503
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,912
Don't do anything rash!

504
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,269
Stop!

505
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,069
I beg you!

506
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,548
Mon, don't!

507
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,705
Mon, don't do it, drop the gun!

508
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,623
Mon, drop the gun!

509
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,508
Good, kill yourself then!

510
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,632
Then we won't waste the serum!

511
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,469
I'm sorry!

512
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,547
I had to do it for my baby!

513
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,110
I told you give my kid the shot now!

514
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,764
I'll kill you all one by one!

515
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,863
Help!

516
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,313
Help!

517
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,190
Pai!

518
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,115
Pai!

519
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,344
Pai!

520
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,904
It may hurt a bit
but after she'll be OK.

521
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,795
Thank you very much.

522
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,708
Thank you.

523
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,464
Help!

524
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,943
Help!

525
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,440
Help! Wit! Help!

526
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,190
Don't open it, Doctor!

527
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,224
Get out of the way!

528
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,882
Help!

529
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,750
Help!

530
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,543
Help!

531
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,864
Help!

532
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,234
I'll shoot you for sure!

533
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,235
You're gonna shoot me?

534
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,230
Help!

535
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,784
Help!

536
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,271
Help! Wit! Help!

537
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,389
Help!

538
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,155
Help!

539
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,269
Where's Wit?

540
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,023
Where's Wit?

541
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,668
Where's Wit?

542
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,190
Are you OK? Mon?

543
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,109
What's with you?

544
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,264
Hey, you've been bitten.

545
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,385
What's wrong? Let me see it!

546
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,481
Doctor, have you got any more serum?

547
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,986
There's only one more.
Do you need another?

548
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,641
Hey, how can you say that?

549
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,466
You see, my wife looks terrible!

550
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,190
Mon!

551
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,386
Doctor, give her a shot! Please!

552
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,629
Just a second.

553
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,264
Hurry up, Doctor!

554
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,881
Just a second. Take it easy!

555
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,637
Hey! Where are you going?
Come back!

556
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,764
Hey you! Stop!

557
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,160
Don't follow me!

558
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,715
Give me that serum!

559
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,944
Don't touch me!

560
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,240
Give me that serum!

561
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,947
Don't touch me!

562
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,948
- Let go of me!
- Give it to me!

563
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,604
Let go!

564
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,954
What the fuck have you done?

565
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,467
It's not my fault!

566
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,391
All of you stop staring at me!

567
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,066
You all look just like me anyway!

568
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,505
You don't realize what you're doing!

569
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,943
I'm not wrong!

570
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,704
Don't come near me!

571
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:09,918
Hold it!

572
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,353
Don't touch me!

573
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,082
Move it!

574
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,400
Fast... fast!

575
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,425
Mon!

576
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,201
Mon!

577
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,196
Mon!

578
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,314
Mon, hang in there!

579
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,596
Mom, don't die!

580
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,904
What's with you?

581
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,107
Can't you do anything?

582
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,561
Are you a Doctor or not? Do something.

583
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,430
Get out of my way!

584
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,241
You!

585
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:31,876
It's not true!

586
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,274
It's not true, Mon!

587
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,028
Hang in there!

588
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,679
Don't worry, dear.

589
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,084
Mom!

590
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,479
Mon! Mon!

591
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,719
Mom!

592
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,467
I'm not staying here!
I'm going downstairs!

593
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,948
Are you crazy!

594
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,640
Haven't you seen it?
There's only snakes down there.

595
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,233
Don't you care about your kid?

596
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,954
We've got to get away
from here or we'll die!

597
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,067
So you want down there then?

598
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,080
Don't cry!

599
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,589
This is my kid and I'll protect her myself!

600
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,274
Don't worry darling!

601
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,000
There got to be a way for
us to get out of here.

602
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,983
There must be a way.

603
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,225
You!

604
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,200
Don't worry darling.

605
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,241
You!

606
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,064
Where did you see Wit?

607
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,241
In there.

608
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:06,997
Wit!

609
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,876
Wit!

610
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,882
Wit!

611
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:12,996
Wit!

612
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,904
Don't go up there!

613
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,830
Stop!

614
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:39,803
Wit!

615
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,750
Don't go up there!

616
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,943
- Wit
- Don't go up there!

617
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,147
I'm telling you don't go up there!

618
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:46,916
Wit!

619
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,311
Wit!

620
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,998
I told you don't go!

621
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,265
Wit!

622
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,916
Wit!

623
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,158
- Don't go!
- Wit!

624
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,063
Don't go!

625
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,440
What the hell is going on here!

626
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,467
Is this what you're hiding from me?

627
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,117
What's the meaning of this, Grannie?

628
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,270
Wit!

629
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,116
Wit!

630
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,631
Wit!

631
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,028
Get it off!

632
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,076
Wit!

633
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,228
Wit!

634
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,521
Don't! Wit!

635
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,881
Wit!

636
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,545
Wit!

637
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,903
Wit! Don't!

638
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,395
Wit!

639
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,076
Wit!

640
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,351
Wit!

641
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,544
Wit!

642
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,272
Are you just going to leave me here?

643
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,800
No matter what we have
to leave here together.

644
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,504
Yes sir.

645
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,307
What the fuck happened?

646
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,000
I don't know! It's not my fault!

647
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,280
I didn't do it!

648
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,396
You didn't do it, eh?

649
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,431
Let go! Let go!

650
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,520
It's not Grannie's fault!

651
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,838
You've gotta believe us!

652
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,320
Believe you?

653
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,511
My brother's dead!

654
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,108
How can I believe you?

655
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,869
I didn't do it!

656
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,063
Stop!

657
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,624
Don't go!

658
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,673
Don't go!

659
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,704
Grannie!

660
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,470
Nin!

661
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,824
Let go of me!

662
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,510
Come on!

663
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,159
No! No!

664
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,316
No!

665
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,276
No!

666
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,474
No!

667
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,561
Please forgive all of us!

668
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,433
Grannie!

669
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,625
Nin!

670
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,425
What's...

671
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,558
Hey, what's that over there?

672
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,346
What's over there?

673
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,073
What's that?

674
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,231
You! You!

675
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,784
Where are you?

676
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,400
Mom!

677
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,076
Mom, relax!

678
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,870
Mom!

679
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,629
Grannie!

680
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,712
I can't.
It's payback time for the snakes!

681
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,512
They're not going to forgive us.

682
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,878
A tattoo is the
only protection from fate!

683
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,427
It's karma!

684
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,838
No!

685
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,507
No!

686
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:03,269
No matter what,
you can never escape your karma!

687
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,873
Mom!

688
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,042
Nin!

689
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,789
Nin!

690
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,784
Nin!

691
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,066
Tell me, how do you
think you survived?

692
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,910
From a miracle or from luck?

693
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,196
Do you believe in the law of Karma?

694
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,224
I believe that if I had used my life

695
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,473
to help anyone else stay alive

696
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,431
then I'd still be alive now.

697
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,150
So in the future, what will you do?

698
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:29,067
I'll develop the serum professionally

699
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,436
so that it helps those
who may need it.

700
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,512
Thank you very much.
You've made the correct decision.

701
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,709
No problem.

702
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:47,040
I only want to do what's best.

703
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,987
Just one life can save many lives,
that's invaluable.

704
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,270
You can never decide
who should survive or

705
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,507
who's good or who's bad.

706
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,908
But you have to decide

707
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,080
what you think is right.

708
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,479
Only that will help you find
the correct path to follow.

709
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,989
Darling.

710
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,709
Nin.

711
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,236
Nin.

712
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,000
How many bottles of serum have you got left?

713
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,001
Two.

714
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:30,914
How could the Doctor survive?

715
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,883
This is unbelievable.

716
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,026
So how do all of you know
this is a true story?

717
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,519
It's true.

718
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,640
It's not important.

719
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,562
We can sell this news anyway.
Right?
