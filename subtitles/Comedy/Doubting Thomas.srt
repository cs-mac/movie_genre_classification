1
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:26,467
My name is Odd Thomas.

2
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:30,256
Though in this age when fame is the
altar at which most people worship.

3
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,765
I'm not sure why you should care.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,219
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not the child of a celebrity.

5
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,009
I've never been married to,
abused by,

6
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:37,764
or provided a kidney to a celebrity.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,093
Green Moon Bowling.

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,262
But I do lead an unusual life.

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,856
Penny Kalisto.

10
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:08,074
My name really is Odd.

11
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,485
According to my mother, it was
a screw-up on my birth certificate.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,861
She says I was supposed to be called
Todd, after a Lithuanian uncle.

13
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,542
My father insists my name
was always Odd...

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,827
and he notes that all of
my uncles are Bulgarian.

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,101
My father claims
my mother is insane.

16
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:26,872
My mother, of course,
begs to differ.

17
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:32,795
My abilities are a gift from God!

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,510
My father won that argument.

19
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,429
I was 12 years old when they finally
locked her up and threw away the key.

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,604
I've come to believe that
my mother and I share certain...

21
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,119
abilities.

22
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,865
Since I don't want to be locked up
with the key thrown away...

23
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,029
I've pretty much kept mine a secret.

24
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,421
Odd Thomas.

25
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:08,846
Hello, Harlo.

26
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,431
Long time, no see.

27
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,386
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Come on, man. No touchy, no feely.

28
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,463
- Sorry, but I love this car.
- I know.

29
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:19,505
It's too bad a car
can't love you back.

30
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,374
What's wrong, Odd?
There anything I can do?

31
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,603
No, it's something
you've already done.

32
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,584
Hey! Hey! Come on-oh, Odd.
No fooling around, man.

33
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,727
- Give me my keys.
- Her blood is in your pocket.

34
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,948
Most people would think
that's a weird thing to say...

35
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,197
but you don't think
it's very weird, do you, Harlo?

36
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:46,331
On that night...

37
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:50,300
you took a piece of white felt...

38
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,225
and after killing Penny...

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,971
you collected some of her blood.

40
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:57,022
And now it's dry...

41
00:02:57,057 --> 00:03:00,806
and stiff and
brittle like a cracker...

42
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:05,394
and it's still in your pocket.

43
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,826
In moments like these,
pity tears at me.

44
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,503
And a kind of madness
comes over me...

45
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,249
forcing me to hunt people
like Harlo Landerson...

46
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,199
who I have no pity for whatsoever.

47
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,598
Sorry, Mrs. Curtees!

48
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:48,062
Sorry, Saleen!

49
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,189
What the hell are you doing?

50
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:25,396
Mom, what's going on?

51
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,528
Stevie, run honey, run!

52
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,113
Come here!

53
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,714
My life is filled with guys
like Harlo Landerson.

54
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:58,346
And since I like my face
just the way it is...

55
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,263
I learned how to handle myself.

56
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,535
I may see dead people, but then,
by God, I do something about it.

57
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:25,220
Hey. Hey!

58
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,180
Shift down, man! Go easy.

59
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:30,133
I'm sorry, sir,
but I don't have a "go easy" gear.

60
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,055
You should probably get that looked at.

61
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,605
Now, Officer Eckles...

62
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,731
does being a police officer

63
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,434
give you the right to beat
the shit out of people?

64
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,068
Not at all, Officer Varner.

65
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,095
But it is one of
the perks of the job.

66
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:51,316
I believe in a higher power
and the afterlife.

67
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,866
Call me strange.

68
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,128
Others do.

69
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,037
He's so strange.

70
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:02,759
Don't worry, Penny.

71
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:06,214
I think where you're going
is a home for the spirit...

72
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,880
and it's filled with
kindness and wonder.

73
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,885
I'm sorry, Penny.

74
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,004
I'm sorry your life was so short.

75
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,229
The dead don't talk.

76
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,148
I don't know why.

77
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,045
Here we are again.

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,331
Busted furniture and
shattered glass everywhere.

79
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,345
Most of it was not my fault.

80
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,779
Except the panda bear lamp
and the Biffy the Clown mirror.

81
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:51,143
- That was this guy.
- Why didn't you come to me first..

82
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,016
give me a chance to find a way
to get Harlo to entrap himself?

83
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,149
Whenever we do it that way,

84
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:58,311
it's always more efficient
and less destructive.

85
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,438
Yes, I know but he had
to be stopped right now...

86
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,645
or he was gonna do it again soon.

87
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,861
That's what Penny wanted to tell me.
That's why she hadn't left yet.

88
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:09,312
Son, you so complicate my life.

89
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,362
Look.

90
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,253
Besides her blood...

91
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:20,251
Harlo had these photos of Penny
post-mortem in his wallet.

92
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,042
If there's any fuss about
how you pegged Harlo...

93
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,798
just say he opened up
his wallet to pay off a bet.

94
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,593
Five bucks on
yesterday's Dodger's game...

95
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,753
the photos fell out,
you saw em-

96
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:32,878
He ran and naturally,
I gave chase.

97
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,760
Naturally.

98
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,510
Save me!

99
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:32,167
Save us!

100
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:34,141
- Save.
- Us!

101
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:36,065
- Save..
- Us!

102
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,955
Save you from who?

103
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:41,789
Who is that?

104
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,213
Who is it?

105
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,623
Evil is coming.

106
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,382
And it's up to me to figure out
who's gonna be holding the gun.

107
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:29,886
Morning, Elvis.

108
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:31,604
Pico Mundo Grill.

109
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,273
So much of my life
is out of my control.

110
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,853
I would have gone 7 kinds of
crazy if I hadn't simplified.

111
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:40,524
So I have no motorized vehicles,
no homeownership...

112
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,527
no insurance,
and no grand ambitions.

113
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,689
Ladies.

114
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,620
Eggs! Wreck em and stretch em!

115
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:49,283
"Wreck em" means scrambled,
and "stretch em" means...

116
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:50,499
add an extra egg.

117
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:51,959
Cardiac shingles and hash browns!

118
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:55,122
"Cardiac shingles"
are toast with lots of butter.

119
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,850
And hash browns...

120
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,508
are just hash browns.

121
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:01,247
Not every word
we use is diner lingo.

122
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,138
Just as not every short-order cook

123
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:08,345
is an undercover detective
for dead people.

124
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,803
Duck.

125
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:19,154
That is Stormy Lewellyn.

126
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:23,686
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

127
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:32,112
You are destined
to be together forever.

128
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,661
Hey, Chief.
Tummy Tickler coming at ya.

129
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:44,132
You know, I'm still not happy
about what you did yesterday, Oddie.

130
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,384
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

131
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,060
I am not afraid of death.

132
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,586
Of course, I'm not ready to go
on a date with him, either.

133
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,731
Would you throw yourself
off a cliff for me?

134
00:10:58,766 --> 00:10:59,614
Of course I would.

135
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,485
Into a river of razor blades
and lemon juice?

136
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,701
Absolutely.

137
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:06,114
Of course, I'd like to know
the reasoning behind such a request..

138
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,164
but, fortunately for me...

139
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,536
you reek of intelligence
and integrity.

140
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,830
And you reek of peach shampoo.

141
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:16,238
Just the way I like you.

142
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,635
- Chief.
- Morning, Stormy.

143
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,964
What's with
the cat-ate-the-canary smile?

144
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,838
Tonight is date night.

145
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,880
So you think you're
gonna get yourself some, huh?

146
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:30,222
- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
- Stormy Special.

147
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,299
- Girlfriend.
- Morning, dude.

148
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,877
I call them bodachs.

149
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,545
Well, not to their faces, I hope.

150
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,953
I never met anybody
that could see em before.

151
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,878
- Neither have I.
- Everyone told me it's in my head.

152
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,463
Well, you should stop
telling everyone.

153
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,096
I tried telling my parents.

154
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,674
If I told my parents,
I'd ve spent my whole life...

155
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,567
picking winning lottery numbers.

156
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:07,425
You can pick winning lotto numbers?

157
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,682
- No, I can't. Stay on point.
- Right. Yeah.

158
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,810
Yesterday, when I finally saw one...

159
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,979
I gave him the finger, Homes.

160
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,404
Don't you know?

161
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:20,974
If they find out you can see them,
they will kill you.

162
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,236
They will kill you.

163
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,039
- Little advice?
- Yeah?

164
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,042
Karla prefers chocolate to flowers

165
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:11,579
and you should get
yourself some candles.

166
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:12,610
Candles?

167
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,700
Thanks. Good idea.

168
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:21,972
Whew, close.

169
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,675
That would have been
a little awkward.

170
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,132
You two are really something.

171
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,520
I don't know what, but something.

172
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,058
We're weird and screwed up
but we're okay.

173
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,303
I don't know.

174
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:33,977
You are...

175
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,445
so cool.

176
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,151
So, you deny me my weirdness,
but agree that I'm screwed up?

177
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,784
You're right.
I see your problem.

178
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,113
Weirdness, it can be fun.
It can be kind of cool.

179
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:47,867
Screwed-up-ness, not so much.

180
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:50,655
You are quite weird.

181
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,459
- Apology accepted.
- I gotta go. Be good, you two.

182
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:58,086
It's not me you have to worry about.

183
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,415
Don't I know it.

184
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,258
I gotta go to work, too, Oddie.

185
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,546
- Okay.
- Later, my love.

186
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,434
Stormy!

187
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,942
Miss you already.

188
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,624
- Living up to his name.
- Every damn day.

189
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:34,869
Later.

190
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,046
Months often pass
when I don't see a single bodach.

191
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:39,971
When they do show up...

192
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:43,134
it's a sure sign that carnage
and bloodshed are not far behind.

193
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:44,017
Morning.

194
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,258
They don't cause it.
They feed on it.

195
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:50,506
The more bodachs that show up,
the bigger the eventual feast.

196
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:55,438
They're attracted to evil
like bees to flowers.

197
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,941
They know when death is coming
and want to watch.

198
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:00,284
They don't show up
for any ordinary death.

199
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,613
They want extreme,
operatic violence and terror.

200
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:09,704
Penny Kalisto's death
wasn't horrific enough...

201
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,452
to bring a single bodach
into our world.

202
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,123
This town is in serious trouble.

203
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,385
- Bye, Oddie.
- See you, ladies.

204
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,259
Nicolina! Levanna!

205
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:31,804
Odd, am I really sucking
at this whole "mother" thing?

206
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,321
Well, considering their
last one was a junkie...

207
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,983
who left them in your lap
when you were barely 18...

208
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:41,612
I think you rather rock, Vi.

209
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:42,643
See you later.

210
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,123
I'm heading this way, too.

211
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,514
Gonna go see Madame Pearl,
get myself read.

212
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,836
Personally,
I don't believe people who say...

213
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:52,999
they can read minds or palms
and, trust me, tea leaves...

214
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,716
just cloggage
in the garbage disposal.

215
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:57,796
It's just I had this dream
last night you would not believe.

216
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,550
Well, anything short of
a 9-alarm massacre, I can top.

217
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,255
I'd never seen myself face-on
in a dream before.

218
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,021
You saw your own face?

219
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:10,601
Me and this guy, we were
both lying dead all busted up...

220
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,306
like we'd been shot
to pieces or something.

221
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,702
You know, I wouldn't worry
about it, Vi.

222
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,813
I mean, have any of
your dreams ever come true?

223
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,903
No.

224
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,245
I know most people think
you're just quirky or weird, Odd...

225
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,330
except Stormy who thinks
angels fly out of your butt.

226
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,082
But I know there's more to it.

227
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,632
You have a secret.

228
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,592
You're either a clairvoyant...

229
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,887
a psychic, a seer,
a soothsayer, or something.

230
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,132
Or you got yourself some juice
with a higher power.

231
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,015
And I need to know.

232
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,924
Tell me the truth now, Odd.

233
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,837
Do you see death in me?

234
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,563
No. No, all I see
is my own insensitivity...

235
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:57,015
and a long,
happy life for you, okay?

236
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:04,611
Hey, Vi, the the dead guy
in your dream, what was he wearing?

237
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,327
Wearing? I don't know.

238
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:09,587
Oh! Wait. Yeah...

239
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:14,118
a red and black shirt with
black bowling balls on it.

240
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,928
One of my stranger abilities is
that when I need to find someone...

241
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:26,479
like right now, the creepy
guy in the diner,

242
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:30,477
I can randomly wander around, and
pretty quickly, I'll run into him.

243
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:32,885
This is a talent for
which I have no name.

244
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:36,108
Stormy calls it psychic magnetism.

245
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:38,701
Super Summer Sale.

246
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:41,620
That's Tom Jedd.
He was my little league coach.

247
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:45,826
Been hanging around Tire World for
years, although I don't know why.

248
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,204
His death was not caused
by a defective tire.

249
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:51,953
Such a beautiful girl-

250
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:01,468
There is something about
a dead man trying to get a laugh...

251
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,544
that just bugs me.

252
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,933
Perhaps because it suggests
that even in death...

253
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,851
we still have a pathetic
need to be liked.

254
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:15,439
As well as the ever-present
ability to humiliate ourselves.

255
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:19,813
Where are you?

256
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,653
Where are you?

257
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,361
MANAGER Stormy.

258
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:37,631
When I finally have my own shop,
no stupid uniforms.

259
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,134
I think you look adorable.

260
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,086
Adorable? Really?

261
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,003
Puppies are adorable.

262
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,870
Why are you here so early?
You missing me?

263
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:50,686
Always.
But I'm here looking for a guy.

264
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:51,486
A creepy guy.

265
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:55,275
Well, with you,
there can be no other kind.

266
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,809
My psychic magnetism
brought me here.

267
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,411
- That guy?
- That guy.

268
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,792
You are better than a bloodhound.

269
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,044
What is that thing on his head?

270
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,052
Hair.

271
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,047
It looks like a yellow yarmulke.

272
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,681
No, it's hair.

273
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:21,069
Any of those bodachs with him?

274
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:23,423
More than I've ever seen before.

275
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,883
You're not shivering
'cause of cold ice cream, are you?

276
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:35,003
I'm gonna see what this guy's up to.

277
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,193
- Stormy, wait, wait.
- You, sit.

278
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,076
You think those fish
are up to something?

279
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:52,835
All fish do are eat, excrete,
and fornicate all in the same water.

280
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,260
Fish are disgusting.

281
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,429
Oh, I never thought so till now.

282
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,300
Your creepy friend is buying
two gallons of the summer special.

283
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,725
Are the flavors significant?

284
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,251
That's your department.
I'm just reporting in.

285
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,703
Cherry chocolate coconut chunk?

286
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,816
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

287
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:12,314
I didn't realize the grammar was
so rigid in the ice-cream business.

288
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:13,689
Well, now you know.

289
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,735
This is bad for business.

290
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,148
Why? No one can see em but me.

291
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:28,326
Well, how could a bunch
of slithering, evil spirits...

292
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,575
and guy who look like
fungus be good for business?

293
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,700
Fungus Man scares me.
Can't you forget him?

294
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,011
I have a gift.

295
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:37,340
It wouldn't have been given to me
if I wasn't supposed to use it.

296
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,426
- Maybe it's not a gift.
- It's a gift.

297
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,635
I still got the box it came in.

298
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:42,687
Here. Take my keys.

299
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,843
And please show up
for dinner alive...

300
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,964
because, remember,
I can't see the dead.

301
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:25,440
If someone is going
to cause extreme violence...

302
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:29,277
especially on a massive scale,
which this is starting to look like...

303
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:34,021
bodachs will not leave him until the
last ounce of blood has been spilled.

304
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,605
But they lost interest
in Fungus Man.

305
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:20,408
Winstons, Camels, and Marlboros.

306
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:23,326
Fungus Man has friends.

307
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,154
Oh, now would be
a good time to run.

308
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:35,247
Bodachs.

309
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,651
- Hey.
- Loop me in, odd one.

310
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,912
I think I just achieved a personal
best in the "jump and gasp" event.

311
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,806
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

312
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,631
I found a gateway to hell.

313
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,216
I'm walking back to it right now.

314
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,046
Most people would have
the good sense to run away from it.

315
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,497
- Well, I'm not like most people.
- Not in the least.

316
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,843
It's gone now.

317
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,152
Or hidden.

318
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,307
So, is Fungus Bob a man or
something new in the neighborhood?

319
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,267
I don't know.

320
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,620
This place looks like
some kind of shrine.

321
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,579
Theodore Kaczynski Arrested and...

322
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,532
Bundy Claims...
Police Believe The Number To Be...

323
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:57,957
Cannibal Killer.

324
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,454
Shrine of guys that like to
make belts out of women's nipples.

325
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,699
What?

326
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,458
Who is this guy?

327
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,334
His real name is Robert Robertson.

328
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,141
Well, hello Fungus Bob.

329
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,678
Did you check the refrigerator
for any severed heads?

330
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:18,395
No, I didn't open his refrigerator.

331
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,849
Where else would you expect
to find severed heads?

332
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,723
I wasn't looking for any.

333
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,946
Stormy, Stormy, someone's here.
I got to go.

334
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,031
We don't know
what this guy's planning to do yet.

335
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,557
You know what? Let me ask him
to wait outside until I'm finished.

336
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,645
I can feel that.

337
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:40,870
Wait a minute.
What's today's date?

338
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:42,170
August 14th.

339
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,499
The page to August 15th
is torn out of his calendar.

340
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,706
That's tomorrow.
What happens tomorrow?

341
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:50,672
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get out of there, Oddie.

342
00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:53,467
Maybe he has a file on himself,
you know?

343
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:55,226
Unsolved murders and atrocities.

344
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:57,549
Chief and I could figure
out a way to entrap him.

345
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:02,351
So, what's in it?
Is he a mass murderer?

346
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:03,680
No.

347
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,822
But I think he wants to be.

348
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:11,522
Hey, Bob!
Robert, where the hell are you?

349
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,227
I want my gun back!

350
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:21,529
Oh, shit. Damn dogs.

351
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,500
Shut up, you hear me?

352
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,514
Shut up you damn dogs!

353
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:34,752
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?

354
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,062
Wyatt is out back here burning
some perfectly good steaks.

355
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,188
Thanks, Karla.

356
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,404
Chief.

357
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:49,484
Odd, I hope you haven't come
here to dampen my evening.

358
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,909
I share your hope, sir.

359
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:52,508
Been communing with the dead?

360
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,452
It's not about who's dead, sir.

361
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:56,361
It's about who soon might be.

362
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,795
We call him Fungus Bob.

363
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,958
Yeah, I saw him enter the grill, but
he didn't strike me as suspicious.

364
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,134
Just unfortunate.

365
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,380
Oh, you don't have the advantage
of seeing his fan club, sir.

366
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,807
I guarantee you hell on earth
is coming to Pico Mundo.

367
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:16,220
You know sometimes you expect me
to walk a dangerously narrow line.

368
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,599
That's just because I've got such
great respect for your balance, sir.

369
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,286
Son that sounds perilously close
to being bullshit.

370
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:24,938
There's a little bit of
bullshit in it. A little.

371
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,989
But it's mostly sincere.

372
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:29,422
Odd this is one of
our newer officers...

373
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,821
- Bern Eckles.
- Oh, hi. We met yesterday.

374
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,454
Good collar, that Harlo character.

375
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:35,366
I can't believe
I once dated that perv.

376
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,666
And of course you know Lysette.

377
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:39,203
Bern, I want you
to do a little DMV check on..

378
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,492
this guy Odd was telling me about.

379
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,460
I think Officer Eckles
is a little worried

380
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:46,593
I might try to hook up with you.

381
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:48,296
Karla and the chief
are trying to set us up...

382
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:50,170
him being new to the force and all.

383
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:54,136
It's like cleaning fluid
with sugar in it.

384
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,853
Which reminds me, how's your dad?

385
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:59,850
He's selling pieces of the moon
online, vacation home sites.

386
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:00,774
Is that legal?

387
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:03,312
He certainly doesn't guarantee
the quality of the air.

388
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,606
And how's it going with Bronwen?

389
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,149
She prefers "Stormy."

390
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:08,525
Who wouldn't?

391
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,411
Did you used to play piano?

392
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,823
I did, yeah, for years.
How'd you know that?

393
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,117
'Cause you have really
beautiful hands.

394
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,695
I bet you play like a dream.

395
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,999
You know Odd, you're a strange one.

396
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:25,711
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

397
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,502
Bit of an oddball.

398
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,424
That was my nickname
all through high school.

399
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,151
But you do have your charms.

400
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:33,809
That's what Stormy says.

401
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:35,478
Personally,
I find it rather dubious.

402
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:38,641
You know, if you ever decide
to give cooking lessons...

403
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:40,274
you should give me a call.

404
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,902
I bet you really know
how to whisk.

405
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:45,439
Sure, yeah,
with scrambled eggs and stuff.

406
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:48,168
But, pancakes, you really,
you got to fold em.

407
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,862
But, mostly,
I just fry, fry, fry, you know?

408
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:52,736
Hey, Odd. We got to talk.

409
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,542
Robertson moved here
five months ago.

410
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:59,246
Before that,
he was living with his mother.

411
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:01,954
Inherited a shitload
when she died last year.

412
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:04,627
Clean record, though.
Not even a speeding ticket.

413
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,552
How'd his mother die?

414
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,361
Officer Eckles is checking on
that right now.

415
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:12,135
But otherwise,
I got squat on your Fungus Bob.

416
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,017
I can't hold him.

417
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:16,806
All right, well, you do agree that
he's strange and suspicious, right?

418
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,726
If strange and suspicious were
enough to put someone in jail...

419
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,600
you'd already be there.

420
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:24,272
You're gonna watch him right?

421
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:25,530
Only because you're never wrong,

422
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:27,776
I'll put on a tail on him
and watch his house.

423
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:30,487
You go and have
your dinner with Stormy.

424
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,370
She's the one.

425
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,551
You are one smooth operator, Odd.

426
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,698
She must love to hear you say that.

427
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:37,660
I love to hear me say it.

428
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,968
You better not be hauling
any dead guys on my scooter.

429
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,929
- Dead don't ride scooters.
- Just saying.

430
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:55,722
I'd have to scrub
the seat for hours.

431
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:57,439
Destroying the pleather.

432
00:31:57,474 --> 00:32:00,394
I see you left your hormone
spigot running, griddle boy.

433
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,600
Crank it shut.
This is a church.

434
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:07,276
I know it's a church.

435
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:08,701
I have a brain, you know.

436
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:10,321
You know why I call you Pooh Bear?

437
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:11,621
Because I'm so cuddly.

438
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,063
Because his head is full of stuffin'

439
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,380
Now listen to me, odd one.

440
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,417
I don't want you going back
to that creepy room again.

441
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:24,342
It doesn't exist anymore.

442
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,171
Well, don't go looking for
it hoping it'll come back.

443
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,221
- Never crossed my mind.
- Yes, it did.

444
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:30,863
- Yes, it did.
- It is a gate to the underworld...

445
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:33,435
and you are forbidden by me
to ever play in it again.

446
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,056
It's hard enough living with a guy who
helps dead people without having to

447
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:38,767
trek all the way down to hell
to pull his ass out of the fire.

448
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:40,770
Since when are we living together?

449
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:41,652
We will be.

450
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:44,190
Oh, I guess I didn't think
"Let's put a pin in it" meant "Yes."

451
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:46,693
You have to learn to listen
with more than just your ears.

452
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:49,397
Stormy, what body part am
I supposed to listen with?

453
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:53,074
Right. My heart.
I'm supposed to listen with my heart.

454
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,291
Listen with my heart.

455
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:59,539
I will do something big
to improve our financial situation.

456
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:01,465
- Your idea about selling car tires?
- Bigger.

457
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,794
And what, from your perspective,
is bigger than tires?

458
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:04,812
- Shoes.
- Shoes?

459
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:05,761
Yeah, think about it.

460
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,444
A family of 5 might have 2 cars
but they have 10 feet.

461
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:11,058
Not only that, but they need
different kinds of shoes.

462
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:13,387
Dress shoes, winkle pickers,
high-tops, low-tops, running shoes-

463
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:15,473
But not you. You have
5 pairs of the same sneakers.

464
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:17,679
- Like I said.
- You're not like most people.

465
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,808
Not in the least.

466
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,697
Do you want crackers
with your cheese?

467
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:31,914
We have a problem.

468
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:33,617
Crackers aren't a problem,
just a choice.

469
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:34,416
- Come on.
- What?

470
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:36,325
- Come on! It's Fungus Bob!
- What!

471
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,453
He followed me. I don't know how.

472
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:43,926
Shit! Come on! Come on!

473
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:45,595
- It's him? You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure!

474
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,132
You don't think the two of us
could kick his ass?

475
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,674
Not this guy.

476
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,032
- Come on!
- The sacristy!

477
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:20,657
The back door.
Come on. Come on.

478
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,717
Wait! Wait. Come here.

479
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:25,457
We're heading towards danger,
not away from it. I can feel it.

480
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:29,710
It's like he's everywhere.
He's in front of us. He's behind us.

481
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,220
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.

482
00:34:32,255 --> 00:34:34,175
- Let's call the cops.
- No time.

483
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,096
I have a better plan.
You stay here.

484
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:38,081
I'm gonna run over there
and open the door.

485
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:39,645
If he doesn't lunge through,
you run that way.

486
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,779
If, however, he does lunge through,

487
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,899
you run this way and
I'll try to follow you.

488
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,436
Some plan, odd one.

489
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,938
It's the best I've got.

490
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,904
Full of stuffin'.

491
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:05,797
Does that mean "Get on with it"
or "Up yours"?

492
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,256
Unbelievable.

493
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,831
Right.

494
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,417
Come on! Come on!

495
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,448
Chief, it's Stormy.

496
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:06,194
I'm sorry to drop in on date night,
but here's Odd.

497
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,870
Sir, if you send a car real
quick to St. Bart's...

498
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:11,617
you may be able to catch
Robertson trashing the sacristy...

499
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:12,833
or even the whole church.

500
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:14,919
What was he doing
vandalizing St. Bart's?

501
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:17,456
He was trying to catch me
and Stormy in the belfry.

502
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,417
What were you and Stormy
doing in the belfry?

503
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:21,581
Well, we were having a picnic, sir.

504
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,711
I'm sure that makes sense to you.

505
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:29,797
My guy at Robertsons house said
he still hasn't been home yet.

506
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:33,296
Yeah, because apparently
Bob's been too busy following me.

507
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,232
Oh, one second.

508
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:37,561
- Where are you going?
- To get some food.

509
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,855
How can you think
of dinner right now?

510
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,697
Because I'm hungry.

511
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,649
Look, Odd. Vandalism, big deal.

512
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,569
I thought you said this guy
was gonna bring on the apocalypse.

513
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:52,069
Yes, sir, on August 15th,
which is less than 3 hours away.

514
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,279
Trust me, that is the day that
Pico Mundo will never forget.

515
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,424
Lyle!

516
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,607
Oh. Hi, Odd. Hi Stormy.

517
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:03,755
- Hi, Ozzie.
- Hey, Oz.

518
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,214
Odd.

519
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:07,717
- I'll be right back.
- Lyle, you know that

520
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:09,588
I know guys who know guys, right?
Right. - Right.

521
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:12,514
So if you guys don't stop
messing up my takeout orders..

522
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,266
you're the one that's gonna
get taken out. Get it?

523
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,274
- Got it.
- Good.

524
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:17,394
Oz, Oz, watch your blood pressure.

525
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:19,028
My blood-Hey, Odd...

526
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:20,856
my blood has got
cholesterol molecules

527
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:22,156
the size of marshmallows in it...

528
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:24,610
and if it wasn't for a little
righteous outrage every now and again

529
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,686
my arteries would
completely collapse.

530
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:32,619
I finished that
trinket you asked for.

531
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:34,611
Perfect.

532
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,300
Wow, Oz, what exactly is this?

533
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:44,006
It's a steel heart 6 inches
in diameter, like you said.

534
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,431
No, I said...

535
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:49,094
"A piece of steel 6 inches
in diameter to go over a heart."

536
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,597
Well, man,
I embellished, you know?

537
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:53,147
I get in the moment.

538
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:55,768
I mean, why would Stormy
wanna wear that?

539
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:57,610
It's not for Stormy.

540
00:37:57,645 --> 00:38:00,895
I keep having this image of a...

541
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:05,477
a bullet going through a heart.

542
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:10,565
It's perfect. Thank you.

543
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:15,569
Hey, Chief.

544
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,128
- This place is trashed.
- Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.

545
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:22,970
I'm sure you're right.
You always are.

546
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:26,217
But he was long gone.
Didn't leave a single print.

547
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,511
Even the chalices were spotless.

548
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:29,435
Weird, huh?

549
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,099
I'll give my psychic magnetism a try
to see if I can find him again.

550
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:34,440
Take Stormy home first.

551
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:36,352
- Like hell he will!
- I heard that.

552
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:37,467
He heard that.

553
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:40,363
Chief, you know
I love Oddie desperately...

554
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:44,569
so madly I would cut off my hand if
that made any sense as proof of love.

555
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:46,572
And now I find out
there's a guy trying to kill him.

556
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,860
No one was trying
to kill me, Stormy.

557
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,125
What, you think
he was hitting on you?

558
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,497
You know, this is the craziest
conversation I've ever had.

559
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,999
Odd you're a fountain
of crazy conversations.

560
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,328
A geyser.

561
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:03,460
Time feels like
a powerful black wave...

562
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:06,584
that wishes to crash down
and engulf us.

563
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,001
I must run faster.

564
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,964
Why did I drive here?

565
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,830
Oh, my God.
Oddie, your nightmare...

566
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,660
the slaughter of the bowling alley
people, is it happening here tonight?

567
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:32,237
- Now?
- No.

568
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,670
No, no, I checked this place.

569
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:34,364
The employees here wear green
and gold shirts.

570
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,998
- So?
- So, in my dreams,

571
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:39,698
the victims wear red-and-black shirts
with little black nbowling balls on em.

572
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,214
And I don't see
Fungus Bob's car anywhere.

573
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:45,001
You think the slaughter of
the bowling alley people

574
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,377
and Fungus Bob are connected?

575
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:47,706
Yeah.

576
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,837
Yeah, yeah, I know they are.

577
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,572
They got new uniforms.

578
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:28,796
Don't you dare.

579
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,088
Oh, Wyatt.

580
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,888
You said that whatever was gonna
happen wouldn't happen until tomorrow.

581
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:38,199
- Yes, sir, but you see-
- I still got an hour.

582
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:40,476
I know, sir.
I just want to keep you up to date.

583
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,109
I think there's a good chance that

584
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:44,287
Bob Robertson might
come to Green Moon Alley...

585
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,431
to do a little more
than just hook some balls.

586
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:58,954
Maybe you wanna send a guy out here
to, you know, keep an eye out?

587
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,088
Any of those bodarch things around?

588
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:05,286
Bodachs. No, sir,
but they will show up when he does.

589
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:08,124
Yeah-yeah. All right.
I'll send a guy right over.

590
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:11,673
Something doesn't feel right.

591
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,517
Something's wrong.

592
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,116
Are you nuts?
Everything's wrong.

593
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:16,646
There's going to be a massacre...

594
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:18,662
and I'll bet you
it's going to happen here.

595
00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:20,608
No, all we know is it's
the same uniforms,

596
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:23,144
so it's the same
group of people getting killed.

597
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,646
But tomorrow,
any of them could be anywhere.

598
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,693
God, I'm missing something.
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.

599
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,485
I need to see Viola.

600
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,659
Evening!

601
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,876
- Odd Thomas, right?
- Yeah.

602
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,145
Miss Lewellyn.

603
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,344
The chief sent me.

604
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,000
So you know this guy, right?

605
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,050
I've seen him a couple times today
but no, I don't know him.

606
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,097
Yeah, chief says,
If you see him reach for his pocket

607
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:57,971
he's probably not going
for a breath mint.

608
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,359
- Wise words from a wise man.
- Yeah.

609
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,514
So what exactly makes this guy
so suspicious and dangerous?

610
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,561
He came into the grill
for lunch today.

611
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,899
That's it? You served him lunch?

612
00:42:10,934 --> 00:42:13,189
- He was weird.
- How weird?

613
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,290
He had weird friends.

614
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,785
- He has friends?
- Weird ones.

615
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,160
How weird?

616
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,032
Very weird.

617
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:26,421
And a couple hours ago,
he got very aggressive with me.

618
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,388
Wait. A couple hours ago,

619
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:31,839
this guy, Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

620
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:35,180
Look, the creep made a pass at me
and Odd told him to back off...

621
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:38,015
and the creep got,
you know, creepy.

622
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,096
Creepy.

623
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,399
Hey, Simon, I've been dying
to know what this tattoo means.

624
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:47,059
Do you mind?

625
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:50,818
Well, Stormy...

626
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,289
when I was a teenager,
I was a mess.

627
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:56,306
If it wasn't for the police
academy and the good Lord.

628
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:59,289
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity...

629
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:01,246
that I'd rather not
say the meaning of.

630
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:04,370
Well, what a gentleman you are.

631
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:08,339
Nighty-night, Simon.

632
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:10,336
Night.

633
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,521
You manipulate me like that?

634
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,142
Good heavens odd one,
I manipulate you every day.

635
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,483
- You do?
- Yes.

636
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:22,438
Gently, of course, and with great
affection and you always like it.

637
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:23,683
Oh, I do?

638
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:26,366
You are so adorable.

639
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:28,535
- I'm not adorable.
- Oh, please.

640
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:31,281
Puppies, puppies,
little puppies, are adorable.

641
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:35,444
You and puppies,
totally adorable.

642
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:40,364
I had a feeling
I'd see you tonight.

643
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,293
- It's about my dream, isn't it?
- You said you were shot.

644
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:47,096
My skull was all whacked,
my eyeball swollen.

645
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,696
You know dreams have nothing
to do with the real future, Vi.

646
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:52,261
We've already been over that
territory, but here you are.

647
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,921
Where are you in your dream?

648
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:56,845
No place. A dream place. Fuzzy.

649
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,343
Are you planning on going bowling?

650
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,792
Bowling? Did you hit your head?

651
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:03,780
What are your plans tomorrow?

652
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:07,107
Levanna's birthday is Sunday,
but tips are real good on a Sunday

653
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:10,400
so I was gonna work it and celebrate
her birthday tomorrow instead.

654
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,951
A lot of people died in that
dream of yours, huh Odd?

655
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,196
Yeah, they did.

656
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,696
Your dreams ever come true?

657
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:19,574
Sometimes.

658
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,078
I thought so.

659
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:25,705
Close your eyes, Vi.

660
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:40,093
In your dream what do you see?

661
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:43,350
- What do you hear?
- All right.

662
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:46,563
I'm running.

663
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:51,358
There's suddenly lots of
flashing lights with...

664
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:53,990
old-fashioned kiddie music.

665
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:00,030
And then I hear a big crowd,
a roaring one.

666
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,009
Like in a big football stadium.

667
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:06,081
And then there's the sound
of water, gushing water.

668
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:08,794
How do you die?

669
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:13,050
It's like someone hit me with
a baseball bat, quick, like twice.

670
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:16,308
I scream and
fall to my hands and knees.

671
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:18,032
My hands slip, slippery.

672
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,722
What are you slipping on?

673
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:23,023
Oh, God. Blood.
There's blood everywhere.

674
00:45:23,058 --> 00:45:25,901
What's under the blood,
under your hands?

675
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:27,837
A floor, grass, concrete?

676
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:29,738
I'm staring at the dead man.

677
00:45:32,158 --> 00:45:35,076
Do you know him?
Do you recognize him?

678
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,584
Oh, dear Lord, Odd.
So many dead bodies.

679
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:46,620
Odd, you have to stop
this from happening.

680
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:53,159
Oh, Odd, is there any hope
this could pass?

681
00:45:53,194 --> 00:45:55,182
If you listen to Oddie,
you'll be just fine.

682
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:56,214
No.

683
00:45:57,476 --> 00:46:00,871
Fate is not a straight road.
There are many forks in it.

684
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:04,267
You have the free will to choose
which one you take, but...

685
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:06,117
sometimes it will bend around...

686
00:46:06,152 --> 00:46:09,568
and bring you straight back
to that same stubborn fate.

687
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:13,109
I just wanna check on the girls.

688
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:20,331
They're so beautiful, Viola.

689
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:22,920
And they're such good girls.

690
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:24,771
They're lucky to have you.

691
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:26,588
That's what everyone says.

692
00:46:55,037 --> 00:46:56,200
Odd?

693
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:59,745
- Anything wrong?
- No.

694
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:04,130
No, no, no. I just wanted
to make sure the girls were safe.

695
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:06,264
And with the bars on the windows

696
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:09,134
I taught them how to work
the emergency release myself.

697
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,778
Well, looks like everything's
a-okay in here.

698
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:31,596
Step one, do not stay here.

699
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,501
I'll go to my grandma's.

700
00:47:33,536 --> 00:47:34,683
Don't tell your grandma
you're coming.

701
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:35,830
Don't tell the girls
where you're going.

702
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:37,662
I don't want you overheard.

703
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:39,424
- By who?
- By anyone.

704
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:42,080
Or anything. Just go with it.

705
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:47,999
Step two is don't go bowling if
for some reason you get the itch.

706
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,266
I can't believe we're leaving
those horrid things...

707
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:56,060
hovering around those sweet girls.

708
00:47:56,095 --> 00:47:56,942
They won't hurt em.

709
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:59,063
They just want to smell em
before they die.

710
00:47:59,098 --> 00:48:00,196
God.

711
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:03,442
Look, Stormy, there's nothing
I can do about bodachs, okay?

712
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:05,284
And right now
I wouldn't even if I could.

713
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:08,573
I need em to help me see the danger
coming so I can maybe prevent it.

714
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:11,490
And when they eventually find out
that you can see them?

715
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:18,006
Oddie, will you ever leave here?

716
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:21,378
Well, I sure hope I don't end up like
Tom Jedd hanging out at Tire World.

717
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:23,371
I meant while you're alive.

718
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:28,634
Hey. Hey, Stormy.

719
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:31,093
Hey, hey. Look, look.

720
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:35,560
Look, Stormy,
if you want us to go, I'll go.

721
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:37,018
It's not that. It's-

722
00:48:38,396 --> 00:48:40,554
I am just so scared for you, Oddie.

723
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:44,315
So scared, ever since
I saw that creep Fungus Bob.

724
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,237
I'm sorry. I just-

725
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:50,358
I love you so much.

726
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:56,797
My Pooh Bear.

727
00:48:56,832 --> 00:49:00,085
I promise you on
the other side of tomorrow...

728
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,704
I will have all my stuffing intact.

729
00:49:08,636 --> 00:49:10,296
That must be for you.

730
00:49:57,437 --> 00:49:58,766
Oh, God!

731
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:03,214
I heard the scream.
She ran across my yard.

732
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:06,613
I saw the dogs following her.
I grabbed my gun.

733
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:09,200
I shot the dogs.

734
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:10,575
It's on.

735
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:15,784
All right. Here's what we know.

736
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:21,504
Lysette left my barbecue with
Officer Eckles at around 7:45.

737
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:24,181
He dropped her off at home
clocked in at 8:00,

738
00:50:24,216 --> 00:50:26,927
and was manning the front
desk when he got the call.

739
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:30,354
So somewhere
between 8:00 and midnight,

740
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:32,996
Lysette was whacked in the eye
and then tied up

741
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,603
and gagged and hauled
all the way the hell out here

742
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:38,070
and had two Rottweilers
sicked on her.

743
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:40,816
Hey, Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

744
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,450
His name's Kevin Goss.

745
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:44,535
He was teaching a class
from 6:00 to 10:00...

746
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,365
then he went to Starbucks
till they closed at midnight.

747
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,773
He got home about
two minutes too late.

748
00:50:50,076 --> 00:50:53,955
Sir? I've actually seen
those Rottweilers before.

749
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,829
They belong to Bob Robertson.

750
00:50:58,961 --> 00:51:00,419
All right!

751
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,174
I want an A. P. B.
put out on this guy now!

752
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:05,474
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

753
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:08,554
Simon, I want you to go back
over to Robertson's house.

754
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:10,222
I'll have a search
warrant in the morning

755
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:11,439
as soon as the courthouse opens.

756
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:15,228
Sir, no offense, but I wasted most
of the day staking out that house.

757
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:18,982
Then I went to the bowling alley
and stayed there until they closed.

758
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:20,310
Nothing happened.

759
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:23,564
Nobody showed.
It was a complete waste of my time.

760
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:29,190
Sir, are we sure this Robertson
character isn't just a wild goose chase?

761
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:31,703
Exactly where were you between
the hours of 8:00 and 10:00?

762
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,452
- He was with me the whole time.
- Just ease up.

763
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:38,794
Now go check the house again
and ask around about the dogs.

764
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,123
Yes, sir.

765
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,454
You two.

766
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:45,123
Home.

767
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,923
Go, now!

768
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,972
I think you should wear this.
Try not to laugh.

769
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:06,949
Oddie, you are not responsible
for every death you can't prevent.

770
00:52:06,984 --> 00:52:07,831
She died.

771
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:10,911
And if Fungus Bob was her killer,
I was either slow or stupid.

772
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:12,003
Choose your weapon.

773
00:52:12,038 --> 00:52:13,796
Why would Fungus Bob kill Lysette?

774
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,548
What's the connection?
It makes no sense.

775
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:19,879
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just has to satisfy some sick urge.

776
00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:21,753
Maybe he's warming up.

777
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:25,302
I think the chief just sent
some detectives to protect you.

778
00:52:25,337 --> 00:52:27,045
I don't need protecting.

779
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,341
Actually I think it might
just be surveillance.

780
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,609
Fungus Bob followed me
to the church.

781
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:36,230
I bet the chief is hoping
he'll sniff me out again.

782
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:37,863
If the chief is using you as bait...

783
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:41,018
he should at least ask if
you mind having a hook in your ass.

784
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:50,198
Oh, man, I got to stay focused.

785
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:55,206
Good. You keep an eye on my girl.

786
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:58,250
August 15th had begun.

787
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,413
Time was running out.

788
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:48,930
Hey, Bob.

789
00:53:50,057 --> 00:53:51,931
You're not planning
on getting up, are ya?

790
00:53:55,814 --> 00:53:57,474
But if you're dead...

791
00:53:57,899 --> 00:54:00,390
who's gonna massacre Pico Mundo?

792
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:04,147
Gun on the floor,
dead guy in my tub.

793
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:06,945
I know a setup when I see one.

794
00:54:07,993 --> 00:54:11,329
But if I call the police,
the chief will have to arrest me...

795
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:14,665
and I won't be able to stop
the catastrophe from happening.

796
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,519
Oh, my God!

797
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,761
Oh, you are creeping me out.

798
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,112
You're freezing cold, Bob.

799
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,867
Your rigor mortis is way advanced.

800
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,113
You know...

801
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:54,834
the chief said
you didn't leave any fingerprints.

802
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:56,708
He didn't leave a single print.

803
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:01,791
And Stormy never actually saw you.

804
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:04,009
- Come on!
- What?

805
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:09,996
Because you were already dead.

806
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:11,984
And the whole time in the church,

807
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:14,688
you were actually
a pissed-off poltergeist.

808
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:17,323
I think the last time
I saw Fungus Bob alive...

809
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,478
was when he left his house
right before I broke into it.

810
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:25,741
He's been haunting me ever since,
blaming me for his death.

811
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:29,746
Why he blames me or who the hell
killed him is a little hazy.

812
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:32,471
If I'm caught,
I'll either be arrested for murder

813
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:35,161
or rolling what looks like
the biggest joint ever.

814
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,262
It's just me, Rosalia!

815
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:09,487
Damn it.

816
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:13,328
Oh, give me a break.

817
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:17,493
It's just me, again, Rosalia.

818
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:21,675
I'm gonna borrow
your car again, okay?

819
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,017
If I'm being framed,

820
00:56:23,052 --> 00:56:25,905
why the police have failed
to arrive and arrest me...

821
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,758
or the murderer hasn't come
to kill me, I do not know.

822
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:44,573
All right, Bob, where can I put you
to quietly decompose for a while...

823
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:48,075
before someone finds you and has
a new love of Jesus scared into em?

824
00:57:06,848 --> 00:57:08,481
Interesting story, Bob.

825
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:11,436
After the federal government
abandoned this prison...

826
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,779
it went through a long
series of owners.

827
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:18,402
Rumor has it that at Von Zipper's
Burgers the fries were delicious...

828
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:21,853
and the free-soft-drink-refill
policy was generously honored.

829
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:27,335
And yet, this fine
dining establishment...

830
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:32,166
never succeeded in winning
over the family-dining crowd...

831
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,701
which is so essential
to any restaurant operation.

832
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:38,805
Welcome to the gas chamber.

833
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,508
A lot of people died in here, Bob.

834
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,176
You should feel right at home.

835
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:01,155
Stormy's always joking about running
off to Las Vegas and getting married.

836
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,200
But I tell her Vegas is packed
with dead people and bad guys...

837
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:07,201
and I'd just end up
fighting evil 24-7.

838
00:58:09,414 --> 00:58:11,490
I should have listened to her.

839
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:15,325
Too many.

840
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,457
Too many.

841
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:41,288
The chief.

842
00:58:41,323 --> 00:58:42,651
I need the chief.

843
00:58:44,743 --> 00:58:46,501
Dear Lord.

844
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:50,071
If that's you again, Odd,
we are going to have words!

845
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,837
Oh, my God.

846
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:13,748
No offense, Odd Thomas,
but I can't think of anybody...

847
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,933
who could come in here right now
and not get my back up.

848
00:59:16,234 --> 00:59:18,591
- So you think he knew the shooter?
- Had to.

849
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:20,948
Which means it's probably
somebody I know, too.

850
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:23,439
- How bad is he?
- Bad.

851
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,282
- Well, he's a fighter.
- He better be.

852
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:30,727
- Hey, Bern.
- Ma'am.

853
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:37,494
- Hey.
- Oh Oddie.

854
00:59:37,715 --> 00:59:40,760
Keep those reporters out of here.
You, on that door.

855
00:59:40,795 --> 00:59:43,049
- Sorry, no press inside.
- Comin through.

856
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:48,140
You saved his life, Oddie.

857
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,977
Where's this bullet?

858
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,185
That's the one they're
trying to dig out of him now.

859
00:59:57,945 --> 00:59:59,938
Time is up.

860
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:04,948
Pico Mundo is awakening
to a horror that only I can stop.

861
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:08,122
Lysette and Fungus Bob are dead.

862
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:10,340
The chief is
in the emergency room.

863
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:13,294
There's hoards of bodachs
swarming all over town.

864
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:15,011
Whatever's coming is gonna be big.

865
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:17,722
I'm scared,
and I'm supposed to be fearless.

866
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:19,947
- Don't tell me to stay home today.
- Please stay home today.

867
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:22,137
- I will if you stay home with me.
- We've been through this.

868
01:00:22,172 --> 01:00:24,640
I have to do
whatever I can to stop it.

869
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:26,607
Is Viola going to be shot dead?

870
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:28,931
You know I don't know
that for sure.

871
01:00:29,353 --> 01:00:31,927
She's had it hard in life.
She doesn't need this.

872
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:34,949
Shot dead? Really?
Who does need it?

873
01:00:34,984 --> 01:00:37,570
Oh, I don't know
why I try to reason with you.

874
01:00:37,605 --> 01:00:38,703
I always lose.

875
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:40,761
You're a fabulous man of action,
odd one.

876
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:42,784
You don't need to be
a good debater, too.

877
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:44,542
Besides, you said yourself...

878
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:47,289
any road I choose could lead me
right back to the same fate.

879
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:49,458
So, which is it?
Do I have free will?

880
01:00:49,493 --> 01:00:51,118
Am I in God's hands?

881
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,968
Or is it both?

882
01:00:53,003 --> 01:00:55,297
Have I ever told you
you've got a lot of issues?

883
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,056
I'm a woman. We all have issues.

884
01:00:57,091 --> 01:01:00,156
It's what keeps us interesting,
and you men interested.

885
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:03,222
Oh, yeah? It's what makes us
crazy and die younger.

886
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:04,467
Do you love me?

887
01:01:05,224 --> 01:01:07,393
I love you more than life itself.

888
01:01:07,428 --> 01:01:10,228
See? It's working.

889
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:18,780
Don't look back. Don't look back.

890
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:20,025
Give him strength.

891
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:25,453
Knock, knock.

892
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:33,246
I'm hoping Bob left
a clue on his computer.

893
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:36,496
Something to lead me
to his partner...

894
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:40,970
to the person who was
planning on killing 100s,

895
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:44,007
if not 1000s of people.

896
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:45,503
Hey.

897
01:02:45,538 --> 01:02:47,290
Loop me in, odd one.
Where are you?

898
01:02:47,325 --> 01:02:49,180
I'm walking towards the fridge.

899
01:02:49,215 --> 01:02:51,035
Yours, mine, or Fungus Bob's?

900
01:02:52,629 --> 01:02:54,137
Don't "uh-huh" me. I told you...

901
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,883
you are not allowed to go playing
around in any more hell gates.

902
01:02:56,918 --> 01:02:58,461
Next!

903
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,112
Oh, God. Cockroaches.

904
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:03,464
Always cockroaches.

905
01:03:03,682 --> 01:03:06,060
- Odd Thomas, did you hear me?
- Which part?

906
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,276
I can't believe
you went back there.

907
01:03:07,311 --> 01:03:10,645
Every time you don't listen to me,
you get yourself into trouble.

908
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,524
- I wish I'd listened to you.
- You get out of there right now.

909
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,737
Right, right. Leaving. Leaving.

910
01:03:20,784 --> 01:03:23,495
Never heard you make that
sound before. Is everything okay?

911
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:27,327
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?

912
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:29,925
Fingers.

913
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,546
Please say they're attached
to someone's hand.

914
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:33,762
Sorry.

915
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:35,014
Get out of there, Oddie.

916
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:38,267
Someone has been buying
a lot of Burke and Bailey's.

917
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:40,471
Yeah? Well, you tell whoever's
buying it that our ice cream...

918
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:43,092
may be the best,
but it'll still melt in hell.

919
01:03:44,976 --> 01:03:46,728
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

920
01:03:46,763 --> 01:03:47,973
No. Wait.

921
01:03:48,187 --> 01:03:50,607
I'll leave here first.
Then I'll call 'em.

922
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:52,018
Be careful.

923
01:03:52,053 --> 01:03:53,395
Don't worry.

924
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,279
Hey, Bob.

925
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:06,714
I guess when I began to out you,
word somehow spread...

926
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:12,170
and you became a liability to
your partner and he had to kill you.

927
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:13,833
Sorry about that.

928
01:04:18,636 --> 01:04:23,349
I find it funny how I know more
about dead people than dead people.

929
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:24,441
This is our realm, Bob.

930
01:04:24,476 --> 01:04:27,512
You can't physically harm
a living person.

931
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:33,644
But there is that.

932
01:04:43,996 --> 01:04:46,570
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

933
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,215
Gas.

934
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:29,706
I'm exhausted, I'm lost,
and somewhere along the way...

935
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:33,705
I missed an important clue
that could take me home.

936
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,511
The bullet through the heart.

937
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:53,022
It wasn't about the chief.

938
01:06:15,134 --> 01:06:17,423
God.

939
01:06:41,912 --> 01:06:45,246
Enough already, Bob. Please.

940
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:51,500
My three least favorite words.

941
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,583
Some..

942
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,670
assembly...

943
01:06:57,887 --> 01:06:59,938
required.

944
01:06:59,973 --> 01:07:02,893
Simon, I've been dying to know
what that tattoo means.

945
01:07:02,928 --> 01:07:06,096
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity.

946
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,565
It's Varner.

947
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:13,193
I once had a run-in with
some devil worshipers.

948
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,988
I should've known.

949
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:20,376
P- O-D. Prince Of Darkness.

950
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,296
No wonder Varner was suspicious
when I told him...

951
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,917
Fungus Bob had gotten aggressive
with me an hour earlier.

952
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:29,167
This guy Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

953
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,712
He had already killed Bob
5 or 6 hours before that.

954
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:35,267
And that police van
protecting Stormy?

955
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:37,596
That must've been Varner
waiting to follow me home...

956
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:40,009
to bust me
for Fungus Bob's murder.

957
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:42,387
Or shoot me while resisting arrest.

958
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,156
There were no bodachs around Varner.

959
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,951
But I can still feel myself
being drawn to him...

960
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:55,521
and to the place where
he's about to commit mass murder.

961
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:05,871
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

962
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:08,452
Oh, God, no.

963
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:23,394
Hey, Nell,
I see what the problem is.

964
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:24,277
Stormy.

965
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:27,231
You are eating and
reading at the same time.

966
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:29,224
How about I eat and you read?

967
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:33,603
No? Not so good? Okay, fine.

968
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:51,538
All right, Varner, where are you?

969
01:09:42,936 --> 01:09:46,056
Fungus Bob didn't just
have one kill buddy.

970
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:48,240
He had two.

971
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:52,321
One more, and they could buy group
health insurance or form a rock band.

972
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:54,203
Officer Eckles is checking
that right now.

973
01:09:54,204 --> 01:09:56,081
I don't know what this
Odd Thomas character knows...

974
01:09:56,116 --> 01:09:57,767
but I know that Robertson
is stupid and careless...

975
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,418
and he's gonna get us nailed
if we don't do something.

976
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:00,300
Relax.

977
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:03,672
Did Robertson ever find those
photos at the mall he misplaced?

978
01:10:03,707 --> 01:10:08,169
I said, relax.
I'll take care of him.

979
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,139
Stalking someone at the mall, Bern?

980
01:10:22,776 --> 01:10:24,436
Robertson, that idiot.

981
01:10:26,947 --> 01:10:28,824
We got to make it
look like an accident.

982
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:30,966
Oh, it'll look like
an accident all right.

983
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,073
When I find Robertson,
I'm gonna kill him.

984
01:10:33,412 --> 01:10:35,570
Already been there, done that.

985
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,757
Looks like their plan was to jump
out at the end of the mall disaster

986
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:47,379
like heroes responding to the call.

987
01:10:48,219 --> 01:10:52,051
But I never saw any bodachs
around Eckles, either.

988
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:56,390
The presence of the bodachs
tipped me off to Fungus Bob...

989
01:10:56,425 --> 01:11:00,391
but not to his two co-conspirators,
which now seems...

990
01:11:00,732 --> 01:11:02,241
intentional.

991
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:06,439
As if the bodachs knew of my gift,
as if they know I can see them.

992
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:10,397
The bodachs have been
manipulating me.

993
01:11:32,015 --> 01:11:33,973
I'm gonna finish you off,
old man.

994
01:11:38,564 --> 01:11:39,780
Four.

995
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:42,104
Well, that's just jiffy.

996
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:16,637
This just so happens
to be my very favorite book.

997
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:19,430
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.

998
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:24,988
Officer Varner Prince of Darkness,
Officer Varner, Prince of Darkness.

999
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:36,244
Viola.

1000
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,585
- Viola! What are you doing here?
- Odd! Geez!

1001
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,678
- You scared the-
- What are you doing here?

1002
01:12:40,713 --> 01:12:42,652
We had to pick out
a birthday present for Levanna.

1003
01:12:42,687 --> 01:12:45,140
And Nicolina wanted to get
a card for her big sister.

1004
01:12:45,175 --> 01:12:47,593
Look, your dream, it's happening
right here, right now.

1005
01:12:48,221 --> 01:12:50,994
I thought in a big stadium or
at the water park or a bowling alley.

1006
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:53,768
Ladies, I need you to take Viola
and get her out of here, okay?

1007
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:56,473
Come on.
Come on, come on. Go on.

1008
01:12:57,731 --> 01:12:59,573
This made Dorothy so very angry...

1009
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,902
that she picked up the bucket
of water that stood near...

1010
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:04,607
and dashed it all over
the wicked witch.

1011
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:08,027
And then the wicked witch said...

1012
01:13:08,062 --> 01:13:10,525
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

1013
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:15,946
There's suddenly lots
of flashing lights.

1014
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:18,865
With old-fashioned kiddie music.

1015
01:13:21,089 --> 01:13:23,046
And then I hear a big crowd.

1016
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:28,672
And then there's the sound of water,
gushing water.

1017
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:33,805
Bye, Nell.

1018
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,469
Bye, Stormy.

1019
01:13:37,773 --> 01:13:39,650
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry!

1020
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:41,192
Move, move. Excuse me!

1021
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:32,282
A gun! He's got a gun!

1022
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:28,921
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

1023
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:33,716
Gypsy Mummy gave us a card that
said so, for a single quarter...

1024
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:36,845
what other couples couldn't
buy at any price.

1025
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:42,563
No!

1026
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:08,962
Get out of the way! Get off!

1027
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,290
Hi.

1028
01:17:24,678 --> 01:17:26,007
Odd!

1029
01:17:33,646 --> 01:17:34,975
Odd!

1030
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:38,019
It's not over.

1031
01:17:44,491 --> 01:17:45,819
It's not over.

1032
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:49,073
It's not over. It's not over.

1033
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,376
Hey Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

1034
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:56,665
His names Kevin Goss.

1035
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:58,965
One of these days, bang!

1036
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,127
You hear me?

1037
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:24,823
He's got a gun!

1038
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:41,391
- Is this your truck?
- I need a drill!

1039
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:43,240
Do you have a drill?
I need to get this open!

1040
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:45,020
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop. Now look!

1041
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:47,140
You see that woman?
Some maniacs just shot up the mall!

1042
01:18:47,175 --> 01:18:49,434
So either get with me,
get behind me, or get out!

1043
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:51,012
I got a grinder!

1044
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:05,190
Oh, my God.

1045
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,179
Everyone get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out!

1046
01:19:24,214 --> 01:19:25,294
Now!

1047
01:20:12,564 --> 01:20:13,678
Hey!

1048
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:35,999
Shit!

1049
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:48,428
You really set yourself up, asshole!

1050
01:21:27,643 --> 01:21:30,348
It's cold in the desert.

1051
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:19,989
I could tell my stuffing
wasn't entirely intact.

1052
01:22:20,024 --> 01:22:21,915
He's awake. He's awake!

1053
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:24,785
But it was nothing
they couldn't stitch back together.

1054
01:22:31,668 --> 01:22:34,380
Karla told me that the chief
had come through just fine...

1055
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:37,056
and somehow managed
to spin Fungus Bob's corpse...

1056
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:40,709
into a bizarre cover story
that kept my secret a secret.

1057
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:47,901
An FBI expert
on television said that

1058
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,855
if you hadn't gotten
those explosives out of there,

1059
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:53,740
at least 500 or 600 people
would've died, for sure.

1060
01:22:53,775 --> 01:22:57,725
They told me events at the Green Moon
Mall had made headlines everywhere.

1061
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,272
But I didn't want to read
or see anything about it.

1062
01:23:02,951 --> 01:23:03,834
According to Eckles...

1063
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:07,060
he and Varner started a satanic
cult when they were teenagers.

1064
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:10,251
One night, they killed a man
and realized they enjoyed it.

1065
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:11,551
So they kept at it,

1066
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,503
eventually joining
the police force for better cover.

1067
01:23:15,548 --> 01:23:18,735
They met Robertson and Goss
and came up with a plan...

1068
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,922
to infiltrate a small town
and then slowly kill it.

1069
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,825
Odd! Odd! Odd!

1070
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,351
Detail, present arms.

1071
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:04,231
When I'm with you,

1072
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:08,015
I don't have to worry about
pancakes or poltergeists.

1073
01:24:09,063 --> 01:24:12,396
When I'm with you,
I'm with my destiny.

1074
01:24:13,234 --> 01:24:16,852
Where you live, I flourish.

1075
01:24:21,868 --> 01:24:24,359
We ate food that wasn't healthy.

1076
01:24:27,082 --> 01:24:29,573
We drank too much...

1077
01:24:31,253 --> 01:24:32,913
and slept too much...

1078
01:24:39,386 --> 01:24:42,222
but could never kiss enough.

1079
01:24:42,932 --> 01:24:45,767
Everything was just as I wished.

1080
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:54,395
- Yeah?
- Odd, it's us. Open up.

1081
01:24:55,987 --> 01:24:58,323
- Hey, guys.
- We have been calling you, Oddie.

1082
01:24:58,358 --> 01:25:00,624
I know. You know,
I disconnected the phone...

1083
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,953
because the reporters won't
leave me and Stormy alone.

1084
01:25:02,988 --> 01:25:04,744
- Son.
- Do you want some-

1085
01:25:07,249 --> 01:25:09,539
You've been here long enough.

1086
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:11,829
We think it's time to stop.

1087
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:17,249
Sweetheart, the coroner finally
released her poor body.

1088
01:25:34,653 --> 01:25:36,444
A part of me knew...

1089
01:25:37,072 --> 01:25:40,607
from the moment I saw her
behind the ice cream counter.

1090
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:44,162
But the truth hurt
too much to accept.

1091
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:48,623
Her death would have been
one wound too many that day.

1092
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:53,329
And I think I would have
let go of this life.

1093
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,184
She's here, isn't she?

1094
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:16,063
You got to let her go.

1095
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:20,240
She deserves to move
to her next life.

1096
01:26:21,494 --> 01:26:22,822
Son...

1097
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:26,373
it's just time.

1098
01:27:23,017 --> 01:27:24,476
I love you.

1099
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:31,227
I promise I will see you again.
Okay?

1100
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:54,572
Stormy always believed that life
is not about how fast you run...

1101
01:28:54,607 --> 01:28:56,730
or with what degree of grace.

1102
01:28:57,283 --> 01:28:59,333
That this life is a boot camp,

1103
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:01,911
that we must persevere
through all the obstacles

1104
01:29:01,946 --> 01:29:04,455
and hardships to earn our way
into the next life.

1105
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,750
To be with her again, I will have
the perseverance of a bulldog.

1106
01:29:10,213 --> 01:29:13,333
But sometimes, it seems to me...

1107
01:29:14,176 --> 01:29:17,296
the training
is unnecessarily painful.

1108
01:29:24,603 --> 01:29:26,654
If I live an average life-span...

1109
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:30,023
I'll have another 60 years
before I see Stormy again.

1110
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:32,318
That will be a long wait.

1111
01:29:34,405 --> 01:29:36,363
But I am a patient man.

1112
01:29:38,785 --> 01:29:41,074
And I have much to do.
