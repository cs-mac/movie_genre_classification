1
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,476
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,573
Don't move.

3
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:08,973
Ha Wan Seung?

4
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:12,703
Hey.

5
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,333
Detective Ha. Did you kill Jang Do Jang?

6
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:28,703
Arrest him.

7
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,533
It was all designed from the beginning.

8
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,133
The case file went missing.

9
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,273
I couldn't find them.

10
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:43,073
That case was...

11
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,773
100 percent suicide.

12
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,873
Hey, how did you know?

13
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,373
What a good hunch.

14
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:54,903
How did you know something
would happen here?

15
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,203
Why did you kill Jang Do Jang?

16
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,503
You said you were getting farsighted,

17
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,003
but you have a great eyesight.

18
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,503
You recognized Jang Do Jang from there.

19
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:06,903
Arrest him.

20
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:12,933
Let's see if you stick to the rules.

21
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,733
First one is a blank-fire.

22
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:16,843
Get him!

23
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,473
Don't let him get away!

24
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,603
What are you doing? Go after him!

25
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,403
I had him ready for you.
How can you miss him?

26
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,273
I'll get him today no matter what.

27
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,193
You have until the end of the day.

28
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,903
If it takes any longer,

29
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:48,903
Mr. Ha will be on the move.

30
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,103
(Mr. Ha of Ha And Jung Law Firm)

31
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,173
How dare you make my son a murderer?

32
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:06,303
I'm trying, but...

33
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:10,233
your son is pouring oil on the fire.

34
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,673
So what?

35
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,803
What are you trying to do?

36
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,403
As you know,

37
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:20,173
I only follow orders from my superiors.

38
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,143
I have to obey them. What else can I do?

39
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,233
It's time...

40
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,573
for you to decide.

41
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:32,303
17 years is a long time.

42
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,473
I can't have your back anymore.

43
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,643
All right.

44
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,273
Sir.

45
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,773
Your life...

46
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,932
and mine are at stake.

47
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,403
I know that.

48
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,903
I'll take care of everything. You stay put.

49
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:00,803
Mom. Dad.

50
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:04,233
You must've been upset.

51
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,973
I thought we'd catch the culprit soon...

52
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,033
because Ho Cheol is a prosecutor.

53
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,233
I'll get the culprit myself.

54
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,603
I won't rely on Ho Cheol anymore.

55
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,773
(Shinim-dong taxi driver
and wife commit suicide)

56
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:54,003
(The police concluded the
case as a double suicide.)

57
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,873
Dad.

58
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,403
Mom!

59
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,303
That's my dad's taxi!

60
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:23,172
It's my dad's! Why won't you let me go?

61
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,332
- Dad!
- Hey.

62
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,503
Hey.

63
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,973
They're both dead.

64
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,533
Pardon?

65
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,833
That's a lie.

66
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,373
My dad has...

67
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,833
never been sick.

68
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,603
My mom got over her cold.

69
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,503
They committed suicide.

70
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:08,173
Mom!

71
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,373
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,673
Mom, don't go!

73
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,173
Dad, no!

74
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,433
Mom! Don't leave me alone.

75
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,573
Dad!

76
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,233
It's not a suicide.

77
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,133
Who is it?

78
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:48,033
Lady?

79
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,633
Detective Ha?

80
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,703
I'm sorry it's late,

81
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,073
but I have to see you.

82
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,073
What?

83
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,593
Why would you call out a
married woman this late?

84
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,203
We don't have enough time.
I have to see you.

85
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,573
Where are you? I'll be there.

86
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,503
In front of the lunchbox shop.

87
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:10,403
What?

88
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:15,573
What?

89
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,303
Lady, what are you doing there?

90
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,533
What is this? What are you doing here?

91
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,503
Detective Ha, your leg.

92
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,973
It's bloody.

93
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,833
A bullet brushed past my leg. I'm fine.

94
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,533
A bullet?

95
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:36,743
Are you crazy? Let's get you to a hospital.

96
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:38,933
I can't go to a hospital.

97
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,403
Gosh, why are you so dull?

98
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,503
Didn't it hurt?

99
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,973
My goodness, go easy on me.

100
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,202
You walked around fine
with all these blood.

101
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,273
Why, does it hurt now?

102
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:13,073
My gosh. I thought you were
an experienced detective.

103
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,002
Why do you always get hurt?

104
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,843
Do you know how many times
I saw you get hurt?

105
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,173
I think I mostly got hurt because of you.

106
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,773
If that's so, it's the biggest
reason not to get hurt.

107
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:25,903
It makes me angrier.

108
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,333
Try to loosen that. You're
cutting off my circulation.

109
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,243
This is how you're supposed to do it.

110
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,073
And take this.

111
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:45,233
I'll use it often to prevent infection.

112
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:47,933
You're a lot nicer now.

113
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:58,133
Were you waiting for me,
pretending it's a coincidence?

114
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,273
This is my workplace.

115
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,933
It's not your working hour.

116
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,203
All right, fine.

117
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,602
I've been waiting all night...

118
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,402
to see if our precious little detective...

119
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,333
would stop by.

120
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:13,903
Are you happy now?

121
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:16,333
Did I ever tell you?

122
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:18,903
I'm a bad boy.

123
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:26,773
(Shinim-dong taxi driver
and wife commit suicide)

124
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,873
You and I are connected.

125
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,702
Forget about it.

126
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,242
It's too burdening...

127
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,933
to receive attention from
a pretty boy like you.

128
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,743
(Shinim-dong taxi driver suicide case)

129
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,933
This is your parents' case file.

130
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,873
No one is here.

131
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,933
There's no way he would be at home.

132
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,173
Oh, are you tracing his phone?

133
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:20,073
It's not available.

134
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:22,203
Darn it.

135
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:24,702
What are you doing? Search the place again.

136
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:25,803
Yes.

137
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,402
Seven years ago,

138
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,773
I killed a woman who got in my taxi.

139
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,532
I tied her body with a heavy weight...

140
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,473
and threw her into the ocean.

141
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:38,803
My wife and I cannot live with this guilt.

142
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,873
I will pay for my sin with death.

143
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,773
Please take care of my daughter.

144
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,603
National Forensic Service said...

145
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,873
the handwriting is your dad.

146
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,733
This is my dad's handwriting.

147
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,833
But this isn't his will.

148
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,003
He wrote it himself,

149
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:04,033
but it isn't his will?

150
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,473
He just copied whatever someone else wrote.

151
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,403
I see evidence of murder on this will.

152
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:19,733
Wan Seung?

153
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:22,372
If he's not home,

154
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,003
he's not here, so he must
be at the lunchbox place.

155
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,773
But it is rather late now.

156
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,833
Oh, really?

157
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,233
No, it's nothing. Don't call him.

158
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:36,403
I'll call him.

159
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,273
No, it's nothing urgent.

160
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,033
Yes, I'll visit you soon, Captain.

161
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,933
Goodbye.

162
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:54,703
Speech and writings are like fingerprints.

163
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,573
Fingerprints again?

164
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,972
It means there are a set vocabulary...

165
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,333
and writing habits for each of us.

166
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,133
My dad never used "I" correctly.

167
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,103
He always used "me" instead.

168
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,533
And my dad...

169
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,203
always had the wrong spelling.

170
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,233
He would always get a
couple of things wrong.

171
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,103
But this has everything
spelled out perfectly.

172
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:32,833
(Me will put the car out quickly.)

173
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,133
It is a bit odd.

174
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:39,303
Before someone dies,

175
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,703
they look back on their own life.

176
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:44,703
He only talks about why
and when he killed her...

177
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,633
and where he threw out the body.

178
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,403
It's only about the murder.

179
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:52,133
This isn't a will. It's a report.

180
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:55,002
He doesn't know words like
"statute of limitations"...

181
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,903
That's what detectives usually say.

182
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,973
The case file went missing.

183
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:03,103
I can't find it anywhere.

184
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,663
The detective who looked into
this case is suspicious.

185
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,773
He's the guy who waited around to catch me.

186
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:16,103
It's weird how Jang Do Jang
suddenly changed the place.

187
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,173
I'm going to change the place of meeting.

188
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,002
Come alone to...

189
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,523
the empty Muju Factory in Shinim-dong.

190
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,033
That's Detective Ko's jurisdiction.
Shinim-dong.

191
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,703
Detective Ko has never left
Shinim Police Station.

192
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:32,903
Something is going on.

193
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:34,833
It's someone above.

194
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:37,603
We can't reinvestigate with just this.

195
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,449
We need a concrete evidence.

196
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,403
I do have it. The concrete evidence.

197
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,103
What evidence?

198
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:00,973
A fingerprint. The one on our fingers.

199
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,672
There were no fingerprints found.

200
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:09,903
Exactly.

201
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,803
How can there be no fingerprints?

202
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,823
How can there be no fingerprints in a taxi?

203
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:19,273
Hundreds of people get in and get off.

204
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,593
It wouldn't make sense
even if it wasn't a taxi.

205
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,533
The fingerprint of the person
who died should be there.

206
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,033
What if the person had gloves on?

207
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,972
The gloves would be in the car.

208
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:32,073
But they weren't. They
weren't on him either.

209
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:35,833
Someone erased the fingerprints.

210
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,703
And...

211
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,102
(Briquette)

212
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,373
look at this briquette.

213
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:43,432
It's only half burnt.

214
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,933
It went out in the middle.

215
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:46,732
With this much gas...

216
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,203
A person can't die.

217
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:50,073
They didn't die in the taxi.

218
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:53,073
They were moved after they died.

219
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,332
We can tell by the purple
spots on their body.

220
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,573
(Purple spots appear on
a dead person's body.)

221
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:02,833
There's no autopsy result.

222
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,833
The evidence here only leads to a suicide.

223
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,503
They hid the most important autopsy result.

224
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,973
Detective Ha, where did
you get this case file?

225
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,873
This is the last present I can give to you.

226
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,333
Seo Hyun Soo's murderer...

227
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,203
is in here.

228
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,103
Detective Ha, are you
hiding something from me?

229
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,933
Detective Ko.

230
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,302
You can't enter without a warrant.

231
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:50,873
Hey, that's not the problem right now.

232
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,073
We don't know when the murderer will run.

233
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:54,603
- What?
- Move aside.

234
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,103
I read it on the advertisement.

235
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,443
It was on a pretty detective
in Seodong Police Station.

236
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:07,073
I learned a lot about you through that.

237
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:09,773
Right after...

238
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:12,303
Ms. Seo Hyun Soo went missing,

239
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:17,633
February 26, 2001, you got
into the Police University.

240
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:20,973
You started out in the
intelligence division.

241
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,003
It was to find Ms. Seo Hyun Soo.

242
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,603
March 21, 2007.

243
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,033
You applied for traffic safety division...

244
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:38,073
in order to find the taxi Ms. Seo took.

245
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,733
10 years ago,

246
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,233
you found the taxi driver,

247
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,473
Yoo In Sang,

248
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,073
my dad.

249
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,903
November 13, 2007.

250
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,673
You two were going to meet in Shinim-dong.

251
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,733
The man had a tattoo on his arm?

252
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:06,503
He had a snake tail tattoo
and needle marks on his arm.

253
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,973
Needle marks on his arm?

254
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:10,873
Was he a drug addict?

255
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:14,233
Well, I'm not sure.

256
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:18,903
Can you tell me more details in person?

257
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:21,733
Of course. I have a good memory.

258
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:26,233
You didn't get to meet the taxi driver.

259
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,203
Ever.

260
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,533
You joined the narcotics
division in 2009...

261
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,672
to find the man...

262
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:40,003
with a snake tail tattoo and needle marks.

263
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:42,373
Jang Do Jang.

264
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,943
- Here.
- Thank you.

265
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,003
Let's go.

266
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:05,533
All right. Here we go.

267
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:13,603
My dad died on the day...

268
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,903
he was supposed to meet you.

269
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:17,943
Was it a coincidence?

270
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:21,973
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,233
If only...

272
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,253
I hadn't been looking for...

273
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,503
My dad could be...

274
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,533
so meddlesome.

275
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,832
- Is he in there?
- No, sir.

276
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,273
- Search the kitchen.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,103
It's the police. They're after me.

278
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:03,333
Why is the police chasing a police?

279
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,673
I'm accused of killing Jang Do Jang.

280
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:08,973
What?

281
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,033
What's going on?

282
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:31,473
It's a security alarm.

283
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,273
I believe the police
substation has been informed.

284
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:36,749
Gosh, this is annoying.

285
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,332
Let's move out.

286
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,403
Yes, sir.

287
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,703
The one who killed my parents...

288
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,673
must be related to Seo
Hyun Soo's case, right?

289
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,623
I'll catch the culprit no matter what.

290
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:21,733
Do you have a place to go?

291
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:33,173
(Dong Ho's Lunchbox)

292
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,473
Hey.

293
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,773
What happened to your leg?

294
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:56,903
Don't ask. Just come here and help me.

295
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,832
I asked you to give me the passcode.

296
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,102
Why would I give you that?

297
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,532
Tell me. I might come here again.

298
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,773
Are you okay?

299
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,572
Hey, you should get home early.

300
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:12,972
It's dangerous out there.

301
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:16,202
You're right. It's dangerous
even for a police.

302
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,473
It's really terrible.

303
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:21,103
Hey, give me my pajamas.

304
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,233
Pardon?

305
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,209
Why would your pajamas be here?

306
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:27,133
We had matching pajamas.
Those were really comfy.

307
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:28,873
Where did you buy them?

308
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,333
Matching...

309
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,173
pajamas.

310
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,573
Who could that be?

311
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:45,903
- Captain.
- Hey.

312
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:49,572
- Wan Seung...
- He's here.

313
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:50,573
- Hey.
- Hello.

314
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,273
Are you all right?

315
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,233
What's that? Did you get hurt again?

316
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:59,103
I'll be fine. As long as
he doesn't kick me out.

317
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,833
What do you mean I'll kick you out?

318
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,373
I'll give you the pajamas.

319
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,873
Tell me the truth.

320
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,073
Did you really kill Jang Do Jang?

321
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:18,733
What? He killed Jang Do Jang?

322
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,372
Captain, I'm a detective.

323
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:24,103
I didn't go through all
the trouble to kill him.

324
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:26,373
That's not what I'm asking.

325
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,103
Are they saying you killed Jang Do Jang?

326
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,903
Yes, I think so.

327
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,533
What will you do now?

328
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:41,209
I'm going to catch the real killer.

329
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,333
Where?

330
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,233
Hi, Captain.

331
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,133
Hi, Detective Ko. Did you
meet with Detective Ha?

332
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:15,373
Detective Ha is on his way to my place.

333
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:19,573
I'm not sure. I think he
wants to borrow money.

334
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:23,173
You should come over if
you need to talk to him.

335
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,993
We'll head over to Captain Bae's house.

336
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,833
They left.

337
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:37,973
You have an hour.

338
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:41,733
Don't use your cell phone.
They'll track it.

339
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:45,433
That's a given.

340
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:58,733
Detective Ha.

341
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,213
You're under arrest for the
murder of Jang Do Jang.

342
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:10,703
Let's go.

343
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,273
You entering the crime scene was...

344
00:25:20,873 --> 00:25:22,473
caught on tape.

345
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,533
Jang Do Jang's last phone
conversation was with you.

346
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,033
You've been after him for a long time.

347
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:34,573
You caught him every time he ran away.

348
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,903
You two have a long history.

349
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:41,833
Just confess.

350
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,833
It's for your sake.

351
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:49,173
He said he didn't do it.

352
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,303
What was it that he didn't do?

353
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,303
He was going to tell me everything.

354
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,633
But he died when he was about to.

355
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,703
And you came right in time to catch me.

356
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,833
Detective Ko. Do you know Seo Hyun Soo?

357
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:40,073
You're pathetic.

358
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,823
Request a visit if you want to see me.

359
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,273
People are watching.

360
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:49,833
Go to the US.

361
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,603
I'll get everything ready.

362
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,503
Ha And Jung Law Firm is amazing.

363
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:58,233
It can let a murder suspect fly abroad.

364
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,503
Thanks to Ha And Jung Law Firm,

365
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,333
you're still alive.

366
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,433
Without Ha And Jung Law Firm,

367
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:10,603
you're nothing.

368
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,473
The same goes for you.

369
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,573
Do you think people grovel
because you're great?

370
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:22,503
This is your last chance.

371
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:27,133
I'm not in a great shape,

372
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,473
so I can't see you off.

373
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:52,403
(Shinim Police Station)

374
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,333
Detective Ko started
working in Shinim-dong...

375
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,403
Right before Hyun Soo went missing.

376
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,803
Everything was planned.

377
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:07,903
It was all designed...

378
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:10,033
from the beginning.

379
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,473
Everything began in Shinim-dong.

380
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,733
Detective Ko probably
had his eyes on my dad.

381
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:20,032
Even if you didn't find him,

382
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,273
he would've...

383
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,233
I will save you, Detective Ha.

384
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:32,003
Lady, I'll clear myself of false charges.

385
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,273
Don't go messing around. It's dangerous.

386
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,803
You don't have anyone
to save your life now.

387
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:42,373
I also want to be conceited to you.

388
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,903
False charges and your
life aren't the same.

389
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,073
Goodness.

390
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:52,903
You should go. A lady shouldn't come here.

391
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:11,433
A crime always leaves a trace.

392
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,373
You cannot go in.

393
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,209
I just need to go in for a bit.

394
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,773
You may not. Please leave.

395
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:29,873
Corporal Park.

396
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:34,933
Hello.

397
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,073
Come in.

398
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:41,803
I didn't know you were here.

399
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:43,933
I'm here to help the forensics team.

400
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:47,373
The National Police Agency
calls forensic officers.

401
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:03,103
I can tell by the bloodstain...

402
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:06,103
that the victim died...

403
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:07,833
facing that way.

404
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:12,303
Detective Ha came in this way.

405
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:13,703
Jang Do Jang...

406
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:16,233
Jang Do Jang drove a car
in and came this way.

407
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,832
And the car door was supposedly left open,

408
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,103
so it looks like he was killed immediately.

409
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:22,873
But Detective Ha...

410
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,733
got on the car and ran away.

411
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,433
Detective Ha couldn't be the culprit.

412
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:47,132
He walked in from this way,

413
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,903
but the victim fell facing that way.

414
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,603
Then the knife should be on his back.

415
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:55,733
Oh, look.

416
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,273
Inspector Woo.

417
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,203
Are you going to let him go to jail?

418
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:10,873
Just drive.

419
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,133
Yes, I apologize.

420
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:30,673
Is the headquarters doing the profiling?

421
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:34,373
It's a case involving an officer.
Please do it well.

422
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,933
Detective Ha's shoes had blood on them.

423
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:43,172
You can see bloodstains
here, here, and here.

424
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:45,903
But there's nothing above
Jang Do Jang's head.

425
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:48,203
Let's take a look.

426
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:54,473
Excuse me.

427
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,173
Do we have any other suspects?

428
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:14,873
Not yet.

429
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:18,373
The only working security
camera was at the entrance.

430
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,833
No one else was on it
other than Detective Ha.

431
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,673
So the other cameras were
broken just in time.

432
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:26,973
This is interesting.

433
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:34,073
(Experimental pills)

434
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,503
That's fake blood.

435
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,203
Where did you get that?

436
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,273
170.

437
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:49,473
175.

438
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:50,933
180.

439
00:32:55,803 --> 00:32:58,133
It looks like the blood was dropped from...

440
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,433
Okay.

441
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:03,732
His height is 180cm.

442
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,173
Age, from the late 30s to early 40s.

443
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:09,303
The deep wound shows it's a man with power.

444
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,503
He weighs around 90kg...

445
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:14,103
and he's not used to using a knife.

446
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:15,933
It's probably his first time.

447
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,033
He stabbed him four times.

448
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,773
A lot of blood must have splattered.

449
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:22,833
You're right.

450
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:25,072
He must have looked for...

451
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,903
a place to wash up and get changed.

452
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,633
I saw a restroom over there.

453
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:36,503
I'm not sure if you'll like it, Ms. Yoo.

454
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,603
It had no toilet papers.

455
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:44,033
Was that a joke?

456
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:45,503
Sure.

457
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:18,073
His clothes were probably covered in blood,

458
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:20,103
but he didn't throw them away here.

459
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:23,403
There must be traces left elsewhere.

460
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,103
Jang Do Jang was a guy who
knew how to use a knife.

461
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,373
Don't you think...

462
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,033
he let go of the knife too easily?

463
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:40,273
His defense marks weren't severe.

464
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:42,203
He didn't really fight back.

465
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:45,403
We should run it by the
National Forensic Service,

466
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:47,372
but the victim was blood type A...

467
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,773
and no other blood types were found.

468
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:51,203
It'll have to be a gun...

469
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,773
for him to give over the knife so easily.

470
00:34:56,673 --> 00:35:00,073
And it's probably a person he believed...

471
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:03,673
would not kill him so easily.

472
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,533
For example, it could be a detective.

473
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:48,903
Blood type A.

474
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:53,343
He made a call here.

475
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:56,803
He reported the case to the police.

476
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:00,403
Then the police came right away.

477
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,303
To infer from your hypothesis,

478
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:17,203
this person checked to see
if the police got here,

479
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,233
then somewhere from this building...

480
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,502
Height, 180cm.

481
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,473
Weight, around 90kg.

482
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,133
A detective who's more used
to a gun than a knife.

483
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,203
A detective who came onto the scene...

484
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,133
a bit later than the other officers.

485
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:47,842
Why aren't you controlling the scene?

486
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,503
- I apologize.
- Don't let strangers in.

487
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,502
Please come out.

488
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,133
Oh, okay. Fine.

489
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:00,533
My goodness.

490
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,203
I'm sorry that the scene is so chaotic.

491
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:06,133
I heard you're a profiler
at the headquarters.

492
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,733
You look better in real person than on TV.

493
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,073
Thanks.

494
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:14,843
Here.

495
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,603
You're a lefty.

496
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:21,373
Pardon?

497
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,603
Can I have a look at your hand?

498
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,303
It won't take a minute.

499
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:32,473
What do you think you're doing?

500
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:35,303
Get a warrant.

501
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:43,033
The killer isn't that detailed.

502
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,433
He'll have left evidence elsewhere.

503
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,273
Let go of me.

504
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:10,573
Your job is to stop
people from trespassing.

505
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,372
Officer Hong, the cameras
might have caught the killer.

506
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:47,873
Can you get the footage?

507
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,203
Okay. I'll come right over.

508
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:54,203
I'll see if there are any
other security cameras.

509
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,002
They're gone.

510
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,173
Did someone take them?

511
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:23,473
Some detectives came and took them.

512
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:26,903
Detective Ko was on it.

513
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:28,873
Did he have a beard?

514
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:41,603
The bloody clothes are
the only evidence left.

515
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:45,533
He joined the team after he had changed.

516
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:47,273
Where did he dispose of them?

517
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:50,273
He wouldn't have thrown
it away just anywhere.

518
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:52,173
The trunk of his car?

519
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,403
It's a safe place.

520
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:58,003
Very private.

521
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,843
Did you see the footage?

522
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:06,873
No, but I did see who took it.

523
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:08,373
Was it Detective Ko?

524
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:15,602
We'll need a warrant...

525
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:17,272
to get into the trunk.

526
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:19,132
He parked illegally,

527
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,672
so I had it towed.

528
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:23,233
Can we open it at the impound lot?

529
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,433
That's also illegal...

530
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,203
without a warrant.

531
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,973
This is insane.

532
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,203
(Shinim Impound Lot)

533
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:14,873
He opened it as you said he would.

534
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:20,533
(Shinim Impound Lot)

535
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:27,572
The evidence is ours.

536
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:29,402
You're under arrest for the
murder of Jang Do Jang.

537
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,703
Get off me!

538
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:33,733
Don't move! Freeze!

539
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:53,402
Murder suspect Lieutenant
Ko Jae Heon fled the scene.

540
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:54,733
Put him on the wanted list.

541
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:07,073
We have evidence that Detective Ko did it.

542
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:09,403
Well done.

543
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:15,703
Inspector Woo took it to the
National Forensic Service.

544
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,773
You'll be released when
the results are out.

545
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:20,903
But...

546
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:25,873
Detective Ko got away.

547
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:30,403
Keep a leash on Seol Ok, so
she doesn't go after him.

548
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:32,573
No one knows what he'll do.

549
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:34,673
Okay, I'll remember that.

550
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:42,303
What did he say when you
told him he'll be out soon?

551
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,672
Did he thank me?

552
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:49,133
Well... He told me to keep
you on a tight leash.

553
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,033
I'm the one who cleared his name.

554
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,933
Give me a call when he's released.

555
00:42:57,903 --> 00:42:58,903
Bye.

556
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:05,033
I saved his life.

557
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:09,103
He was getting cabin fever in that cell.

558
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:18,032
There's evidence that Detective Ko did it.

559
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,873
Why won't they release Detective Ha?

560
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:22,572
I don't know.

561
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:24,872
The blood in the public
toilet and phone booth...

562
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:27,003
belonged to Jang Do Jang.

563
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,633
So...

564
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:31,503
why are the superintendent and chief...

565
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,703
asking to see you one after the other?

566
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,433
Is it a cover-up?

567
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:42,572
I did my job thoroughly...

568
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:45,833
and said I would report
my findings by the book.

569
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,672
Corporal Park, you're suspected of...

570
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:53,573
corruption related to equipment supplies.

571
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,703
You need to come with us.

572
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,473
What do you mean? I did...

573
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,603
what with equipment supplies?

574
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:08,873
Yes, Captain.

575
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,193
A corruption related to equipment supplies?

576
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:13,803
Yes.

577
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,733
Things are looking very strange.

578
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:20,432
Are you at the National Forensic Service?

579
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:21,933
Yes, I'm just outside.

580
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:25,533
(Recent call)

581
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:28,333
I'll call you back. Bye.

582
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:33,203
Inspector Woo.

583
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:35,033
Detective Ko?

584
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,372
Can Wan Seung leave when
the results arrive?

585
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:42,373
Yes.

586
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,902
- Inspector Woo.
- Hello.

587
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:54,733
Did you leave the clothes at the NFS?

588
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:56,403
What?

589
00:44:57,603 --> 00:44:59,233
Detective Ko's bloody clothes.

590
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:01,033
We procured them from the tow yard.

591
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:04,733
We talked on the phone.

592
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,473
I don't know what you're talking about.

593
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,603
What's going on?

594
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:14,273
I have work to do inside.

595
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,833
Hey.

596
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:26,303
What's he up to?

597
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:02,233
You scumbag. I told you.

598
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,003
I'm sorry.

599
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,233
Hello? Mr. Kim.

600
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:24,433
I dealt with it.

601
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:51,533
Come along.

602
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:57,803
- Save me.
- Move.

603
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:14,533
Inspector Woo got rid of the clothes.

604
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,703
It was the only way to get you out.

605
00:47:24,873 --> 00:47:25,973
Why are you here?

606
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:31,073
Do whatever Ha And Jung Law Firm wants.

607
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:35,703
Do you work for them too?

608
00:47:36,173 --> 00:47:38,403
Is that why you destroyed the evidence?

609
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:41,179
I don't work for them,

610
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:42,932
and I didn't destroy evidence.

611
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:44,333
How can I trust you?

612
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:52,033
Detective Ha, you must believe
what I'm about to say.

613
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:57,233
You need Ha And Jung's
help to save Seol Ok.

614
00:47:58,633 --> 00:47:59,673
Seol Ok?

615
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,133
What about her?

616
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,833
Detective Ko abducted her.

617
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:19,473
Bring me the clothes you took.

618
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:21,933
Come alone.

619
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,673
You know what'll happen
to Seol Ok if you don't.

620
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,103
The time and location...

621
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:31,003
He sounds anxious.

622
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:34,303
He's very likely to do something drastic.

623
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:38,603
One wrong move could put Seol Ok in danger.

624
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:43,003
Detective Ko works for Ha And Jung.

625
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:45,579
How do you know that?

626
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:47,633
That's not important.

627
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:54,933
Detective Ha!

628
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,133
Inspector Woo.

629
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,233
Hey, it's Wan Seung.

630
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,003
I'll be there. I have the clothes.

631
00:49:03,503 --> 00:49:05,303
What are you and Inspector Woo up to?

632
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:08,533
Your business is with me and Seol Ok.

633
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:11,173
Is that so?

634
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,833
Come alone.

635
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,203
I'm a fugitive myself.

636
00:49:15,473 --> 00:49:17,073
Would I bring a team?

637
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,802
In return, Seol Ok...

638
00:49:19,803 --> 00:49:21,073
Be here by 6pm.

639
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:23,003
She'll be safe until then.

640
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,803
That scumbag.

641
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:32,573
I'll save her.

642
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:35,603
What can you do from here?

643
00:49:42,103 --> 00:49:43,773
Are you all right?

644
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,933
Detective Ha. Help him.

645
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,273
Detective Ha.

646
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:54,233
Detective Ha. Stay with me.

647
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:58,603
(Blood for testing)

648
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:01,403
Don't use it too much. It's expensive.

649
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:04,602
Don't people think you're weird...

650
00:50:04,603 --> 00:50:06,273
if you carry this around?

651
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,073
No, you're weirder.

652
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,103
It looks so real.

653
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:16,533
That's more than enough.

654
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:19,673
Detective Ha. Detective Ha.

655
00:50:20,373 --> 00:50:22,773
Are you okay? Detective Ha!

656
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:24,833
Detective Ha.

657
00:50:28,103 --> 00:50:29,972
- Stop screaming.
- Save me!

658
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:31,333
Stop it already.

659
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,103
No one's looking.

660
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,533
Really?

661
00:50:38,273 --> 00:50:40,132
This is hard work.

662
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,303
My throat's sore.

663
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:44,033
Did you have to use so much blood?

664
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,232
Detective Ha! Be strong!

665
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:51,172
He's losing blood!

666
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,402
I feel dizzy. Save me!

667
00:50:53,403 --> 00:50:55,133
I feel so dizzy.

668
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:38,503
I'm off.

669
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:32,773
I see.

670
00:52:34,603 --> 00:52:35,933
- Shall we?
- Sure.

671
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:38,433
Dad.

672
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:47,533
Detective Ha, get out.

673
00:53:08,473 --> 00:53:09,503
Dad.

674
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:12,303
Let me through.

675
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,033
This is your last chance.

676
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:20,673
If you go with the police,
you'll become a murderer.

677
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:23,103
If you come home,

678
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:26,273
everything will go back to normal.

679
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:31,773
There's nothing...

680
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,273
I can do for you now.

681
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:37,733
Dad.

682
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:44,233
I'll do everything you want.

683
00:53:45,403 --> 00:53:47,233
I'll live the life you want me to.

684
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:50,373
Please...

685
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:52,873
let me through.

686
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:06,803
Hello?

687
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:21,033
Put your guns down.

688
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:23,633
Let's go.

689
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:16,033
Hyun Soo. Hyun Soo. Hyun Soo.

690
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,673
Wake up. No, Hyun Soo.

691
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:21,933
Hyun Soo.

692
00:56:43,173 --> 00:56:44,802
If you go in now, it will put her at risk.

693
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:46,172
It's worse to leave her alone.

694
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,402
Detective Ha's lost it.

695
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,903
No one knows what he'll do.

696
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:50,803
Captain!

697
00:57:13,603 --> 00:57:14,833
Are you not coming?

698
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,303
Are you kidding me?

699
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:19,133
Do you think I'm joking?

700
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:29,173
What are you trying to do?

701
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:31,173
I'm almost there. Wait a bit more.

702
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:35,233
Darn you. I told you to come by yourself.

703
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:37,533
Did you think I'll fall for this again?

704
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:39,833
I am by myself. No one knows.

705
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:43,473
Hey, Seol Ok's blood is in your hands.

706
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,033
No!
