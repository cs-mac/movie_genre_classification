1
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,478
What are you trying to do, Walter?

2
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,695
Nothing tricky, dear.

3
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,188
Just husband and wife stuff.

4
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,612
Oh, you make me feel so used.

5
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,907
Why can't you do what
considerate husbands do?

6
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,905
What do considerate husbands do?

7
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,076
They jog.

8
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,745
I'm 41 years old, Vivian.

9
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,209
Who knows when the magic
will leave my body,

10
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,171
then will be the time to start jogging.

11
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,008
You have no right to force me, Walter.

12
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,721
The Bible says, woe unto
the wife who turneth her back

13
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,680
on a horny spouse.

14
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,926
The Bible doesn't say that, Walter.

15
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,177
It did a long time ago.

16
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,520
It was edited out by a lesbian translator.

17
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,855
Vivian, I want you.

18
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,270
Walter, you're scaring me!

19
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,518
Nothing to be afraid of, sweet baby.

20
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,148
It's just an old friend
coming for a visit.

21
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,193
Open the door.

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,236
Walter!

23
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,485
I said open the door!

24
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,111
Would you get off?

25
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,206
Buenos dias, Bianca.

26
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,416
Buenos dias, Senora Whitney.

27
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,756
Gracias.

28
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,304
Who the hell was that?

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,518
That was Bianca, the new housekeeper.

30
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,183
New housekeeper, where's Estelle?

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,555
Walter, I had to fire her.

32
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,852
But I liked her.

33
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,691
She kept forgetting her place.

34
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,811
Bianca just arrived from Guatemala.

35
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,359
Everyone's importing them from
Central America these days.

36
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,574
They don't resent being
treated like servants.

37
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,613
Why don't you import a husband

38
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,829
who doesn't mind being
treated like a servant!

39
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,620
That's what I feel like,
like I don't really belong.

40
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,208
Walter, you know how uncomfortable I get

41
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,954
when you just barge into the bathroom.

42
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,580
What are you ashamed of Vivian?

43
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,958
What is there to see that
I haven't already seen?

44
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,880
Whether you want to admit it or not,

45
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,298
I've seen you naked, Vivian.

46
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,217
I've even laid you, Vivian.

47
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,716
Must you use that language
in the bedroom, Walter?

48
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,969
This is not some cheap bar!

49
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,891
I could get more action in a cheap bar

50
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,230
than I get here!

51
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,935
Good morning, Mother.

52
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,902
Good morning, darling.

53
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,527
Mwah.

54
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,743
Morning, Walter.

55
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,953
Mary Ann.

56
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,572
Mother, is it alright if
I go shopping this morning?

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,825
Of course, darling, as
long as you're home by 6:00.

58
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,794
Shopping, you don't need new clothes.

59
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,289
Walter says I don't
need any new clothes.

60
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,790
Of course you do, darling.

61
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,963
I'll talk with him later.

62
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,266
You committed a moral
crime this morning!

63
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,054
Vivian!

64
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,345
That's why we're having all this trouble

65
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,346
in the country today.

66
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,815
We're a nation of
sex-starved, frustrated men,

67
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,186
so we jog and vote for the death penalty!

68
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,276
I was shocked, Walter.

69
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,694
Shocked.

70
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,237
I did not try to rape my wife

71
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,737
in front of the housekeeper, Nelson.

72
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,283
Whatever my faults, I don't lack a sense

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,701
of the theatrical.

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,745
I majored in theater arts.

75
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,835
Now if I try to rape the
housekeeper in front of my wide,

76
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,079
that's drama.

77
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,672
My daughter was
in tears when she called me.

78
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,088
She had no right to call you.

79
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,962
Vivian's concern is your career, Walter.

80
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,057
Her upbringing has stressed
the importance of that career.

81
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,975
Beware the wife who places
the bed ahead of the office.

82
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,517
I've seen a dozen careers ruined

83
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,437
because of sexually aggressive wives.

84
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,901
A wise man can always make
discrete arrangements.

85
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,362
I'm not the type of man who
goes out cheating, Nelson.

86
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,776
Not cheating, Walter.

87
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,819
Not cheating.

88
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:13,785
Think of it as easing the
pressures on someone you love.

89
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,161
You're a lucky man, Walter.

90
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,413
Then why don't I feel lucky?

91
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,256
Vivian, Mary Ann.

92
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,002
There's something wrong, Nelson.

93
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,254
I feel like I've blown
up a beautiful balloon,

94
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,005
but I'm on the inside.

95
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,257
I'm lonely.

96
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,431
Learn to trust unhappiness, Walter.

97
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,929
You and I have shared many secrets.

98
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,431
I'll share today's
secret by forgetting it.

99
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,479
Go throw yourself into your work.

100
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,192
I've never seen a
happily married executive

101
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,982
that was worth a damn.

102
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,030
Thank you.

103
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,495
Hold on please, I'll see if he's in.

104
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,830
Oh, Mr. Whitney, there's
a young man at reception

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,119
who wants to see you.

106
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,333
A Roger Porter.

107
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,748
I don't know a Roger Porter.

108
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,166
Mr. Whitney, he says to tell you

109
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,381
he's Lorraine Porter's son.

110
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,339
Have him sent up.

111
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,264
Lorraine Porter's son.

112
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:31,862
Lorraine.

113
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,906
Lorraine Porter.

114
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,453
Yeah.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,496
Mr. Whitney, he's here.

116
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,039
Have him come in.

117
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,508
Lorraine Porter's son?

118
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,181
Yeah.

119
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,183
Yeah, this is cool.

120
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,311
Nothing ratty-tatty about this place.

121
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,606
And that's the way it should be up here

122
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,196
where the hog is fat.

123
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,031
No meat scraps.

124
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,243
We're talking T-bone steak here, huh?

125
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,406
And man, you're it, huh?

126
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,784
The big ace in the card deck.

127
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,623
Mmm-whee!

128
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:30,045
I'm sure glad our zodiac signs crossed.

129
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,008
It's like my horoscope said,

130
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,803
Capricorn, baby, consolidate
your financial future today.

131
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,889
Here I was, thinking I
was just another little

132
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,679
poor black orphan boy going to freeze

133
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,848
in the cold white world.

134
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,596
Lorraine...

135
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,017
Your mother's dead?

136
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,811
Gone.

137
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,444
Oh, I can't tell you how sorry...

138
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,814
I'm truly and deeply sorry.

139
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,816
Uh huh.

140
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,534
She was a very special person.

141
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,778
A dear friend.

142
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,574
Uh huh.

143
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,410
What about your father?

144
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,704
Oh, Mom never got married.

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,202
You know it is with us colored folks.

146
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,874
We ain't much for marrying.

147
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,417
What the hell kind of
thing is that to say?

148
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,416
You don't talk that way about your mother.

149
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,588
Of course not being
married didn't make my mother

150
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,676
less of a woman.

151
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,012
It just made my father less of a man.

152
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,177
I don't like you, Mr. Porter.

153
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,016
I've tolerated your incredible display

154
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,763
of bad manners because your
mother and I were friends.

155
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,809
Dear friends.

156
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,516
Someone I knew very well.

157
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,108
No, you lived with her.

158
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,068
But you didn't know her.

159
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,064
Come on, let's lay it
on each other straight.

160
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,657
Let's tell it like it was.

161
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,992
I don't believe it.

162
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,078
Lorraine was a lovely person.

163
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,038
Intelligent, cultured...

164
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,249
It's just too much of a shock for me

165
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,413
to accept you as her son.

166
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,332
Well, if that's too
much of a shock for you,

167
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,050
you're liable to go into a
coma when you get behind this.

168
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,797
Hi, Daddy.

169
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,525
Hey!

170
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,554
Your son?

171
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,318
There's things about me
I never told you, Victor.

172
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,191
And you're my dearest friend.

173
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,160
I guess that's how we
keep our dearest friends.

174
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,124
By only telling them the things
that make us dear to them.

175
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,371
You didn't know about Lorraine,

176
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,496
or about me changing my name.

177
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,917
Changing your name?

178
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,541
From Weisenthal to Whitney.

179
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,542
Weisenthal.

180
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,170
What sort of name is that?

181
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,717
It's Jewish.

182
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,519
You better have a drag.

183
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,682
You'll feel better.

184
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,679
It's too late.

185
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,680
Too late!

186
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,478
Oh come off it, you're
not in that kind of trouble.

187
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,227
I'm Jewish, my son is black,
and my lawyer smokes pot.

188
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,069
Don't tell me I'm not in trouble.

189
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,358
Hey, it makes me feel better

190
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,027
and does not affect my judgment.

191
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,275
I delivered the valedictorian speech

192
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,493
at Harvard completely stoned!

193
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,861
Okay, okay!

194
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,909
Get me out of this spot,
Victor, and I'll keep you

195
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,657
in grass the rest of your life.

196
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,703
You provide the facts,

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,451
I'll provide the solution.

198
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,624
Now who knows you changed your name?

199
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,338
Just Vivian and her father.

200
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,424
It was his idea.

201
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,837
And who knows about Lorraine?

202
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,710
Just Vivian's father.

203
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,473
After I got out of the Army,
I went to Northwestern.

204
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,593
I met Lorraine in my sophomore year.

205
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,516
We lived together almost three years.

206
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,141
After I graduated, I
came here to Unilectron

207
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,851
as a copywriter.

208
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,273
It was gonna be temporary
until I made enough

209
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,896
so that we could get married.

210
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,693
Married?

211
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,116
Oh, yeah.

212
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,657
The only problem was, I made
an instant smashing success.

213
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,452
I was kidding around
one day, and I came up

214
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,042
with this idea for fun, the
biggest lie I could think of.

215
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:38,460
Unilectron, the Company That
Puts People Ahead Of Profit.

216
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,456
Was that yours?

217
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,298
Yeah.

218
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,132
That's a biggie.

219
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,216
Two weeks later, I
was a junior executive.

220
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,134
And then, like everything
else, Vivian's father

221
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,802
found out about Lorraine.

222
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,016
Oh no.

223
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,099
Oh yeah.

224
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:50,934
What'd he do?

225
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,805
He had a father-to-son talk with me.

226
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,182
No, it was more like the Pope

227
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,651
talking to a parish priest.

228
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,112
Someday you will sit
in this chair, Walter.

229
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,858
He promised
the priest the Vatican.

230
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,029
I'm only showing the
concern your mother and father

231
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,369
would show if they were alive.

232
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,988
He slipped
on my parent's ghosts

233
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,206
like you would an overcoat.

234
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,916
As your mistress, yes.

235
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,376
But not marriage.

236
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,041
He moralized.

237
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,130
She would never be
accepted by the right people.

238
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,590
The fear of the unknown.

239
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,629
As the wife of a
plumber, a garage mechanic,

240
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,470
an elevator operator, fine.

241
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,805
A veiled threat
to my future employment.

242
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,219
We wouldn't want to lose you.

243
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,138
A direct threat.

244
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,386
I am not a bigot.

245
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,682
He believed.

246
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,180
But I am a realist.

247
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,522
From that day I've
never known the difference

248
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,437
between those words.

249
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,605
I am your friend.

250
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,147
He insisted.

251
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,396
There might be a child.

252
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,571
The image we leave of ourselves
on this earth after death.

253
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,364
Think about that, Walter.

254
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,737
I said nothing.

255
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,410
You're in love,

256
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,533
but not for the last time.

257
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,123
That's what makes man superior.

258
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,168
He can love, forget, then love again.

259
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,837
Write to her.

260
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,757
Tell her that getting
married at the moment

261
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,630
would not be practical.

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,092
She'll understand.

263
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,389
They're a very understanding people.

264
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,603
I wrote the letter.

265
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,142
She never answered.

266
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,017
After she died, Roger found
all the letters I'd written.

267
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,646
How could a dude write
all these pretty words?

268
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,692
Just dripping with honey!

269
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,783
Man, they could make a nun pack a suitcase

270
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,493
and blow the convent.

271
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,321
I think you showed damn little respect

272
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,244
for your mother by reading these letters.

273
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,414
Not as little as you
showed by writing them, Dad.

274
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,083
And stop calling me Dad.

275
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,753
Who told you that I'm, that we're related?

276
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,126
After I found the
letters I asked Aunt Clara.

277
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,798
You remember Mom's sister, Aunt Clara.

278
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,341
Yeah, I remember Aunt Clara.

279
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,136
Well, Mom went to stay with
Aunt Clara when she got...

280
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,303
that way.

281
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,721
And you know Aunt Clara would never lie,

282
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,310
not with her husband being
a preacher, the highest...

283
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,145
Okay, okay.

284
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,482
I won't argue the fact that you're my son.

285
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,693
You're a good sport, Dad.

286
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,817
This is a moment that
calls for total honesty.

287
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,570
Nothing but the truth.

288
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,698
We both agree that this
is a delicate situation.

289
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,493
I think we would both agree to keep

290
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,121
this delicate news to ourselves.

291
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,499
Oh, you mean now we found each other

292
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,217
we're not going to tell anyone?

293
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,507
Who would we tell?

294
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,097
Well, I guess first your wife.

295
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,233
Stop following me.

296
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,075
Isn't a son supposed to
follow in his dad's footsteps?

297
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,363
Why are we walking by the ocean anyhow?

298
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,239
In case I decide to throw myself in.

299
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,459
When do we go home and
tell the family about me?

300
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,421
Do you really expect
to come and live with us?

301
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,959
Are you ashamed of me, Dad?

302
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,548
And stop calling me Dad!

303
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,087
Well, what am I supposed to call you?

304
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,210
Well, I don't know.

305
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,210
Whitey.

306
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,257
Honky.

307
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,345
Mr. Charlie.

308
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,840
Anything, but not Dad!

309
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,513
Not right now.

310
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,102
It's something I'm gonna
have to get used to.

311
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,312
Slowly.

312
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,101
If ever.

313
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,684
Good morning, Whitey!

314
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,858
Hi there, Honky.

315
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,275
No, that's no way for a
boy to talk to his father.

316
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,151
It sounds disrespectful.

317
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,577
And whatever else I may
feel, I respect you.

318
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,539
Mr. Charlie.

319
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,460
It has a certain dignity.

320
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,171
Makes me still feel like your
son, flesh of your flesh,

321
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,585
blood of your blood.

322
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,128
Mistake of my mistakes.

323
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,048
You'll feel different after adopt me.

324
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,011
Adopt you?

325
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,339
Yeah, I'm 17.

326
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,716
It's time I became legal.

327
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,092
No way, no how.

328
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,269
I know I'm not everything
you want in a son.

329
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,392
That's a keen observation.

330
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,234
We'll become buddies.

331
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,695
We'll go to games.

332
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,232
We'll go fishing and hiking.

333
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,951
We'll wrestle on the floor together

334
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,411
We'll become pals.

335
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,744
You can teach me how to
build a model airplane.

336
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,539
I'll show you how to pick a lock.

337
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,788
You take me to a Chamber
of Commerce meeting.

338
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,882
I'll take you to a third-world
liberation meeting.

339
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,501
Why are you doing this to me, God?

340
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,004
There's this boy who
claims to be your son.

341
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,630
He is my son.

342
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,806
I think a judge is better
qualified to make that decision.

343
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,348
I can't deny it.

344
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,770
Not because he's my son but
because Lorraine was his mother.

345
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,109
I loved her, but I really can't remember

346
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,819
what she looked like.

347
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,814
We used to laugh a lot,

348
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,693
but I can't remember what about.

349
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,446
There were so many moments.

350
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,991
It was so long ago.

351
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,870
Oh God.

352
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,076
To be young again

353
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,999
with a lover that says yes.

354
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,465
Well unfortunately, you're in San Marino

355
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,333
with a wife who says no.

356
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,506
Now, you may not love Vivian,

357
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,802
but a husband owes his wife some loyalty.

358
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,549
Well, what does a father owe his son?

359
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,971
You know what I mean.

360
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,810
Vivian, my wife, all those women.

361
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,898
They're social animals whose
jungle ends at the city limits.

362
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,065
Now, you want to toss those
tigers this kind of raw meat?

363
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,061
That's it.

364
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,062
That's the answer.

365
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,063
They're animals.

366
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,064
Don't appeal to their intellect.

367
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,191
Appeal to their instinct!

368
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,317
Their instinct is to kill.

369
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,320
Their basic instinct is to kill.

370
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,663
What about their baser instincts?

371
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,952
Envy, ego, false pride?

372
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,575
What are you talking about?

373
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,124
Let Vivian adopt without ever knowing.

374
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,123
Let it be her victory, not my defeat.

375
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,924
Take in a colored orphan for the summer?

376
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,296
It's an experimental program

377
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,641
to show underprivileged
kids a better way of life.

378
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,010
But if they see a better way of life,

379
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,558
they're gonna want it permanently.

380
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,430
Why give them false hope?

381
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,807
It seems so cruel

382
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,399
No more cruel than busing.

383
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,688
And you accepted that.

384
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,857
Only because it didn't affect Mary Ann.

385
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,321
Oh, Walter why us?

386
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,360
Why must you get us involved in this?

387
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,657
We owe it to them, Vivian.

388
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,281
When will we stop owing?

389
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,749
They already have
welfare, low rent housing,

390
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,618
special job programs,

391
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,497
and four of their own television series.

392
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,466
When will we stop owing and be even?

393
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,632
Vivian, it's just for
the summer vacation.

394
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,679
We'll be the only family
in San Marino to have one.

395
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,927
That's what disturbs me.

396
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,599
Disturbs you?

397
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,222
Cynthia Robbins will be so green with envy

398
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,271
She'll probably go out and adopt one.

399
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,643
That's true, isn't it?

400
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,317
What about Gloria Pitcan,
and Elizabeth Webner?

401
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,814
You think they'll let you and Cynthia

402
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,157
get a step ahead of them?

403
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,367
Even if they all go out
and adopt colored orphans

404
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,360
for the summer.

405
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,331
It won't diminish the fact
that you did it first.

406
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,575
Like the heart transplant.

407
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,622
No matter how many
doctors do it afterwards,

408
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,747
it's always Dr. Christian
Barnard who will take the credit.

409
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,376
You'll be the Christian
Barnard of compassion.

410
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,503
You can even start an organization.

411
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,005
Call it Human Transplant.

412
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,474
To take people with no hope
and give them new life.

413
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,343
Human Transplant. ah.

414
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,224
I'll bring him over and
you can see for yourself

415
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,021
what a fine boy he is.

416
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,942
He could sleep in your
workshop in the garage

417
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,484
until we decide.

418
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,824
Just in case it doesn't work out.

419
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,159
Good idea.

420
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,824
It's easier to ask someone
to leave your garage

421
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,492
than it is your home.

422
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,871
I just don't dig it, Mr. Charlie.

423
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,543
I mean, the way you're
getting me to be family,

424
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,586
this whole adoption bit.

425
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,255
Me sleeping in the garage.

426
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,423
I told you, it's just temporary.

427
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,466
Well it just don't seem right,

428
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,009
making believe I'm an orphan.

429
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,132
You are an orphan.

430
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,132
No, I ain't.

431
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,133
I got a daddy.

432
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,180
Don't I, Mr. Charlie?

433
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,177
Get your feet off the seat.

434
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,475
This is a Rolls Royce, not a bus.

435
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,314
Hey, will I get the Rolls when you die?

436
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,024
It belongs to the company.

437
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,859
It will probably go to Mary Ann.

438
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,070
Oh, you like Mary Ann
more than you like me.

439
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,191
Far, far more, and I'm
not very fond of her.

440
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,661
Will you stop playing with that telephone?

441
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,826
Are you going to high school, Roger?

442
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,415
Uh-uh.

443
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,704
When did you leave?

444
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,247
About a year ago.

445
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,002
Have you ever thought of
going back and graduating?

446
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,215
Don't need to.

447
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,379
You don't need to, huh?

448
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,377
How far are you gonna get
with an attitude like that?

449
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,423
I'll make out.

450
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,796
You'll make out.

451
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,220
You know where you'll make
out without a diploma?

452
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,013
On the unemployment line.

453
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,885
I mean, outside of waiting for me to die,

454
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,432
you have no future.

455
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,979
Stop playing with the glove compartment.

456
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,362
You belong to a golf club, don't you?

457
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,027
What about my golf club?

458
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,275
Well, I can join it, can't I?

459
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,402
Only as a caddy.

460
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,995
Oh, you mean they don't
have no black members.

461
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,534
None.

462
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,285
Makes you proud,
doesn't it, Mr. Charlie?

463
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,331
What makes me proud?

464
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,378
That the first black to join
the club will be your son?

465
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,179
Do I have to wear these square clothes?

466
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,969
Yes, you have to wear them.

467
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,512
Why, if the brothers ever saw me,

468
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,181
they'll think I sold out.

469
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,177
Relax Roger.

470
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,147
There are no brothers in San Marino.

471
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,284
Mmm-mm!

472
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,776
So this is going to be my new home?

473
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,815
All right.

474
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,811
Just the garage.

475
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,784
I said, just the garage.

476
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,118
So this is Roger.

477
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,128
Mr. Whitney has told me so much about you.

478
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,588
Welcome to our home, Roger.

479
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,581
Thank you, ma'am.

480
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,582
It's an honor.

481
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,552
My, what a fine looking boy.

482
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,886
You were right, Walter.

483
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,097
I was worried over nothing.

484
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,386
You're just in time for dinner

485
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,352
Walter, will you tell Mary
Ann that we're expecting her?

486
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,140
Roger?

487
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,644
We're having chicken for dinner.

488
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,062
I just love chicken, ma'am.

489
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,276
I know you do.

490
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,941
I had Bianca prepare
it especially for you.

491
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,316
We want you to enjoy
your stay with us, Roger.

492
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,487
Thank you, ma'am.

493
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,860
You don't have to call me, ma'am.

494
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,987
Just Mrs. Whitney.

495
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,615
Mrs. Whitney?

496
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,615
Thank you.

497
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,227
It's an exciting experiment.

498
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,399
When Mr. Whitney first
broached it, I'll admit,

499
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,863
I was a little dubious.

500
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,573
But then I realized
that I'd be giving a boy

501
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,365
a second chance in life, a
chance to improve himself.

502
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,205
And you will try to improve
yourself, won't you Roger?

503
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,948
Oh, yes, ma'am.

504
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,167
Mrs. Whitney.

505
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,706
We want to be proud of you, Roger

506
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,750
We'll see if we can't get our church

507
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,874
to accept you as a member.

508
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,752
You'll be a Presbyterian,
Roger, isn't that nice?

509
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,879
Well, I was raised to
be a Baptist, and I...

510
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,097
You'll be a Presbyterian.

511
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,348
About your schooling, Roger.

512
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,764
How far along are you in high school?

513
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,761
I don't go to high school.

514
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,604
We'll give him remedial schooling

515
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,473
and then a job training program.

516
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,440
Excellent.

517
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,604
This is going to be an
exciting summer, Roger.

518
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,446
Well, what do you think, Mary Ann?

519
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,988
Shall we adopt Roger for the summer?

520
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,031
Have you ever been arrested?

521
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,826
That's an offensive question, Mary Ann.

522
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,540
Yes, little sister, I've
been busted by the pigs.

523
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,409
Roger, in our community,

524
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,333
the pigs are known as police officers.

525
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,003
Well, where I come from,
they're always known as...

526
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,466
Police officers.

527
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,302
Police officers.

528
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,386
Why were you arrested, Roger?

529
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,509
Well, I was walking
along in a protest march

530
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,011
against the Klan,

531
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,354
singing the second verse
of We Shall Overcome,

532
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,104
We know the song, Roger.

533
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,774
And then this man stepped off the sidewalk

534
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,198
and hit me over the head with a lead pipe.

535
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,911
Well, needless to say, I fell down,

536
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,280
and he started kicking me,

537
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,031
and then the...

538
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,704
police officers arrested me.

539
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,418
Roger you must promise to never go on

540
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,289
one of those protest marches again,

541
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,087
or sing that Overcome song again.

542
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,210
Never?

543
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,633
Well, if you feel the
urge, you may sing it

544
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,926
in the privacy of your room.

545
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,640
Well, Mary Ann, do you approve of Roger?

546
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,854
I think we should ask Dennis first.

547
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:30,973
Yes.

548
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,190
Who's Dennis?

549
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,605
Dennis Erkle.

550
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,150
He's captain of the lacrosse team.

551
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,570
Why do we need Dennis Erkle's approval?

552
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,067
His father is Judge Erkle.

553
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,285
He's going to run for Superior Court.

554
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,280
And his chances might be jeopardized

555
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,625
if his son's fiancee has
him living in the house.

556
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,413
Fiancee?

557
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,037
Mary Ann and Dennis are going together,

558
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,414
sort of unofficially engaged.

559
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,550
Mary Ann, don't you think you should

560
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,885
inform your father about something

561
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,880
as important as an engagement?

562
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,176
I did.

563
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,924
I called Daddy in Westport,

564
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,846
and he gave me his blessing.

565
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,062
Not that father, me, your
legal father Walter Whitney,

566
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,771
who's clothed, fed and housed you,

567
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,140
while that drunk hasn't even bothered

568
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,484
to visit you in two years.

569
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,102
Mother, I will not sit here

570
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,606
and have Walter slander my father!

571
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,155
I just knew he'd cause trouble!

572
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,494
We're all a bit upset.

573
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,040
I think perhaps it's best we wait

574
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,415
until morning before taking a vote.

575
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,257
Vote? What vote?

576
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,752
On whether to take Roger into our home.

577
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,755
We discussed all that, Walter.

578
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,552
I never agreed to a vote.

579
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,550
It's our decision, just yours and mine.

580
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,018
Please, Walter I don't
want to argue the point.

581
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,638
I didn't take a vote
when I adopted Mary Ann.

582
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,390
She is my natural child.

583
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,562
It was the only decent thing to do.

584
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,561
By that logic, if he
were my natural son,

585
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,689
I'd have every right to expect
you, my wife, to accept him.

586
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,362
Don't make ludicrous parallels, Walter.

587
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,610
No, I mean it, Vivian.

588
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,158
If Roger were my son, you'd accept him?

589
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,328
Yes Walter, if he were
your son, of course.

590
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,453
All right, Vivian, I will let
you be as good as your word.

591
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,749
Roger is my son.

592
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,882
I don't find that very amusing, Walter.

593
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,376
Neither do I, but it
happens to be a fact.

594
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,844
That can't be.

595
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,929
He's.

596
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,798
And so was his mother

597
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,302
This is really your son?

598
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,433
Yes.

599
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,060
Your natural son?

600
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,896
Yes.

601
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,148
Oh, my God!

602
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,070
And to think I was going
to let him live here!

603
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,944
You promised to accept him
just as I accepted your child!

604
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,116
You tricked me!

605
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,330
- Vivian, listen!
- Don't touch me, Walter!

606
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,073
Don't ever touch me again.

607
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,245
You're getting hysterical!

608
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,165
God will never forgive you
for having a black child!

609
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,207
How do you know, Vivian?

610
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,295
Maybe he'll be pleased.

611
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,461
Maybe God is black?

612
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,711
You will burn in hell
for saying that, Walter.

613
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,761
Will you stop singing that song?

614
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,605
Mr. Charlie?

615
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,571
I got a feeling you better
start learning the words.

616
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,803
Where's the boy?

617
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,051
In the garage.

618
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:01,812
And Vivian?

619
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,071
Upstairs, with Dr. Bristol
and Reverend Hayworth.

620
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,740
How is she?

621
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,161
She's under sedation.

622
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,286
Reverend Hayworth is praying with her.

623
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,759
I even had to give Mary Ann tranquilizers.

624
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,887
I've been the Longhurst
family doctor for 40 years.

625
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,105
I delivered Vivian.

626
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,692
And to see her in this
state of shock is...

627
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,109
You must be a sadist to flaunt
a black son in front of her.

628
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,203
I didn't flaunt him.

629
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,366
And he's not black.

630
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,332
He's what interior decorators
call hickory bronze.

631
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,246
The same color as your new car.

632
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,370
I would just as soon you
did not compare that boy

633
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,496
to my new car.

634
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,219
I no longer consider myself
your personal physician.

635
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,885
And I would advise you not to get sick

636
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,099
in San Marino, Mr. Whitney.

637
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,114
Your father-in-law wants the family

638
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,334
to spend the night at his house.

639
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,080
I don't see God's book around, Walter.

640
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,797
I'm sorry.

641
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,168
Sorry is for those seeking forgiveness.

642
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,842
Are you seeking forgiveness, Walter?

643
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,305
Forgiveness for what, Reverend?

644
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,472
Vivian said you told
her that God is black.

645
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,186
I simply posed it as a possibility.

646
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,102
We don't speculate
on God's color, Walter.

647
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,895
If you ever want her
to speak to you again,

648
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,111
go upstairs and tell
her that God is white.

649
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,570
But we're really not sure!

650
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,530
I mean, the Hindus don't believe it.

651
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,944
The Moslems, the Buddhists.

652
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,032
God is white!

653
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,026
It's simple logic.

654
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,699
His Son is white.

655
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,741
That's not proof.

656
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,956
I'm white, my son is black!

657
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,995
I'll pray for you, Walter.

658
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:58,698
Walter, this is the most
critical night of your life.

659
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,914
I was beginning to get that feeling.

660
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,125
But one which you can easily survive,

661
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,837
provided we proceed with
delicacy and good taste.

662
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,422
And Roger is not good taste?

663
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,758
Someday, perhaps, but not at the moment.

664
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,003
Well when does Roger become fashionable?

665
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,549
Who makes those decisions?

666
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,593
People.

667
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,589
Me, you.

668
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,807
Me?

669
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,301
Have I been wrong all these years

670
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,679
in interpreting your silence as approval?

671
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,815
Ah, it's human.

672
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,103
People lean any way the wind blows.

673
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,697
The wind blows white, not black.

674
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,693
It blows Whitney, not Weisenthal

675
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,241
You must not legally recognize the boy.

676
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,863
As long as he is considered illegitimate,

677
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,990
society is not threatened.

678
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,544
Someday the torch of leadership, of power

679
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,334
will be passed to you.

680
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,583
We must feel confident
that when your turn comes

681
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,335
to pass on the torch,

682
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,677
you won't put it in the hands of someone

683
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,297
who'd burn down the country with it.

684
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,516
Pass on the torch to him?

685
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,970
I don't think of Roger as my future.

686
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,190
I even resent his being here.

687
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,105
But I have a serious problem, Nelson,

688
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,729
a flaw in my character.

689
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,027
I don't have the sense of commitment,

690
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,903
or strength, or courage
to look at him and say,

691
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,199
Go away, you never happened.

692
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,759
Walter, you were like a son to me.

693
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,971
But as you well know,
having a son can turn out

694
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,431
to be a bitter disappointment.

695
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,939
Mr. Charlie, hey, where you going?

696
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,735
To work.

697
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,234
If you're hungry, there's
food in the kitchen.

698
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,780
Otherwise, stay in your room.

699
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,199
Can I go swimming in the pool?

700
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,492
Maybe tomorrow.

701
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,582
Just stay in your room and read.

702
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,075
And if you can't read, just...

703
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,668
sit and draw pictures.

704
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,787
Mr. Charlie,

705
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,624
I want you to know that
no matter what happens,

706
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,343
I'm behind you 100 percent.

707
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,588
You can even rub my head for good luck.

708
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,136
I don't believe in superstitious myths.

709
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,099
There's no myth about black
people changing your luck.

710
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,389
Well you only met me yesterday,

711
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,139
and already your luck
has changed, hasn't it?

712
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,686
I never thought of it like that.

713
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,810
Get your hand off the car.

714
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,040
Sorry, Mr. Whitney, we can't let you in.

715
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,712
Can't let me in?

716
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,755
Orders from the man upstairs.

717
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,047
I'm the man upstairs.

718
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,840
Mm-mm.

719
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,301
Mr. Longhurst gave the order?

720
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,640
Yes, sir.

721
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,509
We also got orders to confiscate your car.

722
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,556
My car?

723
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,226
Yes sir, it's company property.

724
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,940
This is outrageous!

725
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,689
Hello.

726
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,271
I'd like to call my secretary.

727
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,649
You don't have a secretary anymore, sir.

728
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,331
Wardlow, executive security.

729
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,548
May I have your credit cards.

730
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,917
My credit cards?

731
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,463
Article 7 of your company contract.

732
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,007
Unilectron shall reserve the right

733
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,472
to revoke all issued
credit cards at any time.

734
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,138
May I have your credit cards, please?

735
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,243
Thank you, sir.

736
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,656
Have a nice day.

737
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,636
And then he took out these
scissors and cut me in half.

738
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,727
You don't know what it's
like to see yourself

739
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,346
lying there on the ground.

740
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,347
Roger, Mr. Charlie.

741
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,395
Has anyone been around this morning?

742
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,438
Man, have I been trying to reach you.

743
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,686
I called your office, and
they said you didn't even

744
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,312
work there anymore.

745
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,986
As soon as you left, the
whole family came back.

746
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,608
Cops, moving men, and everything.

747
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,451
It's a wild scene, Mr. Charlie.

748
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,821
All your suitcases are on the lawn.

749
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,119
They're putting my
suitcases on the lawn?

750
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,664
Not putting them, throwing them.

751
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,163
What about my golf clubs?

752
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,380
My fishing gear?

753
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,339
My dobro?

754
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,878
What's a dobro?

755
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,547
It's like a guitar.

756
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,633
Yeah, well they just threw
that on the lawn, too.

757
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,557
I've got feeling you ain't
welcome here, Mr. Charlie.

758
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,100
All right, now listen.

759
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,190
Call a cab, put everything in it,

760
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,649
and come down here to my lawyer

761
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,688
242 Comstock.

762
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,770
Got that, 242 Comstock.

763
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,025
She's throwing my things out of the house.

764
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,196
Yes, I know.

765
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,694
I advised her to do so.

766
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,412
Your dossier, Walter.

767
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,866
Tax returns, bank statements,

768
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,910
investments, insurance.

769
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,497
Everything.

770
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,050
You advised her?

771
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,220
You, my dearest friend?

772
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,338
My lawyer?

773
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,466
I'm still your dearest friend,
but no longer your lawyer.

774
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,469
I agreed to represent
Vivian in the divorce.

775
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,347
You agreed to represent vivian?

776
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:06,398
Oh dammit Walter, do you
think I like doing this?

777
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,611
You sold out.

778
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,699
I'm recommending an
attorney, Bob Garvey.

779
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,034
Because of the uniqueness of the case,

780
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:18,122
I think he's eminently
qualified to represent you.

781
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,209
I don't object to him
recommending you, Mr. Garvey.

782
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,125
I object to the reason he recommended you.

783
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,339
They're not gonna get away with this.

784
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,674
I'm gonna fight.

785
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,712
Fight, Mr. Whitney?

786
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,005
Fight with what?

787
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,671
Money, I've got money.

788
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,298
You mean have other funds
that aren't listed here?

789
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,347
Of course not, everything
I have is in there.

790
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,186
Where is the boy now?

791
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,146
Downstairs, waiting in the cab.

792
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,765
Is the meter running?

793
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,484
I mean, with a financial
statement like this,

794
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,025
I'd watch every nickel

795
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,445
There must be some
mistake, some misprint.

796
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,159
Your salary has gone
into a stock option plan,

797
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,620
which is in Vivian's name.

798
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,286
There's trust fund which
is in Mary Ann's name.

799
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,784
Your bank account is in Vivian's name.

800
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,334
Man, you don't even
have a checking account.

801
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,376
But I didn't need checks.

802
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,919
I had credit cards.

803
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,339
All right.

804
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,885
Cutting through all the talk,
Mr. Garvey, what am I worth?

805
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,100
How much have you got in your wallet?

806
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,309
$68.

807
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,645
You mean that's it?

808
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,109
That's it, baby.

809
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,023
I'm worth 68 dollars?

810
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,368
I know it's a very old
cliche, Mr. Whitney, but,

811
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,159
you've still got your health.

812
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,078
For 68 dollars, who wants it?

813
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,201
Well until we get them into court,

814
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,703
you can always collect unemployment.

815
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,704
I can't.

816
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,126
Not unemployment.

817
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,876
That's what they want to do, break me.

818
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,127
Well I'm not gonna give
them the satisfaction.

819
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,595
They're never going to
make me crawl, never!

820
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,048
And stop smiling!

821
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,846
Even you're beginning irritate me.

822
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,477
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

823
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,813
Oh, you don't have to apologize.

824
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,400
Social menopause is a
difficult time for a man.

825
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,860
Social menopause?

826
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,573
Yes, you're going through a
change of color, Mr. Whitney.

827
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,784
You don't want to play the
game as a white man, so...

828
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,326
they're gonna let you
watch it as a black man.

829
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,773
This is it?

830
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,855
It's got no swimming pool

831
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,402
Maybe they got a
tennis court in the back.

832
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,570
Stop complaining.

833
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,614
They got TV and free ice.

834
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,283
That'll be 22 dollars.

835
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,202
And checkout time is noon.

836
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,417
There'll be no dope, no
parties, no fighting.

837
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,583
Only people in the room
is them that paid for it.

838
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,171
Sounds fair enough.

839
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,290
Here you are.

840
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,586
Okay, room 13.

841
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,633
And if I give three short
rings on the telephone,

842
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,133
that means the vice squad is here.

843
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,509
The vice squad?

844
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,896
He happens to be my son.

845
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,449
I've heard them all, mister,
but that's cute.

846
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,783
Hey Daisy, fella out here says,

847
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:45,655
Wait till I tell you.

848
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,045
Hey, you have to put a
quarter in it to make it work.

849
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,085
They only promised free ice cubes.

850
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,082
I don't like ice cubes.

851
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,334
Stop whining and eat them.

852
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,210
Will you stop banging that set?

853
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,462
I gotta watch Starsky and Hutch.

854
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,553
We can't afford them.

855
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,219
Well, maybe some quarters will come out.

856
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,592
Roger, we do not steal.

857
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,093
It ain't stealing. I'll put
the quarters right back in.

858
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,141
We do not steal, Roger.

859
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,306
Sorry, Mr. Charlie,

860
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,274
just seemed like the natural thing to do.

861
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,521
Then we will have to
control our natural instincts.

862
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,648
Who told you to take that bed?

863
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,865
I can't sleep on a narrow bed.

864
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,234
Neither can I.

865
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,406
Well I don't get enough sleep,
I wake up with a headache.

866
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,870
Your health is expendable?

867
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,739
I'm the one that we gotta keep alive.

868
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,160
That bed is mine!

869
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,204
I got it first.

870
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,291
All right.

871
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,082
We'll let reason prevail.

872
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,579
We'll split the room in half.

873
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,128
The space between the beds
should be the dividing line.

874
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,796
Each man's half shall be his,

875
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,668
where he can do as he pleases,

876
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,511
and into which the other cannot
cross without permission.

877
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,846
Call it.

878
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,635
Heads.

879
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,346
Tails.

880
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,263
Take that bed and I'll take this.

881
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,939
I sure hope you get a good job

882
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,059
so we can find a decent place to live.

883
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,560
Don't worry about me.

884
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,439
I'll get a job, I've got friends.

885
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,338
Hey Walter come in, come in.

886
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,880
Sit down, sit down.

887
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,836
Where is he?

888
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,088
Where's who, Freddie?

889
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,214
Your son.

890
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,716
Who told you?

891
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,810
Vivian called Helen this morning.

892
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,520
Is he really as black as she says?

893
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,435
How does it feel, Walter?

894
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,104
Uncomfortable.

895
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,817
Freddie, I got to talk to you.

896
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,810
Vivian told Helen that

897
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,902
she threw you out of the house.

898
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,238
Yeah.

899
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,654
Look, I've got a favor to ask you.

900
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,117
Where are you and your son staying?

901
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,155
In a motel.

902
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,822
Freddie, I'm not with
Unilectron anymore.

903
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,701
Vivian told Helen they
took your Rolls Royce away.

904
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,668
Freddie, I need a job.

905
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,625
Nelson called the old
man this morning, Walter.

906
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,422
No chance, huh?

907
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,385
Your name is shit around here.

908
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,130
I appreciate that, Freddie, I mean it.

909
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,804
There's nothing worse than
being left up in the air.

910
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,097
I can loan you some money.

911
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,642
Vivian told Helen they
took everything you had.

912
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,311
Oh thanks, old buddy, but I'm fine.

913
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,433
I'm just fine.

914
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,110
Well, see you around.

915
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,693
See me around where, Walter?

916
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,233
That's true.

917
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,030
Where?

918
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,200
You want me to okay a
loan without collateral?

919
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,745
I'll pay it back, Tubby,
soon as I get a job.

920
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,492
2,000 dollars, that's a lot of money.

921
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,041
I said I'd pay it back.

922
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,631
No house, no car, no jewelry, no stocks.

923
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,375
You must have something

924
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,673
you can put up for security.

925
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,093
I'm putting up our friendship, Tubby.

926
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,059
15 years of friendship
guarantees I'll pay you back.

927
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,599
I'm giving you the ultimate collateral,

928
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,097
Walter Whitney's word.

929
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,101
But your name isn't Walter Whitney.

930
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,258
7.65 for food.

931
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,598
25 cents for the paper.

932
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,939
Bus fare, phone calls, lunch,
22 dollars for the room.

933
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,103
We're down to 30 bucks.

934
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,976
22 dollars again for the room tomorrow.

935
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,024
Phone calls, buses,

936
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,238
and it's caput.

937
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,573
Eat, enjoy!

938
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,695
This may become known as
the Second Last Supper.

939
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,037
What's this?

940
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,453
Cream cheese, bagel and lox.

941
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,540
Oh, what's lox?

942
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,659
Smoked fish.

943
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,040
I don't dig smoked fish.

944
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,037
Shut up and eat it.

945
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,040
It's soul food.

946
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,131
This is soul food?

947
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,171
To my group, yes.

948
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,511
You know, you're not the
only people who have soul.

949
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,679
That sandwich is the result
of 6,000 years of suffering.

950
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,016
I don't understand.

951
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,760
Don't understand what?

952
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,856
Well, if you're that
loyal to a sandwich,

953
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,521
how come you change your last name?

954
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,815
None of your business, Roger.

955
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,313
Oh being that your name is my name, too,

956
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,905
I just wanted to know
what I should call myself.

957
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,069
I mean, after you make me legal,

958
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,068
will I still be Roger Porter?

959
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,536
Whatever makes you happy.

960
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,825
Roger Whitney.

961
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,577
Yeah, that's style.

962
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,331
Sounds like I belong.

963
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,703
Roger Weisenthal.

964
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,415
No, it don't feel right.

965
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,462
I can just see everybody saying,

966
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,632
You don't look like no Weisenthal.

967
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,674
Hey, where you going?

968
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,671
Out.

969
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,672
You coming back?

970
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,551
Unless I get hit by a
car or struck by lightning.

971
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:02,225
But knowing my luck, I'll be back.

972
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,312
Here we go.

973
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,556
Get set.

974
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,557
Good shot.

975
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,399
Throw me the ball.

976
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,768
You cut underneath the
basket and I'll pass to you.

977
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,144
There you go, go!

978
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,187
No no no no.

979
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,029
Here, Dad.

980
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:12,863
Try one more.

981
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,442
I'll get it.

982
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,284
Throw it here.

983
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,118
What?

984
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:17,952
Cut underneath the basket.

985
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,786
- Okay, right now?
- Okay, here we go.

986
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,620
- Okay.
- Here you go.

987
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,864
Here you go.

988
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:21,911
Okay, here, I'm gonna throw,

989
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,909
and go in your corner and cut out here.

990
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,080
You want me to throw it to you

991
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:25,918
and then you shoot it?

992
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,752
Yeah.

993
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,337
I'll get it, Dad,
don't worry about it.

994
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,174
It's all right, I'll get it.

995
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,384
Is that your boy?

996
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,381
Yeah.

997
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,179
What is he, he's about 17, right?

998
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,302
Uh huh.

999
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,393
Pretty good ballplayer.

1000
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,386
Not bad.

1001
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,104
I got a son about that age, too.

1002
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,097
You want to play a game?

1003
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,270
You and your son against me and my son?

1004
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,438
Three baskets win.

1005
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,107
We'll play for five dollars.

1006
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,820
Okay, you're on.

1007
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,939
Be back in five minutes.

1008
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,939
Okay!

1009
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,871
Hey, where are we going?

1010
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,211
To pick up an easy five bucks.

1011
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:11,878
Just hope those two
turkeys haven't left yet.

1012
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:19,802
Okay, first team scores three
baskets wins five dollars!

1013
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:20,969
Hey, wait a minute, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

1014
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,514
It's supposed to be my
son against your son.

1015
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,887
He is my son.

1016
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:25,978
Come on, let's play.

1017
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,189
You take it out first.

1018
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,309
Come on, son.

1019
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,606
You didn't tell me we
were gonna play basketball.

1020
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,731
Don't slam dunk it right
away, it'll scare them.

1021
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,731
Listen, Mr. Charlie...

1022
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,449
Roger, just do what comes naturally.

1023
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,988
Come on fellas, let's play!

1024
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,204
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

1025
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,381
Come on, Dad!

1026
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,836
Come on, Roger, stop kidding around.

1027
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,018
That's one.

1028
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,395
Will you stop clowning around?

1029
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,486
But I didn't even get a chance.

1030
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,275
Come on!

1031
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,356
Ready son?

1032
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,403
Now dad!

1033
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,196
Okay!

1034
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,122
Shoot, shoot!

1035
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,291
What the hell kind of shot was that?

1036
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:39,545
It's the best I could do, Mr. Charlie.

1037
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,047
That's the best you could do?

1038
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,223
Five bucks.

1039
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,471
We blew five big ones.

1040
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,313
I have to be the father
of the only black kid

1041
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,229
who can't play basketball.

1042
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,067
You didn't have much
luck finding a job, huh?

1043
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,858
Look, jobs at my executive level

1044
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,027
are not just floating around.

1045
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,072
But don't worry, I'll get work somewhere.

1046
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,990
I heard about a place
today at Lincoln and Seco

1047
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,954
where there's jobs for
hardcore unemployables.

1048
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,620
I am not a hardcore unemployable.

1049
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,617
You go there in the morning,

1050
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,540
and guys come by on
trucks lucking for dudes

1051
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,003
to do odd jobs.

1052
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,838
Mowing lawns, painting houses,

1053
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,003
cleaning stables, picking grapes.

1054
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,251
Cleaning stables, where
did you even hear about

1055
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,468
a job like that?

1056
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,305
This afternoon, when
I gave this guy a lift.

1057
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:26,095
How could you give
someone a lift, Roger?

1058
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,433
In the car I was driving.

1059
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:28,392
Car, whose car?

1060
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,226
My car.

1061
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,094
Car, you have a car?

1062
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,097
Yeah, I picked it up
second hand to come out here.

1063
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,598
You have a car and you didn't tell me?

1064
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,475
You let me blow all my
money on cabs and buses?

1065
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,442
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

1066
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,936
I mean everything happened so fast.

1067
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,107
You dragged me to the car.

1068
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,106
You drove me to the ocean,
then to the store, then the...

1069
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,152
Okay okay, forget it, forget it?

1070
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,024
Where is it?

1071
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,492
It's over there.

1072
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,449
It's the red one.

1073
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,947
Should have guessed.

1074
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,949
Cost me 14 dollars and a record player.

1075
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,200
You were overcharged.

1076
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,669
You drove this 2,000 miles?

1077
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,507
You could have been arrested
for littering the highway.

1078
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,645
Do you hear that engine?

1079
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,230
Needs a tune-up.

1080
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,145
It's a menace!

1081
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,232
Beats walking.

1082
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,602
No, it doesn't.

1083
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,835
Hey, there's gas fumes in here.

1084
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,706
That means the engine's still running.

1085
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,462
Open the window.

1086
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,134
It's stuck, it won't open.

1087
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,679
Well, bang on it a few times.

1088
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,349
Hey, what are you doing to my car, man?

1089
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,600
Your insurance will cover it, won't it?

1090
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,981
What the hell was that?

1091
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:01,978
I don't know.

1092
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,070
We may be on fire.

1093
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,109
On fire?

1094
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,277
That dude on the bike.

1095
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,695
Yell for him to get out of the way,

1096
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,989
'cause once I get rolling,
I can't slow down.

1097
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:09,986
Blow your horn!

1098
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:10,987
Don't have one.

1099
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,614
Don't have one?

1100
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,990
That's it.

1101
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,333
Out of the way!

1102
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,997
Out of the way!

1103
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,620
We've got no brakes!

1104
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,583
Out of the way!

1105
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,210
We've got no brakes!

1106
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,104
Good morning, officer

1107
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,231
Get the hell out of here.

1108
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,284
85 cents.

1109
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,536
That's what we're down to.

1110
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,329
85 cents.

1111
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,624
You can sign up for unemployment.

1112
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:01,712
Never.

1113
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,002
That's what they want me to do.

1114
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,750
Well how 'bout welfare?

1115
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,093
Lots of black families are on welfare.

1116
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,212
We are not a black family.

1117
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,432
Well, what's going to
become of us, Mr. Charlie?

1118
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,641
I don't know.

1119
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,306
Oh.

1120
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,605
I never thought it would end up like this.

1121
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,894
Eating sandwiches in a cheap motel.

1122
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,858
I came to California figuring
I'd live in a mansion.

1123
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,068
Look where you dragged me me.

1124
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,858
Where I dragged you?

1125
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,856
I thought you'd take better
care of me, that's all.

1126
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,528
I'm doing the best I can!

1127
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,993
I've been turned down by
every corporation in town.

1128
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,531
So we're talking wall here.

1129
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,030
We're doing what?

1130
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,453
I mean, they really got
you up against the wall.

1131
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,245
Oh yeah.

1132
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,459
That's it!

1133
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,920
What's it?

1134
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:43,913
The wall.

1135
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,005
What wall?

1136
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,715
The money's in the wall safe

1137
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,428
behind the picture of Vivian's mother.

1138
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,216
Right.

1139
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,108
Who is it?

1140
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,826
Who's there?

1141
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,945
Don't hurt me.

1142
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,951
Take what you want.

1143
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,294
I know what you're going to do.

1144
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,003
I know I can't talk you out of it.

1145
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,213
I can't stop you.

1146
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,205
I'm alone.

1147
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,256
My husband isn't here, I'm defenseless.

1148
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,128
All right, go ahead.

1149
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,177
Do what you're going to do and leave.

1150
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,678
Just go ahead and...

1151
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,848
get it over with.

1152
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,573
Well, what are you waiting for?

1153
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,986
Go ahead!

1154
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:35,779
Do it!

1155
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,579
Seventeen years of marriage,

1156
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,168
and the only memorable night with my wife

1157
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,504
was the night I came in as a burglar.

1158
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,294
She was like a wild woman.

1159
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,962
And you know, if she'd
have known it was me,

1160
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,085
she would've gotten had a headache.

1161
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,211
Roger, Mr. Charlie.

1162
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,885
Roger, remember that place you mentioned?

1163
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,475
The place for the hard-core unemployables?

1164
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,061
Yeah, it's on the corner
of Lincoln and Seco.

1165
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,475
But it's not that easy to
get a job there either.

1166
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,565
I mean, there's lots of competition.

1167
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,728
Stop worrying.

1168
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,227
I can hold my own with any misfit.

1169
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,198
Come on, you guys.

1170
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,658
Let's go, move it.

1171
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,046
After Roger registers, tell him

1172
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,671
to pawn my golf clubs and find
a cheap furnished apartment.

1173
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,968
I'll meet him in front of
your office when I'm done.

1174
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,433
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

1175
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,600
They're not going to
beat me, Mr. Garvey.

1176
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,171
Any of you know how to load scrap iron?

1177
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,090
- Over here.
- Over here.

1178
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,177
Here I am, boss.

1179
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,465
All right, you in the blue cap

1180
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,633
across to the white cap.

1181
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,007
Hop in the back of the truck.

1182
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,026
You want a drink, buddy?

1183
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:19,897
Five cents.

1184
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,693
I only drink after work.

1185
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,378
Hey, any of you turkeys
ever worked in a rock quarry?

1186
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,713
Yeah, all right, get on.

1187
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,130
You, yeah, you,

1188
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,300
Come on, get on.

1189
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,764
Alright, sit down and hang on!

1190
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,306
Everybody in?

1191
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,478
It's just you and me, buddy.

1192
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,662
Either of you stiffs
know how to clean stables?

1193
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,955
Yes, sir I can.

1194
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,669
I'm available.

1195
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,208
Okay, you, dummy.

1196
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,625
I think he means you.

1197
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,258
Yeah, you dummy.

1198
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,596
Come on, get your butt in the back!

1199
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,715
On the double!

1200
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:51,619
You shovel each and every
one of these real clean.

1201
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,118
Then come on over here to this other barn.

1202
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,869
Then you clean all of these.

1203
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,246
You start all the way
down there at that end,

1204
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,997
clean all these up to here.

1205
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:03,547
Then go back down there and
clean all those on that side.

1206
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,465
You load it all in this wheelbarrow here,

1207
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,134
clear up to the top.

1208
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,256
Now you got that?

1209
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,382
Come on, then.

1210
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,311
Come on.

1211
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:18,433
Then you walk it over here
to the pile and unload.

1212
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,433
Got it, dummy?

1213
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,275
Yes, sir

1214
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,644
Then you go over there
to that barn over there,

1215
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,362
and start over again.

1216
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,777
Now go!

1217
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,868
Go back to number one, and
don't stop till I tell you.

1218
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,906
Go ahead, go!

1219
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,622
Move it, move it!

1220
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,832
Move it, dummy!

1221
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:06,856
32 stalls.

1222
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,572
You're okay, dummy.

1223
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:27,961
Mr. Charlie!

1224
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,722
Mr. Charlie?

1225
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,892
Hey, I went to wait for you
down at Mr. Garvey's office,

1226
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,266
but when you didn't show up, I came here.

1227
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:51,363
I hocked the golf clubs, and
found us a furnished apartment.

1228
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,736
Wasn't easy, but I found one.

1229
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,921
Had a rough day, huh?

1230
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,323
Where are we, Roger?

1231
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,574
Watts, Mr. Charlie.

1232
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,371
Watts?

1233
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,329
What are we doing in Watts?

1234
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,750
Well, it's not the fanciest apartment,

1235
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,623
but at least it's home.

1236
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,096
This is home?

1237
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,473
This is home.

1238
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,314
Jimmy Dean, get
down to that store, boy!

1239
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,899
Your momma will be home
from work in a minute.

1240
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,195
Hope we don't have to pay for that.

1241
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,572
I don't mind living in Watts, but do we

1242
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:45,290
have to live in the poor section?

1243
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,756
The lock sometimes gets stuck.

1244
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:54,000
Which in a way is good,

1245
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,378
'cause you can hear
anyone trying to break in.

1246
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,096
Who'd want to break in?

1247
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,557
This is a furnished apartment?

1248
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,928
This is terrible.

1249
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,019
Terrible!

1250
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:16,148
The better places wanted
first and last month's rent.

1251
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,400
I only got 35 dollars for the golf clubs.

1252
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,526
35 dollars?

1253
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,280
That was a complete
set of MacGregor clubs!

1254
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,825
Where's the bedroom, Roger?

1255
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,243
It pulls out.

1256
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,913
One of us can sleep on the couch.

1257
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,160
I thought that was the bathroom.

1258
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,457
Yeah, I did too, at first.

1259
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,042
Where is the bathroom, Roger?

1260
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,261
It's down the other end of the porch.

1261
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,421
No, never.

1262
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,673
I'm not sharing a communal bathroom.

1263
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,175
It's unhygienic.

1264
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,848
That's exactly how the other
tenants feel, Mr. Charlie.

1265
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:51,064
That's why every apartment
has its own toilet seat.

1266
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,435
Now it wasn't easy to get
you in here, Mr. Charlie.

1267
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,652
I mean, they weren't too happy about

1268
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:58,147
having a white person in the building.

1269
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,240
You're here on a trial basis.

1270
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:05,329
Well, I don't want to
lower the standard of living.

1271
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:09,666
I registered at
a job training center today.

1272
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,457
The only opening they had was
a class for short-order cooks.

1273
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,499
Short-order cook.

1274
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,792
That's a good trade.

1275
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,040
You can always get a job.

1276
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,133
Yeah, and you can save money
with me doing the cooking.

1277
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,844
Now, you just sit down and relax.

1278
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,637
What?

1279
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,685
I can feel the springs.

1280
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,356
Hey who's talking?

1281
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,231
Turn off the goddamn radio!

1282
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,958
What's the carton?

1283
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,203
Ah, just something I brought from home.

1284
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,420
What's in it?

1285
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,458
Just a lot of stuff
that must belong to you.

1286
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,505
To me?

1287
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:04,881
Yeah, I found it in my
mom's closet after she died.

1288
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:08,388
Oh.

1289
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,413
It's yours, ain't it?

1290
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:33,743
It's mine.

1291
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:34,869
It'd be pretty
embarrassing if it belonged

1292
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,836
to some other dude, huh?

1293
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,544
Mom was great for saving things.

1294
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,170
I mean, if a bird left some
crumbs on a windowsill,

1295
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,514
she'd leave them there
like she expected the bird

1296
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,679
to come back or something.

1297
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:50,893
It never entered her mind that the bird

1298
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:54,184
had forgotten where she lived.

1299
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,146
Hey, it's...

1300
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,147
it's like Cinderella.

1301
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,234
You know, like the slipper fit,

1302
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,072
and you were once the prince.

1303
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,407
But it's midnight, and it's too late,

1304
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,279
and the prince has turned
back into a pumpkin.

1305
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,156
Aside from mangling
a beautiful fairy tale,

1306
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,408
the reason the slipper doesn't fit

1307
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,877
is that the prince's feet are swollen

1308
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,713
from shoveling horse manure all day,

1309
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,300
so he can support the
pretender to the throne.

1310
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,009
I cleaned 32 stables.

1311
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,177
I've been following the horses all day,

1312
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,891
picking up the pieces of my life.

1313
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,771
In a couple of weeks, you're
going to have a trade.

1314
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,140
You'll get a job.

1315
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,818
Then each of us goes his own way.

1316
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,400
Until that time,

1317
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,654
I'll shovel it.

1318
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,527
I'll live in it.

1319
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,154
But I won't take it.

1320
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,875
Think I'll go take a walk, huh.

1321
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,668
Uh huh.

1322
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,644
Where is that welfare check?

1323
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,111
Welfare check, what check?

1324
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,650
You know goddamn
well what check I mean!

1325
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,774
Hey, woman you
better get off my back!

1326
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,117
I'm gonna get off your back

1327
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,485
and get right on your ass!

1328
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,701
Woman have you got
a death wish or something?

1329
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,762
We had difficulty finding you.

1330
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,724
Forgive me for not getting up,

1331
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,101
but I hard day at the stables.

1332
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,776
I got the job without
a character reference.

1333
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:54,072
Walter, many strong words
were said in the heat of crisis.

1334
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,616
But what you said was true.

1335
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,410
The wind does blow white, not black.

1336
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:02,376
It does blow Whitney, not Weisenthal

1337
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,042
When you're shoveling manure,

1338
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:10,167
you really find out which
way the wind is blowing.

1339
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,637
I admire you, Walter.

1340
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,596
I mean that.

1341
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,094
You've shown a determination and an...

1342
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,141
ingenuity which I admire.

1343
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,192
I thought you would
break, but you only bent.

1344
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,358
I respect that ability to survive.

1345
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,902
The company misses you, Walter.

1346
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,076
Vivian misses you.

1347
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:37,949
Come back.

1348
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,575
Come home to the people you belong with.

1349
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,372
What about Roger?

1350
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,337
Provisions will be made.

1351
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,629
A good military academy
to strengthen character.

1352
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,719
A tour of duty overseas in
the service of his country.

1353
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,088
And if by chance he survives?

1354
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,010
In that case, he will
be sent adequate funds

1355
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:01,226
to permit him to live comfortably.

1356
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,720
It's the solution that will
preserve your integrity,

1357
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:05,848
your sense of obligation,

1358
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,067
and most important, the quality of life

1359
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,687
you've worked so hard to create.

1360
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:17,117
I think Vivian would like
to say something in private.

1361
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,076
Peace with honor, Walter

1362
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,789
Why peace at all, Nelson?

1363
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:23,782
I'm a deserter.

1364
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,580
You execute deserters.

1365
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,999
Only as a last resort.

1366
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,837
You're one of us, Walter.

1367
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,832
And there are so few of us.

1368
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,209
We are the true minority.

1369
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,964
Those tiny wheels that keep
the one big wheel turning.

1370
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,216
If we vanish, that wheel stops,

1371
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,765
and it rusts into chaos,
anarchy, nihilism.

1372
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,937
All Power to the People.

1373
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,689
They had it once.

1374
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,987
It was called the Stone Age.

1375
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,824
I had a long talk with Mary Ann, Walter.

1376
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,790
And she's agreed to call you father.

1377
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:10,246
Oh, Walter, I know that
I have, on occasion,

1378
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,339
failed you as a woman.

1379
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,207
But I assure you, I am a woman capable

1380
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:17,256
of great warmth and passion.

1381
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,674
But only for burglars.

1382
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:22,174
Oh Walter, I knew
that was you all along!

1383
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,727
Come home, Walter.

1384
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,521
I'll be waiting.

1385
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,663
They're after me, Mr. Charlie!

1386
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:27,701
What'd you do?

1387
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,540
What did I do?

1388
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,750
Nothing.

1389
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,244
I'm just walking down the street, right?

1390
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,416
These dudes come up, break a store window,

1391
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,834
grab some stuff, and took off!

1392
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,831
Yeah.

1393
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,799
Well, the police pulled
up, and I started running.

1394
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,886
Innocent people don't
run from the police.

1395
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,845
Yeah, maybe not in
San Marino, Mr. Charlie.

1396
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,555
They were probably just trying
to find out what happened.

1397
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,642
Yeah, when a cop yells,
"Freeze your ass, nigger,"

1398
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,386
he's made up his mind what happened.

1399
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,181
Open up, police!

1400
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,478
Help me, Mr. Charlie!

1401
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:55,942
The bed!

1402
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,061
What?

1403
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:57,902
Quick!

1404
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:58,736
Hide in here!

1405
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,570
They'll find me there!

1406
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:00,404
No, they won't!

1407
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,238
Do as I say!

1408
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,073
Why?

1409
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:05,285
Because I'm your father and I say so!

1410
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,366
Open up!

1411
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,208
Coming!

1412
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:13,418
Open up!

1413
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,758
Shove off, pigs!

1414
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,929
What's a
white guy doing in here?

1415
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,048
Let's get him!

1416
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,157
How you doing, Mr. Charlie?

1417
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,451
Not too good, Roger.

1418
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,245
You get points today.

1419
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,369
Got yourself arrested for me, roughed up.

1420
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,998
Finally starting to
act like a father, huh?

1421
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,842
Enough so I'll get off your back?

1422
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,765
I didn't want anything
from you, Mr. Charlie.

1423
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,680
No adoption, no trust fund.

1424
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:53,472
Nothing.

1425
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,478
I just came out here because every kid

1426
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:00,101
wants to see what his dad is like.

1427
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,100
I didn't want you to like me

1428
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,694
because I was your son.

1429
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:08,488
I wanted you to respect me
because I was Mom's son.

1430
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:11,828
But I looked in your eyes,
and you didn't see Mom.

1431
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:12,946
You saw black.

1432
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,454
And Mom deserved better than that.

1433
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,748
You owed her more than that.

1434
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:24,500
I looked at you in that big office,

1435
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,844
and I kind of went crazy inside.

1436
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:32,307
I said to myself, "This is the
man who broke Mama's heart.

1437
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:36,519
The man she spent her whole
life loving and waiting for.

1438
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,263
And she died loving you, Mr. Charlie.

1439
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,438
I think you ought to know that.

1440
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,027
You walked away from a great lady.

1441
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,066
There's no woman in the
world could love a man

1442
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:49,282
more than she loved you, Mr. Charlie.

1443
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,572
And she'd have made you happy.

1444
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,366
She knew how to make people happy.

1445
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:59,125
I wanted to hurt you like you hurt Mom.

1446
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,369
I wanted to insult you so bad

1447
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,621
that you'd get angry
and take a swing at me,

1448
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,339
then I'd have an excuse
for punching you out.

1449
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:09,382
Isn't that terrible?

1450
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:12,347
A son wanting to hit his own father.

1451
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,810
And I was glad when
things went wrong for you.

1452
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,975
Then I realized no matter
how mach bad happened to you,

1453
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:23,771
that couldn't make any
good happen to Mama.

1454
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,734
She's dead, Mr. Charlie.

1455
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,734
We'll never see her again,

1456
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,358
hear her again, touch her again.

1457
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,918
She deserved a better life.

1458
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,338
You should have given her a better life.

1459
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:54,010
I should have given her a better life.

1460
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,636
Did you love my mom, Mr. Charlie?

1461
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,512
This is very important.

1462
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,478
Did you love my mom?

1463
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,021
Yeah, I loved her

1464
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,985
I loved her very much.

1465
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,529
Wow.

1466
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,283
Black and white together.

1467
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,912
That's a lot to overcome.

1468
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,957
You go on back to your
family, Mr. Charlie.

1469
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:33,086
I got a feeling they'll
be a lot nicer to you now.

1470
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:55,196
You're really not a bad guy.

1471
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,238
I mean, if you weren't my father,

1472
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,612
we might have become friends.

1473
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:15,757
Walter.

1474
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,175
Just in time for the board meeting.

1475
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,094
Then lunch with the
common market delegation.

1476
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,184
It's as though these
past days never happened.

1477
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,927
Nothing's changed!

1478
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,645
Everything changes.

1479
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:25,513
Constantly.

1480
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,811
That's why we have to adapt.

1481
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,434
So we can always come out on top.

1482
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,654
Being on top means
somebody's on the bottom.

1483
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,319
Well, you can't have winners
if you don't have losers.

1484
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,941
Why can't we all win, Nelson?

1485
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:37,908
No losers?

1486
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,034
That's what life is all about.

1487
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,123
Even death has heaven and hell.

1488
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,662
Winners and losers.

1489
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:49,671
It's hard to hate you, Nelson.

1490
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:50,834
You have just enough logic

1491
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:54,300
to give your sickness respectability.

1492
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,919
You've sentenced whole races of people

1493
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,420
to be born losers,

1494
01:22:57,431 --> 01:23:00,469
and as the father of one, I object.

1495
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:03,014
Not that he was born
with two strikes on him,

1496
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,481
but that you won't give him
a third pitch to swing at.

1497
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,770
Goodbye, Nelson.

1498
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,312
You walk out this time,
and I'll destroy you.

1499
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,780
When I'm through with you,
you'll think shoveling horseshit

1500
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:16,818
is a step up!

1501
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,045
I just don't understand.

1502
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,668
Why is he going back there?

1503
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,714
He was gonna learn a trade.

1504
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,337
What's he gonna do back there?

1505
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,964
Well, the new college semester

1506
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,637
starts in a couple of weeks.

1507
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:44,930
Well, what's that got to do with him?

1508
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,054
He said left high school when he was 16.

1509
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,226
That's when he graduated, Mr. Whitney.

1510
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:50,189
Graduated?

1511
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,106
He made me
promise not to tell you.

1512
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,069
He goes to college?

1513
01:23:56,073 --> 01:24:00,033
Roger received a
scholarship from Northwestern.

1514
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,822
That's where I went.

1515
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,866
He's in his second year of pre-med.

1516
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,663
He was right, Mr. Garvey.

1517
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,378
I looked at him and I saw black.

1518
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,589
I didn't see Lorraine, what she was,

1519
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,459
what she would have
brought up our son to be.

1520
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,758
I looked at him and I didn't
see a college student.

1521
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,472
I saw a high school dropout.

1522
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,888
I didn't see a doctor.

1523
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,931
I saw a short-order cook.

1524
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,060
Ah, look, there he is.

1525
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:47,697
Roger!

1526
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:48,494
Yeah.

1527
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,002
Just wanted to wish you a good trip.

1528
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:53,791
Thanks.

1529
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,632
If you need something, I mean,

1530
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,718
if you need money or anything,

1531
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:03,008
I can always be reached
through Mr. Garvey.

1532
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,176
Well, if you need anything, I mean,

1533
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,220
if you run short or something, I mean,

1534
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,184
I'll be at Aunt Clara's.

1535
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:18,148
Well, have a good trip, Roger.

1536
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,021
So long, Mr. Charlie.

1537
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,192
You know, Mr. Charlie
doesn't sound right.

1538
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,740
Not when you're saying goodbye.

1539
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,622
Well, so long, Dad.

1540
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:39,124
I have this friend back
in Evanston, Bernie Levin.

1541
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,922
Every time he'd come out
here, he'd try and talk me

1542
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:45,467
into coming back there
and working for him.

1543
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,841
I thought I might just go there

1544
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,308
and take him up on it.

1545
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,303
It's not far from the university.

1546
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:54,181
Might give us a chance to see one another

1547
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:55,602
every once in a while.

1548
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,066
Have dinner, talk,

1549
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,650
maybe take in a ball game.

1550
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,819
Get to know one another.

1551
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:08,786
I mean, maybe we'll never
get to be friends, but then,

1552
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:10,200
maybe we will.

1553
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:13,041
I mean, it's worth a try.

1554
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:13,829
Yeah.

1555
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,125
Well, have a good trip, son.

1556
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,803
Hey, listen.

1557
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,597
If I'm gonna go back there,

1558
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,435
I might as well start now.

1559
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,770
Wouldn't hurt to have someone along.

1560
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:36,890
I'm a pretty good mechanic.

1561
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,856
Good idea.

1562
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,780
You can send the rest of this stuff

1563
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,077
to me at his Aunt Clara's.

1564
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:56,497
Well, all right, all right!

1565
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:29,616
Hey, I almost forgot.

1566
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,906
This picture of Mom.

1567
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,701
I think she'd like you to have it.
